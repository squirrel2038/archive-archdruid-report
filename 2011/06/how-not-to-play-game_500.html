It’s been more than a year now since the theme of “green wizardry” became central to the posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, and I’ve pretty much covered the first two of the three themes I mean to discuss before it becomes time to shift the conversation elsewhere. We’ve discussed organic gardening and its associated arts, and we’ve discussed homescale energy production and conservation. At this point, before we go on to the third leg of the tripod, which used to be called “recycling” thirty years ago and deserves a more robust name now, I’d like to step back for a moment and talk a bit about strategy.<br><br>Yes, there’s a strategy underlying the selection of projects and possibilities I’ve been discussing here. The focus on Seventies-era organic gardening, appropriate technology, and the like is not merely a matter of nostalgia for a time when America seemed to be on the brink of taking its future seriously, before it collectively took the coward’s way out, nor is it simply a recognition that we don’t have a lot of time left and would be wise to concentrate on options that have already had the bugs worked out – though this latter may well be a point worth making. Rather, by some combination of prudence, prescience, and sheer dumb luck, the toolkit of ecotechnic options pieced together by the backyard farmers, basement inventors, shoestring-budget nonprofits and local government initiatives of that time happen to be very nearly uniquely suited to one of the dominant features of the future ahead of us.<br><br>To understand the way this works, it’s going to be necessary to look at some of the least welcoming features of that future, and that in turn is going to require a look back at a vision of history I first sketched out here years ago, and developed in more detail in the pages of my book <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/E/The-Ecotechnic-Future>The Ecotechnic Future</a>. That look is going to require close attention to some of the least pleasant features of where we’re headed as a society. Unwelcome as that may be, it can’t be avoided, for it’s precisely as a response to the more troubling dimensions of our future that the strategy I have in mind has its place.<br><br>The fast version of the take on the future I want to discuss divides it up into four overlapping phases or periods, labeled according to the basic modes of economic production that predominate during each one. The first of these, the one in which most of us grew up and to which nearly all current political, economic and social thought is attuned, is <i>abundance industrialism</i>. This is the phase in which the supply of goods and services available to people in the world’s industrial nations by and large increases with each passing year. Yes, I know, it’s heresy to suggest this, but my take is that what drove that increase was not the growth of human knowledge, or any of the other comforting mantras offered by the publicists of science and industry over the last century or so. Rather, what drove it was simply an exponential increase in consumption of the Earth’s finite reserves of fossil fuels.<br><br>With the arrival of geological limits to fossil fuel production, we enter the second phase, <i>scarcity industrialism</i>. This is the phase in which the supply of goods and services available to people in the industrial nations peaks and begins to contract. According to mainstream economic doctrines, that can’t happen, which may be one of the reasons why we’ve become so good at ignoring it. Few people notice, for example, that most of what’s for sale in supermarkets is a little smaller and a little more shoddily made with every passing year, while the price stays level or creeps upwards; few people talk about the disappearance of scores of once-common services – try to get a perfectly good shoe with a worn heel repaired in most American cities nowadays – or think about the way that municipal services always seem to contract while the cost always seems to expand.<br><br>All these are part of the same process, the rise and fall of scarcity industrialism, which ends when the level of goods and services being produced drops below the level needed to support any kind of industrial system at all. After that come <span style="font-style: italic">salvage societies</span>, which no longer have the energy per capita that would be needed for industrial modes of production at all, and concentrate on extracting value from the legacy left behind by the industrial past. Later on – probably some centuries later – the salvage era winds down as the salvage runs out, and new societies depending on natural, renewable resources take their place. In a fit of optimism, I labeled this latter phase the ecotechnic era, and suggested that it could potentially see some amount of relatively advanced technology supported on a truly sustainable basis; I still think that’s possible, though it’s going to take quite a bit of work now, and even more in the centuries to come, to make it likely.<br><br>Still, it’s the age of scarcity industrialism that deserves close attention right now, since most of the world’s industrial nations are somewhere along the trajectory that leads there. It’s tough to make predictions, as Yogi Berra once pointed out, especially about the future. Some of the main features of developed societies in the age of scarcity industrialism aren’t too difficult to predict, though, partly because equivalent processes have happened before, and partly because some nations right now are much further along the trajectory than others and provide a useful glimpse ahead.<br><br>The role of social conflict is one of the features that’s fairly predictable. In an age of abundance, the easiest way to deal with social conflict is to buy off the disaffected. That’s how industrial societies over the last century came to provide welfare for the poor, mortgage guarantees and college grants for the middle class, subsidies for farmers, tax breaks for businesses – name a group that’s had enough political savvy to organize and raise a ruckus, and you can just as quickly name the arrangements by which they were paid off to minimize the risk of disruptions to the system. That was politically feasible in an expanding economy; even when the shares of the existing pie were grossly unequal, the fact that everyone could have at least a little more each year made those with smaller slices willing to work with the system in order to get their cut.<br><br>In an age of scarcity, that easy option no longer exists, and social conflicts heat up rapidly. That’s the unmentioned subtext for much of what’s going on in politics on both sides of the Atlantic just now. The middle class, who shrugged and turned its collective back when the working classes of Europe and America were thrown to the sharks thirty years ago, are now discovering to their horror that they’re next on the list, as the rentier class – the relatively privileged fraction of industrial society that makes its living from investments rather than salaries – struggles to maintain its prosperity at everyone else’s expense. (The middle class did exactly the same thing when it had the chance – ask any impoverished working class family in Pittsburgh or Glasgow – so sympathy cards sent their way may be misplaced.) The gutting of social safety nets, the slashing of salaries and benefits, and the impoverishment of millions of previously affluent people are part of that process, and lead to a rising spiral of social conflict that may well push a good many nations into crisis or collapse.<br><br>Not, it’s probably worth noting, into revolution. It’s an interesting detail of history that revolutions rarely happen in ages of decline; the classic recipe for revolution is an extended period of economic improvement for the bulk of the population, followed by a standstill or a reversal. (The government of China would do well to take note of this.) In times of decline, the class and group solidarity essential to an effective revolution dissolves into a scramble for slices of a shrinking pie, in which your own peers are usually your worst enemies. Mind you, social hierarchies get fed through a blender in times of decline; the former holders of wealth and power tolerably often end up starving in alleys if they don’t simply get their throats cut, while sufficiently ruthless individuals from well down the ladder can climb right up to the top. Sill, the general trend in ages of scarcity is that the circle of people who have access to wealth and privilege narrows step by step, leaving most of their former peers to scramble for scraps or to claw their way into the charmed circle by fair means or foul.<br><br>Now it might in theory be possible for a country to extract itself from this kind of spiral descent into the kind of social conflict that normally ends in some form of authoritarianism. The chance that the United States will manage such a last-minute save, though, is pretty slim at this point if it exists at all. We’re already seeing even the most basic services provided by local government slashed to a degree unequalled in the industrial world; what remains of a social safety net that was already an embarrassment among developed nations is pretty clearly headed for the chopping block; the machinery of government in state houses and Congress alike is jamming up as pressure groups of every kind launch increasingly frenzied efforts to cling to wealth and influence at everyone else’s expense. The "health care reform" pushed through by the Obama administration, a political absurdity meant to prop up a faltering medical-pharmaceutical industry by mandating that people who can’t afford health insurance have to pay for it anyway, is as good an example as any.<br><br>It’s not a pretty picture, and it’s unlikely to get any more attractive any time soon. Still, it’s important to understand why societies in decline so often plunge into this sort of self-defeating spiral. One of the major problems faced by any society in decline is the almost universal unwillingness of such societies to deal with the fact that they are indeed in decline. It’s a problem rather than a predicament; that is to say, it has a solution; but the solution – accepting that the glory days of the past are over, and that the new and unwelcome reality of contraction and limitation will be around for the foreseeable future – is normally accepted only after every other imaginable response or nonresponse is tried out, and found wanting. A rising spiral of absurd beliefs, grandiose projects, and violent political passions is a standard part of the evasive maneuvering that goes into avoiding that one necessary step, and we’ve got plenty of examples currently, of course.<br><br>Here again, though, we’re dealing with a problem rather than a predicament, because there’s at least one way out of the trap I’ve just outlined. The declining years of a rich and powerful society resemble nothing so much as a game of musical chairs in which, in the end, all the chairs will be taken away. What’s the winning strategy in a game in which everyone inevitably loses sooner or later? That’s a simpler question than it sounds: the way to win is not to play the game.<br><br>And that, in turn, is what we’ve been talking about for the last year: how not to play the game.<br><br>The struggles of the age of scarcity industrialism will focus with increasing bitterness and intensity on access to the remaining benefits of industrial society as we’ve known it – above all, the cheap abundant energy that powers automobiles and planes, keeps wall sockets supplied with electricity, brings foodstuffs and consumer goods from around the world, and provides the context and the income for jobs in the increasingly overlapping spheres of business, government, and the military. The struggles for these things, if historical equivalents are anything to go by, will focus on certain geographical and social battlefields and have increasingly limited effects anywhere else. Those who turn their backs on the things being fought over, and distance themselves from the battlefields, have a very good chance of staying clear of the resulting difficulties.<br><br>That’s what the green wizard toolkit is meant to do. Those who have a place in the country or can get one won’t have any need to depend on a faltering corporate food system for their daily meals; those who focus instead on the small-city approach will be able to supplement sacks of bulk grains and legumes from the farm belt with produce from a backyard garden, amplified with henhouse and/or rabbit hutch as circumstances permit. Those in either situation who know how to insulate and weatherize, and provide the small amount of energy they need from homescale sources, will be able to ignore the decline of the electrical grid. Those who learn how to get the things they need from salvage, instead of relying on global supply chains fed from rapidly depleting resource stocks, will be able to stand aside as what’s left of the global economy circles the drain and goes down it. Those who do these things, teach these things to neighbors and friends, and help build local networks of mutual exchange and support, will be creating the social frameworks of the next stage of the future – the stage of salvage societies – within the crumbling skeleton of the old industrial order.<br><br>Now it’s common enough, when a plan such as this is suggested, for people to insist that it’s all very well and good, but the government, or the corporations, or roving hordes of zombies, or somebody else equally colorful and convenient will inevitably come and take it all away. That seems logical, but it only seems logical because the people who suggest it haven’t grasped the implications of the toolkit I’ve been suggesting here. That is to say, they haven’t noticed that the lifestyles that are possible when your food comes from a backyard garden, your heat comes from a wood stove, and your job comes from refurbishing salvage of one kind or another, are not comfortable middle class American lifestyles, or anything like ithem.<br><br>What we are talking about, to borrow a phrase from Henry David Thoreau, is voluntary poverty. The founders of the modern movement of "voluntary simplicity" backed away uncomfortably from the noun in Thoreau’s phrase, and thereby did themselves and their movement a huge disservice; it’s all too easy to turn "voluntary simplicity" into a sales pitch for yet another round of allegedly simple products at fashionably high prices. The concept of voluntary poverty does not lend itself anything like so well to such evasions. The idea, Thoreau’s idea, is to deliberately embrace being poor, in every material sense, in order to avoid the common fate of being possessed by your possessions.<br><br>That’s a valid choice at any phase of history’s wheel, but it takes on a great deal more importance than usual in an age when being anything but poor makes you a target for practitioners of involuntary poverty who are fixated on scrambling over you on their way back up toward a fading vision of extravagant wealth. This is why monasticism works so well in the declining years of civilizations and the dark ages that follow them, for successful monastic traditions invariably embrace strict poverty. Having nothing to steal, they don’t need to worry about thieves, and a traditional habit of choosing locations well away from the centers of wealth and power is also worth noting – Monte Cassino in Italy, the Shaolin Monastery in China, and Koyasan in Japan, where St. Benedict, Bodhidharma, and Kobo Daishi respectively founded three of the world’s great monastic traditions, were all more or less in the middle of nowhere when the first simple dwellings were erected there.<br><br>What most Americans do not know, and have no interest in learning, is that it’s possible to be poor in relative comfort. (One of the advantages of a writer’s career, with its traditional slow start, is that I had ample opportunity to learn this.) The central secret of green wizardry is that one way to be poor and comfortable is to learn how to work with nature, so that natural processes take care of many of the needs you’d otherwise have to spend money to meet. The appropriate technology movement of the Seventies was predisposed to develop along this path by its roots in the Sixties counterculture, which however briefly and inconsistently held up the ideal of voluntary poverty to a mostly baffled consumer economy. Where most of today’s chatter about solar technology focuses on grid-tied PV systems, vast arrays of mirrors in the Nevada desert, solar satellites, and the like – all things that can be built only in an economy of abundance with resources to spare, and thus are useless in the future we’re facing – the equivalent talk in the Seventies as often as not focused on homebuilt solar water heaters, bsolar ovens, and other things that could be cobbled together in a basement out of salvaged materials, and thus are relevant to our time and the time ahead of us.<br><br>It’s quite possible that some of the things I’ve been discussing will end up being used in monasteries during the dark age that follows the decline and fall of our civilization. Still, that’s for the future to decide. The present concern, at least for me, is getting these things remembered in time to make it through the next forty or fifty years of crisis, the next step down on the road to that future dark age, as America’s global empire comes unglued and a nation used to living on a quarter of the world’s energy supply and a third of its industrial products gets to learn what it’s like to live on a great deal less. If the things we’ve been discussing here get pulled out of the dumpster where America puts its unwanted heritage, and are put to use by people who aren’t terrified of the concept of voluntary poverty, the Benedicts, Bodhidharmas, and Kobo Daishis of the future will at least have the option open to them, and so will a great many less exalted individuals whose lives could well be made happier and better by the application of a little ecotechnic knowledge and a few pieces of highly appropriate technology; and so, dear reader, may you.

<div class="avtb a_5ee831" id=c2712478477085687030></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/04737693388485635100 rel=nofollow>John Michael Greer</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Pasttense, we've had temperatures in the 90s already this year, and plenty in the last two years since we moved here; in southern Oregon, where I lived for four years, temperatures well over 100 were common every summer. How do I handle it? First, the human body is surprisingly good at dealing with heat -- we evolved on the east African plains, you know -- and if you don't weaken your body's resilience by using a/c all the time, it's not actually that hard to acclimatize to summer heat. Care concerning hydration and salt intake also helps -- and if it gets miserably hot and humid, I can always spend the afternoon working on a project in the basement, where it's a good deal cooler. <br><br>Draft, it's not an unstated assumption; I've discussed the reasoning behind it repeatedly. I'd point out here that we're already showing signs of early scarcity industrialism -- oil prices tripling over the last seven years, large sections of the Third World facing crippling energy shortages, and the spiral of political dysfunction I discussed in this week's post, among others. The Limits to Growth scenarios that allowed for stability at a high level presupposed changes that haven't happened, and in the current political climate, won't happen. As for the annual decline rate, Stuart's estimates are on the low end, and not well supported by evidence from, e.g., the North Sea. For these and other reasons I think expecting stabilization is past hoping for, and scarcity is fairly close.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c2712478477085687030 title="comment permalink">6/29/11, 9:38 PM</a><br><br>

If not, I would suggest it to you. I know it might be something you have no interest in doing (in which case, no problem), or that you feel less secure in exploring, but I would like to see some of your toughts in that direction.<br><br>It seems to me that, even though 90% or more of the global population these days can be said to be living in some variant of a capitalist/industrialist society in which fossil fuels are used, urbanization is either high already or rising, etc, there are MAJOR differences not only between First World societies and their Third World counterparts, but between countries inside the blocks themselves. <br><br>You're always saying that dissent in opnions is going to be necessary in order for the people of the future to experiment and find solutions that work for them. I wonder what you would say about different responses to our current global situation from different countries/regions. For example, some countries are betting the farm on nuclear power (France, chiefly), others are more or less commited to keep doing whatever they are doing atm(mostly coal, nat gas and big hidro, I suspect) and never giving a second thought about it, some others are investing heavily into big renewable projects (big wind, big solar), etc. <br><br>There is also the question of different conditions. Let's take for example, Asia and South America. Asia is badly overpopulated as it is, it's degrading it's ecosystems faster than anyone else (China and India particularly) and there's some scary possibilities of a population crash if some of the global warming scenarios happen (water shortages in the river systems that depend of Himalaya snow runoff, for example). South America, on the other hand, has a very different set of circunstances, including smaller population, better acess to water and some other resources and possibly better renewable potential (in solar, hidro and wind capacity). So, it would seem that preparedness for the future in both continents would take very different paths. <br><br>That's not even talking about social/political differences.<br><br>I know your area of expertise is the US, this is an english language blog and all, but I bet there's a substancial minority of your readers (like myself) who are NOT americans and would like even a superficial analysis, from you, of areas outside of north america.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c2435359135501723804 title="comment permalink">6/29/11, 10:45 PM</a><br><br>

The Governor, Mark Dayton, refuses to accept a state budget that only cuts spending and does not raise taxes at all on the wealthiest Minnesotans. The Republican legislature refuses to consider a budget that raises taxes one iota, and only wish to decrease spending.<br><br>The shutdown will cut off child care for the poor, services for the mentally ill.

The white roof (we used Mobile Coat) helps the most while we wait for our shade maples to mature. It's cool to the touch in all weathers, hence longer lasting.

Still practicing what I learned back then and still have some of the out of print books of the time. That knowledge is more useful to me now than it was to me then. I've been cherry picking what technology I use ever since. <br><br>My dad once said that he never knew anyone work so hard to live the way his grandfather lived. The kitchen cook woodstove really amused him. What he doesn't understand is that it's much easier for me to gather a few sticks to cook dinner than work at a job to buy propane. <br><br>Few of my generation seem to have kept the ideas alive. However, I'm constantly working with people in their early 30s. They seem to get it. We gift each other what we all need, be it materials, labor, tools, food, or friendship. They understand gifts and barter much better than us baby boomers. <br><br>They choose their technology. I've friends building a house in the country. Right after installing a basic solar electric system, they put in high speed Internet. It was more important than not having to poop in a bucket or drywall. The 'net is their connection to the world and a source of income for them. <br><br>Quite a few of us are already well into the salvage economy. Most of the materials for my rocket mass heater project is coming from salvaged materials. It's all a matter of letting me friends know what I need. They want to gift those things to me, since I've gifted them other things. It's almost tribal. We take joy when our friends are making a go of it.<br><br>It pains me that I've other friends who suffer more than they have to. They are still trying to get by in a paradigm that's dead. They feel that if only they can get enough money, they'll be comfortable. To do that, they ignore friends and family who could help them be comfortable and happy right now.<br><br>Keep up the good work.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c5673288466327392032 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 1:52 AM</a><br><br>

Aside from getting to hear Nicole Foss speak, one of the evening's highlights was a local mountain fellow's show-&amp;-tell about water rams/ram pumps. I was so excited to see one and to hear he has a neighbor who has one that has been in constant use for over 100 years.<br>I had learned about ram pumps in my Ecotechnology class at the Institute for Social Ecology back in 1988 and was glad to see it is a "living" technology still in use here in the mountains. All most equally exciting to me was having a local share this info with a room full of "from aways". One of the reasons I moved to WNC in the mid-90's to await peak oil was access to a culture with living memories of life before electrification.

I have not had A/C at home in over 15 yrs. Some thing you can do to stay cool include hanging out under shade trees, napping during the heat of the day, putting your feet in the "crick" or other water, putting wet cloths on your wrists and/or back of your neck, spritz yourself with water, etc. Someone reminded me recently that poorer residents of DC (where I was born) are sometimes seen with towels that have been in the freezer draped over their heads as a means to keep cool while walking around.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c4915276154890647381 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 2:11 AM</a><br><br>

However, very few of them would like to (or possibly could) do the level of work required to live this particular life. It’s hard work, really. The other thing that I’ve become aware of is the big risk factors which are sickness, injuries and unfavourable weather. At the moment, they can be worked around, but if deindustrialisation kicked in they could be very problematic. I’ve just set up a herb garden and once I’m less busy will look into medicinal herbs.<br><br>I’m halfway through your book “The wealth of nature” and must say that I am enjoying it immensely as it confirms my own world view. However, this morning I had an insight which I wanted to share with you.<br><br>As part of my professional and personal life I have occasion to perform free or volunteer work on a regular basis. I’ve always seen this work as building social currency. However, I’ve noticed that the majority of other people do not see it this way. A majority of people tend to see this free work performed for their benefit as having little intrinsic value even though it has a commercial value. I’ve often wondered about this issue.<br><br>Then whilst reading your book I came across your idea that people confuse money with wealth. This idea had never occurred to me and started me thinking that maybe because people had not paid for those services with money, they put no value on the services provided by myself free of charge for their benefit. <br><br>This is an alien point of view to me as I see wealth in social currency, but I can see that I’m in the minority.<br><br>Incidentally, I’ve observed that social currency has a much higher value with people in rural areas than with people in urban areas.<br><br>What do you think about this?<br><br>Also, a neighbour who has bee hives has suggested a barter of fruit for honey – his honey is really good as we bought some off him last season. I also appreciate the work his bees do in my orchard and vegie beds and he obviously benefits from the pollen provided to his bees. He has also suggested maybe setting up a bee hive in the food forest here. How would you recommend that I work out a suitable exchange for honey and fruit given that money won’t be exchanged? I’m unsure and would really appreciate some advice.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c3737371297974736084 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 3:00 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, I know, it’s heresy to suggest this, but my take is that what drove that increase was not the growth of human knowledge, or any of the other comforting mantras offered by the publicists of science and industry over the last century or so.

Employment seemed a way of distributing (as you say) enough of the largesse out of the hands of the simply greedy, and actually enlarged the market for goods.

I have learned a lot about potash, how to read what the soil needs by the plants that grow on it. Initially, this thinking started with soil, but as I pursued this line of thinking I began to see that the loop should start and potentially end on the homestead.

I'm sure most of his friends and family scratched their heads when he made that decision. However, one of the recurring themes in his books is the future need for the very same monastic lifestyle of voluntary poverty that you mention here. <br><br>This idea is a very hard sell for most Americans, who have been conditioned to believe that the luxuries and indulgences we have enjoyed for the past few generations are a permanent condition, rather than a transitory one. <br><br>Across the street from our place is an old farmhouse which is currently being offered for sale on a parcel of 30 acres that includes a full complement of outbuildings and a nice barn. Built in the 1860's as a fairly upscale residence and occupied until very recently by an elderly couple, the premises are worn but quite livable by the standards of the 1930's, which is apparently the period in which the house was electrified and plumbed with a single bath and kitchen sink. There is a gas-fired forced-air heating system which appears to have been installed in the 1950's.<br><br>It's been on the market for quite a while. <br><br>Aside from issues of price and financing, I'm sure that most prospective buyers who tour the house are horrified by the 'primitive' living conditions that the old place represents, notwithstanding the fact that the previous occupants lived there for their entire lives without apparent injury. <br><br>While the place could certainly benefit from modern thermal insulation techniques and a good scrubbing and painting, there is nothing unhealthy or dangerous about it.<br><br>Up until very recently, the typical old house of this type would have been purchased only with the intention of a total strip-down to the bare framing, followed by a complete 'rehab' with all new materials, mechanicals and granite countertops.<br><br>Nowadays, for most potential buyers, that several hundred thousand dollars worth of rebuilding would be prohibitively expensive, so they politely back out the door and ask the realtor to show them another more 'modern' house.<br><br>That's too bad, because that old place represents a perfect opportunity for the kind of "voluntary poverty" you're talking about here. It's a fully-built and functional farmstead with tillable open land, ready to go for another generation or two. All it needs is a family who can be content with one bath and an iron sink and who are willing to wear sweaters in the wintertime.<br><br>It would be nice to have neighbors like that. I hope they come along soon.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c9088912744553194540 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 6:12 AM</a><br><br>

It is unfortunate that our education system does not teach enough critical reading and history for the majority of americans to see the reality behind his his words (however politically correct he attempted to be). He stated that China would more or less bail out Greece and that China would back and support the EU and, by extension, the euro even if it meant a redistribution of economic tools. Given that this has happened each and every time a 'top dog' nation has fallen and a new dog has risen, one can easily infer that China is telling the world 'don't rely on the U.S. China now holds the economic power and, by extension, is poised to assume the #1 position in the world.' I suppose we can only hope that some country will still see value in America (as we did in Britain when we saved their economy by parking our boats off of their shores during WWI) and save us from the messy and extremely uncomfortable decline faced by Spain, France, Italy, and many others!<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c7293820710403610273 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 6:51 AM</a><br><br>

It will take some time to fully digest all of it (I have some questions and minor quibbles, but I'll keep them to myself at least until I finish both books and go through the older posts on this site). You seem to be one of the only people out there who is being even remotely realistic about our future prospects. <br><br>We live in Arizona, where there is too much heat and not enough water, but we have been living without air conditioning for a couple years. In the warm months, we open the doors and windows at night, and suck in cool air with a pole fan, then close everything up and pull down the shades to keep it (relatively) cool during the day. In the winter we open the shades to let in sunlight during the day, and keep all the windows caulked tight, etc, and set the thermostat as low as it will go, and dress accordingly. As a result, we've saved a ton of money on our heating and electric bills, even though our house has practically no insulation to speak of. We all do what we can...<br><br>We've been growing lots of our own vegetables in raised beds (and under Eliott Coleman style row covers), even though we don't have much room in our yard. My husband built a bunch of self-watering containers from a design we found at Tomatofest.com, and we've been having pretty good luck with our tomatoes so far. This is mostly a learning experience, as you have suggested, so that we will be able to (hopefully) be self-sufficient in food in a few years, when we really need it.<br><br>Our ultimate goal is to move back east, after our youngest kid graduates from high school, to some place like Michigan or Missouri, where we can buy a few acres of agricultural land, build an energy-efficient house, with a greenhouse, and raise some goats and chickens, etc. I've had it with big cities and suburbs and traffic and the materialistic rat race that we're all stuck with, so the sooner it all falls apart, the happier I will be (should I be careful what I wish for?).<br><br>So, the idea of setting up shop in a small town near the Mississippi River or on Lake Michigan might be a good long-term plan, especially if sailing ships turn out to be the main form of transportation. That makes a lot more sense to me than moving up to Idaho with all the hard-corps survivalists.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c680610497976702851 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 7:01 AM</a><br><br>

It occurs to me that specializing in growing such plants might be a relatively high-value enterprise in a future in which the existing health care system has collapsed (currently, we do not have health insurance, so we're sort of ahead of the learning curve in this regard).<br><br>After my husband builds me my underground passive solar farm house, he wants to build a small wood-working and metal-working shop. Right now, this sort of activity is nothing more than a hobby for him, but in the kind of future that you are predicting, that's the sort of thing that could turn into a money-making enterprise (assuming there is still such a thing as money). <br><br>He built a small windmill (for only a few dollars) using scrap aluminum and a salvaged alternator, and thinks he might be able to do stuff like that as a part-time side job if the grid goes down. He loves to tinker with stuff, which is usually a good thing. <br><br>Our youngest son wants to be a gunsmith when he grows up, and is planning on learning that trade after high school. He seems to think there is a future in that particular specialty. My husband already knows what kind of windmill-powered, belt-operated lathes he wants to install in his shop, and says he knows how to make gunpowder the old-fashioned way... I don't think Homeland Security needs to know about this, do you?<br><br>Oh, and speaking of the salvage society of the future, a typical suburban tract house covered with aluminum siding will contain several hundred square feet of the stuff. Cut and shaped and polished, a thousand square feet of highly reflective aluminum could concentrate enough sunlight to boil water for a small turbine, or melt small batches of lead for home-made bullets, or solder pieces of copper together, or...

Admire your ability to garden, think and write all at once (I know, I know, think while gardening, research and write when it's too dark to garden--or some such).<br><br>Good message from Thoreau--though I must point out he was supported by his family's pencil factory, for which he invented a more efficient way of manufacturing pencils and a new "lead" recipe. Still, he lived a life that stayed out of the game you're talking about. Emerson got mad at him for this.<br><br>A side note: Many of us Quakers (from whom Thoreau got some of his ideas/philosophy/ethics) live the "testimony of simplicity"--akin to "voluntary poverty" because tied in with a non-materialist ethos. Living as a Quaker is much like living as a member of a religious/monastic order, while also living and doing work "in the world." Maybe like being a Druid?<br><br>As Greg Reynolds points out, working in the two systems at once gets wearing, and less gets done on the sustainability front than one would like. My husband and I continually work at our projects and on moving down the power slope in large and small ways. Right now I'm looking for a good mortar and pestle so as not to use the blender so much. But we never get as much done as we should and there's this sense of urgency.

What defines a serf, as opposed to a free peasant? The peasant owns his own land; the serf works on the baron's demesne, and has to depend on the baron for every necessity of life. Replace "baron" with "employer" and the only difference is that employers don't even give lip service to a code of chivalry. <br><br>Guilherme, I get that request about once a month, and my response is always the same: the last thing the rest of the world needs is one more clueless American telling it what to do. There are excellent peak oil authors and bloggers in Europe already -- I'm particularly partial to Ugo Bardi and Damien Perrotin -- so I'm hardly needed on that front; for that matter, based on comments you've made over the last few years, I suspect you could do a very good blog on these topics yourself. Remember that relocalization means, among other things, local production of ideas!<br><br>Publius, I'm not surprised. One of the hard lessons a lot of us are going to have to learn very quickly is how to deal with the absence of basic municipal services and the collapse of the social safety net; some of us will have to learn that sooner than others. <br><br>Risa, thank you for the tips and the encouragement! <br><br>Nuffnuff, exactly. Human beings got by just fine without a/c for close to a million years; it simply isn't that difficult. <br><br>Donkey, first of all, remember that that's the way most of us live right now. Between your employer and the government, you get a good deal less than half the value of your own labor. (The average medieval peasant worked fewer hours in a year than today's employees do; one day in three was a saint's day, thus a day off.) <br><br>Second, remember that we're not talking about a fast collapse; many of today's governmental structures will still be more or less in place until long after your time, or will be replaced by close equivalents, the way the Soviet government was replaced by the Russian Federation. Work with those structures to maintain basic public order, and you shouldn't have too much to worry about. <br><br>Lizzy, I'm already planning the post-internet form of the Archdruid Report, which will be a print newsletter/magazine mailed to subscribers. (Postal systems are viable on an 18th century technological basis, remember.) As that becomes more of a live option, I'll keep everyone posted. <br><br>Sixbears, I'm delighted to hear about the 30-somethings! That's very good news; this stuff has to find its way down the generational ladder. <br><br>Colleen, that's good to hear. Those "backwards" mountain ways are some of the best resources we've got just now. <br><br>Olvidadorio, you should indeed have done so! Still, they'd be better off if Georgia ws working on developing its own metalworking industries using salvage and scrap. <br><br>Ralph, that's <i>very</i> good to hear.

The chance that the United States will manage such a last-minute save, though, is pretty slim at this point if it exists at all."<br><br>I think this ignores the fact that the US has been moving steadily in an authoritarian direction for some decades now, so it would not constitute a 'last minute save' - the gutting of things like the Posse Comitatus and the Insurrection Acts under Bush, and the further extension of PATRIOT Act provisions under Obama being some of the more recent examples, but the entire Cold War era provides plenty of others. <br><br>Rather than last-minute, it's a culmination of trends decades in the making, and long apparent.<br><br>The fact that governments at all levels are cutting social services has little to do with the ability and demonstrated intent to preserve 'core' authoritarian functions such as domestic surveillance and intelligence, control over financial transactions, hyper-militarized policing and asset forfeiture, ongoing war making, etc. <br><br>Yes, we see the government divesting itself of 'non-essential' functions - but it is retaining - and in fact expanding - all of the apparatus necessary to project power and control the populace.<br><br>One of the most in-depth (and most widely-ignored) investigations into one key aspect is the extensive series authored by Washington Post's Dana Priest (not exactly a wild-eyed conspiracy theorist) a couple of years ago: <a href=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/a-hidden-world-growing-beyond-control/ rel=nofollow>'Top Secret America'</a>.<br><br>The fact is that the US already IS, effectively, an authoritarian state, a reality masked by the rhetoric of the ruling class (as expressed thru establishment media) and abetted by the willful ignorance of its citizenry (still buying into that 'land of the free' mythos). Ours is a softer, gentler authoritarianism. So far.<br><br>Like Gulliver, our civil liberties (the free measure of which are the metric for authoritarianism) are not denied via massive and blatant totalitarian chains, but by millions of threads of oppressive bureaucratic laws, regulations, codes, and ordinances and the petty (and more and more often, not so petty) tyrannies required to enforce them. But the constructs needed for a full blown authoritarian state are in place, waiting. As social disorder increases, and elite panic begins in earnest, it seems likely that we can count on the activation of many if not all of those mechanisms. To 'instill order' and 'for the public good,' of course.<br><br>I think Thijs put it well:<br><br>"I cannot help thinking that the worlds last drop of gasoline will be burnt in some military vehicle, probably in the act of keeping down its own country's populace."<br><br>Verging on hyperbole, but its essence is, I feel, all too possibly very much on target.<br><br>We don't have to look too far across the globe to see this State impetus in action, after all, and imagining that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cant-Happen-Here-Sinclair-Lewis/dp/045121658X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1309450004&amp;sr=8-1" rel=nofollow>'it can't happen here'</a> is just one more example of the denial to which this nation is so deeply wedded.<br><br>When it comes to cultural myths, IMO, among the most pernicious is this one: that the US government is largely a socially beneficent teddy bear. The reality is that is it a grizzly in teddy bear's clothing (that clothing currently rapidly disintegrating). Our blood stained history makes this grim point all too well.<br><br>IMO, to downplay the possibility of authoritarian rule in the US is to fall prey to this myth.<br><br>In summary, this is probably my one area of major disagreement with your vision of the future, JMG. Certainly, it makes your vision of a 'less than welcome' future even less so.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c5910710671292540022 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 9:28 AM</a><br><br>

Rural people have to depend on their neighbors; they don't have the option of anonymity. As for bartering honey for fruit, it's a great idea -- you might want to read up on barter arrangements (there's a sizable literature). How much fruit for how much honey? That's called "supply and demand," or in barter terms, "How much fruit would you want for five gallons of that honey?" <br><br>Lee, thank you! As I recall, Alabama's very humid as well as hot in the summertime; if a/c isn't needed there -- and of course people lived there for many thousands of years before a/c -- it's not really needed anywhere. <br><br>Sage, true, but those rednecks aren't going to be able to get a working TV from you, now are they? Here in the Appalachians, I've found that a lot of "rednecks" are decent people and good neighbors, and I've already had quite a few conversations over the fence about how I get all those vegetables so early in the season. <br><br>Phil, not that long ago the big bags of grain and legumes, the allotment garden, and the working kitchen where food got put up for the winter were essential parts of urban life. They will be again, in the not too distant future -- and they can be again, right now, with huge advantages to those who get going!<br><br>Alex, well put. Oil consumption in isolation from everything else is a lot less important than the whole system of energy inputs, and much of the energy inputs into any prosperous nation these days are actually used to run Third World farms and sweatshops that produce products for export to the First World. <br><br>Luke, from what I've read -- I haven't had the chance to visit yet -- Scotland's former industrial and shipbuilding towns are Exhibit A in any discussion of deindustrialization. Thanks for the link -- I'll follow up on it -- and also for the Dorothy Day quote. <br><br>Thijs, Ireland was a major gold producing region in the Dark Ages and its monasteries ended up becoming unusually rich -- a mistake which, as you noted, cost them dearly. In most of Europe, that didn't happen until long after the Dark Ages were over, and there were repeated efforts to launch new monastic movements to reclaim the value of poverty, from the Benedictines themselves right up to the Franciscans. <br><br>As for the US avoiding authoritarianism, er, where did you get the notion that I said that was a likely option? I said exactly the opposite -- that it might in theory be possible to get out of the spiral of conflict that leads to authoritarianism, but that the US' chances of doing so were slim to none. I'll be discussing this in much more detail down the road a bit. <br><br>Fleecenik, excellent! You get today's gold star for inspired salvage. This is exactly the sort of thinking that smart farmers used to do as a matter of course a century ago, and smart farmers will again be doing as a matter of course a century from now. <br><br>Greg, the problem is exactly that you're trying to live two lives in the same 24-hour period. The time you put into maintaining your presence in the existing order is the time you don't have for root cellars, etc. This is why I encourage people who live in couples, families, etc. to see to it that at least one person has the freedom to stay home and work full time in the household economy; it's much easier to get things done, and it's also a good way to transition to using less cash and more labor to get what you need. <br><br>Planner, you can't change anyone else's mind for them, and the ideas I'm discussing here are literally unthinkable to most people in the industrial world right now. Since you're stuck in the machine, at least for now, you might explore what can be done in a dense urban setting -- there are things you can learn and practice, and skills you can pick up. Might as well get to work!<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c7085177100728628440 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 9:53 AM</a><br><br>

It is part of the very long-standing tradition of despising those who make your lifestyle possible. Most of the things that people consider "trashy" like tube tops, shirtlessness, old cars, junk in the yard, etc. are things that come from being poor, at least in money terms: no a/c = more exposed skin, old cars = can't afford a new one, junk in yard = stuff salvaged and saved in case needed for parts, etc. This is a part of our cultural mythology that folks really should try to think a bit harder about. In fact, much of the stuff that "rednecks" get blamed for are actually projections from the middle classes down on to them. "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a sadly prime example. Our professional class hero, Atticus, is trying to save the oppressed black man from the racist low class white rednecks. Except, all the racist institutions that maintained the black oppression in the south were actually created and enforced by the people of Atticus' class, not by the "rednecks." Blame those who support you for your own sins -- a grand tradition. <br><br>About a/c -- it always leaves me bemused when people think that hot and humid climates are challenging places for people to live. Not only is that the climate in which we first evolved, I suspect if you did the demographics you would find that the majority of the people on earth still live in those climates -- without air conditioning.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c1766302832526266049 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 10:11 AM</a><br><br>

And of course you're right that some people will draw the short straw, as things unravel. It's just that not all of us will. <br><br>Mage, with dense clay you need huge amounts of organic matter. Compost <i>everything</i> and dig it in; when the leaves drop in fall, collect all you can, use them as a heavy mulch on top of your garden over the winter, and then dig them into the soil in the spring. Use raised beds to keep your plants from drowning, and run planks between the beds to walk on so you don't end up wearing ten pounds of hardened clay on each boot. You can get a first-rate garden on clay soil if you do this -- been there, done that, and enjoyed the vegetables. <br><br>Ghung, I'm going to be talking about that in a couple of weeks. The short form is that you're quite correct, the notion that people can't possibly live without (fill in the utterly unnecessary convenience of your choice) is going to be a fruitful cause of failure, suffering, and death in the years to come. <br><br>Robo, I wish I were in the market! It sounds like a great place. <br><br>Jonathan, good. Very good. You're paying attention, which is rare these days. <br><br>Susan, don't be too close to the Mississippi unless you like living underwater! Still, you're quite right that choosing a location close to natural transport corridors -- lakes, navigable rivers, passes through mountains -- is a good way to be sure you have access to trade. <br><br>Medicinal herbs and other low-tech healing methods are crucial; I don't have medical insurance either -- can't afford it -- so that's what we use. As for your son the future gunsmith, in your place I'd do everything possible to encourage him; that's going to be a highly valued trade in the years to come, and in fact it's a good income right now. <br><br>DIYer, I'm hoping to see papermaking and letterpress printing in those monasteries o the future -- those can be done with late medieval technology, and the impact on literacy and communication of the printing press was frankly much greater than that of the internet. <br><br>Andy, from my perspective that last burst of transformations runs a couple of phase shifts together. Agriculture dates from about 9000 BCE, along with empires and cities and reached a relatively steady state by around 500 BCE. The brief fling into fossil fuels started more than a thousand years later, and will be over shortly; I don't see it as a change analogous to the evolution of agriculture -- it's more like the invention of the war chariot, the innovation that sent the Indo-Europeans careening over so much of Eurasia, except that chariots stayed in use for a long time afterwards. Imagine an Indo-European expansion in which the horses all got worked to death and went extinct, maybe...<br><br>Petro, nicely put. In many ways, I have a richer and more comfortable life than a lot of people who earn five times what I do. It's just that they're not likely to see things that way!<br><br>Carver, remember that we're talking about the disintegration of the system that provides those things.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c8734038015123618400 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 10:13 AM</a><br><br>

Once the global economy comes unraveled, the US is going to have to start producing its own textiles again, and if you've got a solid background in textiles you may be set for a very good job. <br><br>Adrian, rather like being a Druid! I don't have any herb books to recommend right off hand; maybe some of the other commmenters have some suggestions. <br><br>Raven, no argument there. That's why I don't expect monasticism to become a major factor again until a lot of Americans get a lot of the nonsense knocked out of them. <br><br>Remnant, you're quite right -- this is one of the places where our visions differ sharply. To my mind, what we've got in America is a typical end-stage democracy, not that different from late Republican Rome or, say, pre-Mussolini Italy. All the things people use to justify claims that the country's getting "more authoritarian" have been going on at approximately their current pace since the early 19th century -- yes, that includes unconstitutional invasions of other countries and abuses of civil rights at home -- and only look new because most American social critics know next to nothing about their own country's history. Add to that a bad case of projecting the shadow via over the top "bloodstained grizzly bear" metaphors and the like, and you've got a thoroughly unhelpful view of where we're at, which -- as I'll be outlining in later posts -- is feeding the trends its proponents think they're fighting. More on this later. <br><br>Don, thank you! That's a good tip. <br><br>DPW, excellent! <i>A Guide for the Perplexed</i> is a brilliant book, one of the few works of popular philosophy to come out of that era that actually has some lasting depth to it. <br><br>Cathy, if you're out there doing projects, you've already gotten everything important that I'm trying to pass on. Delighted to hear about the local meetup, too -- that's a crucial next step. <br><br>Bill, true enough. These days, though, I know a fair number of people who embrace the term "redneck" with pride, and that's the sense in which I use the word.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c594056998318127630 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 10:34 AM</a><br><br>

Add to that a bad case of projecting the shadow via over the top "bloodstained grizzly bear" metaphors and the like, and you've got a thoroughly unhelpful view of where we're at, which -- as I'll be outlining in later posts -- is feeding the trends its proponents think they're fighting.

I would speculate that you hear quite a bit from conspiracy theorists and such, and may have tossed me in that bucket.<br><br>Having done years worth of shadow work myself (and continuing along this path), I completely agree that projecting the shadow explains much about our current society. In this case, my critique comes not from the unconscious, but from the rational, based on some years of intense study of history and politics, including works on the US by Zinn and Chomsky, who I think offer well informed politico-historical analyses which underscore your point that this is not a recent innovation. In fact, this is one of the basic points I labor to make to people who I tend to find as oblivious to history as you.<br><br>In fact, the only thing with which I disagree here is the notion that erosion of civil liberties has not dramatically accelerated over the last few decades (I think it has), while as you note having been present throughout US history, arguably starting back with the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 and extending forward from there.<br><br>And while the grizzly bear metaphor may be over the top, I think this is in fact the proper use of metaphor when emphasizing a point - that being, perceiving the lethal as its opposite often leads to unpleasant outcomes. Over the top metaphor has its place, methinks.<br><br>As for 'bloodstained', I think any reading of US history demonstrates it's a fair and accurate depiction, as many peoples from Native Americans, black slaves, victims of 'manifest destiny' all the way to citizens of the Philippines, Dresden, Hiroshima, Vietnam, Iraq, etc would attest.

Moore, like most northern liberals, does a fine job of forgetting that the South was a major force in US politics until 1861. As for Taoist monasticism, of course! I didn't happen to recall the name of any of the founders of major Taoist monastic lineages while writing, is all. <br><br>Gordon, I don't think most people in the political class -- or, for that matter, most middle class Americans -- have begun to think about what's going to happen once the majority of ordinary working class people in this country come to the conclusion that they really have nothing left to hope for from a continuation of business as usual. <br><br>Bill, I'm recalling some of the very colorful (as in unprintable) things said about bankers in the wake of the Great Depression.

It's not a matter of the continuation of present trends -- by any objective measure, the level of authoritarian behavior from the US government is less now than it was during any decade in the first half of the 20th century, for example -- but precisely as a function of the delegitimization of a flawed and faltering system by people who insist on labeling it in extreme terms. It's very much like the end of the French monarchy in 1789; so many people became convinced that the <i>ancien regime</i> was the worst possible government, and that anything that replaced it would be a change for the better, that they backed the rise to power of radicals who proved them wrong in the most definite possible way. More on this later; in this discussion, it's arguably off topic. <br><br>Matt, I think you're underestimating the economic impact of the collapse of US empire. In resource terms, it's the exact equivalent of every one of us taking an 80% pay cut, effective forever. That's going to hurt; I don't see a way to avoid malnutrition and bitter impoverishment for literally millions of people, including quite a few who are currently among the privileged classes. Still, as you say, it's going to happen, and we had better get to work on ameliorating it. <br><br>Rbtp, I hear that fairly often, of course. I wish I had an answer to it, but I don't. It's reminiscent of <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>, where the main character realizes his city is going to be utterly destroyed, but nobody else -- including his wife and children -- is willing to listen. The best advice I can offer is not to push it on other people, who won't listen no matter what you do; if you have to remain in the game for the time being, take up a "hobby" that will teach you skills for life after it ends.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c8978544387034097253 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 6:00 PM</a><br><br>

While I never have explicitly described my lifestyle as embracing voluntary poverty, it closely describes what I’ve done since I graduated from college a decade ago. I have survived on near or at poverty level income during most all of my adult life. I specifically chose to work just part-time in the formal economy because it gave me time to do things important to me: cooking, food preparation, studying/reading, household work, writing, music, volunteeer work of various sorts. While this type of informal work may not boost me up a “career ladder,” it is personally enriching.<br><br>During the 2008/2009 recession it was interesting because if it weren’t for reading the news and talking with certain people, I would have never known that things were so bad financially in the country. It didn’t affect my spending levels because I spend at a very low level anyway. I didn’t have to worry about my investments because I choose not to invest in the stock market. I didn’t have a mortgage, and I had no debt. And my job situation was pretty stable, but if I happened to have become unemployed, I had several years worth of savings to live off of if I had to. So having chosen voluntary poverty, it made me much more resilient to larger economic turmoil going on and actually less likely to become poor in an uncomfortable way.<br><br>One of the many advantages of this lifestyle is that one is able to actually appreciate occasional unessential items. For example, I eat out in restaurants rarely because I or my housemates cook meals at home. But the occasional time I do eat out becomes a novel experience that I try to savor, unlike how it is for certain city-goers who eat out every day. I don’t purchase much beside basic food staples, utilities, rent, and public transit fare, but the occasional extras I buy I really treasure. The most latest example is your book “The Wealth of Nature”!<br><br>In other words, the child who gets candy once a year enjoys it way more than the child who gets candy whenever she wants!<br><br><br>On air-conditioning: <br><br>I have gotten along well living without air conditioning in all the places I’ve lived (except my college dormitory might have had it). I think having grown up living without air conditioning in a place with hot and humid summers made me used to it. Now more often than not, I find air conditioning annoying, because it’s hard to go from a cold inside out to a sharply contrasting hot outside. Currently I live in DC and while it can get pretty hot on the 3rd floor of the rowhouse where I live, it is not unbearable. When it approaches 100 degrees, I sometimes resort to using a fan, or I just go to a cooler part of the house. If it gets uncomfortable, I remind myself that the effects of air conditioning on society/environment are way more uncomfortable than what I’m experiencing.<br><br>Today on the bus I was noticing a high number of DC professionals wearing thick pants, long shirts and ties, some wearing tuxes. Only in an air-conditioned workplace would you want to do that in the summer. Such a waste that so many have to bring a sweater to work to not shiver in the air conditioning while it’s in the 90’s outside. I’m all in favor of doing away with 99% of the air conditioning, even in the city (with a few exceptions such as hospitals, where elderly live, etc.) I find it ironic that air conditioning is one of the things contributing to global warming/weirding, which then causes people to use air conditioning even more!

Make sure you get enough salt. Sweet caffeinated drinks like sweetened black tea or coffee also seem to help for some reason. <br><br>Use evaporative cooling. Put a wet cloth on your neck to cool down. I have gotten through 35-40 (Celsius) nights without even a fan by using a damp dishtowel as a bedsheet. <br><br>Siesta during the hottest parts of the day. <br><br>Move your bedroom to the basement. <br><br>I have used all of these techniques, both at home in Canada (where summer temps can hit 35 - 40 or more Celsius), as well as on travels through Egypt, Portugal, Jordan, and other such hot countries. The hottest day I have ever lived through was 49 (around 120, I think), and I walked over 15 kilometers that day to see some ruins. I was fine, though I drank over 5 liters (more than a gallon) of water. <br><br>There are lots of low-tech ways to deal with extreme heat. I am sure there are many more than I have listed here, and I am also sure they work in the US just as well as they do in Egypt or Portugal or Canada.

Saves a lot of repeated work. <br><br>Greg, I didn't say you should drop out completely. I said that if you live with other people, one person in the household should consider dropping out, in order to be able to get the household economy up and running. In many cases a family is financially better off with one income than with two, since the costs of maintaining that second income and the lost opportunity for producing real wealth at home more than account for the second income. Not everyone will be willing to accept the lower income in order to gain those benefits, of course, and not everyone lives with other people, but it's an option that deserves more attention than it gets.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c455715191994892255 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 7:56 PM</a><br><br>

I’ve always seen this work as building social currency. However, I’ve noticed that the majority of other people do not see it this way. A majority of people tend to see this free work performed for their benefit as having little intrinsic value even though it has a commercial value. I’ve often wondered about this issue. <br><br>Then whilst reading your book I came across your idea that people confuse money with wealth. This idea had never occurred to me and started me thinking that maybe because people had not paid for those services with money, they put no value on the services provided by myself free of charge for their benefit.” <br><br>I’ve contemplated similar issues too. I live in a very career-oriented city, and it’s not uncommon to get asked, “What do you do?” I have learned to answer this question honestly and respond with what I do with my life, both paid and unpaid work (and not even mention which is paid vs. which is not). When I start mentioning that I cook, or write, or whatever, it’s common for people to ask, “Oh, where do you work?” or “What kind of job do you have?” In other words, “work” is assumed to be only paid work and if it’s unpaid, it isn’t of value and not worth being in an answer to the question of “what I do.”<br><br>It’s particularly funny because some of the work I do is both paid and unpaid, but when I do the same type of work that I get paid for sometimes as unpaid work or as a labor exchange for a service received, suddenly it’s not looked at in the same way, but the actual work I’m doing is no different!<br><br>Growing up, my mother did not have a job in the formal economy but yet worked just as much or more than people with full-time paid jobs—raising children, cooking meals, going to town council meetings, volunteering. I think she sometimes resented how people and society didn’t value her work, simply because it wasn’t paid.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c3475414885094803382 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 8:08 PM</a><br><br>

"Oh, what helpless victims!" the media wails. Meanwhile they are found footsteps away from a working bathtub. Ignorant perhaps, but clearly not helpless. If they had enough strength to turn on the faucet and step into a cold bath, they had enough strength left to survive.<br><br>The problem I see in academic and corporate America, where I've spent all my life, is that there is no respect for natural cycles. There are fast times, and there are slow times. The culture that focuses on production at all costs has no respect for the slow times. In 100-degree Farenheit weather, without air conditioning, the body adapts naturally, but naturally means slow. You can't do as much work. Sometimes nature dictates when you take a rest. But Oh No, says our culture, we have no patience for that! Turn up the A/C and get to work!<br><br>At home is a different story. Sorry, but I really have no patience for my fellow wealthy Americans who don't understand that you can live in 100-degree Farenheit weather without air conditioning. Haven't you ever been to summer camp? Really, people! (OK, perhaps I am too harsh on ordinary Americans. I have been thin and in good health all my life. I have never walked a day in an obese person's or a sick person's shoes, so I don't know what it's like to experience heat from that perspective.)<br><br>Then again, how can I expect ordinary Americans to live without it? Our military, supposedly our hardiest men and women, are spoiled by the softest living the world's ever known. Here's a headline: <br> Air conditioning for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan costs $20.2 billion a year<br> Keeping troops cool costs more than NASA's entire budget, says NPR.<br> http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/energy/stories/air-conditioning-for-troops-in-iraq-and-afghanistan-costs-202-billion-a<br><br>A year?!!

It will help you meet some like minded folks, and it's a good way to get green wizarding ideas into wider (local) discussion.<br><br>I was at my town's sustainability group meeting last night to discuss the completion of the town sustainability plan: do they have the clear view of descent I do? No, but one main topic of conversation was house insulation and energy use reduction. A member of local government was there who said that the town is working on starting a composting system as part of reducing the waste stream and improving the soil. <br><br>I was able to remind folks (including many representatives from other community organizations, so the message may spread) that reducing energy use means JMG's acronym LESS, and changing personal habits, not just installing a geothermal heat system. So that became a part of the overall discussion.<br><br>I'm sure a lot of readers are already doing something like this--it's just a way of helping our communities figure out ways to manage the descent, and we here have a lot to offer.<br><br>Re household economy: even one spouse working (for money) only part-time as I do gives more time for projects. Ideal in my book would be if my husband also worked part-time--there'd still be money coming in, but more time for teamwork at home.<br><br>p.s.

When I look around at the object around me I often consider how they might be reused, and one of the things I've noticed is just how specialized they are. Automobiles are certainly one large class of object that will be salvaged, and they're an example of high specialization. While I've no doubt that people will become very inventive in re-purposing, when you look at an automobile there is not all that much that is useful as-is. Alternators, lamps, seats, some pumps, wiring and connectors, panels and windows of simpler shape, a few bearings and shafts, stuff like that can be re-used. But much of the rest is not easy to do much with.<br><br>That means that it must be salvaged for the raw materials. In addition to requiring more energy, this presents certain problems based on what those materials are. There will be certain high strength steel alloys that can not easily be worked at forge temperatures. But perhaps the biggest issue is toxicity. Much of the metal has coatings, and then there is all that plastic. What will it be used for? Some may be shredded and reused, but I cannot help but believe that most of it will either end up distributed into the environment on land and the in the sea, or it may be burned for heat. Either way there will be a huge amount of toxins released into the environment that are presently somewhat contained. There are likely to be a lot of people tearing apart stuff that they have no knowledge of, releasing all kinds of toxins where they take it apart and where it is taken to.<br><br>Incidentally, whenever I see the phrase salvage society I cannot help but think of those pictures of the shipbreakers in Asia that cut up old ships with mostly hand tools and little protection.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c887982646257176334 title="comment permalink">7/1/11, 10:08 AM</a><br><br>

I know you’re well educated in occult philosophy, so I wanted to run some ideas by you which are very relevant to the issues you discuss here.<br><br>In certain schools of occult thought, "white magic" or "the right-hand path" means the submission of the subjective universe to the inherent mechanical and organic patterns of the objective universe, while "black magic" or "the left-hand path" is the exercise of the subjective universe's Will to Power over the objective universe. The extreme examples of the right- and left-hands paths today are the Primitivists and the Singularitarians, respectively, but this division has probably been around from the beginning.<br><br>The modern West is an example of a left-hand path society; we are governed by essentially Satanic ideas such as individual freedom, the total subjection of the natural world to the Will, the transcending of all limits, the breaking of all established rules, the violation of the cosmic order, etc. This explains why to the more traditional cultures of the world, we truly are the "Great Satan". <br><br>Personally I'm more sympathetic to the left-hand path values than the traditionalist, naturalist and collectivist right-hand path values. As I see it, a person needs to choose sides, and either accept individual freedom and constant, disruptive change, or choose the traditional, restrictive but stable values of the hunter-gatherers, whose cultures went unchanged for millennia. The “Satanists” have clearly had the upper hand for a long time, but that may be changing. While I’m skeptical that humanity can attain godhood and do believe that there are limits to what we can achieve in this universe, I would never want to draw a line and say “Enough!” or adopt a fatalistic attitude toward the future.<br><br>Anyway, do you agree with this general formulation? You seem to be much more in the white magic school which is against “disturbing the universe” and in favor of the Druidic or Taoist “go with the natural flow” way of thinking. Is this a fair assessment of your philosophy?<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c8049008632854267384 title="comment permalink">7/1/11, 3:23 PM</a><br><br>

We’re going broke trying to pay for all these sprawled-out roads and schools and jails and teachers and librarians and police officers that additional people like you are going to require. This is Agricultural zoning, not Residential, and this petition is greenscam. Just adding a little backyard garden and a PV panel to an auto-dependent McMansion doesn’t cut it out here. You can easily do household-scale fruits and vegetables and chickens and rabbits on a 50’ x 150’ lot in the city, and still have room left over for your house. But out here we’re doing serious, large-scale row-crop farming to produce serious, large-scale surpluses of food because the world is soon going to be starving to death, and you guys in your BMW’s tailgating our slow-moving farm tractors and beeping your horns is not making our job any easier.

Since daytime temperatures in the summer could reach 120 degrees, night time temps would still be over a hundred. So the challenge was keeping the heat out. But since most houses still got unbearably hot, the solution was the "submarine" This was a half tube of wood and sheet metal construction with a bunk inside for a bed. Canvas was then stretched over the roof. A soaker hose was placed on the ridge line, I believe. A short time before retiring for the evening, the canvas would be drenched in water. As the water evaporated in the desert air, the "submarine" would lose 20 degrees or more, enough to make sleeping comfortable. A second drenching was often needed to keep things cool."</i><br><br> The idea of using pure evaporation as a method of cooling intrigued me so I did a test today.<br><br>I was able to get a 12 degree temperature drop in about 40 minutes with a very crude set up.

So in that sense, we are supporting a much higher level of complexity now than previous civilizations could manage with paper and bureaucrats.<br><br>While I agree with JMG that this industry will also succumb to collapse, I think there will be some effort to keep them in production."<br><br>The problem I see with this hypothesis is that it's not the processor technology alone which affords the tremendous power, but rather the coupling of that technology with networks, both wired and wireless.<br><br>Which means it's not one industry - the semiconductor industry (in which I worked for 14 years) - that would need to remain viable (and this is a tall order in itself when one considers the raw materials it consumes [including truly astounding amounts of fresh water] and the toxic chemicals and rare earths required by the fabs), but rather several, including the wireless and wired networking industries and all that those require, and all the other supporting technologies (like battery manufacture) to keep the whole thing going. Leibig's Law of the Minimum applies most severely the more complexity inherent in the technology.<br><br>IIRC (my son has my copy), it was in the EcoTechnic Future where JMG discussed this issue, and the very good example he used was of slide rules vs electronic calculators. The former being amenable to construction by a woodworker of sufficient skill, the latter requiring numerous parallel complex technologies to produce.<br><br>There is a further consideration as well: you are posing this as an issue of utility - that the *uses* are so beneficial that we will wish to keep the technology going for as long as we can. But - the business model of technology tends to rely upon a large number of users to reduce the per unit and per use costs. In an age of economic contraction, the number of users will ineluctably decline - as many simply cannot afford the technology, and this sets up a vicious cycle of increasing costs as the number of users decrease - which causes the costs to rise further, and # of users to drop further, etc. So the economics of the thing - which benefited from increasing energy flows throughout society when those were available - now reverses and sets into motion the opposite effect when they are not. Feedback loops are like that.<br><br>So as much as many people (especially including the military) may *want* to keep semiconductor technology available, it's just not in the cards. In fact, I expect it to be one of the earlier casualties, regardless of its utility, due - ironically - to exactly that which makes it so useful: it's innate complexity and dependency on support infrastructure. <br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c8765511112072557863 title="comment permalink">7/1/11, 5:41 PM</a><br><br>

The monastery kitchen alone, is an absolute model of efficiency – everything has a purpose and nothing, NOTHING, goes to waste.<br><br>At the beginning of the week they provide each guest with one linen napkin rolled into a personalized wooden napkin ring. You are expected to use that same napkin all week– folding and turning it as needed. At the end of the week that napkin pretty much tells the story of everything you've had to eat. :) I tried instituting a similar practice when I returned home, but my wife and kids threatened to have me committed :) <br><br>In my 'green wizard' library, alongside my Foxfire and Rodale books, there's a copy of "The Rule of St. Benedict," and "Roberts Rules of Order." Strange bedfellows?<br><br>On another note, I'm mindful that Francis of Assisi (the original hippie) rejected the values and materialism of his time and sparked a breathtaking movement toward 'voluntary poverty' whose first followers were disenchanted privileged youth.

The relationship between the self and the cosmos, like any other relationship, can take many other forms besides "B submits to A" and "B dominates A" -- not least because B is a subset of A, and in no real sense separate from A. From my point of view, for what it's worth, neoprimitivists and singularitarians are both chasing minor variants of the same failed tradition of apocalyptic utopianism -- they disagree about details but share the same terror of history and the same delusion that the human condition will go away if they just believe hard enough. <br><br>Steve, thanks for the reference!<br><br>Dltrammel, excellent!

We would have to move from our spacious suburban home (that is taxed at a rate of $7200 a year, and hopelessly energy inefficient) to a small 2 room log cabin, built by my aunt, heated with wood. The more I think about it, the more it seems prudent to make the move. My husband is dying of a stress-related disorder and might recover if he quits his job but he is addicted to the internet and can't think clearly.

I'll try and make this as short as possible.<br><br>Just thinking out loud here, so lack of continuity is possible.<br><br>Playing the wrong game has been my catch phrase for some time now with alot of my friends that even care<br>to talk about this subject (some simply cannot get by on much less due to living on the same playing field as their income, if not beyond it). Getting your life designed around needing MUCH less money to get by on has been<br>a plan I've had in motion for some time, and now I'm starting to really see this new vision bloom! It's been rather rewarding seeing my ideas and intuition on how life can be without needing so much extra..... everything, and how much time is left for pleasure, thought, and actually particpating in LIFE without all the rat race nonsense being part of the equation. It starts with a plan, a dream, a means to the dream, and some up front hard work to make it happen. More on this to come.<br><br>I'm a oil painter (artist) that had a full time corporate job for 2 years, but was layed off 8 months ago.(life's never been better!) My wife and I bought a house 6 years ago, a beautiful old home (over 100 years old) in southern Louisiana for a great price, it needed work, but very liveable with a lovely back yard and a nice front yard with the classic la. wrap around porch (plenty of growing room). We made sure the mortgage was realistic for us up front, even in times of no work. Simply, if we couldn't "wing it" on our own ideas for making money to pay for it, we couldn't afford it. <br><br>But my "plan" was to aquire the house, get the house fixed up, pay off most if not all our other bills (truck, motorcycle, credit cards, etc.) and basically quit our jobs (she's a teacher of 7 years now), and wing it. Also, a couple years back, I started saving money to actually enjoy this "coast time" so I wasn't worried about making money or losing my job, and could feel good about my plan and enjoy myself. But that was the "point" to even getting this corporate job I speak of, it had a purpose, provided some future lovely down time, and most importantly..... wasn't thoughtless cruise control without an end! Now, that this has been accomplished, the world has really seemed to open up. I'm painting more, spending more time with my wife (she's off for the summer!), and having fun not spending a bunch of money on silly stuff. When you don't need so much money to get by on, the value of your dollar seems to have an incredible exchange rate on it's own....even in these increasing living rates.<br><br>Had a bought a newer car (Hey, don't us working class deserve nice things! LOL!) , mine is 11 years old, or decided to simply keep collecting things on credit or extra cash, I would be in a financial pickle. Instead, I've started a garden and am collecting herbs, help friends on their projects, see family, talk to my dogs and plants all day, cook more, sleep more , daydream , little yoga, read... you get the idea. <br><br>So right, the wrong game is the game designed to not have a winner or some type of finish line. It just keeps going on and on, a maze with no trees or self helping clear thinking allowed. My savings won't last forever, and before they start to run short you can bet I'll be doing some new and fun odd jobs to make our rather simple financial obligations ( I do have practical craft skills) , and I hope to learn new things, meet new people , and get some excercise and sun outdoors all at once. Quite simply, if you can make your money getting excercise and some sun all at once, there's just two more less bills to pay..... the gym and the tanning bed. LOL! I think alot of stuff can work this way. The way my life is now with most of the financial overhead out of the way and needing less..... the air seems cleaner and my brain has had time to fire in the right direction, even if it means I'll make alot less money, I can assure you there is more grace in my steps.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c2705997131860505048 title="comment permalink">7/2/11, 4:19 AM</a><br><br>

It allows us to make our contributions to the future usefulness quotient with less overall impact, but we cannot forget that in order to exist in the long term, we must contribute more than we take. Being frugal or sustainable isn't sustainable unless we create something to make up for random events. Civilization probably started from the concept of food storage for 'bad years'.

We have a small organic vegetable farm that was the result of thinking about the energy crunch in the 1970s.<br><br>There are about 30 acres in a 4 year rotation, about half of which are in soil building crops. About 30% of the other half is producing seeds for the green manures, cover crops, small grains (oats, barley, wheat), flour corn, dry beans, and peas. We eat a lot of our own food year round. <br><br>There are 5 more windows in the house that need to be replaced with energy efficient ones. We burn wood for supplimental heat. I have infloor heat in my greenhouse, infloor solar heat in my workshop, and drove my pickup truck about 750 miles last year. Excluding a motorcycle trip to BC last year and deliveries, I logged about 3000 total miles on all my vehicles.<br><br>All my grandparents were farmers. Subsitance farming was something they knew a lot about. They also sold products in the marketplace. Like them, I have no real interest in subsistance farming. <br><br>Now to the example of the difficulty of running two parallel systems. <br><br>If I continue to make my living farming here and decide to switch to horses I would need about 6 horses. Coincedentally, there are stalls for 6 horses in the (circa 1900) barn. Those 6 horses need to purchased and fed every day. <br><br>I can either buy the hay and feed or I can produce it myself. Buying it seems kind of dumb since I live on a farm. To produce it I need to take about 25% of our land out of roatation and make hay and grow additional oats. <br><br>On average (considering soil building and production) those 8 acres produce $20,000 of net income in my current system.<br><br>I can't grow the additional oats and hay without a tractor - horses need to be fed from day one. Producing the feed takes time and I'm not currently finding time to get everything done (see the comment above about the root cellar). I think my wife would like me to have a little bit of a social life too...<br><br>If I skip the horses, I can run my tractors all year on about $1500 worth of gas and oil. Parts can run as much as $2500 if I had to rebuild the motor (every 15 years or so) or as little as $500 for new tie rods, a battery, rebuilding the hydraulic pump, or whatever little things need to be taken care of. So say it takes $2000 a year to run the tractors. <br><br>When I'm not using not using it, the tractor stands in the barn and needs no attention. Horses need feed and water everyday. There is a fair amount of responsibility to owning livestock. <br><br>There are lots of other examples (and excuses), but at this point I think you can see where I'm going. <br><br>To make a realistic transition work, I need to add a new production system and then run both of them in parallel, when the cost of the current system is much less. In addition it is folly to count on a new system to be reliable and resiliant.<br><br>The opportunity cost vs. the actual costs are probably greater than 10:1. It should be noted that no one pays more because my costs of production are higher. <br><br>I have been working on this for a while, but progress seems painfully slow.

So historically, all societies have developed rules – written or unwritten - about the use of land.<br><br>Modern zoning and building codes usually reflect what your neighbor – modern society – thinks is rational. So since modern society’s rationality is questionable, sometimes those rules make a lot of sense, and sometimes they don’t.<br> <br>For me personally, the worst place to try to build or rehab a house would be a golf course subdivision of McMansions that is governed by a homeowners association run by nitpicking busybodies. But that’s just me. For some people, that’s exactly what they're looking for: tight enforcement of strong rules that prevent their neighbors from doing something that could negatively impact their life, like allowing children to play in the children’s own front yard or other horrific acts unsuitable for cultured, sensitive eyes.<br><br>If you want the fewest regulations, then you’re going to end up living on what “Chief Bison” Jim Dakin at bisonsurvivalblog calls “junk land”: rugged, infertile, little rain, remote in Nevada. It works for him, but not for everyone.

Some inconveniences, sure; but nothing catastrophic. The rules exist, but due to economic constraints, enforcement is often lax. <br><br>In terms of sustainability/survivability, the current regulations have permitted us to do most of what we’ve wanted to do: blow in more insulation, plant fruit trees and grape vines, build a 6-foot-high chain link fence around the back yard with thorny raspberries at the base to discourage the crack heads from exploring, etc.<br> <br>We may eventually do chickens, but they are currently banned (although Rockford does have extensive regulations on raising pigeons). So I’d have to get a revision to the local ordinance passed (add another species, basically).<br><br>The best approach to changing regulations is to find another jurisdiction that is permitting whatever you want to do, and then just copy their legal boilerplate and bring it before the appropriate committee. Here’s Cleveland’s ordinance that now permits backyard chickens and other farm animals within reasonable limits (scroll down a bit to Sec. 347.02):<br><br>http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/clevelandcodes/cco_part3_347.html#347.02<br><br>And then go to work: “People in China have chickens in their back yard.

You’ve mentioned that you think the long-term carrying capacity for the human species is significantly less than the current human population. It also seems apparent that you think (as I do) that the issue of overpopulation is not an isolated issue and is interconnected with lots of other issues in a world that largely ignores the limits to growth.<br><br>However, I have never heard you say any of your opinions (at least in any direct way) about what options you’d encourage both individuals and societies to take to humanely reduce population. I would be interested in knowing more of your own thoughts regarding population (especially on the level of what actions can be taken). Do you advocate that people seriously consider having less or no children? What policies do you think would be both fair and address overpopulation? If you were so inspired, I think I would enjoy reading a blog post on this topic from you sometime. I admire the maturity and style of your writing, and I think your voice would encourage higher quality discourse on this topic.<br><br>The main other peak oil writer I really follow and admire besides you, is Sharon Astyk, and she writes about the population issue. I’ve appreciated the complexity and questions she has put forth that add to a high quality of discussion, beyond the polarized, simplistic, and judgemental statements that people sometimes make regarding overpopulation ( such as “Overpopulation is the root cause of all problems” or “Any additional child born makes the world situation worse” or on the other end, “Any concern about overpopulation is racist.”)<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c999567823485730241 title="comment permalink">7/2/11, 11:08 AM</a><br><br>

And at home, I hear the nonstop sound of the traffic 'ocean' from the nearby Parkway (that's a type of death-trap freeway with very narrow lanes and no commercial vehicles); just the endless whush and roar of motor vehicles at least 18 hours a day.<br><br>Not to mention my most recent experience which really makes your new 'Dark Age' thesis seem far out. I have been offered a position at a very obscure college that's 9000 miles away. They will be paying to transport me via four jumbo jets and I'll be living on a very small island that is completely dependent on diesel oil for cargo ships, electricity, and pumping water; and yet there are over 6000 people there who do seem to manage.<br><br>I hope this is not construed as overly critical. At home, I do grow a small garden and I find the idea of living in a small town and having a real community very appealing. I guess it wasn't meant to be - at least not here.

In actual practice, when one lives in a world with other people there are often good reasons why you should not be able to do whatever you want with "your" land. Usually those who complain the loudest at the imposition are the first ones to howl when someone else asserts the same right. <br><br>While there are often stupid zoning rules, and even the ones that made sense at one time may need to change now, good zoning has been a huge benefit in places where it has worked.<br><br>My father worked for years since the 70's to preserve agricultural land in the township where they live. There are many factors at work, but through all of that effort that township is a real gem now. Not too long ago someone did a video from an old Piper Cub flying into the township, and when it crossed the line the developments just STOP. There is a lot of great prime farmland there now that does not exist in the surrounding area, along with the very highest quality streams.<br><br>By contrast I lived in a neighboring township for a while, which when I moved there was a rare gem too with its old small farms intact, and I too worked to preserve it. But we failed, as the oldtimers were convinced they were the best stewards and needed no zoning. Then they all sold out for a song to a rich local boy developer and now there is nothing left of it. And we escaped to a rocky old hillside that was a poor man's hardscrabble farm in a township with good zoning and stewardship.<br><br>The people who live in my parent's township in the years to come will live much better for the zoning laws he helped enact. If that trampled on someone's ability to take every last bit of the wealth of nature on "their" land before they left, well too bad.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c7342615118218955784 title="comment permalink">7/2/11, 5:05 PM</a><br><br>

Of course, it's summer there too, and 40+ degree days are normal. But he is having to use every blanket he brought at night because the A/C is turned up so high in the barracks that the cold is making it hard to sleep.

They are not being given the opportunity to acclimatize to the heat.

You might do a bit of research and find out how Americans by and large responded to the Palmer Raids and the firebombing of Tokyo and Dresden, for example. That being said, yes, you have a point; the absence of a collective moral compass, combined with the demonization of government that people like Remnant have turned into a national fetish in recent years, is doing yeoman work setting the stage for the demagogues who will promise to free us from the tyrants in Washington DC, and then teach us all what the word "tyrant" actually means. <br><br>Aaa, you might want to be careful about words such as "absolutely impossible" when applied to human beings.

I'll try my best to explain the insight, but well...<br><br>In marketing there's a concept that if you provide consumers with lots of choice with a relatively homogenous product, you can create a level of dissatisfaction in that consumer. The reason for this dissatisfaction is because of the variety of choice has instilled a feeling in those consumers that they may be missing out on a better product, when in reality there is not much difference. A good example of this is toothpaste, few people ask why there needs to be so many different varieties? Social conditioning tends to reinforce this too as people try establish their place in the social heirachy.<br><br>Marketers are tapping into a well of human discontent so that they can sell more volume and higher margin products. <br><br>There is a side effect to this though, in that because there is a perceived choice, people struggle to make a decision fearing that they may make the wrong decision. In effect they are looking for a perfect solution.<br><br>I've noticed that people on average are finding the process of making decisions to be more difficult as time goes onwards. I acknowledge that this is a sweeping generalisation and I haven't conducted research other than my own observation.<br><br>The simple answer to this conundrum (that I've noticed) a lot of people favour is the do nothing approach. Although I've said it before not making a decision is actually making a decision (I know it sounds strange, but if you think about it the concept is valid).<br><br>I saw this in the response from DIYer (and I'm not singling DIYer out as you can see this in comments across the board).<br><br>The thing is though, where this mindset fails is in the situation where there is no choice. Oil is one such example, as there is no exact replacement for it. <br><br>People's comments and indeed our societies response to this predicament tend to show that we are acting as if something else will turn up to save us when there really is no alternative.<br><br>This to me is why the business as usual mindset is so seductive to people because at the core of it is the bonus of being able to delay making any decision on energy.

I suspect it's the influence of the old apocalyptic narrative, which requires both. That's a general response to your question; the specific response is that every civilization tends to rely more and more on its tertiary economy as it ages, but the differences in kind between various tertiary economies make it very difficult to quantify which does so more than others. The tertiary economy of ancient Egypt, for example, was theological; they used religious rather than financial incentives to determine who got how much secondary wealth. By the time Egypt entered its final tailspin, the structure was so vast that it all but defined everyone's life, but how do you quantify the comparative exchange values of a god and a derivative? <br><br>James, er, I'm scratching my head. You seem to be saying that since things are the way they are now, and haven't changed drastically in the last twelve months, it's impossible that they could be any different in the future. I don't think you could actually be claiming something that silly; perhaps you can help me out here. <br><br>Twilight, no argument there.

When I lived in Arizona, it was illegal for me to setup a greywater processing system. The documentary about Michael Reynolds' earthships offers additional examples, and I encourage you to watch it. Because his houses did not require water, sewage, electrical lines, and thus were not considered 'standard construction,' his architect's license was revoked, and the subdivision he built was declared illegal. Real harm was done. <br><br>After all, when considering the good that zoning has done, one must also consider the harm.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c7953710928388256349 title="comment permalink">7/2/11, 11:53 PM</a><br><br>

I can't help but wonder what will happen to the foreclosure/homeless folks in the country in the future, as well as the apartment-dwellers and those who haven't really gotten a good start yet (us young'uns). I imagine sometimes the most hideous future where empty houses are kept under lock and key or bulldozed while many sleep under the stars nearby--those who couldn't afford to keep their giant mortgages, and those of us who never got a chance to really get something to keep. I think of Detroit, which i'm not really familiar with, but I know houses there have been leveled for the benefit of the banks' books. The ultimate absurdity. <br><br>I do hope that at some point reasonableness and compassion takes hold in our culture and a humane path is taken. I remember the old homesteads of the 1800s--work the land for ten years and it's yours free. Perhaps at some point it'll come down to people keeping abandoned houses in decent repair for a period of time--or perhaps producing a certain amount of food for the lot--and it'll be theirs. <br><br>And as far as the one person who questioned being able to both work and do work at home--JMG gave a great answer and I'd like to direct anyone interested towards a book, "Radical Homemakers" by Shannon Hayes. While I believe that much of the book is flawed, it does give a decent introduction to the reasoning behind why someone might want to stay home rather than have a two-income family.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c8023636427137885845 title="comment permalink">7/3/11, 1:07 AM</a><br><br>

Recently I have had less work hours and so intensified my yoga asanas and Tai Chi (more slowly so enrgy intnesifies) and on Easter weekend the hand and feet chakras opened immensely(similar happened 11 years ago to me initially but it was vey strong this time with hand and feet chakras spinning intensely). I recently did a two weeks practicum at a nursing home and discovered that the doctor who visits there practices avidly hands on healing. I had read a book on this by a phillipines master some years ago but it was not widespread then. Now it seems to have itnernational convetions with doctors involved, etc. <br><br>Linked article below on biomagnetism discusses scientific basis of biomagnetism and disese and healing using SQUID devices in scientific studies from 60s-90s.<br><br>http://www.reiki.org/reikinews/sciencemeasures.htm<br><br>I have no opportubity to practice this stuff myself but I know about this enrgy and was recently more interested as I read in a meditation book that human magnetic field is proportional to body size much greater than the earth's magnetic field(like aq thousand times). So stimulating this by good health techniques (food,exercise, prayer, medtiation) can keep us healthy without expensive medical. So called scientific materialism has hit its limits but releigion of dark ages tried to hinder private direct contact with "God", so to speak direct opening and use of our own energy fields for shamanic healing or so-called psi powers. However through recent scientific advances in measurements of biological fields we can see that biological life can maintain its own balance (happiness, health in total ecosystem and organism) by direct stimulation of own biomagnetismus(qui, chi, prana, kundalini). SO the future of the monks and society after collapse is less christian and more chinese, indian, but it has to be a mass phenomenon and not just a secret society of mystics as gnostic christians in caves as the whole earht is now at stake. We can't just opt out. Cheap mechanical living in poverty is one thing but a scientific "magical" spirituality is definitely the next step in any mass human development. The Chinese govt. say humans rights without material development is empty to rebuff western criticism. However "the pursuti of happiness" in material and democratic and purely intellectual religious beliefsf are all empty without understanding the basis of human life/spirituality/health, that is biomagnetismus. When people understand thsi materialismus and political power will be less important for them.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c4296924227609835198 title="comment permalink">7/3/11, 4:34 AM</a><br><br>

I was certainly very critical of Bush and thought he was a terrible president too, but I also thought that the Bush administration’s actions and policies couldn’t happen just because of who was on top, but all the masses (including the many who despised Bush) going along with it in myriad ways. It’s one thing to be critical of elites, but it’s another thing when it becomes only blame--a way of avoiding personal responsibility towards actually living a life tackling of those problems oneself.<br><br>During the Bush years, I saw many bumpers stickers that said “Anyone but Bush.” I certainly had no admiration for Bush and I was glad to see his eight years end. But I find it problematic when people’s standard for changing society solely amounts to a lowly standard of having anyone replace an “evil” elite power. It then bothered me the way some were so enchanted by Obama as some sort of savior who could fix society. There’s actually a eery commonality between the opinion that a certain elite will be society’s savior vs. the opinion that an elite is an evil person solely responsible for destroying a society.<br><br>As for Obama, I’m no fan of a lot of his policies, though I wouldn’t say he’s “evil,” the way I hear some people imply in their political rants. If anything the Obama years has taught me is the vast limitations of putting one’s faith in a single elite to change society for you. This feeling even applies to third parties and my general ambivalence towards third party solutions towards political problems on the national level. While I may agree more with some stances of some third party candidates, I sometimes think the energy certain people put into third party campaigns (on the national level, at least) could accomplish more if used towards more practical community work of many kinds. And to me, there is no complete assurance that even a seemingly good third party candidate, in the small chance s/he got elected, would not be subject to the same forces influencing other elites.<br><br>This situation actually speaks to me of a feeling of powerlessness that evades our society and that sometimes scares me more than whoever is sitting on top. I think people have a lot more power than they realize. Yes, I agree that corporations have an unwarranted influence on life and politics in our society and I’m critical of corporate power. But I put blame not solely on corporations themselves but on all people who through their life choices are giving them that power—through supporting those corporations through buying habits, investing in the stock market, not being civicly involved in one’s community on whatever level, educating children not to be independent thinkers but mindless consumers, and generally not being honest with themselves and others in so many ways. I do not deny the importance of community and policy changes of certain kinds, but I do still believe in such an outdated thing as personal responsibility.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c5739022508591115410 title="comment permalink">7/3/11, 4:36 AM</a><br><br>

In practice? In Russia it paved the way for Lenin, in Spain for Franco, in Germany for Hitler...I could go on. As Edmund Butrke pointed out very sensibly a long time ago, it's remarkable how often the idealized futures held up as goals by ideologues give way to their exact opposite in practice. <br><br>Still, this conversation has gone a long ways off topic. I'll ask you to keep further rounds of government-bashing to yourself, or post them elsewhere. <br><br>Matt and Jess, I'm increasingly convinced that the most radical thing most people can do just now is scale back their participation in the money economy; having one ore more family members opt out of employment in order to work in the household economy is a critically important way to do that. <br><br>Surfer, that's an important point that can be generalized very far: the human body, mind and spirit have resources in them that most of us have never imagined, much less learned how to tap and use. All the world's pre-industrial spiritual traditions are largely about that fact, and have tools for doing things with it. More on this in a future post. <br><br>Beneath, very well put! "The fault is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings." This is why I keep on pointing out the extent to which people who blame the corporations, the government, the Republicans, the Democrats, etc., etc., for all the world's troubles are engaged in shadow projection. <br><br>DIYer, if it lasts a decade I'll be impressed. I'll keep the list posted about other options. <br><br>Sruggieri, you're right that that particular debate has outlived its usefulness. Still, there's a point to not encouraging the popular fetish for government-bashing: within ten years at the outside, as the world gets past the denial phase of its response to peak oil, many governments will be begging people to take the steps we're discussing right now -- as indeed they did during the Seventies. At that point, if we play our cards right, we may be able to multiply our efforts substantially during that window of opportunity. Recognizing that governments are resources that can be worked with is an important step in that direction.

I see why you’ve kept your operation running as long as you have: planning and hard work.<br><br>We’re in a vaguely similar situation here in urban Rockford: mechanical vs. muscle. We have two attachments for a walk-behind tractor (a tiller attachment and a snowblower attachment), but no power unit (the attachments are left over from when we lived in the country; the power unit and a sickle bar attachment stayed behind with the buyers of the property as part of the sale).<br> <br>We want to gradually bring more of the nearby vacant urban lots into cultivation, and are debating whether to buy a power unit or to buy a draft dog (probably a Bernese Mountain Dog) and teach it to pull a few implements that I would have to cobble together (like a small plow and a cart).<br> <br>We’re leaning towards muscle power because another purpose for the dog would be increasing our physical security (lots of home invasions here). <br><br>But in your situation, I would probably stick with the tractor until spare parts finally become unavailable at some distant point in the future. Adding half-a-dozen horses to your current workload sounds crushing. And you're not getting any younger.<br> <br>For us, the food energy a draft dog uses when he’s not pulling a load would also go into maintaining a 24/7 security system that can deter, alert, and defend. But it’s unlikely that you could get a draft horse to do much else that is useful, like answer the telephone. (“You’ve never heard of a talking horse? Then listen to this: ‘I am Mr. Ed.’”)<br><br>Of course, of course. Mid-20th Century Hollywood goofiness aside, horses use up a lot of food energy just standing around being horses; and you have to use up a lot of food energy maintaining them.<br><br>Since it’s reasonable to assume that your fuel costs are going to rise, could you use part of the biomass you’re producing to make biofuel to run the tractor? Biofuels obviously are not going to power our whole automobile-based economy; but in your circumstances, homemade biofuel to run your vehicles until they just totally disintegrate might make sense. Could a biofuel crop fit into your rotation, or could you use an existing crop as the source?<br><br>Eventually horses and/or oxen will become major power sources on farms again. But in your case, biofuel might be more practical for however long you can keep your vehicles chugging along.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c2378845370709655174 title="comment permalink">7/3/11, 12:34 PM</a><br><br>

You've got to feed the nanny and get her bred for her to freshen so I have a suggestion. Don't be in a hurry to butcher any little billies, go ahead and de-bud them but train them to harness. Goats have been used to pull conveyances for a long time. Abraham Lincoln's kids received harness trained goats and carts one year for Christmas. Todd broke up a party at the Whitehouse once by hitching his goat to a rocking chair and driving through the middle of a dance! You'll likely become the neighborhood sensation for awhile but if it works it works. <br><br>You might try Boer goats, they're meat goats and larger then milk goats, then you can always eat them if needed. Although the nanny will only give you maybe a gallon a day in milk. If you don't use all the milk for food you can make milk based soap or save the extra enough to make butter or cheese. And I know the butter process would be hard since goat's milk is naturally homogenized.<br><br>Just be cautious in regard to what the nanny eats, things like garlic, onions, horseradish or hot peppers come through in the milk!<br><br><br>Wadulisi<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c347505623789090398 title="comment permalink">7/4/11, 12:36 AM</a><br><br>

Argh – you all have time or energy that I don’t! :-} <br><br>Voluntary poverty is how I’d been describing myself for a while, because as you suggest, JMG, voluntary simplicity has been co-opted by marketing. It now carries the idea of “perfect Martha Stewart simplicity” – and is a total fiction! (When that <i>Real Simple</i> magazine came out and all my friends raved about it, I felt ill.) And I am glad you are spreading the word that not playing the game is the only way to win… that’s what I concluded in these past couple years, when it became obvious that the US way of life is mostly ad-based frosting over a stale, nutritionless mass-produced cake.<br><br>A thought I had yesterday (stacking a cord of wood give lots of lovely thinking time) was that some of us might be pre-inclined to not play the game. I think I’ve always felt “safer” when I was physically able to verify my own basic needs. The more I became aware of how our society depends on a vast web of connections, the more uneasy I became. Growing/cooking food and being able to repair my house, my clothes and having tools I could repair just made me feel more comfortable. So green wizardry comes natural to me, and I think the first wave of green wizards might feel the same. I hope the next wave – those who come to it because they see the need, even if they don’t like these activities – will be able to adjust and eventually enjoy their new lifestyles.<br><br>And apropos one of your earlier posts, on managing with less stimulation – it’s tricky which comes first: I’ve found that without withdrawing from the massive stimulation of US culture, I couldn’t slow my mind down enough to think though whether I wanted a simpler life! There is a flat-out adrenalin rush that comes from living in over-stim (I know, I’ve lived in NYC) and you have to go through withdrawal from that (and it feels like withdrawal) before your mind is clear enough to see some of the things you, JMG, are describing…it’s taken me 30 years.<br><br>@sofistek<i>For some years now, I've felt that such a simple definition could result in a misconception about how many people are living in misery, as distinct from living in poverty.</i><br>I’ve been thinking the same thing every time I read that $2/day line – in fact, it presupposes that everyone is in the “money society” and 1) that’s an error and 2) that’s biased. As you say, depending on how connected you are to real wealth (natural resources) you might be fine on $2/day. When I tell my friends how little I spend, they are appalled and think I’m “starving”, but I’m living better &amp; happier than I used to.<br><br><br>@Greg Reynolds<i>To make a realistic transition work, I need to add a new production system and then run both of them in parallel, when the cost of the current system is much less.</i><br>This is the same excuse that the alternative energy critics are using – yes, it’s true that it will cost more initially, but the reasons for doing it are that the current system might fail, and might do so at a time when you simply can’t replace it! <br><br>@jamesjde – think “cracking ice” – it seems solid, until it’s not!<br><br>@matt and jess <i>I imagine sometimes the most hideous future where empty houses are kept under lock and key or bulldozed while many sleep under the stars nearby--</i> That’s what happened during the Irish Famine – and probably will happen again in some places… <br><i>Perhaps at some point it'll come down to people keeping abandoned houses in decent repair for a period of time--or perhaps producing a certain amount of food for the lot--and it'll be theirs.</i><br>Some places already have squatters’ rights regulations… there are blogs that talk about that somewhat, though I’ve never researched it.

We live in a tough city (Rockford, IL has the 4th highest per capita rate of violent crime in America) in a tough area (we’re right at the angle in Rockford’s notorious ”Bloody ‘L’”), so we need a big dog for protection as well as for draft work.<br> <br>We’re hoping that the dog (or dogs) can produce enough additional calories of food energy to justify their continued existence. With the human race facing widespread hunger and starvation, dogs are going to have to work again to survive. A lot of dog breeds – particularly those bred as cutesy companion animals - will probably go extinct. Some of the working breeds (Berners are one – it’s a general purpose farm dog used by Swiss dairy herders ) have a good chance of surviving by earning their keep, and making life easier for people on the other side of this fiasco we’re headed into.<br><br>You’re right that goats are extremely versatile: they don’t take up much space; they can eat just about anything (not that you want them to eat garlic, etc.); they produce milk and meat; they can haul a cart – and goats can be a formidable opponent if they take a disliking to someone.<br><br>Particularly if you don’t have the space and money for a cow – and most people don’t and won’t - then a goat or two is a good option. Goats should do well in the future.<br><br>But the bad guys around here wouldn’t look at a goat the same way that they would look at “a striking, tri-colored large dog” of 80 to 120 pounds that was bred to protect vulnerable Swiss farm families from the unemployed ex-soldiers and wandering sociopaths of former centuries. And since we already have those sorts of people in our neighborhood – and will probably see more of them in the future – we think that a dog will protect us better than either a machine or a goat(although all three do a good job of pulling carts).<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c4324768715217390522 title="comment permalink">7/4/11, 12:55 PM</a><br><br>

It's sad that the great Google glitch ate your dew point comments a while back. I thought your explanation was brilliantly clear.<br><br>It's not as swampy in Nebraska as in the Deep South, yet we do sometimes suffer major humidity problems here, as well. The summer of 2008 was a bad one. I lost a parrot that year. The pathology results were inconclusive, but the cause of death was a noncontagious respiratory condition, with aspergillosis as the most likely candidate. Our basement was very damp, and with mold beginning to visibly grow in several places. I wouldn't be surprised if our house was full of spores.<br><br>After that heartbreaking experience, I gave up and bought a dehumidifier. I run it only on days when the dew point is high enough that I begin to see condensation. It consumes almost as much electricity as a refrigerator. But that's the tradeoff I've made, for now, in exchange for not using much air conditioning. Our three remaining parrots (all older birds, adopted from rehome and rescue situations) have thankfully not become "canaries in a coal mine" for poor air quality in our home.<br><br>I wish there was a better solution.

I've sometimes thought that media, electronic games and the internet are the drugs we use to numb ourselves to the point that we don't have to notice just how late it's gotten and how cold the wind has become. <br><br>DIYer, already there. When Blogger becomes pay-to-play, as it will eventually, or when restrictions of other sorts start narrowing down the internet, I'll shift to my own website for a while, as a transitional measure, while making arrangements to take the Report into the world of print media. Exactly how that latter works will depend on other details -- it may be a monthly column in an existing magazine, or it may be an independent newsletter with a modest subscription cost. I'll keep the list posted as that point comes closer. <br><br>Steve, that's good to hear. <br><br>Kate, there's a fine line to tread with regard to suggestions that "X is not going to happen." You're quite right that it can be an excuse for inaction, or for that matter a justification for doomer porn of various kinds. Still, it's fair to say that if something has been tried, and tried, and tried again, and has failed every time, holding it up yet again as a viable option for the present is probably not a good idea. <br><br>Jason, thanks for the heads up. That's very much worth hearing. <br><br>Tracy, I don't know how much use it will be in hot weather, but cast iron woodstoves suck moisture out of the air -- to the extent that in winter, a lot of people keep a kettle of water on the stove all the time to keep the air from becoming too dry. I'll keep an eye out for other methods. <br><br>Harriet, er, if you can tell me where to find that "tremendous political will of the people," I'd be glad to hear it. What I see is a very small number of people who are willing to admit that there's a problem at all, and a small fraction of that fraction willing to do something about it, while the rest insist that everything's just fine. While you're waiting for the appearance of the ideal society you've sketched out, by the way, won't you consider taking the time to insulate and weatherstrip your home, plant a vegetable garden, and decrease the burden you place on the living Earth? That way, whether or not Utopia shows up, you'll have done some measurable good...<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c1579661029704408239 title="comment permalink">7/5/11, 2:00 PM</a><br><br>

In practice? In Russia it paved the way for Lenin, in Spain for Franco, in Germany for Hitler...I could go on. As Edmund Butrke pointed out very sensibly a long time ago, it's remarkable how often the idealized futures held up as goals by ideologues give way to their exact opposite in practice."<br><br>I saw this a few days ago, and wanted to come back to it. It is rather important, both in the specific and the general point. A large and significant number of the people who are now doing the deep and important work at the heart of your writings here were inspired directly by theoretical anarchism and called themselves anarchists during a dramatic revival of the ideology that occurred around 2000. As a result anarchist thought has had a major direct and indirect influence on every major social movement the left has been willing to associate with since then, including permaculture, peak oil, and Transition, and many of their associated outer circles of activity. I was one of those activists, and I still occasionally use the term today, though increasingly less often. In fact I do still believe that the values and ideals and arguments raised by anarchism such as mutual aid, non-coercion, anti-oppression and anti-fascism are valuable and enduring, and of relevance to a society in decline, and I am loathe to throw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak, even as I have drifted away from organized anarchist circles and their attendant pathos and flaws.<br><br>Anarchists often argue that their presence in Russia, Spain, and other countries during periods of fascist ascendence is evidence of their relative strength in the face of tyranny, when compared to more liberal opposition parties. No association is ever drawn between their presence and the success of such fascist parties, even defensively, as if the idea never even occurred to anyone, so it caught my interest with some surprise. I would love to see you expound on that point, as I think it would not only be relevant to our own current national political stew, it would also be of interest to a large number of readers who are coming from the same perspective as myself.<br><br><a href=how-not-to-play-game_500.html#c8244049022543965625 title="comment permalink">7/8/11, 2:43 PM</a><br><br>
