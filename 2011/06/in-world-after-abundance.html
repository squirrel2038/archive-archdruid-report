Over the past month or so the essays on this blog have veered away from the details of appropriate tech into a discussion of some of the reasons why this kind of tech is, in fact, appropriate as a response to the predicament of industrial society. That was a necessary diversion, since a great many of the narratives that cluster around that crisis just now tend to evade the necessity of change on the level of individual lifestyles. The roots of that evasion had to be explored in order to show that change on that level is exactly what can’t be avoided by any serious response to the crisis of our time.<br><br>Still, if it’s going to do any good, that awareness has to be paired with something more than a vague sense that action is necessary. Talk, as Zen masters are fond of saying, does not boil the rice; in the rather more formal language of the traditions of Western esotericism where I received a good deal of my training, the planes of being are discrete and not continuous, which means in practice that even the clearest sense of how we collectively backed ourselves into the present mess isn’t going to bring in food from the garden, keep warmth from leaking out of the house on a cold winter night, or provide a modest amount of electricity for those bits of modern or not-quite-modern technology that will still make sense, and still yield benefits, in the world after abundance.<br><br>That last phrase is the crucial one. In the future ahead of us, the extravagant habits of the recent past and the present will no longer be an option. Those habits include most of what people in the industrial world nowadays like to consider the basic amenities of a normal lifestyle, or even the necessities of life. An unwillingness to take a hard look at the assumptions underlying our current notion of what a normal lifestyle comprises has driven a certain amount of wishful thinking, and roughly the same amount of unnecessary dread, among those who have begun to grapple with the challenges ahead of us.<br><br>One of the best examples I can think of is provided by the ubiquitous wall sockets that, in nearly every home in the industrial world, provide as much electric current on demand as the residents want and can pay for. In most circles these days, when conversations turn to the prospects of energy for the future, the belief that the only possible way to use electricity is to keep uninterrupted power flowing to those sockets is very nearly as sacrosanct as the belief that the only possible way to handle transportation is to find some way to keep hundreds of millions of private cars fueled with as much ethanol, or biodiesel, or electricity, or what have you, as their drivers can afford. Both these beliefs take the temporary habits of an age of excess and treat them as necessities, and both of them box our collective imagination into a futile quest to sustain the unsustainable instead of looking at other options that are well within reach even this late in the game.<br><br>The sheer inefficiency of today’s habits of electrical generation, distribution, and use is rarely recognized. Behind those wall sockets lies what is very probably the world’s largest single system of infrastructure, an immense network linking huge power plants and end users via a crazy spiderweb of transmission lines covering whole continents. To keep electricity in those lines, vast amounts of fuel are burnt every day to generate heat, which produces steam, which drives turbines, which turn generators, which put voltage onto the lines; at each of these transformations of energy from one form to another, the laws of thermodynamics take their toll, and as a result only about a third of the potential energy in the fuel finds its way to the wall socket. Losses to entropy of the same order of magnitude also take place when electricity is generated by other means – hydroelectricity, wind power or what have you – because of parallel limits hardwired into the laws of physics.<br><br>When the resulting current comes out of the wall sockets, in turn, equivalent losses take place on the other end. Most electricity in today’s industrial societies gets turned into light, heat, or mechanical motion at its end use, and each of these transformations involves unavoidable inefficiencies. Furthermore, a very large fraction of today’s end uses of electricity are things that could be done just as well without it, with the application of a little ordinary muscle power or some other readily available energy source. That’s not even counting the gigawatts that go into lighting, cooling and heating unoccupied rooms, keeping electronic devices on unnecessary standby, drowning out the stars with light pollution, and, well, let’s not even start talking about Wii.<br><br>Having an energy system geared to so grandiose a level of excess seemed to make sense in the days when fossil fuels were cheap and abundant. Quite a few absurd things seemed to make sense in those days, and even when they no longer make any sense at all, the habits of that brief interval continue to dominate contemporary thought to an embarrassing degree. Notice how our economic system, as well as nearly all economists, still act as though replacing human labor with fossil fuel-derived energy is always a good idea, even at a time when unemployment is pandemic and the cost of energy is a rising burden on economies around the world.<br><br>The same fixation on maintaining the extravagant habits of the recent past still holds most discussions of energy hostage. Every source of electrical power these days is measured against the yardstick of whether it could provide enough cheap, abundant, reliable, continuous power to keep our existing electrical grids running. Proponents of each of the various contenders trot out an assortment of canned studies insisting that their preferred energy technology can do just that, while challenging competing systems with equally canned studies that insist that no other option will work.<br><br>Given the billions of dollars that have already been paid out to the winners in these competitions, and the trillions more that will likely follow, this sort of propaganda dolled up in scientific drag will most likely continue to be standard practice until the money and other resources for grandiose projects simply aren’t there any more. Meanwhile, there’s really no way to be sure in advance that any of the options can keep the grids running, and if there is, the chance that the one that ends up clawing its way to the top of the heap in the political free-for-all now under way will just happen to be one that will do the trick is not exactly something on which I’d choose to bet.<br><br>The difficulty here is that most current conversations about the future of energy are trying to figure out an answer without first making sure that what’s being asked is the right question. “How can we keep an electrical grid designed around the unquestioned availability of cheap abundant energy?” is the obvious question, and it’s also the wrong one. The right question – the question that we should be asking – is something more like “How much electricity can we count on having in a future after fossil fuels, and what are the best ways to produce, distribute, and use it?” That question has hardly been asked at all. It’s high time to remedy that omission.<br><br>There are many reasons for thinking, in fact, that trying to maintain an electrical grid on a regional or national scale in a future of scarce energy is a fool’s game. To run a large-scale grid of the sort currently in use, you need to be able to produce huge amounts of power every second of every day. It’s very difficult to get that much power that reliably by any means other than burning a lot of fossil fuels, either directly – say, in a coal- or gas-fired power plant – or indirectly. Tot up the total energy content of the fossil fuels needed to mine and refine uranium and urn it into fuel rods, to build, maintain, and decommission a nuclear reactor, to deal with the short-term and long-term waste, and to account for a share of the energy cost of the inevitable accidents, for example, and you’ll have a sense of the scale of the energy subsidies from fossil fuels that prop up nuclear power; do the same math for today’s giant wind turbines, and a similar realization is in store. Lacking these subsidies, it’s probably a safe bet that nuclear reactors and giant wind turbines can’t be built or maintained at all.<br><br>Still, an important point is generally missed here. Gigawatts of power are necessary for an electrical power grid. They aren’t necessary for any one of the homes and small businesses that make up the great numerical majority of end users. Get rid of the pointless excess that dominates our current approach to energy, and limit your use of electricity to the things it actually does better than other readily available energy sources, and a 12 volt circuit at very modest wattage is very often all you need. Powering a 12 volt circuit at modest wattage is child’s play, and can be done by any of a baker’s dozen or so of readily accessible technologies that can be built, maintained, and used by any moderately skilled handyperson.<br><br>Equally, having all that power on call every second of every day is necessary for an electrical grid of the modern kind. It’s not actually necessary for homes and small businesses. Again, get rid of social habits that amount to wasting energy for the sake of wasting energy, and it’s not that hard to live with an intermittent electrical supply, either by using electricity whenever it happens to be available and not otherwise, or by using batteries to store up current for a short time until you need it.<br><br>Seventy and eighty years ago, this latter was standard practice in a great many American homes. One of my vintage radio textbooks, A. and M. Marcus’ excellent <i>Elements of Radio</i>, dates from those days. At that time radio was the hot new technology, and even out in farm country, where rural electrification took its sweet time to arrive, most families who could scrape together the cash had a radio in the parlor, linking them to news, music, and other cultural resources from hundreds of miles away. Where did they get the power? Batteries, two of them per radio: an A battery to power the filaments on the vacuum tubes and a B battery to provide the working current. The A battery needed frequent recharging, and wind power was among the options for that; the iconic and ubiquitous windmills of rural America three quarters of a century ago had plenty of uses, and as often as not, that was one of them.<br><br>Long before electrical grids extended out of America’s urban cores, in fact, it was fairly common for households elsewhere in the country to have a modest amount of electricity to hand. There are a few things electricity does more efficently than any other form of energy – radio, broadcast or two-way; other electronic devices such as the phonograph; safe, smokeless lighting for the parlor and the kitchen for a few hours after sunset – and those were what people at that time did with electricity. (Nowadays a well-insulated refrigerator and the pump for a closed-loop active solar water heater might be worth adding to the same list.) Those things that electricity only does inefficiently and other energy sources do well – for example, providing diffuse heat or high-torque mechanical energy – people did by other means. Fairly often, those other means required a certain amount of muscle power, but that’s an inevitable reality of life in a world after abundance.<br><br>The distinction between those things electricity does efficiently, and those things that it doesn’t, is as important to keep in mind as it’s commonly neglected. Kris de Decker, in <a href=http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/05/bike-powered-electricity-generators.html>a recent and useful article</a> on pedal powered technologies in <i>Low-tech Magazine</i>, has done a good job of mapping out the issues involved. He points out that most pedal power devices currently on the market use the back wheel of a bicycle to run a generator, and then use the electricity produced by the generator to do something. For most uses, this is hopelessly inefficient, since every transformation of energy from one form to another involves losses to entropy which can be saved by leaving the energy in its original form. How serious are the losses? Enough that you’ll be pedaling two to three times as long to do the same task with electricity as you would if the bicycle’s mechanical power did it directly.<br><br>If you want to power a blender to make yourself margaritas on hot summer days, for example, it’s a substantial waste of energy – your energy, expressed in sweat and tired muscles – to hook your bicycle to a generator and wire up the generator to the motor that drives the blender. The more efficient option is to use the mechanical motion of the bicycle wheel to spin the blender blades directly; there are still losses to entropy, of course, but they’re a small fraction of what they would be if you stick a generator and motor in the middle where they’re not needed.<br><br>The same principle applies to a great many other things that are currently done by means of electricity. Regular readers of this blog will readily be able to think of another example, since I’ve discussed more than once the misunderstandings that bedevil solar energy. They come from the same set of blinders as the notion that pedal power ought to be used to generate electricity, rather than being used to drive the mechanical motion a great deal of today’s electricity is used to drive. Sunlight can be turned into electricity on a small scale in several different ways; none of them are very efficient, and they’re all intermitted and difficult to scale up, but several are quite good enough to drive the sort of small-scale 12 volt system discussed here if you’ve got a good southern exposure. What sunlight does with great efficiency, on the other hand, is convert itself to diffuse heat – the sort of heat that will warm a room, heat a bath, or bake a loaf of bread in a solar oven. When planning for solar energy, in other words, it’s best to do as much as possible with the diffuse heat sunlight provides so readily, and convert sunlight to electricity only for the handful of uses where electricity is the only thing, or the best thing, for the job.<br><br>Apply the same logic across the board and you end up with the most probable energy system of a world after abundance: a patchwork of different energy sources and applications, right down to the level of the individual household or business. In the American households of three quarters of a century ago I mentioned earlier in this post, that was perfectly normal; the radio ran off the A and B batteries, the stove was powered by wood from the woodlot, two lamps in the parlor ran off batteries charged by the windmill while the rest burnt kerosene, the sewing machine ran off a foot-operated treadle, the water was pumped by the windmill and heated by the sun – yes, solar water heaters were hugely popular in the 1920s, especially but not only in the Sun Belt. One consequence of this crazy quilt of energy options is that if something disrupted access to any one source of energy, the rest of the household chugged on unaffected. Compare that to the electricity-dependent household of the present, where a blackout renders the whole household inoperable and quite possibly unlivable.<br><br>The crucial point to take away from all this, though, is that expectations formed by the extravagance of the recent past are not a useful guide to the best options available to us in the post-peak future. It’s a safe bet, of course, that plenty of resources will be thrown down a dizzying assortment of ratholes in the attempt to keep the infrastructure of the age of abundance up and running even as the abundance itself trickles away. Long after private cars have stopped making any kind of economic sense, for example, what’s left of the American economy will still be being jiggered and poked in an attempt to keep some mummified simulacrum of an auto industry propped up in its corner, and no doubt similar efforts will be made to support the big regional grids even when the impact of shutting them down would be less of an economic burden than the cost of keeping them going. That’s why it’s all the more crucial for individuals, families, and community groups to start shifting over to the habits of energy use that will make sense in the world after abundance, to work through the learning curve and develop the skills and technologies that will be there to pick up the pieces when the legacy technologies of our fading age of excess finally grind to a halt.

I noticed that its basement had a bank of 12V batteries. When I asked, the guide said that the home had a diesel generator, which the family would run for 20-30 minutes per day. This was a sufficient charge for the batteries that it provided for the household's electric needs.<br><br>Moving forward in time, I had a good friend who was a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering back in the late 80's, and whose research was into the stability of the grid.

In terms of watt-hours, small appliances like a blender, toaster, even my electric grinder, chop saw, table saw, and my wife's hair dryer are doable. We use the microwave every day. Good management of a power source is the same as good management of a food source, water source, or money. Mismangement results in going without for a time. Sawing too much lumber this afternoon may result in no window fan tonight. But, unlike money, aquiring and storing energy requires only a little active participation on our part (firewood excepted). <br><br>While modern off-grid systems are programable (our inverters and controllers will begin shutting things off if the voltage gets below setpoints), and I have meters and gauges, including computerized data logging, most of the time the simple voltage and amp meters tell us what we need to know. This all started with three salvaged 75 watt PV panels, two golf cart batteries and an RV.<br><br>I gotta go vacuum the kitchen before bedtime. Sweeping stirs up too much dust.

More effort and research into the possibilities of pedal power are needed and should yield very useful results.<br><br>(I myself immediately think that more could be done with gearing and multi-person power. Couldn't the dozen or so people pedalling on the pictured electrical generator be able, through a system of gears, to combine their effort to move a very large flywheel that would generate electricity better, for instance? )<br><br>Coming home from my job at the pedal-powered furniture-making factory to a steaming bowl of solar-oven chili, a local beer brewed with bellows water-powered by the Spring thaw on the nearby river, served cool from the cellar, chilled from the trickle-charged fridge, or frosty from the icehouse, and the wife reminding me that the wind's been dead so I better hook the thermoelectric generator up to the masonry stove if I want to listen to the game on the radio and still have the juice to run the little worklight above my drafting table in my workshop in the old garage... that all sounds pretty darn good right now, actually!<br><br>If the world can contain a pedal-powered algae formation processor, then my dream may just come true. ;)<br><br>-Matt.<br><br><a href=#c5899281930182403486 title="comment permalink">6/1/11, 10:01 PM</a><br><br>

And part of that age of abundance infrastructure is in the houses themselves.<br><br>I've spent the last few years totally gutting and rehabbing our two adjacent old houses.<br><br>The older of the two is about 150 years old. Originally, the owners were probably using kerosene lamps for lighting. A couple of decades later, they brought in gas lighting, because I found the old gas lines routed to the center of the ceilings, but they obviously hadn't been installed when the house was first built. A couple of decades after that, they installed knob-and-tube electrical - which is now totally frayed and a fire hazard, so I'm installing non-metallic sheathed cable that should last about a century.<br><br>The other house is about 120 years old, and the four bedrooms had a grand total of four electrical outlets: two in one bedroom, one each in two other bedrooms, and none at all in the fourth bedroom. <br><br>So I've been rewiring with outlets every twelve feet per Code, etc. <br><br>But my wife and I are using only a small fraction of the outlets that I've installed. <br><br>In twenty or thirty years, when we're dead and gone, the people who replace us probably won't use them, either, because they won't have access to cheap energy.<br><br>So today I've been crawling around in a hot, dusty old attic, pulling cobwebs out of what's left of my hair, running hundreds and hundreds of feet of expensive copper cable, thinking to myself "I'm spending massive amounts of time and money to install outlets that nobody is ever going to use - just to bring this old house up to Code. Is this rational?"<br><br><a href=#c6867283299989490893 title="comment permalink">6/1/11, 10:14 PM</a><br><br>

In the real world, they have surely been smoking.<br><br>The only people who make these sorts of claims don't live with solar power. Like Ghung, I'm off the grid and live with the limitations of solar every day. The other crazy thing that people forget is that the sun don't shine at night and long lasting batteries are really heavy and expensive.<br><br>I love solar energy, but there's just no way the average McMansion can power all of it's current users perceived needs. It's not possible at all without having access to unlimited resources. I often laugh to myself when I see these huge houses with a small 1kWh solar power system on their roof. What a waste of time - it's a feel good gesture.<br><br>What's worse about it too, is that the occupants of these places often use more electricity than the average house because they have this sense of entitlement from having the small solar power system on their roof. Bah!<br><br>The rural areas where the last to be connected up to the national electricity grid. It's all going to unwind as natural disasters strike. The first thing that happens in a natural disaster is that the electricity grid gets knocked out either deliberately or otherwise. The question is, in an era of declining resources will it get reconnected? I'm not so sure.<br><br>Over here some of the worst bushfires are caused by the electricity grid itself. Imagine this, hot windy days with lots of households turning on airconditioning. As the current in the cables increases, the cable sags (yes wire expands when heated). The cable then either earths out and sparks or the heat causes nearby eucalyptus trees which may be touching the cables to ignite. It's the wrong day for such an event... The result massive bush fires.<br><br>Look up the Black Saturday bushfires in February 2009 on Wikipedia to get an idea of where it can go. Nasty. Anyway, after this fire, people got together and started a class action against the electricity distribution company for the Kilmore fire. I keep telling people around here that if that action is successful, the outcome will be that they will shut down the grid to bush areas on those high risk days. People always look at me in disbelief when I tell them this. It's like I'm speaking another language... Some have even mentioned essential services legislation, like that would override vested commercial interests...<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c7045389978773732588 title="comment permalink">6/2/11, 2:37 AM</a><br><br>

You can make a big list of industrial or free time activity, like restaurants, factories, air condtioning, etc. that will disappear without a centralized electricity system so collapse ill come to mass urban existence and population will go down dramatically as oil generators won't be supplied with oil. <br><br>So what you are saying will be true for the few but situation in NYC, Karachi Tokyo, London, Lagos will be different. Since I was offline for half a year you probably covered this topic. This is the reason that so much rides on keeping the current grid up. Because the FIRE economy depends on it. Growth comes through easy energy so people can buy more electronic toys. Economic collapse will lead to war for the few remaining resources due to the media propagated "truth" that growth is good. <br><br>I know you are just writing for us few who are trying to save ourselves but as no man is an island, I suspect everyone will get caught up in the big crisis (war, universal draft, rationing, martial law, closed borders, travel restrictions, media and communications restrictions) and only after grid collapses will the few scrape out some old techniques with a bit of ingenuity and the internet community won't exist to spread these ideas around. <br><br>So a clear break will occur.

Remember that the 19.4 kwh includes ongoing usage, not just power to batteries: powering the fridge, a load of laundry, etc. Our battery bank is @44kwh storage. Yesterday's production was actually fairly good for a very hot, hazy day - stifling high pressure, here in the SE US. As I mentioned last week, I built (3 of 4) our trackers from old C-band satellite dish mounts. See them <a href=http://i1001.photobucket.com/albums/af140/Ghung/pvwaterstuff/panels01.jpg rel=nofollow>here</a>. Tracking has increased our panel's output significantly, ~ 20%-40%. depending on season. Particularly useful in winter. <br><br>The sat dish mounts (all salvaged) have 24vdc actuators, same as our system, so the tracking arrays are self-powered. I order the electronics from a guy in BC, about $140 US per. I originally used a simple reversing switch to re-aim the arrays a few times a day. Having tiltable/adjustable arrays can greatly improve output. One school of thought is that monies are better spent on more PV panels, though this also requires more BOS (balance of system) stuff, and since I built my trackers mostly from junk .....<br><br>Regarding microwaves, et al, my point was this:<br><br>While energy intensive, these things are used for very short periods. A 1200 watt microwave used 5 minutes a day at full power uses 0.1 kwh. A blender used 1 min/day will be negligible. All are one dedicated switches. <br><br>We decided not to throw out the babies with the bathwater until we have to. These, of course, are discretionary uses, depending on battery/solar conditions.<br><br>Life calls, back later.

I’m half way through your recent book and enjoying it also. Your assessment of our predicament at the systemic level is compelling. I expect the system will continue to lumber along for as long as it possibly can, until it can’t. So we use the time available to build skills and prepare. <br><br>I’m finding these posts on energy generation and management helpful, but they are highlighting for me an important challenge with this whole program of lifestyle change – the point at which I cross into full time/dedicated pursuit of a new style of life. You can make a lot of changes – use less, garden extensively, tend chickens, travel differently, etc – while still holding down a job and appearing to your neighbors and children to be roughly within the norm. I really want to spend more time on these more ambitious projects, like domestic energy generation, solar heating, etc, but I am running out of hours in the day. It occurs to me that the average owner of a 1900 era rural household, with a basement full of 12v batteries and a garden full of produce, probably spent most of their time at home, working on the homestead and tinkering in the basement, and didn’t have to commute to a cubicle someplace. So that decision is coming for me, sometime soon I think. That will put a new spin on the whole work/life balance thing.<br><br><a href=#c906068694363296805 title="comment permalink">6/2/11, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

Is the added complexity of the active set-up really a good idea? It means more maintenance, higher likelihood of failure, and lower chance of being able to find/afford appropriate replacement parts or even anti-freeze in resource constrained future. <br><br>What if a dual set-up was used instead, where a passive thermosiphon solar water heater was used whenever temperatures were above freezing, but then yet another passive thermosiphon system, this one running through the wood stove, heated water in the winter. It wouldn't be wasted heat, as long as water, in say a bathtub, wasn't allowed to drain until it had reached room temperature. In fact, the tank would act as a good thermal mass and a means of tranferring heat from the stove on the first floor to the second floor (although admittedly this would be a less desirable setup in a one story house). This also depends on having a good supply of wood, of course, but that is one of the more likely home heating options in the winter anyway, and it is possible to build or buy wood stoves with excellent efficiency.<br><br><a href=#c5979402570129198911 title="comment permalink">6/2/11, 7:46 AM</a><br><br>

The threat of being shot would seem a sensible deterrent to me, provided that the thieves are not so desperate as to be beyond any kind of reason. So IMO, firearms clearly are as sensible a precaution as a rainwater catchment system. <br><br>Think: shotgun. Ideally, it would never be fired. Walking your property with a shotgun in plain sight would seem a good way to increase that probability.<br><br>After all, what we are talking about is taking personal responsibility for oneself as much as possible - in terms of providing for one's food, water, energy needs. I hardly see it as consistent with this philosophy, then, to assert we should outsource all responsibility for security needs.<br><br>This applies at the individual level, of course - IMO, a community which is known to be well armed and to look after its own, will have improved chances at pre-emptively warning off those who would seek to steal from or otherwise assault its members. This presupposes that such a community did not manifest anything like the current levels of social inequity, nor the (not unrelated) current levels of hype-militarized law enforcement.<br><br>In this view, firearms are the second line of defense, whereas community building, in terms of doing one's best to ensure an absence of desperation, is the first.<br><br>to be continued...<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=#c1370454092364072719 title="comment permalink">6/2/11, 8:14 AM</a><br><br>

They maintain their current existence by stealing, after all, and there's every reason to think that will become, at least in the initial stages, more egregious when things begin to crumble.<br><br>Nationalization (or selective "re-privatization" to the well connected) of organic farms, for example, seems a plausible action to me. Also, 'food taxes' - wherein the State confiscates much of the food private citizens grow for themselves (much as, today, they confiscate much of the monetary fruits of our labors via withholding and income taxes) is also eminently plausible. It would be no surprise that bureaucrats get first dibs on such food. History is replete with such examples.<br><br>After all, look at today's society and you will see plenty of "those who have not prepared" for even the vicissitudes of our current existence - they turn to government to get 'their share' - why should this change going forward? Note that I am not passing judgment on these folk - many have been put explicitly in this position by governmental policies. As Harry Browne once said: "the government breaks your leg, hands you a crutch, and says: see? if not for me, you wouldn't be able to walk.'<br><br>Government at federal and state levels is seen by many in today's society (indefensibly, I would assert) as the 'appropriate' agency of forced redistribution of wealth - I'd imagine that as wealth declines across the board, and food stores come to represent wealth, this harmful sensibility will continue to manifest in ways quite detrimental to the average Jane and Joe, at least for a time. Just one more legacy of our current misguided system.<br><br>I guess the point I'm making is: you first have to figure out from whom you are protecting your goods before you can determine the most sensible means of protecting them. The threat will change over time as conditions change. <br><br>So from this standpoint, not only does it make sense to be prepared from the individual and community levels, but also perhaps vital to engage with local governance entities to accomplish things like this:<br><br>http://www.ftcldf.org/Third-Maine-Town-Passes-Landmark-Local-Food-Ordinance.htm<br><br>Power to the people indeed...<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=#c2241396337623307718 title="comment permalink">6/2/11, 8:14 AM</a><br><br>

I have a few power tools, but rarely use them; the more precise handling and finer work that hand tools provide is worth more to me than rushing through the job. <br><br>Zach, thanks for the link! Using an engine for a short time every day to charge batteries is another potentially good option -- I'll be talking about some of those next week. As for the grid, bingo -- it's a potential source of drastic problems that very few people are taking into account right now. <br><br>GHung, that's an option, at least while the economy of abundance still churns out the necessary hardware, but I prefer to look a little further down the track. There are very nice hand cranked blenders available from Amish and Mennonite stores, too, you know!<br><br>Matt, it does sound pretty good, doesn't it? <i>Now get out there and make it happen</i>. Goethe's dictum -- "Begin it now!" -- is worth applying here. <br><br>Don, an excellent point. Still, remember that a few decades from now, you can pull all that wire out of the conduits and either sell it for a nice premium, or use it to run current in from your thermoelectric generator to your batteries!<br><br>Kieran, or you can put down the sweatshop-manufactured electronic pseudo-badminton racket, turn off the machine, step out into the back yard, set up a badminton net, invite some friends over and get your exercise and social interaction in the real world...<br><br>Ruben, maybe it's a west coast thing; the margaritas I'm used to drinking are blended. As for your job suggestion, though, you're spot on; we'll be discussing careers in repurposing old technology in a post in the fairly near future.<br><br>KWohlmut, thank you! That's delectable -- and all too true. <br><br>Sophie, good! But they're hardly limited to festivals; one would work well in restaurants, bars, or any other place where the blender gets used a lot. For less intensive use, a hand cranked model is probably more economical. <br><br>Stephen, true enough! The one advantage of electricity for a refrigerator pump is that it's very easy to switch it on and off instantly via a thermostat; there are other forms of energy that share that advantage, but most have a much slower response time, which is a problem for refrigeration. <br><br>Ray, thanks for the links!<br><br>Chris, that's another good reason to move toward home-generated power. Thanks for the link to your paper -- I trust somebody will get that posted to the <a href=http://www.greenwizards.org rel=nofollow>Green Wizards forum</a>.<br><br>Phil, thank you, but I don't have an iPlayer, and my creaky old internet computer doesn't handle modern media well. <br><br>Surfer, notice that you're leaving out the entire range of settlement between rural areas and New York City -- and it's between those two extremes that most people live.

Do get your 13 year old on it; once the 13 year olds of the world get hooked on Green Wizard geekery, amazing things will follow. <br><br>Lee, many thanks!<br><br>Rialian, standard practice in most parts of America three quarters of a century ago was to use wind power to pump water from deep wells up into a cistern. If you've got a decent site for a windmill, you're good to go -- it's a mature, efficient, and very sturdy technology. <br><br>Fleecenik, that's a great anecdote. Thank you. <br><br>Z, a pedal powered washing machine should be a piece of cake. If I recall correctly, in fact, there were prototypes built during the Seventies. <br><br>Ventriloquist, I deliberately avoid that subject on this blog. Very few Americans on any side of the gun debate are entirely rational about the subject; when it comes up, things quickly polarize between people who are terrified of guns and people who have made a fetish out of them, and it doesn't take long for shouting to start and communication to stop. That doesn't further the purposes of this blog, and of course there are plenty of other places to talk about guns and home defense online if that's what you want to do. <br><br>Sixbears, excellent. You get today's gold star for realism. That's exactly how infrastructure goes down in the real world -- a chunk at a time, starting at the geographical and economic fringes and gradually working inward from there. <br><br>Edde, good to hear about the recumbent pedal power project! I'm always up for speaking gigs, and my rates are reasonable, but I'll pass on the (b/tr)ike and I'll quibble hard about your comment that it would make short distance travel more fun. As a lifelong walker, I've come to delight in traveling at a human pace: slow enough that swallows dance around me as I walk through the big vacant lot on the way to the grocery store, slow enough to pay attention to the wild herbs and the subtle changes as the seasons turn, but quite fast enough to get me where I need to go in good time. <br><br>JJ, excellent. I've found the same things regarding hand tools -- and you're quite right that there are some remarkable things out there if you know where to look. <br><br>Tom, do you still have the radio? Those old vacuum tube receivers still work well; you can get replacement tubes if you need them, and -- catastrophe fans take note -- they're invulnerable to electromagnetic pulse effects, because they're much less fragile than solid state equivalents. I hope, by the way, you're sharing those brown beans with friends who garden; those old heirloom varieties are worth their weight in gold, even at gold's currently inflated prices. <br><br>Richard, that is indeed my point, and the more people who take it the right way -- as you're doing -- and get to work tinkering, the more of a safety net will be in place as the cumbersome mess of a system we've got now breaks down. <br><br>JB, that's an excellent question that deserves a longer answer than I have space for here. The short form is that you've got to start with the basics. if you want to do things with PV, for example, you need to know how electricity works, and also how to solder, test, and use simple electrical and electronic circuits -- otherwise you're stuck depending on someone else's claims of expertise, and as you've noted, that's not a good place to be. The payoff is that once you know enough to build and wire your own solar panels -- and that's not that hard to do -- you can also rebuild appliances and do a lot of other practical things most people don't have a clue how to do these days.

It's to say that the influence crosses from plane to plane through specific and limited channels. When you turn a word in your mind into finger movements on a keyboard, you've moved something from the plane of thought to that of matter, but that crosses the boundary through the specific and narrow channel of your nervous system. <br><br>Jason, many thanks for the story! As with many everyday miracles, the hard work and luck that keep the grids running may only be appreciated when they stop working.<br><br>JP, as I mentioned to Rylan, "discrete" doesn't mean "separated by an impassible barrier." Human beings are as complex as they are because they're composite entities existing on several planes at once, and the links from plane to plane even within the individual can be cumbersome and cranky!<br><br>Yupped, that's one of the issues I haven't discussed yet in this sequence of posts, but it's come up earlier. One of the crucial steps, for people who live in family groups of one kind or another, is to arrange to get at least one adult free of full time employment so that he or she can get to work in the household economy and start rebuilding that vital and neglected sector. For the foreseeable future, nearly all of us are still going to need to have some cash coming in, but the less dependent we are on money, the better, and the more working hours that can be put into noncash economies, especially but not only at home, the better off people will be. <br><br>Justin, depends on where you are. In a lot of North America, there's a fair amount of solar energy to be had during seasons when it gets below freezing at night, and in those places, having an active system pays for itself in savings on fuel -- even when the fuel in question is wood. In other areas, your approach would be quite feasible.<br><br><a href=#c7255495301256047673 title="comment permalink">6/2/11, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

An excerpt from Wikipedia:<br><br><i>"The Windup Girl is set in the 23rd century: Global Warming has raised the levels of world's oceans, carbon fuel sources have become depleted, and manually wound springs are used as energy storage devices. Biotechnology is dominant and mega corporations like AgriGen, PurCal and RedStar (called calorie companies) control food production through 'genehacked' seeds, and use bioterrorism, private armies and economic hitmen to create markets for their products. Frequent catastrophes, such as deadly and widespread plagues and illness, caused by genetically modified crops and mutant pests, ravage entire populations.

That's the reason I have a collection of things like two nice, big cross-buck saws, a human-powered plow/seed drill, plenty of hand tools including a nice brace'n bit set, saws, hand planes, even a hand pump for the cistern. I'm proficient with all of these things, and well aware of the energy (and blisters) required to use them. Prefering to use these things in times of plenty or as a hobby is also a choice, easy to make under current circumstances.<br><br>I also like belt powered stuff. I have a drill press, bench grinder, table saw and my granddaddy's vintage wood lathe, all powered by either an AC or a DC motor; my choice. They could be human powered as well.<br><br>Paula said: <i>"Sawing wood by hand takes longer, sure, but it's kind of meditative in a way. I have a feeling that once we all get used to not living the way that we are currently, we might actually learn to like it better. I like building stuff by hand, really by hand, a lot better."</i><br><br>While I agree with the gist of this, Paula assumes she'll have the time and energy. Methinks that, if she has a PV powered saw and an endless list of other chores, she'll choose to "git'er done".<br><br>My point (see my comment about throwing out the babies with the bathwater) is that, going forward, especially in what will essentially be a survival situation, any non-human energy slaves remaining and available will free up energy (calories), and time for the endless other tasks required for self-sufficiency. While total reliance on technology to perform any one task is not recommended, using anything at hand to make one's outfit more efficient <i>now</i> will be the order of the day. Small example: I have a nice hand operated coffee mill/grinder. Why use it up when I have two small electric food grinders, easily operated on PV power, which I use to grind herbs, medicinals, etc. (I make great "<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allium_tricoccum rel=nofollow>Ramp</a> Dust", BTW.) One of these is still working fine after 30 years. My mortar and pestle aggravates my arthritis, as do hand sawing, hand drilling, etc. <i>"A man has to know his limitations."</i><br><br>It's a bit like using what fossil energy remains available to build out more appropriate technology. This ain't going to be no party. I'll use (and teach my get to use) whatever is available at the time to gain and keep a sustainable foothold, and plan for when such advantages aren't available.<br><br>The blender will be reserved for making apple brandy smoothies.

An abundance of cleaner air and an abundance of quiet for a couple of examples.<br><br>I recall a few years back I was camping for the summer in the White Mountains. One night we were sitting by the fire and I was so happy and contented to be in this beautiful place with my loved ones. The sounds of the forest animals and the fire crackling.

I have still been around, reading your blog faithfully every week, but the demands of the growing season have eaten away at my internet time as of late. Anyway, it amazes me how dependant people have become – at least in their own minds anyway— on the grid for their basic ability to survive. This week of 90 degree temperatures and high humidity in Central Maryland was a perfect example of this as people appeared to be unable to thrive if not for the modern convenience of air conditioning. One would have thought that I sprouted a second head, and maybe even a set of wings when I told one of my co-workers this week that my house does not have air conditioning installed, but instead relies upon the shade from trees, as well as a low-powered attic fan to draw cooler night air in from outside during the evening. The notion that electricity on demand will always be there, just because in the very short span of modern history it always has, is a fool's folly indeed. <br><br>As I stood in my yard this week, sweating in the sun to install a drip irrigation system to my food garden, I started to think about how fulfilling it truly is to build something with one's hands, without modern electricity-based tools. When the project was complete, and after digging nearly 150' of small trenches with a shovel, the feeling of satisfaction was pretty amazing. The "modern conveniences" of daily industrial life were supposed to make things easier, but in my opinion, instead they muddy the mind and make the body feeble. Doing is the key to both physical and mental fitness, and the quicker folks realize this, I think the easier the transition to a simpler lifestyle will be. You don't need air conditioning or power tools to survive, however, a strong body and a sharp mind can permit one to thrive, even in the event that the electricity grid on which our industrial society hinges becomes unglued. <br><br>Bobby<br><br><a href=#c1780323827016251583 title="comment permalink">6/2/11, 11:59 AM</a><br><br>

I recall reading an article about life in Palm Springs before air conditioning. Since daytime temperatures in the summer could reach 120 degrees, night time temps would still be over a hundred. So the challenge was keeping the heat out. But since most houses still got unbearably hot, the solution was the "submarine"! This was a half tube of wood and sheet metal construction with a bunk inside for a bed. Canvas was then stretched over the roof. A soaker hose was placed on the ridgeline, I believe. A short time before retiring for the evening, the canvas would be drenched in water. As the water evaporated in the desert air, the "submarine" would lose 20 degrees or more, enough to make sleeping comfortable. A second drenching was often needed to keep things cool. <br>Speaking of the power grid, it should be noted that electrical vaults routinely blow themselves up, the transformers on the power poles (the big bucket things) contain flammable oil, and the cable insulators (the big ceramic jobbers on the cable) collect dust and cause electricity to arc. One simply has to experience the humm and "popping" of a main trunk line.<br>Finally, perhaps when all the noise of modern civilization has died down people will hear slightly better. Oh by the way, for those still using microwaves, look up ionizing radiation and what it does to your food. What microwaves do best is destroy the nutritional content of your food, much like tv destroys critical thinking in the brain. P.S. Has anyone heard of the SmartGrid? I read a blurb off my Rueters rss. Its supposed to be a hundreds of billions of overhaul of the electrical grid to incorporate more alternative power generation, that will supposedly save us Trillions. Not so sure, but if that's not an admission of the end of abundance, I don't know what is. P.S.S. Margaritas are definitely blended. I am in southern California just a couple hours from Mexico. Last time I was in Tiajuanna they were blended.<br><br><a href=#c1417491441582316509 title="comment permalink">6/2/11, 12:00 PM</a><br><br>

Two lines, each a thin twisted pair of copper wires, many decades old and with plenty of splices. Having worked designing products for the electric utility industry for almost 25 years, I have a fair idea what the infrastructure and equipment behind those wires looks like, and just how vulnerable it is. And much of it quite old too. System stability is indeed a big issue, especially with lots of distributed intermittent sources.<br><br>Never fear though, as the Smart Grid is coming, and it's going to make all of our technological dreams come true. Thanks to the Smart Grid we'll soon all have solar panels and wind turbines and grid ties plug-in hybrid EVs and networked appliances turning on and off at the optimum times. And thanks to the Smart Grid technology, we'll be able to smooth out all the peaks and dips so we can use almost 100% of our existing capacity all the time without having to invest in new generation. Remember that efficiency vs. resiliency trade off?<br><br>Except that's not happening, at least nowhere near as fast as proponents seem to think, and not all of the ideas will even work. Smart Grid is basically an incantation, magic words used to ward off unpleasant thoughts of having to live with less energy. Of course for many it's just a way to siphon public funds into private accounts. What will happen is that the resources to maintain that grid infrastructure, even as it is, will go away. There will be less to go around, and more of it will go towards increasingly expensive input energy, leaving less for maintenance. Someday another of those trees they stopped trimming will fall, and no one will come to fix this old dead end line on our little road – they'll just cut the wires and keep the main branch on. <br><br>Interestingly enough I'm almost finished dismantling our old oil fired heat and hot water system, and I'm installing a standard electric hot water heater. Basically I have no confidence in the future availability of any of the existing energy sources, so I'm going for minimum up front investment – for $400 I can have hot water for a few more years while the grid still works, and hopefully put my real effort into solar and/or wood fired hot water pre-heater.<br><br><a href=#c8179538958075414261 title="comment permalink">6/2/11, 12:56 PM</a><br><br>

These treadmills are modern and well built. As to the advantage of horses over tractors, just remember, tractors require more the fuel, they need parts that most of us can't manufacture, batteries and tires. Horses require hoof care, some vet care and they replace themselves. I sold both of my tractors last year and replaced them with a team of Suffolk Punch drafts and have never looked back. The Archdruid is right, decentralized power is the future not the grid that exists today.

This is one of the reasons I encourage people to start small, and work up from there as resources and opportunities permit. <br><br>Carolyn, thanks for the recommendation! I stopped enjoying science fiction about the time that cyberpunk became fashionable -- still love the older stuff, even though I don't believe in the myth of human destiny central to most of it -- but I'll consider trying Bacigalupi's book. <br><br>Tom, delighted to hear about the beans. An heirloom breed like that will still be feeding people centuries after the last molecules of the radio have gone their separate ways. <br><br>Kieran, oh, granted, there will be specialized applications for pedal powered electricity, and rock concerts are one of them! It occurs to me that if you could come up with some kind of treadle device to pick up power from all of the listeners tapping their feet and moving to the music, you could build a rock venue that would require no outside power. <br><br>Ghung, of course -- there's no one toolkit for everybody, and you have to figure out what works best for you. <br><br>Shiva, understood, but so often people use that sort of language to try to wriggle out from under the painful side of the future ahead of us -- and there will be a lot of pain in it, a lot of loss and limitation and harshness. I feel it's crucial to acknowledge that, and face up to the number of hopes and dreams that are going to die ugly deaths in the years immediately ahead of us. <br><br>Bobby, no argument there. It was nearly as sweltering up here in the mountains of western Maryland, and though I don't mention to our neighbors that we don't use air conditioning -- they already think we're weird because we don't drive -- we did just fine without. <br><br>Bruce, no question, the constant noise of industrial society is one of the things I'll miss least. <br><br>Twilight, excellent! Yes, the words "smart grid" are an incantation, and not even a very effective one. Effective magic demands a clear sense of the boundaries and connections between the planes; when you try to use incantation, unsupported by physical plane action, to deal with a problem that has deep roots on the physical plane, you're not going to get far. <br><br>Glyn, as a short term option, it might be worth trying, yes. <br><br>Brad, batteries are easy -- all you need are two different metals, a mild acid electrolyte, and a watertight container, and you've got current. Alessandro Volta made batteries in 1800, and there are some odd jars with iron and copper in them dating from 2nd century AD Mesopotamia that have been claimed, plausibly enough, as very early batteries, perhaps used for electroplating. They'll be around for the long term, so long as the knowledge necessary to make them gets preserved.<br><br><a href=#c8542563405433516053 title="comment permalink">6/2/11, 9:00 PM</a><br><br>

Rural roads and utilities are already on the chopping block; when poor urban neighborhoods start losing water and power -- not officially, you understand, it's just that repairs don't get made -- then the writing's on the wall. <br><br>Sololeum, that's certainly one option. Most of the people I'm in touch with don't have the money to rent farmland, and haven't got the skills to farm it -- yet. That's why I'm concentrating on intensive gardening on a backyard scale for now, using methods that are even more effective at building and preserving soil fertility. <br><br>Sofistek, very good. You're quite right that the question I brought up was simply a subset of the much broader question you pose. As for the Venus Project, it's well named -- they obviously don't live on the same planet as the rest of us. If they're honest, they're delusional; if they're not, it's one of the most cynical bits of political manipulation I've seen in a long time; either way, the chance that they'll follow through on those glowing promises makes a snowball in Beelzebub's back yard look like a good long term investment. <br><br>Chris, here in the US you can pick up a soldering iron and solder suitable for electrical work at any hardware store for maybe $15, and it's an easy skill to pick up -- I'm not particularly deft with my hands, and I had no trouble building a regenerative receiver as my first project after nearly a 30 year hiatus. Still, availability may be more of an issue down your way. <br><br>Greg, it all depends on what your situation is right now, and what you hope to do with it. If I had significant acreage, I'd probably have an old tractor in the barn, though I'd also be putting time into learning how to handle horses on the assumption that fuel might price itself out of my reach in a hurry, with little warning. That's the problem with using a temporary abundance of resources; if you get dependent on them -- and it's hard not to do so -- that can kill you, in the most literal of senses.<br><br><a href=#c3108331990493847252 title="comment permalink">6/2/11, 9:12 PM</a><br><br>

Of course, since that’s the background noise for us all, the challenge, as many have highlighted in this thread, is living in both worlds; making a living while also preparing for the afterlife: after everyone’s done making a killing.<br><br>And while most people are clueless behind the curve, my heart goes out to those who got a bit too far ahead, like our friend here with the prematurely postponed draft horse plan. In 5-10 years he’ll have a waiting list, but how to maintain preparations for the future local economies by paying for them in this current subsidized insanity? (oh yes, and please DO tell us the breed; Connemara’s?)<br><br>When folks ask me what tools they should own to live more sustainably, they think I’m going to say, “cross-cut saw” “scythe” and “donkey carts” and you should see the faces drop on the Prius purists when I say “chainsaw” “weed whacker” and “pick-up truck”. Huh? Well, of course, eventually you’re going to need the hand tools, and now’s a good time to collect them, perhaps practice a bit, but forget about actually using them to get any work (or income) done now. The game is still played for a while yet on oil-can rules.<br><br>Simply put, in order to have the time to do both, we must use the time-saver tools while we can. When someone can thin the woodlot and buck rounds with the chainsaw, mow the cover crop quickly with the string trimmer, and haul yet another load of manure to the compost yard, then I consider them to be far more prepared for doing all of it with hand tools, than they would be by placing some antique object de art found at some yard sale on a basement shelf and calling it “ready”. No blisters, no progress. Or, uh, adaptability, that’s it.<br><br>But if you live in the woods and don’t heat with it, live next to horses and don’t collect the fertility, or insist on a manicured lawn with tight edges, then these tools are indeed tools of the industrial empire. <br><br>Ultimately, any tool is only as good as the heart and hands behind it (and that goes for guns, too, although I suspect I should not go there out of respect for the druid’s turf). “Environmentalists” hate the bulldozer as a symbol of rapacious destruction, and lord knows examples abound. But in the hands of an old master, it can carve a perfect pond, setting the stage for many years of reinhabitory wisdom to take root downstream.<br><br>I love how an old Indian guy framed it for me a long time ago; you’ve got to lash two canoes together for this ride. In one of them, you’ve got your computer, your grid, your grocery store, and how you figure on paying for all that modern lifestyle. <br><br>And in the other canoe, your seeds, your hand tools, your skills at using them, and all the things you suspect might come in handy some day. <br><br>And while it might be difficult and cumbersome to stock and navigate that craft, there will soon be a wild set of rapids just before a fork in the river. That’s when you cut the lashings and hop in the “future canoe” and do your best to ride it out. <br><br>Even the best paddler can flip their boat; no amount of any provision is a guarantee of safe arrival. But when the roar of the rapids is behind us, we’ll be well-prepared to make a decent camp. And that’s the best we can hope for.<br><br>Because plenty of folks will take the wrong fork, and have useless stuff in their boats.<br><br><a href=#c4719103418275458515 title="comment permalink">6/3/11, 6:54 AM</a><br><br>

Either the notions of dynamic equilibrium and homeostasis are beyond their grasp, or they've intentionally omitted them. <br><br>They go even further, and insist at one point that nature - far from being characterized by balance, is in fact characterized by "chaotic instability" and that this means that self-organization - of natural systems including human systems aimed at achieving egalitarianism - is an unworkable myth.<br><br>They also make much of the idea that the limits to growth study treated humans as mere 'machines' in the systems models, and couple this to some wacky techno-hippie manifesto about rabbits and computers living together in nature in harmony as though these were equivalent concepts.<br><br>They also point out instances of over-reach among systems modeling ecologists and imply that those instances 'disprove' the entire approach of systems modeling, and that in fact systems theory has therefore been totally discredited in modern ecological circles. This is a method of criticism that seems very reminiscent of the dishonest critiques of the limits to growth study itself back in the 70s. It is also quite interesting, inasmuch as recent analyses of the limits to growth study show that we are right on track (ex: http://www.esf.edu/efb/hall/2009-05Hall0327.pdf) with many of its assertions.<br><br>In sum, the film seems willing to bend the facts and to use semantic tricks to make its point. <br><br>It's too bad, because they do raise some thought-provoking points along the way which deserve to be explored honestly.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=#c1532651010808750383 title="comment permalink">6/3/11, 7:25 AM</a><br><br>

I would like to suggest that the universe is an abundant place, always has been, and always will be. In reality, it is we who create the idea of scarcity. Perhaps we might call this time the end of materialism or the end of extravagant consumption or the end of 'me, me, me' at the expense of the earth and our fellow travelers. <br><br>Our problem, it seems to me, is that we have been so focused on the material dimension to the extent that we have forgotten what is really important. The age-old concept of duality, where I am separate from you and where I have to get mine because there may not be enough to go around, seems to be at the root of much of what we are suffering from. <br><br>Reduced to the lowest common denominator, what we suffer from is a low level of consciousness. If we were to suddenly change our level of awareness, we would see some dramatic shifting of resources from those who have much to those who have little, because when you realize that we are all connected, there is no separation.

Using dryers when the sun's shining is part of it -- and good for you for making changes in your own life in response. <br><br>Remnant, good! Yes, and we'll be talking about that in the not too distant future. <br><br>Julie, I'm familiar with the philosophy you've brought up here, and with some of the reasons why it's so popular nowadays. Just now, though, at this turn of history's wheel, I've come to think that it misstates some of the most important features of the universe of our experience. Do we create the idea of scarcity? Tell that to the young robin who hatched and fledged outside my study window; he was the only survivor of three nestlings, because there wasn't enough food to go around during a cold and rainy spring, and now he's been driven off the territory by Mom (a feral cat got Dad a month ago) because that's the way robins deal with the hard limits of resource scarcity. <br><br>The universe contains some things in abundance and some things in very limited supply. Right now, seven billion people depend for their survival on some of the things that are in short supply, and they're using them at a rate that will guarantee that in the not too distant future, there will be a lot less than seven billion people on this planet. Distributing real wealth more evenly won't stop that -- remember that a very large fraction of the "wealth" possessed by the so-called rich consists of abstractions with nothing backing them. <br><br>Given the predicament that we're in, I think it makes for a wiser philosophy to accept that limits are real, and -- as the old mystery traditions teach -- that accepting the reality of limits is not just good for us but the foundation of all human wisdom. Still, I know that that's an unpopular view these days, and I don't expect a lot of people to embrace it. <br><br>Cathy, that sounds like a great resource!<br><br><a href=#c8288949225722464443 title="comment permalink">6/3/11, 8:14 PM</a><br><br>

Whether it withers away in fits of disruption and restarts, or crashes wholesale in a cascade of mostly irreparable damage, would seem to make for some important differences in he effect of the loss upon the users. The vulnerability of the enterprise, it appears, derives both from the state of repair of the physical system hardware, as well as from a fostered and pervasive user dependence. <br><br>The very engineering of complex interdependent connected system to mitigate the risk of local disruption compounds the probability of larger scale failure. The appropriate solution to this problem is to prepare for disruption at the most local scale possible - at the level of the individual user. The more users who can tolerate an intermittent electric grid and the longer they can manage without, the more resilient the system will be overall and the longer it might remain at least partially functional. With some luck we may enjoy the relative ease of a managed and gradual diminishing of electric grid function rather than a chaotic journey through the punctuated equilibria of a system reacting to crisis, or the harsh reality of a rapid and permanent cessation of service. <br><br>Though experience is gained of necessity when electric service is interrupted - I'm thinking that, excepting the off-grid pioneers among the readership, planned practice of the contingency for the purpose of noting weakness would be a wizardly-worthy enterprise.<br><br><a href=#c586491718131268495 title="comment permalink">6/3/11, 8:45 PM</a><br><br>

The prospect of scarcity in the future gives an urgency to it, but many of the changes would be good for us in so many ways even in the times of plenty. There is something that is just wrong about living fat, dumb and with the illusion of happiness. Even before the focus on peak everything it seems, thoughtful people were questioning the emptiness of endless consumption. <br><br>One of my favorites of the ancient stoics is Epictetus. In his slim volume, the Enchiridion, he brings home the point of worrying about the things you can control. One can not control the actions or the attitudes of others, especially when they don't want to change. Unfortunately for some of us, those others who don't want to change are our own family members or others who are close to us. This leads to some difficult moments even in the times of plenty. <br><br>One finds oneself trying to be thrifty, simplify, and use less, while those in the same household just don't get it. What's going to happen when times get really hard? I can see the work and preparations of an individual becoming overwhelmed by those close to him. <br><br>Consider this scenario: We become increasingly independent in our own food production and manage to get by from the fruits of our labor and our foresight. Now what are we to do if our teenager invites hungry friends over for a meal. This could quickly turn into something that is unsustainable. These are people who we care about and it would be hard to refuse them. This is probably as likely or even more likely than the scenario of roaming bandits. <br><br>One person or one family doing well among others who failed to adapt is going to lead to lots of unpleasant situations. This may tie into the advice to include community building in our preparations. It is making me ask myself some hard questions about my values.

The outer world is always a reflection of the cumulative consciousness of humanity. Nature suffers because of our choices. Everything is affected by our level of development and consciousness from weather patterns to seismic activity. Our current level of consciousness has gotten us into our current experience and I believe that we reap what we sow. I also think that by experiencing scarcity we have the opportunity to learn just what happens when we live out of balance with nature. Scarcity is a great motivator. I do believe that there are motivations higher on the consciousness level, however, than scarcity.

Right now, we’re easily tricked into thinking this way, because we all are supposed to have our own incomes, our own bank accounts, our own favorite grocery store, etc. But the household economy is not bounded by its own backyard, it weaves among and through all those neighbors.<br><br>When those teenagers come over, you absolutely must feed them your very best. After all, by then they’ll be using more than their little thumb muscles on a keypad, and will probably have been helping with the haying all morning, anyway. You want them to be thrilled by your meals, because you want them to feel like they owe you something. And they will, gladly. Manipulation? No, reciprocity. In modern corrals, this has been re-branded “the gift economy” and it’s a real mind-bender for the retail-impaired.<br><br>Say you’ve planned on growing all your own potatoes. Of course, you plant a little extra in case the gophers get too many, you know, always build in a little buffer. Barring complete disaster, you could well end up with more spuds than you need, and the surplus is tradable for whatever your neighbors have that you do not; something fished, something hunted, something smuggled by their cousin, etc. <br><br>One family doing well by its household economy cannot help but help the others nearby, which alleviates the potential for unpleasant situations. Your neighbors are your allies, your eyes in the night, the ones you can count on to watch your back. They become this through your generosity in feeding them. And vice versa is the whole point. Feed One Another.<br><br>And yes, “alleviate” is admittedly far from “removed”. Many a person will become unhinged from their moral bearings and team up with those who never had any to begin with, and all kinds of havoc is entirely likely. Responses will also tug on those same behavioral moorings. <br><br>Protecting farm and family from outliers is old business that is simply part of the game we haven’t had to play individually for a long time. Now is the time to ponder the whole package, pack up the smiley face, and start cooking the hybrid neighborhood watch food club. It’s not enough to just know your farmer, you’ve got to LOVE your farmer! <br><br>Now for the previous poster wandering around the perimeter with a shotgun, I have only two words: rock salt. For those who want to make a profound, but non-lethal impression, like many Korean shop owners in the LA riots, simply having a sign You Loot We Shoot was enough to keep their storefront windows intact. Similar strategies could well become necessary.<br><br>My Buddhist friends cringe at my new definition of compassion: Come to my door in the daytime, you’ll be fed. Come over my fence at night, you’ll be shot. Kinda harsh, yes, as I expect these times to become. Building perimeters of safety wider and wider through the neighborhood is perhaps as significant as building the topsoil upon which it stands.<br><br>Perhaps this doesn’t pass as “spiritual preparation” although it may bear greater fruits than much of what passes for a Practice these days; often merely the recantation of personal affirmations of mental safety, and the concurrent expectation that they will become, yes, mirrored by the Universe. Since when did it All work like that? Still a mystery to me… <br><br>PS – thanks, Oz!<br><br><a href=#c7454979655704036956 title="comment permalink">6/4/11, 6:33 AM</a><br><br>

I'm certainly not purporting that nature is a passive reflection of our consciousness, but an active one. We are in a dynamic relationship with the earth. Ignoring this is like being married and treating your partner in a bad way, expecting that they will tolerate you forever. I'm not suggesting that we have an anthropomorphic view of things, but that we do realize that the earth responds to polluting our rivers, destroying our forests, and a number of other harmful things we do to the earth, by creating a balancing factor. We pollute our nest, we live with the results. <br><br>I do agree with you that this conversation probably does not benefit the majority of folks and that the main task at hand is to just get people to see that the future is not gilded with gold by the hands of the gods and that we really do need to wake up to what is coming down the road. <br><br>I do maintain, however, that the universe is infinitely abundant, that that abundance is not for our exploitation, and that we our currently going into an age of scarcity as a result of our extravagance and the exploitation of our natural resources.<br><br>A change in consciousness always results in a change of action which then does have an affect on the earth. Otherwise, why should we try to make a difference? If we do not think that the earth will eventually heal itself if we change our destructive treatment of it--then we should just party on until the wheels come off. Or if we didn't think that by educating folks on the effects that are generated by exploiting the earth that they will change their behavior, we wouldn't waste our time. But neither of us believe that or there would be no use in having these conversations.<br><br>Nuff said--anyway, thanks for listening.

We do have a civilizational bias toward clinging to an illusion of control, pretty obviously. I found that in trying to push my family and friends to make changes, I ran into the same 'difficult moments' that you describe. That changed when I moved into thinking about influence, rather than control, AND employed (as best I could) Gandhi's notions about non-attachment to results.<br><br>As any good Buddhist could tell you, attachment (in the sense of emotionally clinging to) is the heart of suffering - both endured and imposed. Cultivating a sense of non-attachment (which, note, is different than detachment!) tends to free one from the frustrations which arise when one is attached to the change that one desires to see in others, and in my experience this actually leads to greater influence. The subtle trick is, of course, if you go into it with this as the goal, it doesn't work.<br><br>I think there is a psychological mechanism at work: the more you are perceived to be 'pushing' a contrarian human (most of us have this trait to some degree - some, like me, in spades!), the less effective you will likely be. If you cease to push, and concentrate on self-cultivation, this often results in movement in the related other. At least, this has been my observation.<br><br>And if it doesn't, then this is simply what is, for now, and beyond your 'control.' Console yourself, if that's needed, by realizing that you've done what you could by planting a seed - and you can do little to control the conditions which will determine whether it germinates in some future time or not.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=#c631795150101272439 title="comment permalink">6/4/11, 8:19 AM</a><br><br>

And so families and communities wrestled with exactly the sorts of questions Edward poses - to only look after one's own, or allow neighbors into the shelter? Here's how she puts it:<br><br>"an episode of...The Twilight Zone featured a false alarm in which 'the thin veneer' of civilization was once again ripped away as neighbors became enemies in a scramble for survival" - she then gives other examples of the mainstream perception of 'mob panic' in the face of calamity, yet examination of the facts of the period led one historian to conclude: ""slowly but surely, millions of Americans came to the conclusion that private fallout shelters were morally indefensible." Folks like Dorothy Day led the way in this "collective mulishness" wherein the average Joe and Jane refused to turn their backs on their neighbors - even when they felt their own survival was at stake.<br><br>It's not a guarantee by any means, but we do have reams of evidence from studies of disaster sociology which make clear that the notion of 'mob panic' and neighbor-against-neighbor are far less common than the mainstream would have us believe. Cooperation is far more common than competition in such circumstances. Obviously, the more community building that happens prior to, the better.<br><br>Worth noting: the instances where this tends NOT to be the case are in societies where the social inequity is vast. <br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=#c3789512947774640375 title="comment permalink">6/4/11, 10:04 AM</a><br><br>

Later Buddhist commentaries (especially in the Mahayana tradition) reversed this teaching, but this would seem to be a case of later Buddhist leaders imposing their own vision in place of the Buddha's (in other words, as is common, the later institutionalization of spiritual teachings invariably distorts them). <br><br>I have found that most American Buddhists don't have a very good handle on such discrepancies, because they want to see Buddhism as a unified and inerrant philosophy (a cultural deficit) - despite the fact that the Buddha himself made clear he was a mortal, fallible man and not divine or all-knowing.

The tv has been switched off most of her waking hours since she was born. She's smart, and she reads, so she worries about what our generation is doing to the world she is inheriting. Post apocalyptic fiction is quite popular with young adult readers right now, but she avoids it because she sees those worlds as all too possible. I try to steer her toward historical fiction that incorporates the value of self-sufficiency and the importance of community -- and the two are not mutually exclusive. I'm also helping her build the beginnings of a nonfiction personal library that will serve her well throughout her life.<br><br>She showed a real interest in raising chicken, so now there are chickens in our back yard, eggs in our kitchen, and chicken husbandry books in her bookshelf. She saw me knitting and wanted to learn, so I showed her how. Now there are scarves and sweaters in her closet, some quality knitting needles that will last a lifetime in her knitting basket, and basic knitting reference books in her bookshelf. She watched me baking bread and wanted to learn how, so I let her help me until she could do it herself. She' s never asked for anything before, but she says she'd like to have her grandmother's bowl that we mix the dough in. I plan to pass it to her when she has a home of her own. Her dad is building her a recipe box for next Christmas, and all those family recipes she has been learning to cook, as well as the vegetarian ones she has discovered on her own, will go into it. And maybe I'll find her a good book on artisan bread. <br><br>This summer I'm building a solar oven, and I'm sure she'll be helping. And then she'll be testing recipes in it. And then I'll be looking for a book on solar cooking for her birthday.<br><br>The best advice I was given when she was a toddler was to never rescue her from boredom. We didn't always buy the latest toy (or entertainment system) in a never-ending attempt to keep her amused. We didn't plug in a video while we tried to cook supper. She worked through her boredom, saw us doing interesting stuff, and wanted to join in. And we let her, even it meant that what we were trying to get done took three times as long. It has paid off in a capable, inquisitive young woman.<br><br>So, good projects are ones that tie into a young person's interests. Then support that interest, but know when to back off and let her figure things out for herself. Provide quality books as well as experience. And don't make it all about preparing for the fall of the grid. Make it about embracing the reality, rather than just the virtuality, of life.<br><br>Same for the books. Figure out what your young person is interested in, fearful of, curious about, and go from there.<br><br><a href=#c127041943709330673 title="comment permalink">6/5/11, 11:39 AM</a><br><br>

However, we need to understand that how we are presently doing this, for the most part, is horrendously counterproductive if our goal is to live in a peaceful, stable, loving world. <br><br>So what I am thinking is that we need to get our ego blows, that this is a basic need. So how do we do it in a healthy way?<br><br>An example, buying a pair of pants. <br><br>One way to get an ego blow is to go to a big box store and buy it on the cheap. We only need one but on the cheap we can buy several and we can get the big ego blow by self-congratulating ourselves about what a “smart” shopper we are. Of course we are playing a win lose game here with all the negative consequences and karma. <br><br>Or, we can buy the one pair we need from a local craftsperson who uses locally grown organic cotton… We gladly pay the full asking price and may even give a tip to show our appreciation for the efforts put forth in our behalf. Here too we can get a big ego blow that I think is inherently both more satisfying and longer lasting. <br><br>Stop talking and start doing, horse chores... :)<br><br><a href=#c4343499451743817047 title="comment permalink">6/5/11, 11:40 AM</a><br><br>

That said, a power tool can be a force multiplier in enabling a single person to do the work of many. My day job is in one of those coal fired power plants, and the numbers that they produce are so large that it is difficult to see how renewables could compete (over 3 million shaft horsepower at the generators, 2200 Mw total output, all produced by burning 1200 tons of coal per hour. This plant runs 24/7, and the units are only off for maintenance. In this environment, the arguments that seem to have the most effect is 1) disaster insurance, where I point out the alternative, if there is a disaster, is moving to a local gymnasium, where they will share their 3'x8' square space surrounded by several hundred other people, and their upset kids. The second argument is that as the price of power rises, a solar setup is giving tax free returns that is not subject to theft by bankers or governments in far off cities. I do practice what I preach, in that my house is self built passive solar, wood heat and gets about half it's power from the sun. I am currently building wind generators to supplement the solar. One other risk factor in addition to the aging infrastructure, is the aging workforce that maintains it. twenty years ago, they could work 16 hours a day for weeks if required, now three days of that schedule would be pushing it, as far as any productivity goes.<br><br><a href=#c4682930168866811576 title="comment permalink">6/5/11, 7:56 PM</a><br><br>

Nor should it be: you mention that just a third of electric power, finds it's way to the user. This might be truth, but that does not necessarily mean the alternative is any better. If every household would create their own energy it could have disastrous local health and environmental effects. <br><br>If the grid disappears people will try to get energy by any means necessary: that won't be pretty. As long as their is diesel, they will burn diesel. If that's gone they will burn wood or their old furniture. And that's just for heating alone. <br><br>The home creation of energy is less efficient then the mass production of it. A coal-based energy plant might not be the most environmentally nice thing, it's still a lot cleaner then if every-one tapping in to it's output would produce their own co2. Besides, their is a reason we don't want power plants in the neighbourhood of community; getting them in our homes doesn’t seem like an improvement we should applaud. <br><br>Getting energy from you're own renewable source would not be a great alternative either: if you have you're own windmill you're going to lose a lot of electricity. Half the time you don't need the energy-output of you're windmill.<br><br>And once you need it, their might not be any wind. That's where a global power grid comes in. You give the energy of you're windmill to other people when they need it, and you get if from them, when you need it. (for another example: you don't use light's during the day, but that's the time the electricity originates from you're solar energy source. At the other end of the globe it's night already: you're energy is very welcome there)<br><br>Finally: if you look at current developments: globalisation of electric grids increases more, then it decreases, now that we use more alternative energy sources. In Europe, for example, by 2020, 20% of all electricity will be created by renewable energy sources. That has tremendous impact on the grid: renewable energy is less reliable. The cure for this is increasing the amount of powerlines between nations: something that's invested in heavily. You're electric bill will be a lot more expensive in the future, but it will still be there.<br><br><a href=#c3892507526987811081 title="comment permalink">6/6/11, 2:37 AM</a><br><br>

The old adage, "As above, so below" applies here. My point is that our circumstances on the physical plane are a direct correlation to our condition on the spiritual plane. I'm not talking about specific individuals, but our experience collectively. If we were to change in more subtle realms, or if our spiritual intentions would change, it would change our experience in the physical realm.<br><br>For example, if greed were not a major problem in the collective consciousness of our world, we would not be experiencing the rape and plunder of our earth's natural resources. We would not see the exploitation of weaker individuals, there would not be a disparity between the rich and the poor because our actions would reflect our intentions. The abundance that resides in the subtle planes is unlimited. We can call down whatever we choose. It is we who limit it through our own narrow lenses and our tendency to focus on low level stuff.<br><br>You can't have this conversation without mentioning the effects of group karma and that when we participate in a group, we experience the effects of that group's karma. This is fairly evident if you live in America right now. We are reaping what we have sown. You can mitigate the effects of that karma by making personal changes, but you won't escape them altogether. JMG has spoken of communities working together to mitigate the effects and I think that his idea illustrates this nicely. <br><br>We are in the construction trade and our business has dwindled to almost a trickle. We haven't had a paycheck in over two years and I'm getting very creative with how to live a more sustainable life. I could view this as scarcity. I choose to view it as an abundant opportunity for personal growth and the chance to make needed changes in my own practice and consciousness. <br><br>If I view abundance as something as other than material, I can tap into abundance in a more subtle form. Suffering and difficulty are a spiritual path if one chooses to view them in that light.<br><br>But even on the physical plane, we can find abundance. The ability of the body to heal itself is one amazing example. The ability of the earth to heal itself is another. We may run out of fuel, have to live in the dark, or fight about many stupid things, but nature will find a way to regenerate itself. I have hopes that we will too :)<br><br><a href=#c5521340450527699557 title="comment permalink">6/6/11, 9:58 AM</a><br><br>

We're simply not made that way, IMO.<br><br>Even China's misguided 'one-child policy' which has been in place for 30 years hasn't done much good in terms of slowing down their contribution (though it has distorted the male-female ratio dangerously), and that was enforced by a totalitarian regime.

It's not greed (a by-product) - it's violence. Our system of governance is wholly predicated on domination and violence - and it is this, IMO, which leads to the domination and violence we direct against the natural world. <br><br>Bookchin's thesis deserves to be more widely considered in the eco-community:<br><br>"The notion that man must dominate nature emerges directly from the domination of man by man… But it was not until organic community relation … dissolved into market relationships that the planet itself was reduced to a resource for exploitation. This centuries-long tendency finds its most exacerbating development in modern capitalism. Owing to its inherently competitive nature, bourgeois society not only pits humans against each other, it also pits the mass of humanity against the natural world. Just as men are converted into commodities, so every aspect of nature is converted into a commodity, a resource to be manufactured and merchandised wantonly. … The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital."<br><br>Frederick Bastiat said:<br><br>"When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men living together in society, they create for themselves in the course of time a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it."<br><br>We plunder each other, and, worse, many of us call for the plundering of other humans in the name of compassion or environmental policy or whatever, so why should it be such a shock to see the wholesale plundering of the natural world? It is all of a piece, IMO.<br><br>If we sim[;y go after a by-product - greed - we miss the opportunity to restructure our social relationships in a way that can lead to harmonious co-existence with nature.<br><br>That is to say, so long as we perpetuate governmental systems which are based on domination and violence, so long will the society associated with it direct violence against the natural world.<br><br>Most Americans are incapable of perceiving the violence inherent in our system of government - not just police brutality or war, but quasi-axiomatic aspects like taxation as well. I know, it's not 'sophisticated' or 'progressive' to recognize that taxation relies upon violence and its threat, but the fact is, most taxation is extortionist, and thus only perpetuates the dominance paradigm. (If you disbelieve, try not paying them.)<br><br>If I am right, then every call to 'raise taxes' (or even to pay them) is an unwitting call to perpetuate the violence against the natural world. This will be very, very hard to accept, for many. That doesn't mean it's not true.<br><br>As stated in <a href=http://www.zerohedge.com/article/zero-hedge-%E2%80%93-maturing-fight-club-community-or-just-excuse-be-rude-and-abusive rel=nofollow> this thought provoking essay</a>:<br><br>"In my opinion contrary to popular belief ‘man’ and his social order are not ‘naturally’ violent and abusive. ...In nearly every harmonious and healthy indigenous culture I’ve studied going back thousands of years, violence and abuse was simply not a central part of their society as it is today with ours. And if the reader cannot see the violence everywhere s/he looks this is evidence of the reader’s total assimilation and adaptation to our cultural violence. When it has become so integrated and seamless that it can no longer be seen, our conditioning is nearly complete."<br><br>Even those who have peeled back the obvious layers of the onion can miss the subtler, more pervasive ones.<br><br>I'd urge all those who wish to see humanity connecting to the natural world in ways which are non-violent to think carefully about is and how they support the violence which we constantly direct against each other via the mechanism of State. <br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=#c1580219625472239950 title="comment permalink">6/6/11, 4:25 PM</a><br><br>

We're all going to have to learn how to live with a lot less energy. <br><br>That said: i don't think the basic premise of this post, that we can't maintain (and maybe should not even want to maintain) the electrical grid is right. JMG points to the wasteful grid, but for a number of reason's the alternative of a non-grid-electrical society isn't that much better. <br><br>Home-energy sources can be damaging to local environment or can not be counted on to provide at all times. <br><br>Besides a lot of people in city's can't even build them. How is the inhabitant of a small apartment in a big flat going to provide himself with electricity? <br><br>You need a big grid to compensate for unreliable wind and sun if you want to use solar panels and windmills, for example. Hydro-power is renewable: but you have to get it to users; even if that means energy-loss in the distribution. Otherwise, the energy would simply be lost.<br><br>I dispute the thought there won't be enough energy for the grid. In Sweden for example, the production of renewable energy is already at 42 or more. Even if all other sources of energy disappeared tomorrow: that would be more then enough to keep the grid running. In actuality fossil fuels will be around for a couple of years: and the investments in renewables don't stop. <br><br>On a personal note: I really hesitated posting for a second time on this blog. You say I don't offer any evidence or logic to refute JMG's argument. That's a bit rich, don't you think? You might think my reasoning flawed, but I wouldn't know what part of it you mean, since you didn't engage any of my arguments. I tried to better explain my point of view in this post, but since I don't know what you're problem with it was exactly, I might not have succeeded. If you have question's about statements and think they lack underlying data, I’ll be happy to provide you with useful reports and numbers. I saw that JMG discourages links to sources in replies; that's why I didn't use them. <br><br>Another reason for hesitating to reply to your post was you're last remark: I know now beforehand you're not going to take me seriously.

Remember that this paper was a 'meta-analysis' in that it was an overview and analysis of other research. The authors do not claim to have conducted research themselves. This is common in academic circles when one wishes to get an overall sense of what the research to date is telling us.<br><br>So to answer your individual questions, I would follow up and look at the individual studies that this meta-analysis includes. Those may - or may not! - resolve your questions. At the very least, you are now grappling with the real questions, rather than relying on some study that people widely cite without understanding its methodology or context, which is, of course, where we want to be - asking the right questions.<br><br>What is obvious is that solar PV fabrication relies on current industrial processes, which are egregiously unsustainable. PV cells are semiconductors, and as such require very large amounts of water and toxic chemicals (not to mention loads of electricity) to produce. So while 'sustainability' means different things to different people, I don't think that solar PV could by any stretch be said to be a 'sustainable technology' - it certainly isn't in my book! <br><br>But we have to note that sustainability is not the only relevant criteria at this point in time. As JMG noted in response to that particular comment:<br><br>"the interesting thing is that right now, whether or not PV is a net energy gain, it's a good idea. Why? Because it leverages energy costs between the present and the future. The energy that has to go into making and installing a PV panel goes into it now, while energy is relatively cheap and abundant, but a good deal of the energy that comes from the panel is available years from now, when energy will very likely be much scarcer and more expensive. (I discussed this at some length in The Long Descent) Especially on the home and local community scale, PV is a useful option; I'll be discussing that in more detail in an upcoming post."<br><br>So, we have that to look forward to. :)<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=#c4333730370299100524 title="comment permalink">6/7/11, 6:14 AM</a><br><br>

I can't tell you how much I value your weekly writings (and your books) and how useful they have been to me and my family. But more than that, they provide a medium for connection in this troubled age with other souls that <i>get it</i> and for all the usefulness of the internet, I can honestly say that the thing that I will miss the most on that fated day when it goes down for good - is your weekly blog and all those who contribute in the comments. So thank you for your words, energy and commitment.<br><br>On that, and other grid-related matters I can only add my own recent observations. Last week I was driving to work through a remote part of mid-Wales and was marvelling at the sheer number of telegraph poles installed to carry power/telecoms to fairly remote farmsteads - and the time and labour it takes to install and maintain them. I'm sure lots of other people who read your blog do similar mental exercises in trying to understand the frankly mind-boggling energies already committed to our infrastructure. And no doubt it is this attention to energy which cultivates the certainty of it's ultimate demise. Looking at those wooden poles and contemplating the electronic lives lived down those cables is sobering when one appreciates just how fragile that infrastructure is and how reliant most of us are on it. What struck me most about this was the sheer hubris in our culture that allowed us to install this infrastructure in the first place - I guess that's perspective for you!<br><br>Ironically, a few days after this journey I pulled up behind a telegraph pole installation truck (having never seen one before in my life) and marvelled at our ability to make machines for every purpose - and yet the futility of it!<br><br>@ Oz<br><br>Thanks for the pointers on social ecology.

One thing is to use a detergent that doesn't leave residues. I happen to like Charlie's Soap, but I'm sure there are others. If your water is hard, you can add a softener like Borax to the wash, or vinegar to the rinse. Crunchiness is also caused by things drying too quickly with too little movement, so coolish days with a nice breeze will give you softer clothes than a hot, windless day. In some climates, that might mean drying clothes overnight. You can also hang two or more layers of towels together so that they dry more slowly. <br><br>As far as using the dryer to fluff, I've found (with my dryer and my climate) that the 10 minutes is better used at the beginning of the drying period than at the end. They get softer that way, and then you don't have to remember to get them down from the line in time. I do this with the cloth diapers, as crunchy diapers irritate sensitive skin.<br><br><a href=#c8496958970976043015 title="comment permalink">6/7/11, 6:38 AM</a><br><br>

That implies that it will always return to some defined state."<br><br>A very good point. <br><br>Biogeochemists studying the problem of earth's early atmosphere (i.e. what sort of atmosphere would support the creation and maintenance of the necessary precursor organic molecules which led to life) theorize vastly higher levels of methane, vastly lower levels of oxidizing molecules like O2, H2O, etc, and posit that when oxygen first became present in large quantities, this proved deadly to early forms of life. <br><br>Would those early life forms have been any different than us in insisting that the planet would "heal" itself (i.e. that it would rid itself of all that new and toxic oxygen)? <br><br>The one constant in the universe, after all, is change, or impermanence - as true for the Earth as for the inhabitants of it. <br><br>If we define 'healing' as 're-achieving a state optimized for humans,' then this is necessarily anthropocentric. If we broaden the definition to include all life, then biocentric. <br><br>Most of us have a hard time, for example, thinking everything would be fine and dandy if the Earth were once again to become a lifeless chunk of matter moving through the deeps of space. But would this matter to 'the planet'? Or, for that matter, to the universe? Might not *that* be considered a form of the planet healing itself by ridding itself of a virulent 'infestation' of biological life??<br><br>We so readily place ourselves at the center of all things that we find mention of that not being the case as deeply and viscerally offensive. Alternatively, some in the ecology movement (in particular some of the deep ecologists) see humans as a pathogen, and wish for the demise of our species so that other forms of life could propagate unmolested by us. We may well achieve their goal in a not too distant future. If not, then in a more distant one, certainly.<br><br>George Carlin may have been off base on some of the particulars in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjmtSkl53h4" rel=nofollow>this clip</a>, but the notion that 'the planet will shake us off like a bad case of fleas' does, I think, have the merit of recognizing a more realistic relationship between us and the Earth.<br><br>We are effectively powerless to 'harm' the planet. We can degrade the biosphere - and more particularly the biotic component of it - to the point where it cannot sustain us. But the biosphere, in its time, has suffered graver indignities that we, even in our worst moments, seem likely to inflict - and it has prospered. Even in times when the entire planet was, alternately, a fireball, or a snowball, life persisted somewhere and made a comeback. The impacts of meteors, asteroids and other bodies from space have at various times destroyed much of life (though they may also have contributed to it, and they gave us our moon) , but life came back. So, at the least, life seems robust. Humans, perhaps not so much.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=#c2711243450233049296 title="comment permalink">6/7/11, 7:08 AM</a><br><br>

Producing an abundance of people knowledgeable about horses will be a far greater problem. When I tell potential students that becoming reasonably competent with horses takes at least four years, few believe me. After a couple years of study, most question whether they’ll be reasonably competent in ten. By that time, they understand that knowing what to do when things go right is the easy part; learning to respond effectively when things go wrong takes many years. Ever seen a draft team bolt through a school yard? <br> <br>Unfortunately, few “horsemen” today even know how to hold a lead or a lunge line in the safest fashion. For example, a couple of years ago one of my students helped a local trainer lounge horses before a show. She told me several people asked her why she held the lounge line as she did. <br><br>I wrote about why after a young woman in Florida lost her hand last year. http://swifthorse.blogspot.com/2010/08/hand-holding.html <br> <br>One of the Remnant said, “. . . as is common, the later institutionalization of spiritual teachings invariably distorts them.”<br><br>This applies in horsemanship too. Of course, I consider learning horsemanship a spiritual journey.<br><br>Mary said in response to Ryan, “Ah, I've read about the Canadian horse, and seen some pics. As I recall they seemed similar to our Morgan horse (the original type, not the modern ones) which are still to be found at UVM and with backyard breeders in Vermont and Maine. Those two breeds, and the Haflinger, make excellent "double-duty" family horses -- light plowing, carriage and riding horses. Easy keepers, nice temperaments, intelligent, etc...”<br><br>I’ve been thinking about the draft horse of the future. Right now, I favor starting with the old style Morgan. Double duty horses make total sense. What worries me is the round body of almost all draft stock. My bet is that the horse of the future will be working on less feed in higher temperatures. That puts the tall or well-sprung animal at a serious disadvantage since horses are far more prone to heatstroke than humans. The slab-sided horse survives where the wider, “better built” horse will die off. <br><br>Anyone else worried about how to keep strength while breeding for the shape of horse found in Cuba or the Middle East? My current thought is infusing a bit of Arab or better yet Akhal-Teke onto the old style Morgan.<br><br>Houyhnhnm<br><br><a href=#c8143807056448190589 title="comment permalink">6/7/11, 9:37 AM</a><br><br>

So far, in your terms, I have moral authority to discuss it.

From my perspective, the drop in the ocean that our child(ren) will represent in terms of planetary damage is outweighed by the probable good they can accomplish being raised in a Green Wizard household - steeped in the values of frugality, creativity, reverence for the natural world, and love; with plenty of hands-on hard work to hone their skills.<br><br>I'm also being very selfish about it. Reading about the Great Depression lately I've learned how for many people the deciding factor between an overcrowded household and homeless poverty was whether you had any relatives with a job.

Everything else you said was not relevant to your point. The reasoning for being self sufficient on solar PV was given here and over the last few weeks posts and comments. I suggest you re-read them carefully for more insight. As regards sweden, they are not the US which is the case in point. But in their case, 42% of intermittent hydro supply is enough reason to make the grid go down even when nominal load and supply are well balanced, ask any Venezuelan how the drought conditions of late have being suiting them. But the main problem arises when the demand is larger than demand, or supply cannot be guaranteed because of political, financial or resource reasons. Combine those factors in any way you wish and then add the time dimension: the situation deteriorates over time to the point where it is not worth depending on the grid, thus having a further malign catabolic effect, until it disappears completely. It matters not if there is a substantial renewable element in the equation as they cannot supply electricity if the system is not working, thus becoming bankrupted themselves as they are denied their revenue streams<br><br><a href=#c4371920717890264440 title="comment permalink">6/7/11, 11:27 AM</a><br><br>

The damage she did to my barn as a foal literally dropped the jaw of my veterinarian (who's used to 2,000 pound Eu warmbloods). Dahli's not slab-sided by any means. Rotund is more like it, as she looks at food and gets fat (thus now lives in a grazing muzzle). Heat doesn't phase her, even with her black-bay coat and rotund body. Even though she's almost black, she seems no worse off in the heat than my golden-bay, slabbier-sided arab. While I can't see her doing the very heavy work of a draft horse, she could do morgan-level light draft for sure. <br><br>The problem when you get the lighter, narrower frame is that you lose strength. But the old-style arabs are more round than flat, and obviously as desert horses can handle the heat. The humidity can knock them back a bit, but dry heat just makes them more manageable.

We're all going to have to learn how to live with a lot less energy. <br><br>That said: i don't think the basic premise of this post, that we can't maintain (and maybe should not even want to maintain) the electrical grid is right. JMG points to the wasteful grid, but for a number of reason's the alternative of a non-grid-electrical society isn't that much better. <br>...<br>On a personal note: I really hesitated posting for a second time on this blog. You say I don't offer any evidence or logic to refute JMG's argument. That's a bit rich, don't you think? You might think my reasoning flawed, but I wouldn't know what part of it you mean, since you didn't engage any of my arguments."<br><br>I'm glad you did post again, because I think I see the issue now. <br><br>You note that you've "been following this blog for a couple of weeks now" - you are going to need to go back a lot further than that (I'd go back at least a year in this blog and read your way forward) to grasp the basics of the geophysical logic which underlies the peak oil thesis. Better yet, pick up a copy of JMG's 'The Long Descent' and 'The EcoTechnic Future' if you can.<br><br>I'm sorry if you found my response unhelpful, but you sort of showed up at the 8th inning, talking about 2nd inning stuff, in a sense. <br><br>The sorts of assertions you are making have been repeatedly addressed in comments over the last year or so, and therefore I would simply ask you to do your due diligence and educate yourself as much as possible, and I will agree to try to be more helpful in addressing specific issues that you raise.<br><br>As one example, you state that "for a number of reason's the alternative of a non-grid-electrical society isn't that much better" - but what you are not realizing, it seems to me, is that it's not a matter of choice: grid or non-grid electric. We are well beyond these sorts of choices at this point, and that is the point.<br><br>Oil and net energy (a vital concept to grasp) already have or are at the cusp of peaking. That means that our economic and social systems, which are wholly predicated on *increasing* flows of energy, are now about to begin to experience permanent declines in available energy. Not simply because oil is at its peak (geophysical reality), but because of the implications of this (socio-economic reality). As available energy decreases, it becomes, by definition less available. Less available for transportation, less available for industrial use, less available for conversion into 99% of the food we eat - and yes, less available for electrical utilities. <br><br>To oversimplify considerably, would you deny agricultural entities the considerable fossil fuel inputs they need to grow food to keep the grid up? Or vice versa? And all this assumes someone in a position to actually make that decision, which is not at all guaranteed. <br><br>The point is: our current mode of operation is utterly unsustainable - wildly so. Trimming a few corners just won't cut it. We're in for a wild and chaotic ride.<br><br>So what most of us are discussing is not whether or not the grid should be maintained - because it is abundantly clear that in fact this is a literal impossibility after some point (quite possibly in the near future) - but what are some alternatives to it once it begins to go down, and doesn't it make sense ro start thinking those up now, rather than after the lights go out? <br><br>Drawing on history, JMG offers the notion of a patchwork of systems to provide power - NOT necessarily electrical power - to homes and communities in the absence of an ever-present, all you can eat source of electrical energy like the grid.<br><br>I'll include some suggested reading in a second comment...<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=#c9024786880561927777 title="comment permalink">6/7/11, 3:27 PM</a><br><br>

We might call this 'short-circuit' thinking: when any major problem arises, we blind ourselves to all other options and automatically ascribe responsibility for solving it to the centralized authority - the very opposite of subsidiarity. It is a divestiture of ownership.<br><br>Back in 1965, the brilliant Jacques Ellul described this process in compelling detail in 'The Political Illusion' - from the intro:<br><br>Ellul "concludes that all facets of political activity as we know it today are a kaleidoscope of interlocking illusions, the most basic of which are the illusion of popular participation, popular control, and popular problem-solving in the realm of politics.<br><br>The first great evil from which most other evils spring is politicization (the act of suffusing everything with politics and dragging it into the political arena). In our modern world, contrary to what was the rule in all previous ages, everything is politicized: men seek political solutions for everything, whether the problem be freedom or justice or peace or prosperity or happiness. (Oz: or ecocide)<br><br>As a result of this politicization of all aspects of life and of the orientation of all thought and energy toward politics, men increasingly turn to the state for a solution of their problems, though the state could not solve them if it tried. And everywhere in the world this increasing inclination to turn to the state leads to three evils:<br><br>- boundless inflation of the state's size and power;<br>- increasing dependence on it by the individual;<br>- decreasing control over it by the "people" who think they control it, whereas in reality they merely surrender all their powers to it."<br><br>This explains much about our modern world, IMO. <br><br>Ellul is not a well known name, which is unfortunate, as he deserves to be widely read by those who wish to come to terms with the myths with which we think, as JMG puts it. <br><br>Aside from 'The Political Illusion,' he also wrote 'The Technological Society' which warned of 'technological tyranny' - technology (including the media) as threat to humanity and human freedom. The applicability of that thesis to human ecological areas is obvious - we discuss it every week here.<br><br>He also wrote 'Propaganda,' in which he posited that: people become "caught in a web of facts they have been given.

Although he sired a purebred Res. Nat. Champion driving horse and many superior Arabian performance horses, he was more popular with Morgan and QH people than many of the halter-only Arabian people who considered him “coarse,” because he carried so much muscle and bone. Were he still around, I’d be using him to turn out light draft stock rather than dressage and eventing horses. <br><br>I have only seen photos of the tough 19th C. desert Arabs, but I do know that the best horse Davenport imported in the early 20th C died without leaving one foal in the US. He did however win one class—model Morgan stallion at the Vermont Morgan show! I think there were over 40 stallions in that class too, so obviously the desert-bred can be highly Morgan in type. Of course, a good many scholars think that Figure aka Justin Morgan was himself carrying a high degree of Arabian blood.<br> <br>You are quite right that dry heat favors Arabs and other hot breeds. I'm sure those Akhal-Tekes could never have completed that 1932 trek from Ashgabat to Moscow--something around 4800 km in 84 days--unless the riders traveled mostly at night. <br><br>So humidity definitely worries me; humidity and swampy ground stopped the Mongol horsemen and killed off most of the early equine imports to Central America. The import survivors bred on as slab-sided, heat-radiating little weeds like the ones in today's Cuba. They aren't capable of heavy work, but they survive. <br> <br>Of course, people worry me far more than the climate. How many horsemen do you who are competent and comfortable working horses at night or in the wee hours? I know only a few, but I know many otherwise competent horsemen who are afraid of the dark. For example, I know a man who walked his horse the last ten miles of the Tevis, sacrificing a top ten finish, because he didn't trust his horse enough. <br><br>Unfortunately, I know all too many people who own horses and are not competent to work them at noon in a climate-controlled indoor arena. <br><br>Houyhnhnm<br><br><a href=#c3778177836583521871 title="comment permalink">6/8/11, 8:05 AM</a><br><br>
