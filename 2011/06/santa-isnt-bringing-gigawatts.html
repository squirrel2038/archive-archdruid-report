Through the clouds of wishful thinking that too often make up what we are pleased to call a collective conversation on the subject of energy, a ray of common sense occasionally shines through. This week’s ray came by way of a study on the Earth’s thermodynamic balance, soon to be released in no less a scientific publication than the Proceedings of the Royal Society. The study found among other things that <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028063.300-wind-and-wave-farms-could-affect-earths-energy-balance.html?full=true&amp;print=true">there’s a fairly modest upper limit to the amount of energy that wind farms can extract from the atmosphere</a> without changing the climate. <br><br>So far, at least, the peak oil blogosphere hasn’t responded to this study at all. That’s not surprising, since the idea that renewable energy resources might also be subject to environmental limits is about as welcome in most alternative circles these days as a slug in a garden salad. These days, for many people who consider themselves environmentally conscious, a vision of giant wind turbines in serried ranks as far as the eye can see fills a pivotal emotional need; it allows them to pretend, at least to themselves, that it’s possible to support today’s extravagant lifestyles on renewable energy – to have our planet, one might say, and eat it too. <br><br>In the real world, things don’t work that way, but we’ve had a long vacation from having to deal with the real world. Three hundred years of ever-increasing production of fossil fuels have misled most of the population of the industrial world into thinking that it’s natural and normal to have as much cheap energy as you want and are willing to pay for. As petroleum production wobbles along a bumpy plateau and approaches the point of irreversible decline, and other fossil fuels move implacably toward their own peaks and declines, one of the prime necessities of sanity and survival involves unlearning the mental habits of the age of abundance, and coming to terms with the fact that all human activities are subject to ecological limits. <br><br>It’s as though we’re a bunch of children with very, very short memories, who wake up one morning to find that it’s Christmas Day and there are heaps of presents around the tree. Giddy with excitement, we open one package after another, revel in our shiny new toys, then delight in the holiday atmosphere of the rest of the day. As night falls, we doze off, thinking happily about how there will be another round of presents and another big meal the next day. Then the next day comes, and it’s not Christmas any more; search as we will, the area around the tree stubbornly refuses to yield any more presents, and if we strain our memories as far as they will reach, we might just remember that the other 364 days of the year follow different rules. <br><br>Especially in America, but not only in America, a great many people are basically sitting around on the day after Christmas, waiting for Santa Claus to show up with gigawatts of bright shiny new energy in his sack. The people who insist that we can keep our current lifestyles powered with giant wind farms or solar satellites or Bussard fusion reactors or free energy devices – thatt latter is what they’re calling perpetual motion machines these days, at least the last time I checked – are right in there with the folks who chant "Drill, baby, drill" in the fond belief that poking a hole somewhere in a continent that’s been more thoroughly prospected for oil than any other part of the Earth will somehow oblige the planet to fill ‘er up. I have too much respect for magic to dignify this sort of logic with the label of magical thinking; an initiate whose grasp of occult philosophy was that inept would be chucked out of any self-respecting magical lodge on the spot. <br><br>The realization that has to come is the realization that most current chatter about energy is trying desperately to avoid: that Santa isn’t bringing gigawatts or, if you prefer, that no law of nature guarantees us a steady supply of enough energy to maintain the fabulously extravagant habits of the recent past. Once people begin to grasp that the only meaningful answer to the question "What energy resources will allow us to keep the electricity grid running and cars on the road?" is "There aren’t any," it’s possible to ask a different question – "What energy resources will allow us to provide for the actual necessities and reasonable wants of human beings?" – and get a more useful answer. <br><br>That’s more or less the discussion I’ve been trying to further with the posts on energy here in recent months, in the course of surveying those ways of working with energy with which I have some personal experience—conservation first and foremost, but also homescale solar and wind power. There are also plenty of other other options that I haven’t worked with personally, and they also deserve to be brought into the discussion. <br><br>"Micro-hydro" and "mini-hydro," for example, are potentially options of great importance in the broad picture of a post-abundance energy future, but they’re not options I’ve explored personally. The "hydro" in each of these phrases, of course, is short for "hydroelectric;" micro-hydro is homescale hydroelectric power, usually produced by diverting a small amount of a stream or river on one’s property through a small turbine and using the latter to spin a generator. Back in the day there was a certain amount of work done with simple undershot waterwheels made from scrap metal, hooked up to truck alternators of the sort discussed in an earlier post on wind; I have no personal experience with how well these worked, but the concept may well be worth revisiting. <br><br>Mini-hydro is the next step up, hydroelectric power on the scale of a neighborhood or a rural town. Unlike what I suppose would have to be called mega-hydro, this doesn’t require damming up whole river basins, devastating fish runs, and the like; a small portion of a river’s flow or a small and steep stream provide the water, and the result under most circumstances is a supply of sustainably generated electricity that doesn’t suffer from the intermittency of sun and wind. Of course it depends on having the right kind of water resource close by your community, and that’s a good deal more common in some areas than others; it also requires a good deal more investment up front; but if you can get past those two obstacles, it’s hard to think of a better option. <br><br>Small amounts of electricity can be generated in a variety of other ways. Still, one of the great lessons that has to be grasped is that the thermodynamic costs of turning some other form of energy into electricity, and then turning the electricity back into some other form of energy such as rotary motion or heat, can be ignored only if you’ve got a half billion years or so of stored sunlight to burn. There are situations where those losses are worth accepting, but not that many of them, and if you can leave the energy in its original form and not take it through the detour into electricity, you’re usually better off. <br><br>Methane is an example. Methane production from manure on a small scale is a going concern in quite a few corners of the Third World; you need more raw material than a single human family will produce to get a worthwhile amount of gas, but small farms with livestock yield enough manure to keep a small kitchen stove fueled on this very renewable form of natural gas. (The residue still makes excellent raw material for compost, since only the carbon and hydrogen are involved in methane production; the nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other plant nutrients come through the process untouched.) Since cooking fuel is higher on the list of basic human necessities than most things you can do with modest amounts of electricity, this is probably the best use for the technology. <br><br>Flatulence jokes aside, I don’t have any personal experience with small-scale methane production. Wood heat, on the other hand, is a technology I’ve worked with, and it’s probably going to be a major factor in the energy mix in North America in the future. It’s a simple, robust technology that works very well on the home scale – in fact, it’s not too easy to use it on any larger scale – and many wood stoves come with what’s called a waterback, which uses heat from the stove to heat domestic hot water. (Combine solar water heaters with a cooking stove equipped with a waterback, and you’ve basically got your hot water needs covered year round.) The problem here is that wood heat is a major cause of deforestation worldwide; whether or not too much windpower can mess with the climate, as the study referenced earlier in this post suggests, it’s a hard fact that too much harvesting of wood has devastated ecosystems over much of the world and caused a range of nasty blowbacks affecting human as well as biotic communities. <br><br>There’s at least one way around that problem, though it needs to be implemented soon and on a large scale A very old technique called coppicing allows for intensive production of firewood off a fairly small acreage. The trick to coppicing is that quite a few tree species, when cut down, produce several new shoots from the stump; these grow much more rapidly than the original tree, since they have their root system already well in place. When the shoots get to convenient firewood size, the coppicer cuts them again, and yet another set of shoots come up to repeat the process. I’ve dabbled in coppicing – the vine maple of the Pacific Northwest, which grows like a weed and produces decent firewood, made that easy enough, and other regions have their own equivalents. As other fuels run short, the owner of a few acres who uses it for coppicing and sells dry wood nicely sized for wood stoves may have a steady income, or at least a perennial source of barter, on his or her hands. <br><br>Biofuels such as ethanol and vegetable oils are another source of heat energy that will probably see a great deal of use in the future, though here again the limits on production are not always recognized. In a world with seven billion mouths to feed and an agricultural system at least as dependent on fossil fuels as any other part of industrial civilization, diverting any substantial portion of farmland from growing food to producing biofuels risks a substantial political backlash. I wonder how many of the proponents of biofuels production have thought through the consequences of a future in which the hazards of driving might just include being stopped by makeshift barricades and torn to pieces by an impoverished mob that is all too aware that every drop of ethanol or biodiesel in the tank represents food taken from the mouths of their children. <br><br>Biofuels are likely to play some role in the early stages of the end of the age of abundance, then, but thereafter, at least until the world’s human population and post-petroleum agriculture have settled down into some sort of equilibrium, it’s unlikely that this role will be very extensive. Later on, it’s anyone’s guess, and the answer will be up to the people of the twenty-fourth century and onward, not us.<br><br>Methane, wood, and sunlight, then, will probably account for the great majority of heat energy in common use in the centuries immediately ahead of us. What about mechanical energy? The breakthrough that launched the industrial revolution was the discovery that heat from burning coal could be turned into mechanical energy by way of a steam engine, and much of what sets our civilization apart from other civilizations in history is precisely the ability to put almost unimaginable amounts of mechanical energy to work. If a car with a 100-horsepower engine literally had to be pulled by a hundred horses, for example, and each of those horses required the care and feeding that horses do, the number of such cars on the roads would be a very small fraction of the present total.<br><br>There are good reasons, some historical and some pragmatic, to think that the major source of mechanical energy in the post-abundance future will be what it was in the pre-abundance past, that is, human and animal muscle, amplified by a variety of clever tools. If anything, some of the more ingenious inventions of the last few centuries make muscle power even more useful now, and in the centuries ahead of us, than it was before the first steam engine hissed and groaned its way into a new age of the world. The extraordinary efficiency with which a bicycle converts muscular effort into movement is a case in point. The relatively simple metallurgy and engineering needed to build a bicycle is very likely to survive into the far future, or to be reinvented after some more or less brief interval, and the sheer value of a technology that can move people and supplies a hundred miles a day on decent roads will hardly be lost on our descendants. It’s far from unlikely, for example, that wars will be won in the post-petroleum era by those nations that have the common sense to equip their infantry with bicycle transport. <br><br>More generally, the invention of really effective gears may turn out to be one of the nineteenth century’s great contributions to the future. The Roman world had some very complex machines using cogs and gears, but the designs used at that time did a poor job of transmitting power; gearing systems originally evolved in the late Middle Ages for clockwork underwent dramatic changes once steam power created the need to transfer mechanical motion as efficiently as possible from place to place and from one direction to another. Once invented, effective gears found their way back down the technological pyramid to the realm of hand tools; anyone who has ever compared beating egg whites with a spoon to doing so with a hand-cranked beater will have a very clear idea of the difference in effort that such simple mechanical devices make possible.<br><br>That difference may not seem like much in comparison to the gargantuan achievements of current fossil fuel-powered technology, or the even more grandiose fantasies served up by a good many of those who insist that the end of the age of petroleum must, by some kind of technological equivalent of manifest destiny, usher in the beginning of the age of some even more titanic energy resource. Still, if these claims amount to sitting around the chimney on December 26 waiting for Santa’s boots to appear – and I think a very good case can be made for the comparison – it’s past time to shelve the fantasies of limitless energy and the hubris that goes with them, and start paying attention to the tools, technologies, and modest but real energy sources that can actually have a positive impact on human existence in an age when only natural phenomena have gigawatts at their disposal any more.

I have always kind of wondered about this. As for pedal power, I have started looking around the house at all the electric conveniences that could be pretty easily converted to pedal power. The Cuisinart, for example, complete with the grain grinding attachments. Pretty much any small intermittent electric motor could be replaced with pedals by a clever tinkerer. Or by a properly geared water wheel, using torque directly without the electric intermediate. Imagine walking out to the mill house with whatever it was that needed torque, connecting the right tool to the proper drive shaft, closing the clutch, and watching your fruit get pureed or your peanuts get ground or your lathe get spun or your holes get drilled.<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c1493392507498503072 title="comment permalink">6/22/11, 8:04 PM</a><br><br>

I was not aware of it before (but I ran screaming from Academia about a dozen years ago). It sounds very much like the sort of true big-picture energy-based ecosystem ecology that I always thought we should be doing (when I was a professional ecosystem ecologist) but we never get around to because biologists are not so strong on physics and thermodynamics. This work looks at a more total picture of the thermodynamics of the planet, not just the raw calories in/calories out. It relates to all that energy quality stuff that we wrangled with here a while back. Still gathering info, but at this point I might slightly rephrase the real fundamental lesson here:<br><br>Santa DOES bring us gigawatts, but they are already occupied in doing work that is absolutely essential to our survival -- powering the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, pedosphere, etc. that make it possible for us to exist. And he's not going to bring us any more than we already get. Every gigawatt we divert for ourselves is a gigawatt taken from those processes; in the long run it is not going to be a positive sum game. If you push here you have pulled there, and likely weakened something you really cannot do without. This is true regardless of where the extracted gigawatts are taken from. It doesn't matter whether you are bleeding from your toe, your neck, or your nose; you are still losing the same amount of blood. We are part of the biosphere and the energy flows through it; even fossil fuels originally came from the biosphere. Moving an energy flow out of one part of this grand process and in to another gains nothing overall. <br><br>Interesting stuff...<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c5219249847485234056 title="comment permalink">6/22/11, 8:41 PM</a><br><br>

A friend of mine is particularly susceptible to fantasies that he and his partner can power their two cars and urban condo on fuel distilled from lawn clippings or corn or whatever. <br><br>I recently heard Mr. Blume on the radio (again), and he stoutly denied that there exists any conflict between corn ethanol and food production. Specifically, he asserted that vast productive yet (evidently) unused areas of Brazil which are not in the Amazon region are readily available for ethanol production. I have a feeling that someone could poke some rather large holes in these claims, and imagine that this would be a useful exercise. <br><br>Blume is apparently helping Amazonians to free themselves from dependency on outrageously overpriced petrol for their river traffic, so I don't want to diss him entirely. But I have the impression there must be limits on what can realistically be done with biofuels, and it would be useful to have a reasonably accurate idea where those limits lie. <br><br>Serried ranks of giant windmills reaching as far as the eye can see are UGLY.

I chose to go with cider gums (Eucalyptus gunnii) because they will coppice, they grow fast, and all eucalyptus are really, really hard, so they make great firewood with a lot fo BTUs in them. <br><br>The trick with coppicing species that will coppice (oaks, maples, ash, willows, poplar, hazels, and some eucalyptus) is to cut them at the right time of the year, which is just before they start to grow again in the spring. Otherwise, you could wind up killing the tree. <br><br>Experts have determined that the practice of coppicing goes back to the bronze age (in Britain, anyway) and it was only the advent of coal in the mid 1800's that made coppicing fall out of favor. However, coppicing is a super-sustainable practice whose time has come again. <br><br>i just wish I had more than a quarter-acre suburban plot so that I could coppice enough for all my wood-burning needs.<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c4371405679716952005 title="comment permalink">6/22/11, 10:08 PM</a><br><br>

Rinse and repeat as needed for the next billion years or so, and ... <br><br>Or not.<br><br>So, here is the problem as I see it: We have been living beyond our means for hundreds of years, and it appears to be a part of the nature of human nature to continue doing so until our means are completely used up, and then, maybe, we'll start thinking about what to do next. The carrying capacity of our planet is significantly less than our current population, so we probably should all start behaving like the Italians and the Japanese and having no more than one kid per family until the total population of planet earth drops below the planet's carrying capacity, which will take, what? about two hundred more years?<br><br>Of course, we'll run out of fossil resources (not to mention fish in the sea and fire wood) before we reach that equilibrium point, so there will be wars and revolutions and social disruptions as we fight over a shrinking pie...<br><br>Oh, boy, it looks like we're going to need more guns to defend our little self-sufficient farms, because the numbers just don't add up to allow a smooth transition to that wonderful ecotechnic future that we all hope to see in the great bye-and-bye. If we limit the sizes of our families we may have to take in some refugees and orphans to have enough hands to work on our farm. (So, should we treat them as family, or indentured servants?)<br><br>I can sort of imagine how our great grandchildren will live two hundred years from now; it will more than likely be like the Middle Ages, plus scientific knowledge and a little elecricity (or maybe slave plantations where most of us will do all the work while a small elite live like kings). What I have trouble imagining is what is going to happen in the next thirty years or so. All I can see are Really Bad Things on the horizon...<br><br>If we break down the possibilities into categories, we may get a better idea of what the rest of the 21st century is going to be like. There are some things that will almost certainly happen: peak oil, financial collapse, etc. There are some things that are probable, but not guaranteed: wars over dwindling resources, environmental degradation, and so on. There are a few events that are definitely possible, but not necessarily probable right away: nuclear war, plagues of various types, and the inevitable giant meteor impact.<br><br>The end result, as you pointed out last week, will be a total population of under a billion, with an average standard of living close to what our ancestors enjoyed a thousand or so years ago. Getting there from here is going to be really interesting...<br><br>Don't the Chinese have a famous curse about living in interesting times?<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c4242703892996655874 title="comment permalink">6/22/11, 10:30 PM</a><br><br>

Not to mention large quantities of resources too.<br><br>Backwards is the only way forwards.<br><br>Another useful store of the suns energy is food preserving. Preserving is really all about storing collected energy when it's abundant for later reuse.<br><br>For anyone contemplating eucalypt species for coppicing purposes, it's worthwhile pointing out that they are amoung the best. You can guarantee at least 6 coppicing harvests from members of that species. <br><br>This is also why they survive bush fires so well. You'll see after a bush fire that they have epicormic shoots (I think that's the technical term anyway) all over the trunk. It's a survival strategy and it's very successful. <br><br>However, please don't grow eucalypts next to or in falling distance of your dwelling (or shed etc) though! As a survival strategy, the trees can drop large branches (or the entire head) when stressed. <br><br>Still, great for fast growing hardwood firewood. Now that I mention it, don't ever camp underneath any eucalypt species (they're also known as widow makers).<br><br>Oh yeah, don't plant them near either an orchard or a vegie patch as they are amazing at strip mining any possible water or nutrients from the soil.<br><br>On the positive side though, they used to distill eucalyptus oil here (which is pretty easy to do) and the oil is a powerful cleaner and antiseptic. You can also burn it (hardly surprising really) which they also used to do. The leaves are about 4% oil - over summer you can see it and smell it in the air.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c1825538115824658422 title="comment permalink">6/23/11, 1:39 AM</a><br><br>

I've finally been moved to get an OenID to join the discussions!<br><br>I will certainly look up the RS report cited in this week's piece, as it would be interesting to see where they draw the line regarding extracting wind energy. The viewpoint I'd taken is that a certain amount of windpower acts as a double benefit against climate change -- firstly and obviously by displacing fossil fuel use (Jeavons not withstanding) but also by extracting surplus energy from the atmosphere. As the major climate issue results ultimately in the atmosphere becoming more energetic ('warmer'), leading to extreme weather events, it can only help to suck some of the trapped energy back out again. So in the short term (ie 1-2 generations) there must be added benefit to wind power no-one seems to be accounting for... Part avoidance, and part remediation.<br><br>The second point I'd raise is that the biosphere clearly DOES operate at a current energy surplus. If this were not the case then there would be no fossil fuels in the first place. Not to mention limestone or other carbonaceous deposits. Of course this doesn't imply Santa's gigawatts, as those various deposits are laid down from 100 million+ years of surplus. I know it's a fiendishly complex calculation, but that should somehow set an upper bound to our total available extractable energy budget which doesn't otherwise disturb other global systems. <br><br>But generally, in the absence of that fiendish calculation, I try to go on the touchstones of 'less is inevitable' and 'the future is low-tech, low-energy, and local'. Anything I can do that aligns with those signposts must be (hopefully...) a step in the right direction.<br><br>Finally, I'd like to add the Green Wizardry project has greatly imppressed me and it has pointed me to some interesting avenues (thermoelectrics, for instance). And of course, belated solstice greetings!<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c3006495575504820856 title="comment permalink">6/23/11, 3:52 AM</a><br><br>

However, the Royal Society report seems to use the current worldwide rate of energy consumption as the basis for its conclusion.<br><br>Given our current and future economic and mineral resource limitations, it's unlikely that humans will ever be able to build that many wind turbines and solar collectors. The closest we have ever come to this sort of climate changing construction is the 'heat island effect' caused by the extensive paving of urban areas. This will probably be a decreasing factor in the centuries to come. In the not-too-distant future, it's not inconceivable that all those cubic miles of asphalt might be strip-mined to reclaim their meager fuel value, since that's essentially what we're doing right now with the Alberta tar sands.<br><br>Our cultural memory of the the old ways of doing things is not entirely lost. Besides the Amish, the last Americans born in horse &amp; buggy times have only recently passed away. <br><br>I remember sitting with my two elderly maiden aunts, watching with them the telecast of the first space shuttle mission returning to Earth. I vividly recall being very conscious of the huge changes in their lifestyles that had occurred between their youth in the 1890's and their dotage in the 1980's. It's very possible that my own children will experience the reversal of many of those lifestyle changes within their own lifetimes.<br><br>In so-called First World cultures, only four or five generations have lived totally within the fossil fuel bubble. In the Second and Third World many members of those same generations have always plodded along with their draft animals and done their work with hand tools. The future will not be a big surprise to them. The rest of us will be able to call upon the memories and methods of our great-grandparents to make the adjustment. We'll complain and we'll fumble, but we'll do it.<br><br>There are already some encouraging developments. In the Northeast US, many cities were built around water power sources. Here in Rochester NY, the Central Library building was built right over the old Erie Canal after the canal was rerouted in the 1920's. Water still flows through the old canal bed and pours out of spillways under the library. Just this week, the Library announced plans to install a micro-hydro turbine in the basement to capture the energy of that current. I was amazed that they even thought of such a thing and was surprised to learn that quick approval of the project by County authorities was expected. The output of that turbine would be added to the power generated by the three existing hydroelectric plants on the lower Genesee River.<br><br>Then there's the Erie Canal itself. New York State has maintained it in pretty good working order. I'm sure it will once again become a valuable regional transportation resource as we head back towards living "la vida local" and "la vida lento". <br><br>"La vida loco", the fossil fuel era, is almost over.<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c6421129687316219548 title="comment permalink">6/23/11, 3:58 AM</a><br><br>

So be it. Why insist on heating the whole building into the comfort zone when an extra blanket will do? Why run the air conditioner on a rainy day just because it's too humid to handroll a good smoke? This too will pass. I came to the conclusion some time back that I wasn't going to spend much of my time and energy forcing things that were'nt meant to be. Once I adjusted my expectations, I was no longer slave to my sense of entitlement, no longer in such obscene competition with Mam Gaia. <br><br><i>"....since the idea that renewable energy resources might also be subject to environmental limits is about as welcome in most alternative circles these days as a slug in a garden salad."</i><br><br>Well, duh! (meaning no disrespect to JMG for, again, stating what should be obvious.) In a nutshell, it comes down to choosing between limits or forcing. Why use only part of the flow of a river when you can have it all? Matters not if the river no longer reaches the sea. If it mattered, it would be part of our story, the biggest part perhaps, enculturated and infused into our thinking and habits, our stories and songs. <br><br>This too will pass. Mother Earth is doing a bit of forcing as I type, and is far more patient than her thoughtless, souless, impetuous child.

There is a PDF file of a presentation he gave in 2010 available here:<br><br>http://www.newton.ac.uk/programmes/CLP/seminars/082610001.html<br><br>By the way, though it may be controversial, this is mainstream science. It is not fringe stuff and stays firmly within the well-established laws of thermodynamics. <br><br>The presentation includes a lot of technical and mathematical stuff that will lose most readers who do not have a good background. But there are good summary slides, too. I would point you past the derivations to the summaries, conclusions, and implications. I suggest skipping to these pages:<br><br>49: Estimating that the maximum useful power that the earth system can generate is an average of 2 watts per square meter, which is only about 2% of total incoming solar energy. <br><br>53-58: Diagraming the power generation and transfer within the earth system<br><br>62-64: Add the geothermal system of the earth's interior, the biosphere, and human activities to the picture <br><br>74-77: Addressing the difference between impacts on global temperature versus global power generation, diagraming how renewable energy systems draw power from existing earth systems and cannot be without impacts on the larger system <br><br>Though I can see that there is room to argue about magnitudes and particulars, I don't see how one can assail the fundamental conclusion that power flows within the earth system are limited and any power that we extract from it for our purposes means less power for natural processes (on which we depend utterly). <br><br>So if you think your solar panels are generating 1000 watts per square meter, or your wind farm is generating 10 watts per square meter, via the incredible network of interconnections in the earth system you are actually borrowing most of that power from other systems (climate, hydrology, life, soil, etc.) that were already using it.<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c7287669250037928871 title="comment permalink">6/23/11, 8:25 AM</a><br><br>

The problem that's not often recognized is that all current energy sources get an "energy subsidy" from petroleum -- coal would cost a lot more and yield much less net energy, for example, if it had to be excavated without diesel machinery, and wind turbines rely on a lot of fossil fuel inputs for raw materials extraction, fabrication, installation and maintenance. All of that has to be factored into an energy analysis -- since all of it is part of the real energy cost. <br><br>Mustard, and a happy solstice to you as well!<br><br>Macsr, actually, wind power doesn't take any energy out of the atmosphere, since all the energy it extracts is returned to the atmosphere in the form of waste heat in fairly short order. As for the current energy surplus of the biosphere, most fossil fuel deposits were laid down in certain distinct periods of geological history when the biosphere, in effect, used a bunch of energy to dump excess carbon into geological storage. That's not the case at present, and we have no way of knowing when it will again be the case. <br><br>Robo, the Erie Canal is a treasure, and it's a very good thing that it's been kept open. There are a lot of other canals that will have to be redug and rebuilt in the centuries ahead of us. As for the library, good for them! Somebody was thinking. <br><br>Phil, er, I take it you've never heard of dirt bikes or the Ho Chi Minh Trail. <br><br>Thijs, one of the more than occasional commenters here spotted the article and forwarded a link to me; I'd been thinking about your comment, and so everything unfolded as though planned. <br><br>Andy, I saw that article. It occurs to me that floating mills of that kind in the Mississippi and other large rivers could generate quite a respectable amount of electricity, to say nothing of mechanical energy, while still being able to deal with the seasonal floods. <br><br>Planner, that seems pretty likely. Of course it may not work, in which case there'll be a lot of half-completed wind farms and drilling rigs available for salvage. <br><br>Cloud, thanks for the link!<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c2718121326268443491 title="comment permalink">6/23/11, 8:30 AM</a><br><br>

This is happening now in the more impoverished parts of the world, particularly those unfortunate to be at the receiving end of the wealthier world's toxic refuse exports. But the practice is truly a last resort, as the fuel value obtained is hardly worth enduring the oxidation byproducts. Asphalt is not very stable compared to a similarly purposed substance such as conctete. Much as ice cubes in a frost-free freezer shrink away through ablation, the aromatic hydrocarbons in asphalt volitalize, cracks form, water and ice break apart the loose elastic bonds, and opportunistic plants colonize the territory. Without regular travel and maintenance an asphalt byway in the temperate zone could last maybe a dozen years, in twice that most would no longer even be recognizable. Over the last several years I have literaly been watching this process in action, both on a little section of local blacktop, orphaned during an intersection relocation project, which now gets only sporadic foot and bicycle traffic, and on my own driveway which sees minimal vehicular use. I'll pile crushed stone or gravel in any potholes that develop and clear encroaching brush, but that is it. In 20 years there will probably only be a few lumps of tar left. Good riddance. Long before that I intend to reclaim for additional garden space the unneeded parking pad emplaced by the previous FUV-driving property owners. <br><br>Rochester, the Erie Canal, and mules (PhilJ) all look like good candidates for the transition to a diffuse energy source economy.

With any luck, that sort of cultural memory will keep Scotland from making the same mistakes we're all but certain to make over here. <br><br>GHung, no offense taken! Most of what I say here ought to be a matter of "well, duh" -- the fact that it's not is the reason why this blog is necessary. <br><br>Remnant, as usual, it's a mixture of both. Precision machining was done in the 19th century with hand tools, and there are still old manuals from the age of steam that teach the relevant skills. The very high-quality alloys used in the best machinery these days almost certainly won't be an option, but at a slightly less demanding level of efficiency, there are a lot of options -- a good mechanical engineer with a library of old books to hand could tell you a lot more about them than I can. <br><br>RPC, if we can keep a quarter of the current US electricity production up and running over the long term, we'll be doing very, very well. Even a small fraction of that will make the future a lot less wretched than it will otherwise be. <br><br>Calum, I'm not familiar with ballraces so can't comment on the sustainability of the technology. Chains can be made with relatively modest machinery, though, and vulcanized rubber requires only natural rubber -- with climate change, plantations of rubber trees in the American South are likely to be a growth industry -- and sulfur, which can be extracted from sulfates and pyrites in adequate amounts. <br><br>Dltrammel, I expect to see a lot of that in the years to come.

Magic, as I've mentioned here before, is the art and science of causing change in consciousness in accordance with will. Used skillfully, it can cause dramatic change in any phenomenon that's strongly influenced by consciousness, but it can't change the laws of nature, much less make those laws cater to human whims.

Many of the supplied trees are fruit bearing (chokcherry wine, anyone?), some are of the coppicing species mentioned here, and they are all grown specifically for our climate. If you have more than 5 acres of land, you qualify: you have to do up a plan and submit a request, but they really want the trees planted so it's not as though there is a fierce selection process involved. Start now while the program is still being funded - and so that the little baby trees have some time to grow! :)<br><br>Relevant to the discussion on micro wind and solar - we have two small wind generators that were actually gifts to us from a neighbour (nicest wedding gift ever, I think!) ... he has too many trees at his place and couldn't get enough of a breeze, but we have an open pasture and a road that runs in the prevailing wind direction, so we do get enough to make it worth having. Since we already had the solar panels up, adding the wind tower to feed into the same system (it's a full system with batteries and charge controllers and all that) was no trouble. We also rigged up the second wind generator on a pole that extends up above the shed/barn roof: it doesn't get as much spin as it's not as high as the tower, but it's enough to trickle charge an old car battery, and we have a 12V 'trouble light' that we can turn on in the barn so that we have light to see a sick animal or something. <br><br>We also ran a string of solar powered white Christmas lights (speaking of Santa...) along the inside of the barn ceiling: they provide just enough light to see where you are going and make sure everyone's all right. If you have a building (shed? barn? front entryway of your house? garage?) that would be nice to have lit up for a few hours every evening, do consider picking up a few strands of solar powered LED lights after the next holiday. Besides, it makes your barn look so cheery in the dark of winter! :)<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c2337054712390704120 title="comment permalink">6/23/11, 10:51 AM</a><br><br>

There is no evidence whatsoever to support your assertion that this is a "part of the nature of human nature," and thinking in this way only obfuscates, IMO, the ability to think clearly about the implications of the current set of converging crises. That is, assuming that characteristics which are cultural in nature (readily supported by even a cursory knowledge of anthropology) are in fact a part of our DNA only locks you into seeing the future in a certain way."</i><br><br><i>"In this sense, it fits JMG's definition of a 'myth' which becomes so embedded that we become unaware of it. Clear thinking is called for, in terms of an appreciation of such myths and how they distort our thinking."</i><br><br>I'm sorry, but this strikes me as a distinction without a difference. Maybe I was inexact in my choice of words, but the end result is the same. Whether it is the nature of human nature, or simply a cultural construct, everybody wants more than they have, and very few are willing to voluntarily give up very much of what they have without a fight, and most people will avoid having to make hard choices (or even relatively easy ones) until their backs are literally up against the wall (look at the US Congress and its pathetic attempts to come to grips with the fact that we ARE living beyond our means). <br><br>Why would cultural nature be significantly different than the human nature that underlies it? Human beings are greedy, envious, slothful, etc. All those "sins" are part of the nature of human nature, right? And the cultures that we humans have created throughout history exhibit the same properties, but on a much larger scale. Why should I cut back on my own unsustainable lifestyle when I can just tax the rich, or print more money, or max out my credit cards and then declare bankruptcy?<br><br>It really doesn't matter what the root cause is; the bottom line is still going to be the same. With the exception of a relatively small number of people who, like JMG, have seen the light, our whole civilization is accelerating toward a cliff, and most people are in a state of denial or worse. And most people are not going to even start trying to change their lifestyles or beliefs until it is too late, and even then most of them will expend most of their energy pointing the finger of blame at whatever scapegoats come to hand.<br><br>I stand by what I wrote.<br><br>@JMG: Thanks for the suggestion.

For example, I was down at the harbor a couple days ago, watching a diesal truck filling up the tank on a medium-sized lobster boat. The total bill for 1400 gallons was almost $7000. And that will last the captain and crew less than a week of work.<br><br>Now, if gas becomes prohibitively expensive, and causes the price of seafood to become completely out of reach for the vast majority of consumers, how will that impact the commercial ocean fishery?

But after transferring their energy to the propeller, they’re as useless as stoners.<br><br>Predicting the exact effects on climate is impossible. But with enormous amounts of wind and wave energy doing different things than before, it could make for a somewhat different climate.<br><br>Farmers, however, do not generally like "different"; they prefer "predictable". Farmers need stability to produce a dependable, bountiful harvest; they are at or near peak food production, and the last thing they need is more man-made climate destabilization.<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c6860622210717100001 title="comment permalink">6/23/11, 2:59 PM</a><br><br>

If anyone here has heard of a Mormon fence that's what I thought I would do. A Mormon fence was built using found wood, crooked poles and branches. Usually started with a long pole laid in the crotch of a tree or on a rock with two of the shorter pieces of wood with the tops crossing across the starter limb. You lay another long limb in the crotch of the two side limbs and repeat. Wild roses, berry vines and hazelnut bushes growing up in the fence further anchor it creating a hedge. I want to do this to encourage song birds, pollinators and small wildlife and plant alternate food source plants as well as herbs horses can eat to self medicate. Herbs which I can also harvest and dry to medicate a sick horse when such herbs are out of season.<br><br>I also want to 'farm' the grasses in my pastures, running cows after horses and maybe a mobile hen house trailer for free range eggs to break up manure and distribute it more evenly into the pastures. I can also sell some eggs on the side, perhaps to some of my boarders less inclined or able to achieve self sufficiency.<br><br>I want everything set up to support each other or another purpose. The less work I have to do the happier I'll be. But then the real work will be in the initial prep of the property for each use.<br><br>Upon reading the comments on coppicing trees I could plant them inside the Mormon fence and would fit well with my intent for the fence. Besides, I want to build a Russian type stove into my house and wood burned in that would create heat piped in the floor of the house as well as give me heat to duct into a green house built directly behind the main house.<br><br>Regarding bicycles in war, refer to the Swiss.<br><br>For people thinking of draft stock perhaps you should think of steers or bullocks as they're called in other countries. I have a picture of a great grandfather in 1920 or so with his ox team (two span or four oxen), used in logging. Horses can get pretty snippy, especially when you don't quite know what to do. They also require well fitting collar and harness while oxen just need a wooden yoke you can carve out with a chainsaw, add trace chains and you're good to go. When starting out use common sense and follow the kiss principal, you can get fancy later. <br><br>I suggest you buy a SHORT bull whip and learn how to use it without wrapping it around your neck!

My plan has always been to wean ouselves off of propane, even though a little propane goes a long way around here. My main goal is to have gas available for cooking, as it's far too efficient and convenient to give up without a fight. I've cooked with wood and it's a real chore; energies I hope to apply to other chores. During canning time (already underway this season), having a couple of good gas burners is a big advantage. Being able to can things as they come in, in small batches, is for me, preferable.

That means about half a billion people in the world could, if they had the will, spend a very tough decade or so adapting to a low-energy lifestyle, and in principle could end up with a quality of life that is actually slightly more pleasant than what we aspire to now. So far so good.<br><br>But what about the other six billion people? My take on the thermodynamics is that there is basically no way that they can continue to exist without a die-back on an apocalyptic scale that most of us can't even imagine.

Maybe I was inexact in my choice of words, but the end result is the same. Whether it is the nature of human nature, or simply a cultural construct, everybody wants more than they have, and very few are willing to voluntarily give up very much of what they have without a fight, and most people will avoid having to make hard choices (or even relatively easy ones) until their backs are literally up against the wall (look at the US Congress and its pathetic attempts to come to grips with the fact that we ARE living beyond our means). "<br><br>You aren't grasping the central point. Human nature spans all humans. Cultural conditioning doesn't. Depending on how one describes it, there are hundreds of thousands of cultures extant - and if we include the past, many, many, many more. There is only one human species. There's a vast difference in that distinction.<br><br>I'm curious to know if you've ever been outside the US to a non-industrialized country, because what I'm hearing is an extrapolation that goes like this: humans everywhere are the same as humans in the US (and selected other industrialized nations) - and always have been for the life of the species.<br><br>I suggest you take a look at <a href=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/wade_davis_on_endangered_cultures.html rel=nofollow>this</a> just to get an idea of the vast differences between cultures (and the rate at which they are being extinguished).<br><br>In times past, there were many cultures based on gift economies, barter economies, etc. Those examples would not exist if you were correct and humans across the board were invariably greedy, avoided hard choices, etc. My sense is that you are generalizing in wildly erroneous ways and thus coming to conclusions which are not supportable in light of what we know about human cultures across history.<br><br>"Why would cultural nature be significantly different than the human nature that underlies it? Human beings are greedy, envious, slothful, etc. All those "sins" are part of the nature of human nature, right?"<br><br>Ummm...gotta say: wrong. Personally, I don't think the Bible had a very solid grasp on human psychology, and it provides a poor reference for understanding human nature.<br><br>"And the cultures that we humans have created throughout history exhibit the same properties, but on a much larger scale."<br><br>Again, I think this is simply false, and that we have abundant evidence that it is false. I'd suggest you take a look at that evidence instead of just making assertions.<br><br>As one example among many, the Iroquois Confederacy lived by their 'Great Law' which insisted that decisions made in the present which affected their people had to consider the impact seven generations hence. How is this 'avoiding hard choices' or 'greedy'? It is, in fact, the opposite. <br><br>This example alone suffices to falsify your proposition. But there are many more such.

In doing so, he ignores the crucial economic and political contexts. Not to mention simple practicality.<br><br>For example, David Korowicz has defined our society's 'operational fabric' as comprising "the given conditions at any time that support system wide functionality. This includes functioning markets, financing, monetary stability, operational supply-chains, transport, digital infrastructure, command &amp; control, health service, institutions of trust, and sociopolitical stability. It is what we casually assume does and will exist, and which provides the structural foundation for any project we wish to develop."<br><br>So I'd ask the poster:<br><br>Given that the operational fabric - i.e. the technological, transportational and economic infrastructure - is disintegrating as we speak, how could such a scheme - which would rely on supply chain stability, monetary and credit stability (how much does an IFR cost to build anyway and what companies are willing to risk that capital - even if they can get the credit needed to break ground), and other pieces of this fabric - possibly be successful? Even if IFRs were proven to work as promised out of the box (an obvious misapprehension), everything else that's needed for such a scheme to work is absent, or soon will be.<br><br>Where are the resources, capital and financing supposed to come from to engage in a full-on build out of a brand new, never been real world tested network of IFRs (not to mention the hundreds of non-IFR reactors needed in conjunction to provide replacement power for declining oil)? Is he unaware that the world is for all intents and purposes insolvent and sliding into a monetary and economic abyss?<br><br>In the 2005 DoE report, Robert Hirsch famously noted we needed a decade or two of a full-on wartime mobilization to avert the worst implications of peak oil. Given that this has not happened and is not happening, and that we've flatlined in net energy, how can the pie in the sky dream of untested IFRs powering the world be seen as anything but pure fantasy? <br><br>That is, there is neither the time, nor the capital, nor the political motivation, nor the proven technology needed to move forward on such a hare-brained scheme.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c172561269501649332 title="comment permalink">6/24/11, 6:17 AM</a><br><br>

The dam stops the water, from which mud settles, which would otherwise pass on downstream to build a delta. <br><br>With windmills, we could see a gradual buildup of the land around the mills as dust settles out. If there is a prevailing wind direction, you'd find a mound or a range of dunes downwind from the wind farm. Or you might generate a giant "donut" with the windmills in the center.

Far too many would-be students of mine don't. <br><br>Papabear, I haven't kept up with the recent literature -- if anyone else here can recommend some nonpartisan work on the subject, that would be good. <br><br>Chris, from my perspective it's important to keep a whole systems perspective. I use wood in any number of ways, from paper to write on straight on to 2x4s for building things, and we're planning on installing a wood stove down the road a bit, when funds permit. I also eat plants and animals; that's all part of the cycle of existence. The point that seems crucial to me is that I work to minimize the amount of harm my actions cause to the biosphere, accepting the hard fact that perfection isn't attainable. <br><br>Nobody anywhere in the industrial world understands what the process of decline and fall ahead of us is going to be like, unless they've spent some time in one of the more impoverished corners of the Third World and have the imagination to apply that to industrial nations. <br><br>As for my comment on native trees, I was speaking specifically of coppicing, and more specifically about the fact that eucalypts have become a real problem in some ecosystems to which they've been imported; most of Southern California is one big firetrap these days because eucalypts imported for erosion control, with their very high oil content, go off like Molotov cocktails whenever they get a brush fire. My take is that it's always a good idea to check what your local native (and longtime naturalized) plants will do before importing an exotic from the other side of the world!<br><br>Twilight, if you can get gigawatts out of the one piece of coal per misbehaving child he's supposed to hand out, I'm impressed. <br><br>Rialian, allergies do make things complex! My wife has wheat and dairy allergies as well as celiac disease, which has involved some complicated adjustments. <br><br>DIYer, I don't think the kind of basement-workshop wind turbines I'm recommending here will have any significant impact; it's the huge power-the-grid variety that pull enough energy out of the wind to matter. <br><br>Mauricio, thanks for the reference! Good to know. <br><br>Tyler, most interesting. That could be very useful indeed. <br><br>Justjohn, you'll notice that none of that includes the cancer deaths from uranium mining and mine tailings. If it's relevant to include coal mining deaths, it's relevant to include the equivalent toll from uranium mining and processing. <br><br>Phil, I can't alter people's comments -- all I can do is approve or reject them!<br><br>Ruben, I rather like "the Great Unhinging," not least because of the way it riffs off contemporary prattle about "the Great Turning."

Apparently blogger ate it and barfed, and it was sad because it was the loveliest, most eloquent comment ... anyway, I'll retype it in a less-perfect form. <br><br>In another forum, I can't remember which one just now, a commenter was saying something to the effect that she'd neutralize that cesium with a trip through her compost heap. Although a healthy compost heap can handle things like bones and wood and feces, it has no effect on cesium. It will still be radioactive and still bioaccumulate and still be dangerous in the form of compost. <br><br>The other misconception I have seen is that since cesium has a 30 year half life, it will be around for three decades. Of course the correct answer is that half of it will be around for 30 years. After 60 years, half of the remaining half will decay, and so forth. After twenty half lives, approximately one millionth of the original stuff will remain. So 600 years later, if you had a smallish amount of cesium from Fukushima fallout, it would be down to negligible, probably undetectable, levels. <br><br>In Fukushima itself, or in parts of Ukraine, or wherever one of these power plants blows up (and we are brewing some Fukushimas <a href=http://www.statesman.com/news/nation/ap-impact-us-nuke-regulators-weaken-safety-rules-1549803.html rel=nofollow>here in the US</a>), there are millions of lethal doses of cesium on hand. So some of these places will potentially be dangerous hundreds of years later (neglecting the other isotopes for now). <br><br><a href=http://littlebloginthebigwoods.blogspot.com/ rel=nofollow>Greenpa</a> reckons that it will take about five Fukushima/Chernobyl type events before the top level polity wakes up and determines to shut down the nuke industy for good. He also says that there will probably be about 15 or 20 of them before they finish, simply because shutting them down is not a trivial task. These things do not behave well when you just walk away from them. I think he might be a little pessimistic, but he may be about right.<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c62780594505308662 title="comment permalink">6/24/11, 6:17 PM</a><br><br>

I didn’t think that many bankers and other elites read you, so I don’t that allusion is what he had in mind. Another explanation is that no one is actually listening to you. However, the commentators on your blog and the audience that you are obviously reaching through it and the Energy Bulletin show that there is clearly many that are listening and many times also doing. Unless there can be a better explanation, I think that he was going for effect rather illumination.<br><br>From what else he wrote, I think that was your last chapter, “The Road Ahead” that got his goat. I too am tired of books that describe major problems in great detail and then delve into “solutions” in the last chapter that seem to consist of writing to your congress critter to save the world at the eleventh hour.<br><br>Since as you have pointed out, it is already just after midnight, I thought of what you wrote as being things that might happen at six in the morning. Since Dmitry thinks that we all might be nearly practicing cannibals at that point – well, that is probably one reason why you have disagreements with him – the idea that we might have a functioning government of some sort still at that point which decides to take now unthinking actions against what is now consider untouchables is probable an unlikely one for him. I respect him a lot, but it is not as if something like that happened didn’t in Russia recently. Oh yes, it did, didn’t it?<br><br>Speaking of nuclear vaporware, I think that it might be time to sing its praises. With the flooding along the Missouri threatening to create the fourth big nuclear incident of all time, there is the possibility that we in the U.S. might finally come to our senses about the inevitable hazards/disasters that are involved with fusion. However, I won’t hold my breath on that one. So, if we are fated to throw untold treasure down a rat hole in an effort to make up the coming energy shortfalls, let’s make it a rat hole that has the potential to do the least harm.<br><br>So the fact that molten salt reactors/fast neutron reactors/rings of power are a technology untested on a commercial scale and might never go anywhere despite sending zillions in research and testing is a feature, not a bug. It much is much better to have empty concrete hulls that never got finished, rather than another 100 mile dead zone from the light water reactor that did.<br><br>Therefore, if push comes to shove I am all in favor of thorium, fusion or fairy dust reactors.<br><br>I will end with something remotely connected to this week’s post. If the article from the Proceeding ever gets noticed widely, I’m sure someone (a speech writer for a pro-alternative energy political candidate or organization head) will claim that trying to extract too much energy with industrial windmill can affect our weather, that this is a solution to global warming.

But I can assume that in addition to the engineering of all the physical systems that make up the plant, the countless safety regulations that must be adhered to and the contingency plans that must be in place, there must also be a multitude of financial calculations that need to add up properly over the lifetime of the facility to guarantee both "safe" operation and eventual "safe" decommissioning of the facility. After all, decommissioning is part of the life-cycle of the plant.<br><br>I am forced to wonder - in such financial calculations and projections, is any thought ever given to the possibility that when a plant comes due for decommissioning, there may not be any economy left to speak of ? What happens when the financial means to decommision a nuclear plant are limited or non-existent ?<br><br>Needless to say, the events unfolding in Japan have seeded this line of thought.

The topic of trees in Australia is mostly ideologically driven rather than evidence driven so it's a delicate topic.<br><br>You're right about perfection too. A lot of people for some reason seem to expect perfect solutions to all sorts of things even though the world we inhabit is clearly imperfect. <br><br>I received a lot of flak from all corners about solar power when I wrote the series of articles on solar power and living with it and what it all means. There's this mentality that says, "if I can't power my McMansion, then what good is the system?". People haven't yet quite come to terms with living with less and what nature can provide. Fossil fuels are a crutch and it's also the elephant in the room that few people (outside the peak oil scene) tend to discuss.<br><br>By the way, there is no possibility that the current electrical grid will ever provide a replacement source of energy for a large private vehicle fleet.<br><br>As to the eucalypts, well I've seen them personally in India, Peru and Vietnam - all presents from the Australian government. They're a scary present. During bush fires, because of the oil content in the leaves, if the fire gets into the crown of the tree, then the flame height is usually about 50% higher again than the highest point of the fuel. Now some of the trees on my block(eucalyptus obliqua - messmate) are around 50m tall and will eventually grow to around 90m. Food for thought. Unless you can contain them, please don't grow them - there are plenty of Australian rainforest trees which have evolved to be quite drought hardy (Australia works on a boom and bust cycle which has gone on for millennia) and they are far less flammable.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c4376637180451054300 title="comment permalink">6/25/11, 2:13 AM</a><br><br>

Fred M, over at TOD posted a link to this 1981 Reader's Digest article: <a href=http://journeytoforever.org/biofuel_library/methane_pain.html rel=nofollow>Jean Pain: France's King of Green Gold</a>, about producing one large annual batch of biogas while heating water as well (which may have been linked to here previously). I imagine he had some mechanized assistance, creating his large "cake" of biomass every year, but this is something I've considered; creating a huge compost pile to generate heat, for a greenhouse perhaps, and compost of course. With over 60" of rain most years, we certainly have enough veg matter. An ongoing system of soil manufacturing while reaping the energy byproducts seems doable. This may be a better option than the continuous feed idea I've been considering.<br><br>Some great links at the bottom of the article.<br><br>Regarding the debate about fission:<br>Count me with the naysayers.

Maybe they provide them with organic gardening advice to keep them at bay?"<br><br>In fact, the Gaviotas community predated the narco-terrorism that swept Colombia, but they found themselves in the dead center of activity in this regard once it came into existence, as they had chosen the most inhospitable section of Colombia in which to launch their project.<br><br>For years, Gaviotas had been regularly sending teams of mechanics and doctors to all the neighboring villages, installing their innovations (e.g. ram pumps), treating the sick, etc, and many villagers visited the Gaviotas community for classes in horticulture, irrigation, wind power, for medical treatment, etc. Thus, they had fully integrated themselves into the surrounding communities, and were highly regarded by all sides. <br><br>So, like the Red Cross, all sides in the political turmoil that erupted respected Gaviotas as neutral and humanitarian, and did not assault or threaten them, at least for the most part. <br><br>The book says "It became known throughout the region that no one came to Gaviotas armed.' Of course, it was not the FARC (who respected the no arms rule) or other guerilla orgs, but the Army that threatened them the most, landing armed helicopters and soldiers from time to time, bivouacking on the air strip, asserting government authority over the community. After one such incident, the Army engaged guerillas twenty kilometers away, and commandeered Gaviotas' all-solar hospital as emergency medical support to treat their casualties. As the book puts it:<br><br>"In the meantime, a coincidental surge in the arrival of injured civilians suggested that the guerillas were also bringing their casualties. At times it was not simple to maintain this equilibrium. Once Magnus Zethelius discovered that he had bedded two opposing combatants in the same room. One had seventeen lacerations; the other a bullet in his neck. Magnus had worked so many hours straight that he forgot which was which. Earlier they had been trying to kill each other - now the one who could still walk was bringing the other water."<br><br>In fact, this is one of the reasons I recommend people - especially those who tend toward the survivalist mentality - read the book, because it highlights what real community can achieve even in a milieu of war and social tumult. <br><br>So many Americans, in particular in the 'green' camp, are utterly at a loss to understand examples like the one given above, assuming that "human nature" is fundamentally evil, greedy, violent, and that mass mob violence is inevitable as economic and energy decline sets in. I think this is possible, but I know it is not necessary, as examples like that of Gaviotas demonstrate. <br><br>In fact, I would argue that such evidence makes it clear that it tends to be those in power - specifically, government at all levels - who demonstrate evil, greedy, violent intent in desperate times, and that it is from this direction where the primary danger lies - not nearly so much from one's fellow citizens.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c4852144319436551600 title="comment permalink">6/25/11, 1:25 PM</a><br><br>

Anybody who thinks that radionuclides can be neutralized in a compost heap is deep into cluelessness.

As for Greenpa's estimate, I'm sorry to say that he's likely right about what it'll take to end the nuclear age, but the chance that existing nukes will be decommissioned safely is pretty small. In my blog/novel <a href=http://starsreach.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>Star's Reach</a>, set about four centuries from now in the deindustrial future, one of the less pleasant features of the landscape of Meriga is the dead zones around old nukes -- and there are quite a few of them. <br><br>Dr. W, yes, it was the fact that I proposed solutions that seems to have irritated him. If I understand him correctly, he's into the One Big Crash theory of decline, and so my thesis -- that the crisis we're approaching is one phase of our decline; that we'll come out the other end of it, and not as cave dwelling cannibals, in a few decades; that there will be a period of stabilization and partial recovery at that time, and getting ideas into circulation now, so that the new governments of that time may be able to use them, may be a useful stragegy -- is not something he's going to appreciate. <br><br>As for windmills as a solution to global warming, well, it's already been proposed by a commenter here, so you're probably right.

I actually find it hard to imagine any meteorological scenario that could really bring such extreme and persistent drought to the region, given the boiling cauldron of the Gulf of Mexico so nearby. Even in the driest years of the long-term 20th century droughts, places like Tennessee still managed to squeak out 20-30" of rain, and Pleistocene climate reconstructions don't ever push it all the way to hard desert, just to grassland/savannah. You're just hard pressed to make the blocking of the Gulf and the capping high pressure NEVER weaken enough to let the steam burst through and the storms start popping up. Now, the second phase, with an intense monsoon climate, is easier to picture; though without the Himalayas to cut off the arctic I bet there would still be some pretty significant cold outbreaks, and probably some winter rains near the repositioned coast. The same pattern that would cut off winter rain would probably bring down polar air (in the Indian Subcontinent the mountains block these and create warming downslope effects in winter).. And even an Arctic that is much warmer than at present would still be pretty dang cold in January!<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c4449238460065282665 title="comment permalink">6/27/11, 5:25 AM</a><br><br>

Greenhouse warming does not increase the input of energy to the earth's surface. I don't see an a priori reason why warming the globe as a whole should increase the rate at which that Kleidon power-generating earth system should run. Weather is not driven by temperature and moisture per se, but by GRADIENTS in temperature and moisture. All the models actually predict that temperature gradients will DECREASE with increasing greenhouse gases -- more warming in the poles than the tropics. When you have decreased thermal gradients plus increased atmospheric moisture, I'm not sure what comes next. Change, sure, but in the direction of greater intensity? Don't know. The energy available to evaporate water from the oceans is the same; you might wind up with higher global humidity (on average) but no increase in global precipitation. <br><br>What might increase the total energy to drive the system would be increased absorption of incoming sunlight. This gets in to the snow-and-clouds feedbacks. Snow/ice should decrease, certainly; but it tends to already be in areas that don't receive much incoming solar radiation in the first place. Clouds are a real wild card, and probably one of the major long-term stabilizing negative feedbacks in the system (hotter - more evaporation - more clouds - more reflected sunlight - not so hot). <br><br>Change, for sure.. but the details..???<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c2368895052096060415 title="comment permalink">6/27/11, 5:45 AM</a><br><br>

But it does decrease the output, to a point. That is why the system gets hotter, to the new point of equilibrium with the extra-planetary thermal gradient. The anticipated increase in the frequency and intensity of storms is in part predicated on the behavior dynamics of perturbed systems. Increased storminess would be a local manifestation of a re-balancing system. This is why climatic destabilization is a much more descriptive term than global warming. So, while the global temperature gradient should decrease during and as a result of re-balancing, the same is not necessarily true of more local gradients. For instance the latitudinal gradient of the oceans should be reduced due to their thermal mass, while the longitudinal continental effect is increased, particularly at high latitudes. The moisture and cloudiness elements of the equation are indeed difficult to incorporate into a functional model, but there doesn't seem to be any reason to suspect their influence to be particularly stabilizing on a local scale. It is also important to consider that gradients, whether of temperature or moisture, are temporal as well as spatial phenomena.<br><br>In my estimation the potential for successive damaging weather events to erode unprepared infrastructure and consume resources that could otherwise enable a less chaotic and destructive re-balancing of the human element of the earth's system equation is quite high.

To me, derailleur technology is the sort that will outlast resource constraints for quite a while, because it's high technology but low resource intensive; it doesn't depend on electronics, synthetic fluids, or other 'gizmos' likely to wear out or break before the rest of the product does. I even have my doubts about the 'click' technology -- once those babies go out, they're pretty much done, and you may as well get a new one.

See <a href=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2006/4/the-source-of-europes-mild-climate/1 rel=nofollow>The Source of Europe's Mild Climate: The notion that the Gulf Stream is responsible for keeping Europe anomalously warm turns out to be a myth</a> for details.<br><br>This is one of the issues I have with the current state of public "thinking" on climate disruption - it's shot through with myths and non-evidence-based claims, which 'true believers', as with all ideologies, do not think to question.<br><br>Don't get me wrong - I studied the evidence for 'global warming' (better: climate disruption) for many years in an attempt to get at the truth of such a politically polarized topic, and came to the conclusion (based on a preponderance of scientific evidence - really, a consilience of inductions approach) that climate disruption is underway, accelerating, and that anthropogenic factors play a large part. <br><br>But fear mongering and speculation (on both sides) has become such a part of this debate that it can be difficult to separate fact from fiction. <br><br>As an example, the demise of the global conveyor belt is not at all as likely as many claim - it is in fact a hypothetical, speculative, without any firm evidence (to my knowledge), and has all the hallmarks of what HL Mencken referred to as one of the 'endless series of hobgoblins' with which the public is 'menaced' in order to control them. <br><br>One thing that my studies of the global climate system convinced me of was that it is an astonishingly complex system about which we, as yet, know very little, while pretending to be able to make definitive predictions (with very, very rarely being presented with associated error bars, especially in the mass media reports). We're just not that smart or knowledgable.<br><br>The reasons for us to be cautious in regard to the conveyor belt hypothesis have a heck of a lot more to do with the precautionary principle than with solid human knowledge about that aspect of the climate system and how we are impacting it. In other words, as in so many other areas, an uncertain reality trumps our desire for certainty. <br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c3756954640145197427 title="comment permalink">6/29/11, 12:25 PM</a><br><br>

Interesting, but fundamentaly flawed.<br><br>First of all, having had the chance to study this first hand with some of the Climate Scientists we carried on the icebreaker HEALY; no scientist I've met says that failure of the Thermohaline circulation will result in Europe having a "New Ice Age". But they did all say that Europe might get much colder, as it was during the late mediaval period.<br><br>The flaws I noticed in the article:<br><br>Mr. Seager is not the first person to figure out that in the mid-latitudes of the Temperate Zone, with the wind and weather primarily travelling from West to East, the West side of the continent, down wind of the ocean is warmer than the East side, which gets continental air. (Though he seems to imply it in his article) The refinement of what happens when air is sqeezed over the Rockies is nice, but a refinement of general principle. The sufferings of the Plymouth Pilgrims at the same latitude as Spain was noted at the time (early 1600's) and was an early piece of data for the difference between East and West coasts.<br><br>He sets up a straw man: why is the NE Atlantic Coast so much colder than Europe, and proceeds to demolish it with a computer model.<br><br>You might have noticed the caveat he provides that his argument only applies to Europe South of Norway, but does not explain why. It might have been awkward for him to explain the Northeastern arm of the Gulf Stream that keeps the North Cape ice free, while Barrow, Alaska at the same latitude is icebound in winter.<br><br>What he does _not_ do is directly compare an ocean with a thermohaline circulation (the North Atlantic) with one that does not (the North Pacific).<br><br>If he had, the question would have been "Why is the Pacific Coast of North America Colder than the Atlantic Coast of Europe for a given latitude?"<br><br>One answer might be that the Pacific is much wider, and more heat is lost from the Kurishio Current before it gets to us (I live on the Olympic Peninsula); but he would have to admit that heat might indeed be transported via an ocean current (water conducts heat 25 times better than air).<br><br>Another answer might be that due to geographical differences, such as the Aleutian Islands and the narrowness of the Bering Straits, warmer water is prevented from reaching much of Alaska, as opposed to the more open Denmark Straits and the Norwegian Sea on the Atlantic side.<br><br>I posit that the difference is the Thermohaline Circulation in the Atlantic, and the lack of it in the Pacific.<br><br>The source of the water for this is the water entering the Arctic from the Pacific side through the Bering Straits. As sea ice forms in the Arctic the remaining water becomes cooler and more saline. It exits along the bottom on the Atlantic side, driving the thermohaline circulation when it drops off the continental shelf of Northern Europe into the Atlantic basin.<br><br>I agree with you and Mr. Seager that failure of the Gulf Stream will _not_ cover Europe in glaciers. What is more likely is that Western European climate will change from similar to Oregon and Washington to similar to British Columbia and Alaska.<br><br>I like Les's hypothesis about hurricanes and tornadoes though.<br><br>Continued Global Climate change and reduced sea ice in the Arctic might counter this to a certain extent, especially for Scandinavia.<br><br>Glenn,<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Olympic Peninsula<br>Washington State<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c5355503546732027002 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 9:40 AM</a><br><br>

As sea ice is lost, the albedo of the Arctic will be reduced; the angle of incidence is so low that I'm not sure how much that will add to warming. It most certainly will make the Arctic Ocean a much more effective _radiator_ of heat. This may tend to increase the difference between the Tropics and the Poles (at least the North Pole; until the mass of the Antarctic melts off, effects in the Southern hemisphere will be minimal) So, I expect that northern hemisphere weather will indeed become more violent as the Arctic sea ice diminishes in area.<br><br>Glenn,<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Olympic Peninsula<br>Washington State<br><br><a href=santa-isnt-bringing-gigawatts.html#c8241149691092478168 title="comment permalink">6/30/11, 9:46 AM</a><br><br>
