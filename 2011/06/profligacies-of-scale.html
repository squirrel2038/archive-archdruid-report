The logic applied in last week’s post to photovoltaic solar power can be applied more generally to a fairly wide range of technologies that can, under the right circumstances, provide a modest supply of electricity to power those things for which electricity is really the most sensible power source. I want to talk about a couple of those in tthe weeks to come, partly for the sake of completeness, partly because the options I have in mind offer some distinct advantages, and partly because touching on a series of examples will make it easier to grasp certain common themes that aren’t often addressed on those rare occasions when discussions of the future of technology manage to make it out of the realm of popular mythology in the first place.<br><br>I don’t mean that last comment as a joke, by the way. If mythology can be defined as the set of stories that people in a given society use to make sense of the universe and themselves, contemporary beliefs about the future of technology in the cultural mainstream of the industrial world fill that role, doubled, tripled, and in spades. Those of my readers who have come to take the challenge of peak oil seriously, and tried to discuss it with family members, coworkers, and friends who haven’t yet grappled with the issues themselves, can testify just how forcefully most of these latter cling to the belief that some technological gimmick or other will bail us out.<br><br>Technology, for a great people nowadays, is their source of meaning and their hope of salvation. Most liberals, conservatives, atheists, and plenty of people who think they belong to some other religion all put their trust in the great god Progress and wait prayerfully for him to bring a future that, they insist, must be better than the present. However poorly founded that faith may be, it plays an immensely important role in today’s industrial cultures, and the death of Progress in our time thus bids fair to deal the same shattering blow to our present certainties that the death of God announced by Nietzsche measured out to the equally comfortably certainties of the nineteenth century.<br><br>If anything, the approaching experience may be the harsher of the two. What Nietzche was saying, stripped of his ornate imagery, was that the people of Europe in his time no longer believed in the Christian myths and doctrines they claimed to accept, and needed to own up to the anthropocentric cult of power that had become their actual religion. That may have been true; still, it’s one thing to realize that you no longer believe things you were raised to think were good and right and true; it’s quite another, and far more devastating, to believe in something with all your heart and have it disproved right in front of your eyes. The religion of progress claims to be justified by works, not faith; during the three centuries or so of technological expansion, the apparent confirmation of the myth gave it immense strength; as the age of progress ends and we enter on three centuries or more of technological regress, the resulting body blow to our culture’s fondest beliefs and hopes will dominate the cultural psychology of an age.<br><br>It’s the effort to avoid that profoundly unwelcome experience that drives current attempts to insist that we can maintain our contemporary lifestyles, and even provide them to the population of the world’s nonindustrialized (and never to be industrialized) countries, using renewable energy sources. That same effort drives plenty of other exercises in futility, to be sure, and many of them are a good deal more dysfunctional than the dream of a world of middle class comforts powered by wind turbines and solar panels. Still, if we’re going to get beyond the mythology of a dying religion and talk about the future in more useful terms, it’s crucial to start by owning up to the fact that renewable sources are not going to allow anyone to maintain the kind of extravagant energy-wasting lifestyle that most people in the industrial world think of as normal.<br><br>What they can do instead is rather more valuable. There are certain technologies that are either dependent on electricity, or are easiest to provide using electricity, that contribute mightily to human welfare. (Long range radio communication is an example of the first kind; refrigeration for food storage is an example of the second.) If these technologies can get through the present crisis in a sustainable form, they will contribute to human welfare as far into the future as you care to look. Renewable energy sources that provide a modest amount of electricity on a local scale can keep a good many of these technologies going, and if enough people here and now either learn how to build and maintain renewable systems on that scale, on the one hand, or learn how to build and maintain the technologies themselves on the same modest and local scale, on the other, our civilization may actually accomplish the surprisingly rare feat of adding something worthwhile to the long-term toolkit of our species.<br><br>The modest amount and the local scale are vital to any such project. Right now, anyone with a fairly good set of hand tools and a good general knowledge of electricity, carpentry, and metalworking can build a wind turbine for a few hundred dollars. I can say this with some confidence because I helped do exactly that, for a good deal less, while at college in the early 1980s. The turbine itself was basically a two-blade propeller cut, shaped, and sanded from a block of fir; the conversion of rotary motion to electricity was done by an alternator salvaged from an old truck; the tail that kept it facing into the wind, the safety shutoff that swung it out of the path of the wind when the wind velocity got too high, and the tricky doodad that allowed it to turn freely while still getting electricity down to the batteries in the little shed at the base, were all fabricated out of scrap parts and sheet metal. We used a disused power pole to put the turbine up where the wind blew freely, but if that hadn’t been there, an octet truss tower – one of Bucky Fuller’s better designs – could easily have been put together out of readily available hardware and bolted onto a hand-poured concrete foundation.<br><br>The design wasn’t original, not by a long shot; half a dozen old appropriate tech books from the Seventies have the same design or its kissing cousin, and it’s one of a half dozen or so standard designs that came out of the ferment of those years. The most important difference was between horizontal axis from vertical axis models. A horizontal axis wind turbine is the kind most people think of, with blades like a propeller facing into the wind and a tail or some other gimmick to pivot it around in the right direction. A vertical axis wind turbine is less familiar these days, though you used to see examples all over the place back in the day; the business end looked either like one side of an eggbeater – the Darreius turbine – or an oil drum cut in half lengthwise, and the two sides staggered around the vertical shaft – the Savonius turbine. Some of the standard designs yielded high speed and low torque, which is what you want for generating electricity; some of them produced high torque and low speed, which is what you want for pumping water or most other uses of mechanical power.<br><br>All the information needed to design and build one or more of the standard models is easy to come by nowadays – literally dozens of books from the time cover the basic concepts, and it’s far from hard to find detailed plans for building your own. It’s also not too difficult for those who lack the basic technical skills to find small wind turbines of quite respectable quality for sale, though the price is going to be a good deal more than you’d shell out for an old truck alternator, a chunk of fir six feet by eight inches by four inches, and the rest of the hardware we used to cobble together our turbine. Either way, if you live in an area with average winds and your home isn’t surrounded by tall trees, steep hills, or skyscrapers, your odds of being able to run a respectable 12 volt system are pretty good.<br><br>Still, it will come as no surprise to regular readers of this blog that very little of this wealth of practical information receives much in the way of attention nowadays. Instead, the concept of wind power has been monopolized by a recently minted industry devoted to building, servicing, and promoting giant wind turbines that provide electricity to the grid. The giant turbines have their virtues, no question; compared to most other energy production technologies, certainly, they’re safe and clean, and their net energy yield is a respectable 8 or 9 to 1, which beats the stuffing out of most other alternative energy sources. Still, the idea that serried ranks of giant wind turbines will enable us all to keep on using energy at today’s extravagant rates runs headlong into at least two difficulties.<br><br>The first difficulty is intermittency. A wind turbine, obviously enough, produces power only when the wind is blowing, and it’s a safe bet that no matter where you put turbines, the wind won’t always be blowing. That wouldn’t be a problem at all if Americans were used to using electricity when it happens to be available, and doing something else with their time when it’s not, but that’s not the way Americans do things any more. Just now, intermittency isn’t much of a problem, since modern gas-fired power plants can be cycled up and down promptly to respond to any shortage of power from the turbines, but if your plan is to replace the gas-fired plants (and the coal-fired ones, which can’t be cycled up and down so quickly) with wind turbines, you’ve got a problem. You have an even bigger problem if you want to rely on solar as well as wind, since then you’re dependent on two intermittent energy sources, and when they both go down at the same time – as, by Murphy’s law, they inevitably will – you’re left with no power going into the grid at all.<br><br>The second difficulty, as discussed in previous posts here, is complexity. Those giant turbines, it bears remembering, are not made out of spare truck alternators, blocks of fir, and other readily accessible and easily managed parts. They are triumphs of modern engineering, which means in practice that they depend on baroque supply chains, high-tech manufacturing processes, and massive investment, not to mention plenty of fossil fuels and, more generally, a society that has plenty of cheap energy to spare for projects on a gargantuan scale. Nor is a giant wind turbine sitting all by itself on a hilltop particularly useful to much of anyone; it gains its economic viability through connection to the electrical grid, which is itself an immense technostructure with its own even more sprawling supply, manufacturing, and investment requirements. If industrial society finds itself unable to maintain any one of the factors that make the grid and the giant turbines possible, then it doesn’t matter how useful they might be; they won’t be around.<br><br>Homescale windpower systems suffer from the intermittency issue, but then so does nearly every other option for providing electricity on that scale, and we’ve already discussed at some length the solution to it: get used to using electricity when it’s available, or to storing up modest amounts of it in inexpensive storage batteries and using that supply sparingly. The challenge of complexity, on the other hand, is not something a homescale windpower system has to deal with at all. Even in the absence of salvageable alternators, and there are quite literally hundreds of millions of them lying unused in junkyards across the United States, a generator that will turn rotary motion into direct current is not a challenging project. I built a simple one in elementary school, for example, and although it wasn’t really suited to wind turbine use – most of the structural elements were made from paperclips, with a toy horseshoe magnet to provide the field, and the amount of current it produced was just about enough to get a decent glow out of a very small light bulb – the principle can readily be scaled up.<br><br>In the kind of future we can realistically expect, in other words, homescale windpower will almost certainly be a viable technology, while giant wind turbines of the modern sort almost certainly won’t. Now of course it’s a safe bet that the windpower industry as it now exists will keep on building, servicing, and promoting giant wind turbines as long as it’s possible to do so, so the small chance that the giant turbines might actually be viable is covered. What isn’t covered yet is the very large chance that small wind turbines of the sort that can be built and maintained in a basement workshop could provide a real benefit during the difficult decades ahead of us.<br><br>In order to respond to that range of possibilities, homescale windpower units need to find their way back into the conversation of our time and, more importantly, up above the rooftops of homes across the modern world. Professionally manufactured wind turbines of the right scale are a good start, and those green wizards in training who have the money and lack the fairly modest technical skills to build their own could do worse than to buy and install one. Still, there’s also a huge role here for the homebuilt turbine, and for those individuals whose willingness to get to work shaping turbine blades and bolting together octet truss towers might, as things unfold, lead to a future career.<br><br>Promoters of giant wind turbines, and for that matter of centralized power generation schemes of all kinds, tend to talk quite a bit about economies of scale. In an expanding economy with a stable or growing resource base, that sort of talk often makes sense, though the extent to which those economies of scale are a product of direct and indirect government subsidies to transportation, financing, and large businesses generally is not something economists like to talk about. Still, in a world facing economic contraction, resource depletion, and a loss of complexity potentially capable of rendering a great deal of today’s infrastructure useless or worse, the balance swings the other way. In the face of a future where small, cheap, localized approaches that are sparing in their use of resources, relying on massive, expensive, centralized, resource-intensive power plants of any kind is not an economy but a profligacy of scale, and one that we very probably will not be able to afford for much longer.

One interesting type is the nickel-iron cell, also known as the "Edison Cell". These devices use an alkaline electrolyte, potassium hydroxide, and have a service life measured in decades. They are also extremely durable and relatively benign from an environmental standpoint. The earliest electric automobiles were powered by batteries of Edison cells. <br><br>Some technological conspiracy theorists believe that this technology was never widely adopted because it would not have been commercially profitable as a mass-produced product. The cells lasted so long that there was little money to be made in the replacement market.<br><br>For experimental purposes, an Edison cell is easily constructed from two small iron and nickel plates, a mason jar, some insulating material like the perfboard used in electronic projects, a few wires and the potassium hydroxide solution.

I know, it's a sign of the times to come!<br><br>Anyway, another great post as usual JMG. I can concur that trying to talk to people about these issues really does bring out some serious defences - to the degree that I don't bother much these days (though I can't always help myself!). Which makes your description of the 'Myth of Progress' as a currently failing religion/God/world view very pertinent to me. There really is <i>so</i> little awareness of the reality of the predicament we are facing in general knowledge - and the dangers of this belief in progress - that the prevailing belief is that we WILL fix it, it's just a question of time.<br><br>There's a post in today's Guardian to just that effect - that the IPCC are going to be <i>considering</i> options for geo-engineering, presumably as the consensus is slowly emerging that there'll be no consensus on us changing our habits - so we better <i>throw more technology at it!</i><br><br>But this post brings up a related (kind of) question I've been meaning to ask you, and it relates to the question of finding a world view that supports your life, yet also fits in with the <i>reality</i> of actually living it. I ask you this question as I have been profoundly grateful to you over the last few years for not only your knowledge (and it's application) - which is pretty impressive, but even more so with it's method of delivery - which to my tuned-in ear is ever generous, compassionate and accommodating (of others' views). I presume this is rooted in your druidry? I have no real knowledge of this, and would be interested in a few pointers - but pointers which avoid the New Age pitfalls of so many ancient belief systems - I have to admit, that I have a hard time with New Ageism and anthropomorphism generally.<br><br>I don't lack for a world view - but mine is rooted in rationality and science (though not the scientific institution), and I guess I would call myself an atheist. However, I do believe we have a religious urge to find meaning in our lives, which is deep and innate - it's a little later in my life perhaps than I would like, but worship of the sun and natural systems is really making sense to me now! <br><br>So perhaps, a post-progress world will see a reversion to more meaningful belief systems?

The cost of upgrading the power lines from the the north of the country, where presumably the giant wind, solar and tidal generating farms will be safely out of sight, and the populated south where the majority of the population live (people will be expecting to carry on as normal) has doubled in estimated cost - from around 300 million to around 600 million - and this before any work has been done. <br><br>I just hope that instead of abandoning the whole idea of renewables, the focus - and the budget - goes towards first weatherising every home in the country, changing the planning laws so all new build meets stringent energy regulations, and fostering, subsidising and enabling the sort of local energy production you outline.

It's based on a vertical design. Since I know squat about electricity, I have no idea how much actual usable energy you get out of a 3.2 kwh system. The brochure says it works in a 3-4 mph breeze, although the website says more like 5. It also says they're planning to scale up to a 5 kwh and 25 kwh models. It works 360 degrees without having to turn to face the wind. It does't have to turn off in high winds. It will be offered with optional battery and will be sold through a big box store. It's not cheap. The brochure claims $1200-$1500, but the website explains that's based on about $5-6,000 worth of federal and state incentives (which run out this year here in Maine). Still, at $7000 installed, it's half the price of current home windmills on the market that I'm aware of. <br><br>Here near the Maine coast we rarely have a day without at least some breeze, while we have about 6 months with little sun for pv...<br><br>You can read about it at sauerenergy.com.

Many people are not aware that the recycling of lead acid batteries is done in places like Africa where the environmental standards are nonexistent. One charging mistake can permanently damage a bank of lead acid batteries.<br><br>The first problem we will have to face is not likely to be permanent failure of the grid, but intermittent failures, that is, rolling blackouts or random but temporary failures. Having lived in a third world country, I can tell you first hand that the most likely for the grid to fail is when you (and everyone else) need it the most, when it first gets dark and you need to turn on the lights or when you are cooking dinner.<br><br>I am working on the design of what is known as a grid fall back system. This system is centered on a battery bank which can be charged a multiple of ways, from the grid, from PV panels, or in an emergency from a generator run by bio-fuels. It would have to be a very serious emergency for me to waste bio-fuel in a generator. I am having to design this system myself because none of the PV contractors in this area will consider such a design, nor will they consider using nickel-iron batteries. In fact, they have never heard of nickel-iron batteries. Eventually I will evolve this system into an off-grid system. <br><br>Nicole Foss has installed such a system in her home but with lead acid batteries<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c8061333573229862630 title="comment permalink">6/16/11, 6:37 AM</a><br><br>

The Archdruid Report is one place where I come for that optimism. Thanks for that.<br><br> Today I had to go to my local bank and was disappointed to see that they had reorganised the interior to an open plan design, sadly the walls of security glass I had in mind to salvage after the fall for a desalination unit were gone.

I've tried to get him onboard the peak-oil issue as much as anyone else I know but haven't had much luck so far, though rather than poohbahing the idea as he once used to he's seemingly more in denial as every prediction of I've made relating to the economy and commodity swings have come to pass.

What I do with it when it is either abandoned or becomes "community porperty" will depend a lot on the expertise I have and the number of local allies I can quickly mobilise.<br><br> I've long given up the idea of selling up and situating myself and family in a safer location due to limited finances, unless one of a few wealthy relatives suddenly dies leaving me everything (not unlikely but something I wouldn't want to count on), so I have to use what resources are at hand and are likely to become available. <br><br> Surviving the first sudden contraction and utilising as much local knowledge as possible is going to be crucial. Salvaging what I can in the midst of it all will be a real test of survival and cunning, along with knowing as many of the locals who can be of help is also part of that overall strategy (I have local friends now who are in the local police and the local "criminal" community who I hope to forge into some kind of combined local security unit, though they aren't aware of that fact yet. Which will lead to commandeering local assets, of course.).<br><br> There's the matter of what laws will be made that will shape the community and what penaties to apply when the time comes as well. I think I've spent as much time on this issue as much as any other in the years of preparation I've considered, and angle that hasn't been discussed in depth across the highways of the peak-oil universe. Also, who gets preferred treatment when scarcity of resources effects everyone? Is some kind of moral framework essential, or are non-contributing survivors left out of the choice? I'm speaking of the elderly and the sick as much as the young, unskilled and defenseless. Hard decisions that must be dealt with when the time comes.<br><br> I've come to the conclusion that everone must be given a minimum of fair care and an opportunity to be a contributor. Even if a survivor is merely able to act as a boundary lookout, they can be of use. Medical supplies will have been hoarded and only used when necessary as they will likely not be resupplied, and as most medical equipment is not reusable only emergency usage will be allowed. I expect there'll be a certain attrition rate that'll extend the lifetime of the last supplies. Again, hard decisions to make but ones we'll all likely see as the decline sets in...<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c4652968980347238605 title="comment permalink">6/16/11, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

Batteries aren't something I know a lot about, so this is very useful info. <br><br>Matt, it's hard to say whether my religious beliefs or my ecological commitments came first, though it's certainly true that I didn't encounter Druidry as an organized path until quite a few years after I woke up ecologically -- like most Druids, I didn't "convert," I stumbled across the modern Druid tradition and discovered that what it taught was what I'd believed all along. The websites for the <a href=http://www.aoda.org rel=nofollow>Ancient Order of Druids in America</a>, the order I currently head, and the <a href=http://www.druidry.org rel=nofollow>Order of Bards Ovates and Druids</a>, where I had my original training, might be good places to look if you're interested; my book <a href="http://redwheelweiser.com/detail.html?id=9781578633548" rel=nofollow>The Druidry Handbook</a> goes into more detail. <br><br>Chris, despite having taken part in the building of a wind turbine, the fine points of engineering one are not my strong suit.

When energy just isn't there to serve us and when progress does not save the day, I doubt that most will gain an understanding of how dependent on these things we've been.

Like all green wizard projects, it depends on local factors!<br><br>Mary, it's an interesting project. They've basically taken the classic Savonius design and tweaked it for increased efficiency. Since it's still not yet in production, it's anyone's guess how well it will stand up to actual use, but if they engineer it well and don't cut corners, it could work. <br><br>Frankster, thanks for the link. <br><br>Thijs, that's a question that's occurred to me as well. I have no idea what the answer might be. <br><br>Brian, it's a good link -- thanks for reposting it. <br><br>DIYer, true enough. If your backyard wind turbine breaks down, by contrast, it might succeed in frightening some squirrels. <br><br>Kathy, the problem down the road won't be finding a way to use the power locally, it'll be keeping the turbine up and running in the absence of spare parts. You might look into lower-tech turbines you can put in the new one's place when it finally breaks down. <br><br>Rashakor, vertical turbines have advantages, and so do horizontal ones. It's the opposite of a one size fits all situation!<br><br>Mat, there are ways to simplify and streamline the workload -- and of course I've been saying all along that families of the future will be much better off if at least one member stays home and produces value in the household economy, instead of going to a conventional job to earn money. <br><br>Planner, that's certainly one way to approach the matter. I've noticed, though, that the religion of progress is losing devotees at a noticeable rate these days, so there's definitely also a place for the wild-eyed heretic shouting "Progress is dead!" <br><br>Ghung, the links all work nicely; many thanks. Yes, the tower's a challenge, but so long as you don't live in a place with zoning issues, there are options. <br><br>Matt and Jess, that there's a classic, though it's only one way to build a Savonius. As for amateur radio, it's still a going concern, though you're right that too much of today's ham radio uses high-tech rigs straight out of the box. Alternator safety tips -- well, I don't recall any particular dangers, but you'll want to check with those who know more about the subject. <br><br>Evan, the tests cited on The Oil Drum were sharply and, I think, rightly criticized for drawing sweeping conclusions from a narrow and poorly sited sample, and for measuring those conclusions against current energy use habits -- which, as I've said repeatedly, will not be supportable by any means once fossil fuels run short. <br><br>That said, location is crucial -- my house, for example, is on a hillside surrounded by trees, and so wind power of any kind almost certainly won't be an option for me. If I lived in a small town in Nebraska, on the other hand, odds are I'd be able to install a wind turbine and do very well by it.<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c706612544038722875 title="comment permalink">6/16/11, 11:24 AM</a><br><br>

Firstly we figure out how much energy we can get extract from air of a certain density moving at a certain speed. Let's say we're at sea level, so air density is 1.23 kg/cubic meter. We'll say the turbine is sitting in a 20mph (8.9 meter/second) breeze. The http://sauerenergy.com site gives the swept area (width*height for a horizontal axis turbine) as 1.34 square meters. To get the energy available from this breeze, plug these values into this equation: 1/2 * air density * swept area * air velocity cubed = 581 Watts. The power curve chart shows 1000 watts at 20mph. So either these cats have found a way to build a machine that can extract more energy than is physically available from the air blowing across it, or the buyer is going to be rather dissatisfied with the real world output. I'd guess the latter. Especially if you factor that a turbine is not going to be able to exceed the Bentz limit of 59% (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27_law). And in the case of this apparently drag-based turbine (the best you can expect for energy extraction is 17% (see here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine_aerodynamics#Maximum_power_of_a_drag_based_wind_turbine). So if the wind has 581 Watts of energy and your turbine is 17% efficient, then you can expect to get 98 Watts. Will it work? Yes. Will it do what they claim? Probably not. They say on the site is Savonius based as JMG pointed out, but it does have what appear to be lift based blades around the perimeter, so it is possible this device can do better than 17% maximum for a drag based machine but it's likely well under 30% efficient. This is why horizontal axis turbines are better suited for making electricity. They are much better at extracting available energy. However, if you need something simple, cheap, low-speed with higher torque that operates in winds blowing in any direction (say, running a water pump), then a drag based turbine is well suited.<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c1334188143988474481 title="comment permalink">6/16/11, 1:45 PM</a><br><br>

Those of us who have studied small scale wind energy are always looking forward to breakthroughs in efficiency and reliability, and have also seen many claims that have as yet to be proven, especially regarding VAWTs. There are inherent problems with the verticle designs:<br><br>VAWTs have little or no aerodynamic overspeed protection. Most rely on some form of braking, turning the unit into a sail. No way to turn its full profile out of the wind (furling).<br><br>They have only a single axis, single point of support which is at 90 degrees to the wind.<br><br>One or more of the vanes or blades is always moving directly against the wind, reducing efficiency vs. horizontal turbines where all blades are producing power.<br><br>Question: Have the engineers done a sight survey, actually installing an anemometer/data logger?

Regarding the myth of technological innovation and progress we should look at the scale that is implicit in the mythology and how scale is experienced by individual people. <br><br>When economists say "economies of scale" they always seem to mean large- or global- scale, never the appropriate scale. When people hear about peak oil, or climate change for that matter, and invoke the myth of technology and Progress, "innovation will save us", they seem to also invoke the large-scale. More importantly the implicit assertion is that these problems will be solved by *someone else*, presumably a large-scale organization. With our current situation we seem to have large-scale organizations solving our problems and dilemmas with highly complex systems while on the household-scale we experience that complexity as very simple systems. Purchase a box, plug it into a wall, press buttons. <br><br>I agree that in the future the large-scale complex systems will falter and examples of complexity in societies across the globe will diminish, that we will be "in decline". On the household level this will be experienced as "complexification" of people lives: Teach the kids how to better tend the chickens, borrow your brother's hand-plane to finish a new windmill prop, help your neighbor find a source of bone-meal to fix phosphorous deficiencies in her vegetables. . . In short if one follows a Green wizard-like path efficiency, innovation and technological development will occur rapidly and continually in your life for as long as you live it. Life will become more complex for the individual, household and local community. <br><br>I think it is a key component to the mythology of progress in our day and age that all the progress is done by other people. What many people are really afraid of and resist is responsibility and self-improvement. On the other hand- Many people in this discussion seem to be excited!

A few basics from the '70's when I first looked into this.<br><br>Horizontal V.S. vertical axis machines: Horizontal axis machines produce more usable power per swept area, due in part to being able to utilize airfoil section blades and facing into the wind, reducing drag; also easier to feather or turn aside to deal with excess wind.<br><br>Vertical axis: Being omnidirectional, respond better to gusts and shifts, more suitable to a site with changing winds. Vulnerable to overspeeding problems, generally less "efficient".<br><br>Tower Height: Critical<br>Wind speed increases with height due to surface friction. Over open water 50 feet is where speed stabilizes and does not tend to increase any more with height (At least due to friction, there are higher winds at higher heights, not harvestable with homebrew tech.) In general, the advice to have the turbine blades at least 30 feet higher than surrounding buildings or trees is very sound.<br><br>Batteries. I've heard of the Edison Iron batteries before. They do have longer lives than lead-acid, but have a lower "power density". Best used for stationary applications. Lead Acid CAN be recycled safely, but it does take care. They are more usefull for vehicles and boats, where weight is an issue.

My two cents on making some energy are based on three years living off grid now. This winter I eliminated our need to ever run a back-up generator (used to be a daily winter chore for a few hours), and added a chest freezer to boot. I do live in a northern climate, so what I did was lay the fridge down and turn it into a cooler. You can see it on Youtube ('turn your fridge into a cooler'). Now that it is warm out, we still freeze the bottles outside, but they are in the chest freezer. On sunny days, I can use water as a battery of sorts by stocking more bottles in the freezer, thus letting the excess solar power freeze more water.

Still the best resource on pedal powered machines.) and in hunting for a copy of this book, found a free PDF on line. <br>Fellow Green Wizards, I urge you to get a copy<br>http://www.zetatalk3.com/docs/Pedal_Power/Pedal_Power_In_Work_Leisure_And_Transportation_1977.pdf<br><br>Best wishes to all!<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c3743494480124653671 title="comment permalink">6/16/11, 8:40 PM</a><br><br>

We just came back from a trip to California, and drove through one of those big wind farms. Those suckers are HUGE! The towers appear to be about 200' tall, and the turbine blades look like the wings of large jet airliners. A few of these big bird blenders were not spinning, which probably means they periodically require a few thousand dollars of maintenance to replace burned out bearings, etc. <br><br>Once the government runs out of money (which seems ready to happen just about any day now), the tax breaks and subsidies that make these beasts economically feasible will go away, and unless some corporate investor feels particularly generous they will all stop spinning eventually...<br><br>It occurs to us that these wind farms are nothing more than hugely expensive examples of crony capitalism, on a par with ethanol subsidies. Once our so-called leaders run out of other people's money (our tax dollars), then General Electric and the other big rent-seeking corporations are going to have to find another gravy train to ride.<br><br>The unspoken assumption in this discussion is that the whole form of our society will necessarily have to change in major ways. Large nation states will devolve into smaller, more local units: States, counties, local warlords... Every remaining bridge across any river will be a toll bridge run by whover has the local political power (i.e., the guys with the most guns). <br><br>There have always been a few big cities, such as London or Rome, which were able to grow so large only because they were imperial capitals. Until the industrial revolution, most people lived on farms or in small towns, and most people never even got as far as the next valley, except to steal wives from the neighboring tribes. Is it going to get back to something like that in the next century or so? Well, that may depend on what level of technology we can hold onto...<br><br>There will always be settlements in places where rivers converge Kansas City, Pittsburg), or along obvious trade routes (Cumberland, MD). There will be regional centers in agricultural areas (Topeka, Peoria). They may or may not be part of a single recognizable nation in another 50 years or so, but there will continue to be at least some level of trade between all these places. <br><br>I could easily imagine a future in which all of the small farming communities have their little wind farms, and the whole society is structured the way it was a thousand years ago, except for the tube radios and penicillin and a few other necessities. 12-volt DC from your own generator will be the new standard, and 110-volt AC from a far-away power plant will be the stuff of ancient legends...<br><br>Here's a science fiction scenario: Could the people who run Archer-Daniels-Midland be the ancestors of a future King of Peoria? Would that king owe fealty to Da Mare of Chicago? Or would Chicago be a radioactive dead zone after the fuel rods at all those Commonwealth Edison nuclear plants melt down, like at Fukushima?<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c547556594106427186 title="comment permalink">6/17/11, 1:22 AM</a><br><br>

Back in the first half of the 20th century, there were numerous electric rail lines in the US; electric interurban systems covered the midwest before automobiles became readily available. The Great Northern and Milwaukee Road hauled freight and passengers across the Cascades behind electric locos, and the Norfolk and Western hauled millions of tons of coal to Tidewater. Most of the electrified lines were de-electrified when diesel fuel became so cheap and when people started driving gasoline-powered vehicles on paved roads. Only the Northeast Corridor remains... <br><br>But, as fossil fuels become more expensive, it might be possible for a new generation of railroad robber barrons to tie together what's left of our collapsed civilization, in an age where everyone else is limited to riding horses. Most of the rights of way are still there, although many have been converted to nature trails. The towns are still there, strung out like pearls on a necklace, just waiting for refugees from the failing cities to get back to the land.<br><br>So, why can't Union Pacific or BNSF electify their main lines with windmills and solar panels? After gasoline and diesel fuel are no longer available, electric railroads would be possibly the only economically viable form of land transportation (getting juice through the overhead wires is so much better than carrying around a limited-range battery in your Volt or Leaf, or driving an oxcart). Without competition from airplanes or automobiles, they would once again have a virtual monopoly on intercity transport, plus profit and power. What's not to like?<br><br>Yeah, I know... Railroads, even ones powered by renewable energy, are so industrial-age, but there is still going to be a need for some kind of transport system to keep some level of trade going between all those post-industrial villages. The rail lines exist. The customers exist. The railroads have the work force and the profit incentive, and the ability to raise lots of capital. This almost qualifies as a shovel-ready project...<br><br>Just a thought...<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c6571776964745668869 title="comment permalink">6/17/11, 1:49 AM</a><br><br>

Your plans are somewhat disturbing and will also fail because they require quite a considerable amount of energy to implement.<br><br>Now I don't live very far away from where they filmed the original Mad Max film and I recognise a lot of the roads (even though they've since changed quite a bit). I must admit that I quite enjoyed the film too.<br><br>However, there was a logical fallacy in the film. They had access to what seemed like unlimited supplies of fuel. That's no small issue for a supercharged 351 V8 XC Falcon (I always liked Torana's better - smaller, lighter and handled better - think the A9X).<br><br>What actually happened during the Depression era in this area is that people actually helped others. It wasn't about taking, it was about co-operation. If that meant that you had a swaggie living down the bottom of the paddock then so be it. They'd do work in turn for food. It's that simple.<br><br>Remember that people also will hang onto the dregs of their high energy existence far beyond the point in time when it no longer makes sense. They do this because it is what they know. <br><br>Look at all of the negativity about the governments proposed carbon tax. No one is asking what is the collected money going to be used for, it's simply focusing on the increased cost of electricity for consumers.<br><br>It's a complex problem, but I'd come to an arrangement well before handing food over. In those situations, you cannot afford to think short term. Say if you came here and took all of my stored food, how would you feed yourself the day after tomorrow?<br><br>The strategy you are arguing makes no sense and you'd also have to get past the neighbours who I know quite well. It's risky and likely to have an unpleasant outcome.<br><br>I'd appreciate your consideration of the issues, and recommend that you plant a vegetable garden for you and your family instead.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c7760165225215495273 title="comment permalink">6/17/11, 3:22 AM</a><br><br>

She’s from a Jewish family, so the Holocaust looms large in the lexicon. She compared the mindset highlighted above with those Jews who stayed in Germany in the ‘30s. They were good professionals, doctors, lawyers and the like and they just couldn’t believe that things could get so bad. Hundreds of thousands of them went quietly when the SS came for them. They walked obediently into the gas chambers. They just couldn’t believe what was happening.

This development marks what appears to be a major turning point in the global financial crisis in that the protestors who have overtaken Athens provide a good example of the type of political turmoil that one can expect to occur with greater frequency in the cycle of crashes and recoveries that is set to rule global economics and politics as industrial society begins the slow and methodical process of disintegration. This type of turmoil is not confined to the Arab Spring, far from it, and as history has repeatedly shown, even in a post-industrialized society, political turmoil is generally accompanied by a sharp reduction in public services. This can impact everything from an individual's access to food to, as has recently been shown, the willingness of governments to provide access to the internet. Without well-established civic organizations that could fill the gap, the onus lies with the individual to scrape by an existence on an incredibly limited resource base.<br><br>This is why I believe that the projects that you recommend under the banner of Green Wizardry are so crucial in the vicious cycle of geopolitics that will drive the age of deindustrialization. <br><br>On that note, as I mentioned next week, my plans for home-generated power will mostly hinge on PV panels, however, I am also quite intrigued by the thought of a DIY wind turbine project. I did some digging around and found some interesting plans for small turbines that would cost about $150 to build, which could be significantly less depending on what could be salvaged. The plans seem straightforward enough, so I am thinking that I might start digging for parts and, pardon the bad pun, give it a whirl.<br><br>Bobby<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c641777912470619912 title="comment permalink">6/17/11, 6:55 AM</a><br><br>

Now they're everywhere. We have a municipal arboretum which generates a fair bit of civic pride. On my own property, there's a fantastic red oak, planted the same decade as our 1920 bungalow, which now stands over 80 feet. In the summer, when the heat and humidity can be brutal, its canopy shades our entire roof during the afternoon and evening hours. The advantage, obviously, is that we're able to go without air conditioning much of the season. Our neighbors, who aren't blessed with a tree like ours, have been running their A/C unit since the first week in May.<br><br>On the other hand, erecting a tower high enough to clear that tree seems a wee bit impractical.<br><br>I don't mean to be a naysayer.

WTSHTF: "We'll go up to Pappy's place. He's got lots of room, and solar too!"<br><br>I keep thinking back to Katrina and folks' sense of entitlement: "Why doesn't somebody do something?!" <br><br>This ain't the Salvation Army."<br><br>It's a thorny issue, and no doubt about it. <br><br>I guess much depends on whether the SHTF is an event or a process unfolding over time. If the former, then you may be in a real pickle. But I think it's far more likely to play out as the latter. I don't think our descent will be as orderly as JMG's Long Descent implies for many (in fact, I think JMG has clarified in his posts here that he doesn't see a smooth, orderly descent, but perhaps more similar to Stephen Jay Gould's evolutionary notion of 'punctuated equilibrium'), and I personally think perhaps the future might best be seen as a process with sharp events occurring throughout, which events precipitate the next stage of the long-unfolding process. But even in this case, my sense is that 25+ people won't show up on your doorstep one day. In fact, if it does play out more as an unfolding process, your micro-situation will simply mirror the macro-situation - with perhaps 4 showing up one month, 2 a few months later, a half dozen a year after, etc.<br><br>If that's the case, you may be able to adjust as needed to such an intermittent influx - and to put those folks to work expanding the operation in anticipation of the next. Much like growing a business, adding 'employees' as the biz can support them.<br><br>I guess one ultimate question is: what is the long term carrying capacity of those 40 acres? In other words, what *is* the hard limit? And even that leaves out the interactions with others in your local community, which may bear on that question. If you can engage in mutual aid with your neighbors, that will tend to enhance your ability to sustain more folks by achieving some economies of scale that are unavailable to a lone householder.<br><br>And there is the notion of the household economy which plays into that as well - with more people under your roof, that's more people to craft goods which bring in value and which also integrate you into the broader community. Turning liabilities into assets is the name of the game here.<br><br>Further, will some of these folks show up with the wherewithal to purchase additional land nearby (if available), and so increase that 40 acres? <br><br>I guess it feels to me like you are planning to bear all the burdens of such a situation - that those who come to you will be helpless, as pure liabilities who will be wholly reliant upon your generosity and foresight - is this really the case? It may be - of course, I don't know the folks in question. But perhaps there is a way that any such influx could be seen reasonably as, at least in part, delivering assets to your operation, rather than simply burdens, as I noted above?<br><br>Besides, just imagine the immense satisfaction that you will get in repeatedly asserting 'I told you so!' to all and sundry throughout, and hearing them swear under their breath every time you do it. That alone may be worth the cost of admission. ;-)<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c3496994150752810369 title="comment permalink">6/17/11, 7:58 AM</a><br><br>

But I find it fascinating<br>how most people reading this blog have grasped and accepted these concepts comparatively easily. I know it <br>really wasn't easy, most of us probably worked through at least some of Kubler-Ross' stages, I know I did. For 3-4 years I <br>had absolutely no doubt that renewable sources of energy could allow BAU if we only woke up and changed our<br>ways. But once I realized that it couldn't work out that way, I dove into the process of educating myself about<br>energy, thermodynamics and everything else discussed on this blog. That took about 6 months. Throughout<br>my process I don't once recall wanting to bury my head in the sand, everything I learned led to wanting to learn more,<br>not less, about our predicament.<br><br>So I wonder...why did I reacted this way? Presumably most others here reacted similarly, while most of the people in our lives react completely differently, violently defending BAU. It's almost like we are a different species, or have some genetic anomaly that is very rare in the general population. I often comment to my wife, upon seeing some particularly puzzling aspect of modern industrial life, "I don't understand the humans". Recently, many here have commented that figuring out how to get by with LESS is just plain fun! I completely agree, but nearly everyone I know<br>outside of the peak oil blogosphere would rather die than voluntarily choose to use much less of anything.<br><br>On a related note, add me to the list of those who, upon learning about the Druid Path, realized that "this is what I have<br>believed all along!"

So, small hand-made wind turbines mounted on recycled telephone poles, and using home-made nickel-iron batteries for storage, may have to be good enough if there are no rare earth metals available for super efficient batteries, etc. <br><br>It is possible, using relatively simple technology, such as an acre or so of concentrating solar reflectors, to smelt and melt various alloys with reasonable melting points without using coal or even charcoal such as the earliest iron-age folks used. Quantities would be small, but imagine the value of, say, alnico magnets or replacement parts for old machines a hundred years from now.<br><br>How long would it take the ruinmen's guild to disassemble all of the skyscrapers on Manhattan Island or in Chicago's Loop? Even without fossil fuels to power the smelters and machine shops, our great grandchildren will have more than enough of all the necessary (non-organic) raw materials to live happily ever after, assuming they keep the population size steady. <br><br>Of course, in a world of limited resources, the average quality of life will be inversely proportional to the quantity of life, so having small families (just enough kids to work on the farm) would probably be the recommended course of action. Do we need oil wells to be able to manufacture birth-control pills?<br><br>I was looking at some graphs of world population going back to the beginning of recorded history. It would appear that the total population of Mother Earth was around a billion people up until the beginning of the scientific age and the industrial revolution. <br><br>So, in a world without fossil fuels, would the natural carrying capacity of planet Earth go back down to a billion or so? If we all had to make our own soil from available composting materials instead of using fetilizers from Monsanto or Dow, would we still be able to feed 7 or 8 billion people? Somehow, I doubt it. <br><br>If that's the case, what's going to happen to the other seven billion folks who currently live here? We're seeing some of the problems of negative population growth in places like Japan and Russia. I'm wondering if the societal upheavals that are coming at us in the rest of this century will result in a continued slow population decrease, or a very nasty rapid decrease?

Thank you for following this up. <br><br>Mercutio, your comment is an example of what I call "factoid logic." You've seen the claim that wind power depends on rare earth elements in the media, and used it as a debating point here without checking whether there are limits to that declarative statement. As it happens, there are; the only wind turbines that need rare earth elements are the giant grid-tied ones that I've been criticizing in my post; the small, homebuilt ones I've been recommending don't use any rare earth elements at all. Next time, please do your homework!<br><br>Dennis, if you wait for "someone" to do it, you'll be waiting a long time. It's got to start with each of us making that change in our own lives, and as far as possible, not patronizing those that don't. <br><br>DeAnander, thanks for the link. <br><br>Susan, the people who run Archer-Daniels-Midland aren't likely to leave descendants; one of the standard features of the decline and fall of a civilization is that the former upper classes are among the very first up against the wall. The rich folks who daydream about retreating into well-guarded gated communities haven't thought about what happens once the guards realize that they're a few bullets away from having all those goodies for themselves. Pretty? No, but that's how it tends to work. <br><br>Les, it may be a terrifying analogy but it's a fairly exact one. Good to hear you've taken it seriously and started taking the necessary steps to deal with the awkward fact that the future we're getting and the one we want aren't the same thing...<br><br>Troubador, well put. The collapse of public order is a fairly common event during crises of the sort we're moving into.

I went through my Kubler-Ross stages in my teen years, so had a bit of a head start on most people these days, but I certainly did have to go through them. Still, why so many people get stuck at the denial stage, while others go on through the process and come out the other side, is hard to say. <br><br>Susan, I figure that two hundred years from now the world will have maybe half a billion people. Getting there from here is going to be a long, bitter, ugly process, with those four guys on horses playing significant roles in most people's lives. Broadly speaking, that's what happens when a civilization comes unglued; the suggestions I make here aren't going to prevent that, though they may make things a little easier and provide people on the other end of the process with more options. <br><br>Matt and Jess, I hadn't seen that, but it doesn't surprise me at all.

It really wasn't a struggle at all for me - once I'd dug into the data and logic, it was immediately clear to me that this was the real deal and the only real question was what would constitute a sensible response, and how to get there. There was no kicking and screaming involved.<br><br>Perhaps being disillusioned - literally - with BAU and modern society in general predisposes one to see this issue more clearly, without resistance?<br><br>That is, for my part anyway, the immensely deleterious nature of our industrialized, corporatist, centralized culture had become abundantly clear to me before I learned about peak oil.

But few of them consider any further details, or are willing to sit still long enough to ponder the ramifications of suchathing, when all they have to do is play a little game of What Might Happen If…(I do this while driving, hah!). I guess it takes courage or presence of mind, or both.<br><br>As it happens, I’ve given quite a bit of thought to which specific urban (or sub-urban) refugees I would be willing to host. And it’s a fairly short list; some immediate (as distinct from close) family members aren’t welcome to visit even before TSHTF. Aside from any practical skills they might possess, it’s easy to tell right now who is likely to step up, and more importantly, who will not.<br><br>Anyone who has grown up in an abusive household and pulled their lives together, has had to deal with some toxic, addictive and violent people they happened to be born into. Along the way, they’ve no doubt found dear friends and “support system network” of people who behave in their lives like a loving family would. These people become the true family, and the abusive bloodline folks are kept at a distance. Learning how to do this is often termed in the jargon “growing a healthy boundary”.<br><br>Now when the whole society is a bunch of abusive relatives suddenly denied their crack, it won’t turn out quite like the Norman Rockwell Thanksgiving. So learning how to have healthy boundaries in our personal relationships is just the training ground for maintaining healthy boundaries around our future ad hoc food supply. If you can’t tell someone to “Back Off” (or something similar) with conviction now, then how will you ever do so when the stakes are highest?<br><br>Also, Oz, I must comment on your joke about rubbing it in… I’ve found it very important to NEVER even imply “I told you so” in any discussion ever. We must become adept at befriending and becoming allies with folks we might imagine are the polar opposite from us; I’m imagining a right-wing, military-minded, red-white-and-blue Baptist, for instance. All I have to do is think about the depth of betrayal that person will experience as their world dissolves. Then I can choose to withhold judgment, and speak my portion with dignity, without dis-respecting their crumbling stance. This preserves THEIR dignity, and that’s the opening for purposeful alliance. <br><br>Nobody likes to hear “I told you so” and if you say that to your captive workers (their view) it can only foment resentment at best. It’s much better to have good help than be right, after all. Remember, most folks who so far have chosen NOT to venture down the Kubler-Ross trail, will become mental basket cases. Forget about useful skills, many people will not even know Who They Are any longer, as the underpinnings of their tenuous identities erode into…something else. <br><br>BTW, the Baptist just sold me a farm, and I don’t even know if he drinks, but I’m looking forward to having a beer with him, if you know what I mean…<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c3554371451308050915 title="comment permalink">6/18/11, 6:56 AM</a><br><br>

The Limits to Growth study looked at population as one of its variables, and found that, in the event of social and economic collapse, population (as well as pollution) continues to increase for decades. Followed by a rather rapid decrease. So in answer to your question: yes. ;-)<br><br>It is also worth noting that ecologists who study carrying capacity understand that exceeding that carrying capacity for some period of time generally undermines it. That is, the carrying capacity prior to the industrial revolution has almost certainly been degraded to the point where the planet will be unable to carry the level of human population that it could back then. So, yeah, look for considerably less than a billion as a reasonable target.<br><br>Orlov has an interesting take on this issue:<br><br>"Now, die-offs, people have trouble imagining them. There was a bit of a die off in the Soviet Union after the Soviet Union collapsed. Life expectancy plummeted. The odd thing about it, I was there during that time, and it’s not really noticeable unless you happen to be dropping by the hospitals and the morgues all the time and going to a lot of funerals. You just don’t know that people are going away. Its more that people look at their school photos and realize that half their class is dead. And that’s a bit of a shock, but its more of a shock when you realize it than when its happening because you don’t really realize its happening.

Thank you. <br><br>Hawlkeye, very well put. The ability to establish and maintain boundaries is very nearly a lost art these days, and learning it involves bucking the resistance of a society in which ignoring boundaries is very nearly a way of life, but it's crucial. <br><br>Remnant, fair enough. Basically, the model I'm using presupposes that the mechanics of decline and fall in other civilizations will be repeated in ours; since the same processes have applied on scales ranging from small regions to most of a continent, and on technological bases from neolithic to advanced iron age, I figure it's a good bet -- not least because the initial stages are already well under way. <br><br>The resulting model might be summarized as "stairstep decline." It's not a smooth curve; rather, it's a succession of crises interspersed with periods of relative stability and even partial recovery. Some of the crises are localized, some general; some are moderate and some drastic; each wrecks some portion of the civilization's infrastructure and exhausts some part of its remaining resource base. <br><br>Different areas and socioeconomic sectors decline at different rates, so that by the time the last hollowed-out shell of the old system collapses, usually as a result of one more crisis more or less indistinguishable from those that preceded it, most of the land area and surviving population has long since entered the new Dark Age reality. The Dark Age lasts a few centuries, during which new political and economic arrangements gradually come together, and as these develop the strength to reassert social order and allow for some degree of economic complexity, the new civilization gradually takes shape. <br><br>A very rough scenario in terms of our own time might involve industrial civilization coming apart in a series of wars, economic crises, subsistence crises, etc., between now and 2100, though by 2050 or so population levels will be dropping steadily and most of the survivors will no longer be living in anything like modern conditions. The ensuing Dark Ages might then last until 2500 -- a period of mass migrations, continued population decline, and social and political chaos -- followed by the emergence of new and potentially ecotechnic civilizations over the centuries that follow. <br><br>No, it's not a pleasant vision, but it's my best guess as to where we're headed. The one thing I'd add is that we're almost certainly in the early stages of one of those rounds of crisis, and that's going to occupy most of our time and attention for most of the rest of our lives.<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c54269387286962947 title="comment permalink">6/18/11, 9:48 AM</a><br><br>

This co-existed with my thinking that “there's something about this that can't work”. I really had no problems accepting things about sustainability, peak oil, etc, they just seemed to fall in line... “<i>That</i> makes sense!” Over the last 20-25 years I just kept refining my view of what was going on.<br><br>Now, just a thought about wind generators &amp; thermoelectric. If anyone is thinking about having the rather small output from thermoelectric and making use of it, something that I see as quite possible, keep this in mind; you don't have to have the most efficient wind generator to just get a little power at times to store in a battery. I can imagine a small home-made turbine and some thermoelectric basically trickle charging a battery as the opportunity arises. This doesn't have to be a fancy thing on a high tower, some power gotten cheaply from scrounged parts absolutely beats nothing from the expensive turbine on the high tower that you can't afford. The thermoelectric could also scavenge some from the sun when it's out.<br><br>Think about either a car alternator or maybe a home-built thing like that Home Power article mounted on a 10-15 foot tower, periodically making some watts in the breeze. That would keep some LEDs lit at night and maybe a radio. It doesn't have to be very efficient to scavenge a few watt-hours/day to do that, yet its something that almost anybody could find what's necessary to make it.<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c4577335000331726078 title="comment permalink">6/19/11, 10:37 AM</a><br><br>

As I was screwing my courage up to apply for the business grants needed my roommate and best friend suffered a near fatal health crisis which has left her physically and somewhat mentally impaired. I have become her full time care giver and have stewed over how I could manage to buy, build and manage the stable that would support and pay the way for me, my friends and heirs into a post industrial world. I've realized I have no choice BUT to continue seeking a grant to build.<br><br>One of the things I want to offer the boarders at my stable is a garden patch, since if you have no place to keep a horse you likely won't have anywhere to raise a decent garden either. And if my boarders want to do their own cleaning as well as feeding I see no reason why they couldn't keep chickens at the back of their garden plot in a properly designed coop and pen.<br><br>I'll be underhanded sneaky in finding people of like minds in the area by offering such perks at the stable. An excellent way to separate the chaff from the grain when it comes to possible acceptance as extra hands for work in the inevitable collapse. The manner of building in the stable will be such that if families want to move onto the property to work it with my 'family' and I, the warmblood or Stallion stalls would be snug and secure housing with the AP room available for community cooking and the bathrooms close by for communal use.<br> <br>And then as long as the economy permits there's all that natural fertilizer going out the back door that would provide the grass seeds needed for the pastures without my having to pay for them, set up in their own naturally fertilized starter packages!<br><br>One of the necessities for the stable will be a nice big shop for initially fixing broken pipe fencing, wood working, mechanical repairs and automotive and equipment maintenance. Once motors of any kind become a luxury I think it will be just as handy to set up a blacksmithing hearth under the parking overhang.<br><br>Coming of age in the 70's and raised in a lumber camp I was a bit of an anomaly. I saw how the old growth forests in the area were being logged out and I realized that things couldn't go on that way indefinitely. As a result the prospect of the decline of civilization although sad doesn't depress me. One of my early aspirations was riding the Pacific Crest Trail just so I could see what the world looked like before industrialization. Sadly, I never did. And yes, I've a hard time getting through to people what's happening too. It's their choice if they don't want to know.<br><br>I'm still getting ideas on how to make the construction of the stable easy to maintain over half a century and beyond. I'm always thinking of ways to make the stable as self sufficient as possible! (I've got a million ideas and new ones occurring regularly!)<br><br>I still want to breed a line of good horses, a combination of stock and mountain horses suitable for this area. And I still want to breed, train and sell stock dogs too. I think in the future the orchards here will shrink, with much of the land in the valley going back into farms and less well watered areas into cattle ranches. In such a situation a premium line of horses and stock dogs would be a modest but steady income and in such a rapidly changing world that's all you can ask for.<br><br>Wadulisi Tsalagi<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c5130448790473061333 title="comment permalink">6/19/11, 8:31 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not thinking here of micro-hydro (i.e. something an individual could do if provided with flowing water on their property), but the 1MW sort of thing that could be available at the community level. I live near Philadelphia and the streams and rivers around here are peppered with dams that used to have associated mills or alternators. As fossil fuels deplete, flowing water is going to be one of the more concentrated energy sources still available. Most of the Wisconsin towns where I spent my childhood summers had ponds or lakes with hydroelectric alternators that could be eminently useful at the neighborhood or community level whether or not the larger grid survived - it would be nice to still have that option.<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c1237470148861770166 title="comment permalink">6/20/11, 10:42 AM</a><br><br>

However, before people go out and buy the gear...<br><br>The panel was 205w at 12v which equates to a maximum output of 17amps (ie. 205w = 12v x 17A).<br><br>The controller that you recommend could hook up a single panel only as it is rated at a maximum input of 25amps. Two of the above panels at 17A = a total of 34amps which exceeds the 25A rating. <br><br>One panel is OK and it is a good brand of controller - I've heard good things about them.<br><br>Two panels however, is not good and you would cook the regulator within a few days (it won't happen straight away but it will happen).<br><br>The battery is rated at 54amps at 12v. I'm assuming this is at the 20 hour rate (it doesn't say though, it just gives the 100 hour rate). So at the 20 hour rate, you could draw 2.7amps (54amps / 20hours = 2.7Ah) an hour from the battery max.<br><br>Now 2.7Ah is about enough to run a small efficient car fridge (which coincedentally uses one of the thermoelectric devices in reverse). Plus, well, nothing else really. The other thing to remember is that you'd only have enough power to run it for a single day before the battery needs to be completely recharged. The panel would probably do the recharging though - just.<br><br>Anyway, the summary is that the components, whilst individually good, if put together in a system would not be much use for other than an emergency small solar powered refrigerator.<br><br>If this is what you were intending then nice work.

I got almost 200 feet of the stuff. My headers are 1/2" type M. A few years ago I got hundreds of coper fittings on clearance from the HD that were the pre-soldered type no one wanted. The folks at the store didn't notice that the price, even at the time, was lower than the scrap worth of the copper. I think I paid $3.00 for each bag of 50 tees and ells. You gotta pay attention!<br><br>I used my 1/2" pex crimper to swage the soft copper nice and tight into the hard copper risers, then braised everything with 15% silvaloy. I don't trust soldering for projects like this. Eight risers, 5" on center. For glazing I have 6 sheets of low iron tempered glass 44" X 72", recovered from some old solar HW panels that used to be on a local hospital. The copper in the panels was in bad shape (delaminated and corroded) so I sold it as scrap to fund my project costs (some new copper tubing, silicone, paint, etc.), enough stuff to eventually build three of these. I used the sheet aluminum from the old panel cases as a back plane absorber for the fin assembly. Aluminum flashing from my scrounge pile for fins, formed and constructed as per 'Buildit'.<br><br>I'm toying with using pex to build one unit, though, with the current cost of pex fittings, I can likely buy more copper tubing for about the same (as I already have the copper tees, et. al.). <br><br>Did you see the <a href=http://www.builditsolar.com/Experimental/PEXCollector/SmallPanelTests.htm rel=nofollow>tests</a> of pex vs. copper on Buildit? Not bad for the pex unit. All things considered, one may do better to build an extra pex unit to run in series. It just depends on one's situation. My system is a drainback (in winter), so series isn't really an option.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>BTW: About theft; around here they could take a lot more than copper if I'm not around as we're a bit rural. We don't bother to lock doors 'cause they would just throw a patio chair through a big solar window or something. Then there're the dogs.....and rock salt....and my somewhat cranky reputation amongst the population.....<br><br><a href=profligacies-of-scale.html#c4487498991627108108 title="comment permalink">6/21/11, 11:26 AM</a><br><br>

He saw a harmless looking wire was awry and needed, apparently, the simple adjustment of placing the wire back upon its socket. His knowledge of electricity was too vague for him to realize that he was handling a live wire with strong voltage loaded for diffusion to the touch.

It may be better to upgrade to the 50 amp controller if one anticipates expanding much. <br><br>I speced two of the batteries, and with the 25 amp controller plus the single panel, one would have a nice little usable system for lighting, radio, 12 volt fan, power for an RV absorption fridge (igniter), small 12 volt water pump, stuff like that. While I didn't mean to imply that folks could run a whole house, it sure beats sitting in the dark.

The power rating is peak power at peak current, at standard conditions. The actual current on the referenced panel is 7.9 amps, at 26 volts. To get maximum power into a 12 volt battery, a MPPT charge controller is required, as well as adjusting output for temperature.
