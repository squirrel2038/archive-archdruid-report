Last week’s discussion of the twilight of the electrical grid in an age after abundance turned out to be timely, in an ironic sort of way. Whatever conversations it might have set in motion in the peak oil blogosphere were all but drowned out by a flurry of proclamations that some energy resource or other would keep the grid up and running for the foreseeable future. <br><br>Mind you, some of that flurry could have been lifted straight from equivalent discussions in the alternative energy field three decades ago. Fans of nuclear power were busy promoting their glow-in-the-dark solutions, of course, though for some reason fusion didn’t get dragged into the discussion; the folks at Livermore must have been busy doing something else this week. Meanwhile <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/node/7898>a longish essay</a> posted on The Oil Drum, and widely cited elsewhere, insisted that satellite based solar power was the solution to the future’s energy problems. For connoisseurs of energy vaporware, this essay was a treat – a Dagwood sandwich of untried technologies, enthusiastic assumptions, and more than Panglossian optimism concerning the potential costs and downsides of pursuing a wholly untested and dizzyingly grandiose technological project at a time when the industrial world is so far into bankruptcy that it’s scrambling to keep its existing infrastructure from crumbling under its collective feet. <br><br>Still, the chief focus of the discussion was less dated, though attentive observers will have seen it coming some time ago. "Fracking" technology – more properly, "hydrofracturing," but only engineers call it that these days – is part of the toolkit that’s used to extract fossil fuels, and it’s become all the rage among those who want to believe that the age of cheap abundant energy isn’t dead yet. Thus there’s been a great many claims insisting either that natural gas will fuel our current lifestyles for the foreseeable future, or that it will provide a bridge to a future of renewable energy that will, again, keep our current lifestyles supplied with all the power we think we need. <br><br>Now of course fracking is a reality, and one that’s had a significant impact on natural gas production in the US already. Those of my readers who, in their younger days, shook up a bottle of soda pop good and hard, and then opened the cap, already know a good deal about the fracking process. Instead of shaking gas-bearing rock, fracking pumps in a mixture of water and toxic chemicals under high pressure, but the result is the same: bubbles of gas that were trapped in the rock (or the soda pop) come bubbling out all at once. If you want a sudden fountain, it’s not a bad approach, but anyone who’s tasted soda out of a thoroughly shaken bottle knows part of the downside: you get most of the gas in that first big splash, and very little is left behind <br><br>That’s one of the two big problems with fracking. (The other comes from the toxic chemicals just mentioned, which inevitably get into the local water supply with predictably ugly consequences.) Natural gas wells treated with fracking technology produce a lot of gas at first, but production slows to a trickle within a year or so. The same thing is true, interestingly enough, of petroleum wells treated the same way; the drop in production there can be anything up to 80% in the first year. Thus fracking isn’t the answer to our energy future, unless "future" in this case means the next five years at most.<br><br>Nor, it probably has to be said, is it a bridge to a future of mighty solar and wind plants that will keep millions of electric cars rolling down America’s highways. Even if that energy scenario was possible, and the evidence suggests that it’s not, it’s a safe bet that the energy made available by fracking won’t be used for that purpose. Those of us who were paying attention to energy issues back in the 1970s will recall claims that the Alaska North Slope would provide just such a bridge to just such a future. <br><br>Of course it did nothing of the kind. Instead, it enabled Americans to postpone the energy crisis for a few decades, and take the thirty-year vacation from reality that threw away our chances of a less than traumatic transition to the Age of Scarcity. The relatively brief gas and petroleum boom that we can expect from fracking might well permit a speeded-up replay of the same wretched spectacle: a few years of low energy costs, during which no provision will be made for the inevitable exhaustion of the stranded gas and oil reserves that fracking wells can effectively exploit, followed by a plunge into renewed crisis made even more severe by the ongoing depletion of other fossil fuel reserves. If it’s a bridge at all, it’s a bridge to nowhere.<br><br>Fueling a set of unsustainable lifestyles via unsustainable resource extraction, in other words, is not going to get us to sustainability. Of course the term "sustainability" has seen heavy service as a rhetorical weapon in recent years, and has come through the experience with a fair number of dents and scratches, but it’s not actually that difficult a concept to grasp – or, for that matter to define. <br><br>To be sustainable, something – a technology, a lifestyle, or what have you – has to be able to keep going indefinitely despite whatever limits the future will throw at it. Two categories of limits deserve particular attention here. The first, <i>ecosystem limits</i>, sums up the relation between whatever you’re considering and the nonhuman world. If something considered sustainable depends on using nonrenewable resources, for example, or on using otherwise renewable resources at a rate that exceeds the biosphere’s ability to renew them, it’s just flunked its sustainability test. Equally, if a technology or lifestyle or what have you puts things into the biosphere that disrupt the natural cycles of matter, energy, and information that keep the biosphere going, it’s not sustainable no matter how much green spraypaint you apply to it. <br><br>The role of ecosystem limits in sustainability is tolerably well understood. Less often grasped, because of its unwelcome implications, is the second category of limits that has to be addressed, which might best be called <i>complexity limits</i>. This category sums up the relation between a supposedly sustainable technology, lifestyle, etc., and the social, economic, and technological dimensions of human society, now and in the future. If those systems have a significant chance of dropping below the level of complexity at which your supposedly sustainable item can keep running, no matter how green it looks or how enduring it might be in the abstract, it’s not sustainable. <br><br>This is why, for example, I’ve suggested here that the internet is not going to make it very far into the post-abundance future. To keep the internet up and running takes a vastly complex technological structure, ranging from gigawatts of electricity from centralized power plants, through silicon chip factories and their supporting industries and supply chains, to universities that can train people in the wide range of exotic specialties that keep the net functioning. It also requires an economic system complex and rich enough, that the internet can pay its bills and outcompete other ways of providing the services that net users actually use. None of those are guaranteed, and in a world facing energy shortages, economic contraction, and attendant social and political disruption, the chances that today’s faltering industrial societies can maintain the technological and economic foundation for the internet look uncomfortably like those of a snowball in Beelzebub’s back yard. <br><br>The electricity grid, as suggested last week, suffers from much the same set of limits. Its ability to deal with ecosystem limits is open to question, since none of the alternatives to fossil fuels seem at all likely to provide a large enough amount of electricity, reliably enough, at a low enough cost to make the grid economically viable. Its ability to deal with complexity limits is at least as doubtful, since national or regional grids as currently constituted depend on an equally sprawling technological infrastructure and an equally complex set of economic arrangements. <br><br>It seems quite possible that local grids – for example, the size of a small city or a group of neighboring towns – could keep going over the long term, given a stable source of electricity close at hand. There were plenty of grids on that scale across America in the first half of the twentieth century, a point that suggests that the second half of the twenty-first century could see the reemergence of at least a few. Outside localities where this is an option, though, the only electricity that’s likely to be available to families and communities in the deindustrial future is whatever they can generate themselves.<br><br>Fortunately, home generation of electricity in modest but useful amounts is an option, and it’s one that those of my readers who are getting into the green wizardry discussed on this blog can start to explore in their own lives right now. What makes it a complex option, however, is the awkward fact that most of the options for home-generated electricity available right now fail the sustainability test in one way or another. <br><br>Photovoltaic (PV) power might as well be the poster child for this effect. PV chips are made by a variant of the same process that produces computer chips, and face the same problems with complexity limits as the economic and technological basis for fab plants and worldwide supply chains comes unglued. Though silicon, the raw material of most PV chips, is one of the most abundant elements on the planet, many of the other substances used in manufacturing solar panel systems are noticeably scarcer, and there are also issues with toxic wastes and other pollutants, so there are significant ecosystem limits to the technology as well. <br><br>All things considered, it’s probably a safe bet that within fifty years or so, PV cells will no longer be manufactured – not least because a technology we’ve already discussed, solar thermoelectric power, can produce electricity from sunlight using devices that a reasonably enterprising medieval alchemist could have put together. (Given that medieval alchemists pioneered the use of solar energy for distillation, using polished copper reflectors, this isn’t as strange a suggestion as it might seem.) Does this mean that PV panels should be off the list for green wizards today? <br><br>That depends on what your PV panels are intended to do, for there are two sides to the challenge that green wizardry is intended to meet. The first and most obvious task before us is to begin the process of creating and deploying prototype versions of sustainable lifestyles, homes, and communities, on a scale small and local enough that the inevitable mistakes and mischances can be managed. The second, which is too often neglected in discussions of the subject, is to meet the needs and reasonable wants of the people who are doing all this creating and deploying, during an age of economic contraction and technological unraveling when relying on the continued functioning of today’s massive and centralized systems could at any moment turn out to be a sucker’s bet. <br><br>Down the road, solar thermoelectric generators are likely to become one of the standard ways that households and small businesses provide themselves with a modest supply of electricity, while PV panels will be an exotic legacy from the industrial past where they’ve survived at all. There’s a fair amount of road to be covered between now and then, however, and during much of that time, those solar thermoelectric generators will be making the journey that runs from handbuilt prototypes in the backyards of basement-workshop inventors, through balky first-generation models of many different designs turned out by green entrepreneurs on shoestring budgets, to the shaking-out process from which the standard, sturdy, widely available models of the future will finally emerge. <br><br>During that time, those of my readers who don’t happen to have a talent for nonferrous metallurgy and electrical engineering may find PV panels a useful investment. The fact that those panels won’t be available fifty years from now doesn’t make them useless today, and someone whose main efforts are directed toward organic gardening, say, or some other dimension of the Green Wizard project, could do a lot worse than to cut her electricity use down to size and then provide the current she needs from a bank of solar panels and a stack of batteries. For that matter, even someone who’s hard at work in the basement lab assembling bimetallic strips and a parabolic reflector into a prototype thermoelectric generator might choose to retool his lifestyle in the meantime to work off a hundred watts or so of 12 volt power, and put up a few PV panels to provide that power while tinkering with the generator and getting it through the teething pains every experimental project gets to enjoy. <br><br>That is to say, PV panels can be used as a bridge. Unlike the natural gas being pumped out of the ground so frantically by fracking operations just now, it’s a bridge that leads somewhere – or, more precisely, it has the potential to be a bridge that leads somewhere, though it can also be used in less productive ways. The sort of grid-tied PV panel system that’s designed to feed 110 volts of alternating current into the grid, and can’t be used at all when the grid goes down – and yes, there are plenty of PV installations like that these days – is another bridge to nowhere; it’s designed to prop up a way of life with no future, or more precisely to go through the motions of propping up that way of life, and as often as not serving primarily as a status symbol in the meantime. <br><br>The land on the other side of the bridge, to extend the metaphor a bit further, will inevitably be a place where the inhabitants use a lot less electricity than people in the industrial world do today. Just as you need to weatherize before you solarize, to quote the appropriate tech motto from the Seventies, you thus need to make very serious cuts in your electricity use before you can realistically turn to renewable sources to meet the modest power needs that remain. Here again, any response to the predicament of our time that doesn’t start out with using much less – less energy, stuff, and stimulation – simply isn’t serious; it’s yet another bridge to nowhere. <br><br>There are quite a few potential bridges that lead somewhere, just as there are other technologies that aren’t bridges at all but fully sustainable options that will still be running long after the last PV cell stops working. In a world where the industrial nations didn’t take a thirty-year break from reality, it probably wouldn’t be necessary to use the bridges at all; in such a world, entrepreneurs would long since have followed up on the intriguing chapter on solar thermoelectric generators in Farrington Daniels’ <i>Direct Use of the Sun’s Energy</i>, and you’d be able to pick up neatly packaged systems with parabolic dishes on sturdy sun-tracking mounts at the better grade of hardware store, right next to the solar water heaters, the fireless cookers, and the racks of 12 volt household light bulbs. <br><br>Still, that’s not the world we live in. The world we live in is one in which a small minority of people are belatedly waking up to the ghastly predicament into which the misguided choices of recent decades have backed us, while most others are squeezing their eyes shut and covering their ears with their hands in a desperate attempt to keep from noticing the mess we’re in. In that kind of world, saving much of anything at all is going to involve quite a bit of last-minute scrambling and a fair number of temporary expedients and jerry-rigged makeshifts, and one feature that will likely be common to a great many of those latter is the use of resources extracted in one way or another from the disintegrating mass of our current industrial system. <br><br>Quite a few of our bridges to somewhere, in other words, are going to depend on a strategy that makes calculated use of the process of catabolic collapse now beginning to pick up speed in industrial America and elsewhere. I’ve got a few posts more worth of things to say about energy, and then we’ll begin talking in earnest about the third of the core elements of Green Wizardry, which is also the third great legacy from the alternative movement of the Seventies. Most people nowadays call it recycling, and that’s not a bad term at all, but it’s come to mean little more than putting out bins once a week so that diesel-powered trucks can come haul a fraction of your waste products back into the industrial system. The work we’ll be discussing is both more robust and more personal, and so it needs a different name; we’ll be calling it salvage.

I suppose this could be the start of a truthful trend in the mainstream media, but it's far more likely that the most profitable effect will be the continued elevation of public fear levels, which are already very high.

I've been noting a lot of other straws in the wind suggesting that the strident anti-environmentalism of recent years may not have as long a shelf life as many of us had feared.

<div class="avtb a_3a9cbe" id=c1013924903683742080></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/10139224829468946995 rel=nofollow>Tracy G</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>We're still working on the weatherization which precedes solarization. We've scheduled a professional energy audit for this coming Monday.<br><br>Our electrical usage has averaged 375 kWh monthly for the past year. That's a fraction of the typical American household usage, but it's nowhere near as low as I'd like. Our refrigerator accounts for about 215 kWh of that amount. I've often thought about replacing our fridge with an identically sized Sun Frost RF-16, which would consume a mere tenth of the energy. Alas, at our current electric rates of just under 7¢ per kWh, it'd take 19 years for the Sun Frost to pay for itself.<br><br>Plus, we're probably moving in a few years. Sigh. That makes it difficult to judge what's best to do.<br><br>If I was sure we were staying here, I'd put up PV panels in a heartbeat and also install an alternate heat source, since we presently rely on a natural gas furnace that's governed by an electrically powered thermostat. I think we could afford to do several good things like that for one home, but not for two. So for now, we might have to settle for just beefing up the insulation and sealing the leaks on the present place. I'm pretty sure the auditor will confirm that's something we ought to do. I'm going to follow the auditor around and take careful notes, as I'm extremely interested in the nitty-gritty of those assessments.<br><br>I look forward to reading more about salvage here. It feels good to engage both my head and my hands in creative work, and I enjoy crafting useful stuff out of odds and ends whenever I get the chance. I'd like to do more. More with LESS.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c1013924903683742080 title="comment permalink">6/8/11, 8:22 PM</a><br><br>

Clean coal, abundant natural gas, and inovation will come riding in on their white horses to save the day: This, per the Chomskyescent, pervasive mob programming machine. While many readers here have steeled themselves to these not so subliminal messages through intentionally selective media filering, these are the stories being told, being heard. <br><br>JMG, Today: <i>Still, that’s not the world we live in. The world we live in is one in which a small minority of people are belatedly waking up to the ghastly predicament into which the misguided choices of recent decades have backed us, while most others are squeezing their eyes shut and covering their ears with their hands in a desperate attempt to keep from noticing the mess we’re in.</i><br><br>This week especially, I've noticed that the facade, the shell, is beginning to crack a bit.<br><br>Today, from the usually bland CNN, <a href=http://caffertyfile.blogs.cnn.com/ rel=nofollow>Cafferty File</a><br><i>For the first time maybe since the Vietnam War or certainly since the civil rights movement, there are some darkening storm clouds on the civility horizon. A growing number of voices are continuing to suggest that if this economy doesn't turn around, and people can't start feeling optimistic about their futures again, we could be headed for some ugly scenarios. A new CNN poll says 48 percent of Americans think the country is headed for another Great Depression in the next twelve months. That is a stunning number. <br></i><br> <br>The comments were decidedly angry, suggesting violent uprising. And today's <a href=http://theautomaticearth.blogspot.com/ rel=nofollow>TAE</a> post by Ilargi:<br><br><i>So I guess that's sort of a mission statement after all. And don't worry, I’m easily smart enough to understand that that will rub some people the wrong way. I just don't see another way out anymore, it’s all just about analysis and pattern recognition from where I’m sitting. I’m temporarily lodged in France, to work on the new Automatic Earth website. People here say that if austerity measures like those in Greece and Spain and Portugal would ever reach here, you ain't seen nothing yet. The French know protest, and proudly so. Me, I’m wondering what's going to happen when police start shooting live ammo in the EU periphery. And how far away that moment could be.<br><br>We've handed the financial elites absolute powers over our economies, and thereby our lives and well being, as well as our childrens' futures. We’ll have to wrestle it back from their cold dead hands. And that's not going to be an easy one. </i><br><br>While this small, remarkable community is discussing its options going forward, accepting change, society-at-large seems to see itself as running out of options. One wonders how to take this into account. What good are one's best laid plans in an environment of desperation and insecurity?<br><br>JMG concludes: <i>The work we’ll be discussing is both more robust and more personal, and so it needs a different name; we’ll be calling it salvage. </i><br><br>While in the Navy on a small, old ship, my shop had a saying: <i>We have been doing so much for so long with so little, we are now qualified to do anything with nothing.</i><br><br>So I urge folks to pay close attention to what I consider the most important aspect of Green Wizardry: Salvage, Retasking, Recycling, Reusing and Improvising. Learn to make the most of what's at hand, even when what you've considered yours has been taken away. In this you may find the power and self-worth to persevere. Without these skills you'll just be part of the mob. There's a world of junk out there.

Michael hints at possible problems of defining sustainability. If he would go a bit further down that route, his bridge metaphor would fall apart, though.<br><br>Michael says: "[for something to be sustainable, it] has to be able to keep going indefinitely despite whatever limits the future will throw at it." That's a tall order. Will there be oxygen in the atmosphere, or water raining down, or intelligent people on the planet, in the future? A definition of sustainability needs to be relative to a baseline of available resources (material, social, intellectual etc). As this baseline changes, so does sustainability. The example of PV panels is good. They are sustainable now (I just installed a couple on my small sailing boat, to trickle-charge its 12V battery). How long will they be sustainable? 15, 30, 60 years? The answer makes a great deal of practical difference to me.<br><br>I think the metaphor of a bridge is flawed. Agreed: some of the mentioned resources will become scarce or disappear, but which ones and how fast is hard to gauge in some cases. And to assume an end-point in that process, the point at which we "have arrived at the other end of the bridge" is a romantic notion (I imagine a "reaching California" frontier movie moment). <br><br>Let's not get carried away by our own metaphors, try to properly pace our descent into the future, and also have some fun along the way (on our sailing boats or what have you).<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c6645434326574365925 title="comment permalink">6/8/11, 9:30 PM</a><br><br>

When I first started reading your blog a few years ago, I was so depressed by the outlook and angry with how stupid we've been, that I couldn't find a way forward, but you've really inspired me to do what I can, and influence the people I can. I wanted to share with you that you're being a marvellous force for positive inspiration, and your wry humour has reminded me that life and learning is fun, so I've added that component into my approach. I wanted to learn some simple manual skills, so I've signed up to a course to build a Pennyfarthing from scratch. I don't think it will be the best transport option, but it has already made me friends with the hardware store, a hacksaw, a bench vise and given me a new social network and some great laughs! Long live tinkering in sheds!<br>I'm not great at the food growing thing yet, but I'm getting there, and the worm farm, knitting and cooking are all going well. Thank you again for exposing the things that should be obvious, but aren't (server farms really need that much energy?! Wow. How can people think the internet is robust in that form?). <br>If you get a chance, at some point could you please explain a little more about the mechanical power electricity is put to use for in the home? I'm thinking that might be fans, coffee grinders, maybe washing machines - those kinds of things. Would that be right? What are some appropriate tech models for these things? All I can think of is a bike/pedal setup with geared cogs. Oh, maybe waterwheels. I feel stupid asking this question, but I'm trying to re-learn looking at our world. Trying to see it without the gushing power we're used to. <br>Warm regards, and I hope you're enjoying the summer in your new home.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c1255595734299198610 title="comment permalink">6/8/11, 11:42 PM</a><br><br>

In a time when population density was low and people mostly got around on foot, many kids lived too far from school to get there on a regular basis. Home schooling wasn’t an oddity, and even when kids went to school, most of their real learning took place on the farm. Children on the American family farm were growing up to be farmers themselves. Learning to help Mom and Dad around the homeplace wasn’t an obstacle to their education; learning the myriad skills that farming required, from animal husbandry to market strategies to folk doctoring to weather forecasting to making clothes to building a barn was what education was all about. The Three R’s that you studied in school (readin’, ritin’ and ‘rithmetic) were special and useful skills, but learning skills like making soap and folk doctoring took more energy and time. School was not where life’s most important learning went on.<br><br>In any case, to work was to learn, to learn was to work.

My issue with it was that I'm highly disappointed that they conceded that we are not going to get a space elevator as this would have been rather useful and certainly would have made for an interesting tourist trip! At the very least the view would have been pretty.<br><br>Not sure any governments have the money or willpower for such a project. Do they not understand how much debt the first world is in relative to it's capacity to repay that debt? The US is devaluing it's currency in order to allievate the pain of servicing it's debt obligations. The bankers of the US are offloading US dollars in order to finance the purchase of real world commodities such as gold, iron ore, coal, LNG, wheat etc. Devaluing is a good strategy if you hold off on further borrowing, however this is not the case and I can't see what the end game of this will be - probably default at some point?<br><br>The other thing that stands out from the article, is that energy outputs in terms of gigawatts roll off the tongue nicely, but are actually pretty hard for us to supply now, let alone at some unspecified time in the future. <br><br>Me thinks someone is looking for a fat research grant.<br><br>Fracking is an environmental and geological disaster. There are reports that companies are considering starting this process over here in New South Wales and Queensland. Scary and short term thinking.<br><br>The other thing that's been in the business news here recently: You know that the low hanging fruit of fossil fuels has been used up when Shell is commencing building a multi billion dollar mobile off shore LNG processing ship. The reason for it's construction is to tap into previously small, known but unexploited natural gas deposits off shore in NW Australia.<br><br>I love solar PV technology, however it is not sustainable (thanks for a definition of this much misused word too). Still, it will keep me going for a while yet. Current use is a bit below 3kWh per day, with a fall back plan if there is a problem to reduce it further to 2kWh per day. There are further savings to be had, but it involves considerable changes in my useage patterns. Still it is all possible, it just requires a bit of effort.<br><br>Who knows where it will all go.

It's my plan and I will say no more on this subject.<br><br>Hi Matt,<br><br>I can't argue with you about carrying capacity as we have exceeded it here by a factor of at least two - although studies on this vary widely (two is about the average though). Most of the continent here is arid lands (which is not quite desert, but not very pleasant all the same). Still with global wierding it seems to be getting wetter here especially across the north and central areas which is resulting in inland lakes refilling and a more generally humid climate. I'm feeling the effects of all of this and I'm in a pretty wet area to begin with.<br><br>I'd be a bit nervous of stating that the North American population is below the current carrying capacity (albeit with a much lower ecological footprint per capita than at present as you stated). <br><br>My reason for this is that although you have far more productive soils than we will ever have, the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides has the unfortunate effect of destroying the biology of those soils. You can repair this situation, but it will take at minimum three years to transition from a chemical based agricultural process to an organic one. You have to feed a lot of people in that time. <br><br>It would also require a complete rethink of the current systems of nutrient disposal which I'm not sure people have the will power to do. I've noticed that in disaster scenario's people for some reason always dig pit toilets, but there are much better options which recycle the nutrients. Pit toilets end up polluting the ground water, unless you prepare a small hole and plant a tree in that hole shortly thereafter.<br><br>I've noticed a lot of people also point to Cuba to show what can be achieved with transitions, but they also tend to gloss over the fact that it is a totalitarian state and any dissenting voices were probably quietly dragged away somewhere to have a good think about their opinions. They also have a more co-operative culture to begin with and this is no small thing. It's not for no reason that farmers are some of the highest remunerated people in Cuba.<br><br>Also in North America, you need to think about your aquifers. They are being depleted at a huge rate. I often read here in comments that people use wells for drinking water. Over here they use water tanks to capture rainwater (I have around 90,000 litres at present). Those wells in North America are being sucked dry or polluted. This has far reaching impacts and it needs to be considered. Over here we call wells, bores and it's a touchy subject between neighbours I can assure you. Fortunately here our aquifers are very deep (and so are the local trees tap roots) so people have difficulty sucking them dry as it uses a lot of power which they can't afford. <br><br>Look at the process of fracking and ask yourself, what is this doing to the water table? Do we produce food in this area? Will that food be contaminated?<br><br>I dunno, who can tell?<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c9090301648827019072 title="comment permalink">6/9/11, 2:46 AM</a><br><br>

A set of unhappy insights at best.

You really can't make this stuff up. <br><br>And in fact, the breakdown of functioning credit markets and monetary systems (and by extension, the rest of the hyper-complex and heavily interconnected global financial system) seems more or less imminent, which would immediately disrupt supply chains and transport (as we saw in 2008 when letters of credit virtually disappeared), and those aspects of life depending on them. Which, in an importation nation like America, is just about everything. Ain't globalization grand.<br><br>In fact, it is this notion of complexity limits that seems likeliest to me to drive a rapid descent initially, in the form of food and job shortages, first, as a result of the contraction (or perhaps outright collapse) of trade and commerce, with attendant constrictions in agricultural inputs, followed at some point down the road by electricity or internet shortages, once hastily contrived social and political 'quick fixes' prove untenable in the face of the facts on the ground, and we begin to be forced to grapple with reality.<br><br>In light of this, the garden remains my top priority, but I will admit that the concept of thermoelectric has really grabbed my imagination.

It is that the usefulness of the Internet to its users is proportional to the number of people who have access to it. As Internet access gets more expensive (and I can't imagine how it could fail to do so), the number of people able and/or willing to pay for it will go down. But now the usefulness of the web to those who still have access to it declines because suddenly, a lot of their favorite web pages are down, a lot of people with whom they used to exchange e-mails can no longer be reached that way, and so on. And I see a feedback loop developing: people who might, in principle, be willing and able to make financial sacrifices in order to preserve their Internet access might decide that those sacrifices are not worth it if the utility of the Internet is substantially diminished. And now that these people abandon the Internet, it becomes even less useful.

Soldering is not the way when you're heating them with the sun. This is a very basic article but it gives you an idea what's involved.

While the single well decline rates are quite high and the economics are not as great as the stock pushers would have you believe it is a resource that will be with us for a good while to come. The reason for that is that it is more similar to tar sands than conventional natural gas in it is a large but rate limited resource. That is bad news for those looking to rapidly increase production to very high levels to maintain the status quo, but it is great news for people interested in sustainability and use as a bridge fuel and to cushion and extend the transition period. Furthermore, all those gas wells, even after reaching the end of their economic life from an international oil company's perspective, may provide individuals in areas where drilling has been prevalent a useful trickle of energy for many decades after the drill rigs stop running (most gas wells are shut down not because they stop producing gas, but because they don't produce enough to hassle with relative to ongoing liability and regulatory compliance costs). <br><br>Also a more general comment on your recent posts on the impending "long decent" and the green wizard project. It may very well be that I have been misinterpreting you, but it seems like you envision a somewhat homogeneous loss of complexity throughout society, when in fact it is quite likely that there will be vast inequity in what impacts are felt by who (both globally and domestically). In the current stage I see society re-stratifying into a more traditional pyramid distribution of wealth and power. While the strategies you have laid out in your green wizard project are quite useful adaptation strategies for those of us who are likely to be expelled from the bloated privileged class in this country, I also find it hard to believe that there will not be a fairly significant elite class that manages to hold onto a large portion of what we consider to be a comfortable modern lifestyle. I would think it would make sense to look at the social and economic structure of other nations we consider to be "third world" as an appropriate parallel for certain stages along the decent. Even in the poorest nations there is a wealthy class that lives comfortable modern lifestyles. It is this elite class that may be far more successful than you think at maintaining and stewarding a large portion of technology and knowledge far into the future. That is of course assuming they are able to keep the masses and their pitchforks at bay.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c8035097727565562697 title="comment permalink">6/9/11, 12:16 PM</a><br><br>

If one could figure out the major complexity vulnerabilities then perhaps one might imagine how they would be solved, and by that method come up with a picture of what is coming.<br><br>One potential is in regard to the real estate debacle presently unfolding. Recently there has been a lot of difficulty in producing clear title to properties, with some feeling that maybe the law will stand up for the little guy in opposition to the banks. What happens when the electronic data systems associated begin to fail for any number of reasons? What if the bureaucratic machinations are just too complex to unwind? We've discussed previously that at some point society may be arranged on more of a feudal structure, which would be a reduction in complexity compared to the present situation, and I could well imagine that eventually the issue of ownership might be dealt with by simply assigning ownership of blocks to “worthy” individuals or organizations. <br><br>The electric grid is another, and I do expect an uneven breakup with some smaller islands that still have power, some marginal areas that have intermittent power for a while, and many rural areas that simply cannot maintain enough infrastructure to get power through. It is not trivial to keep a small island powered and stable though. You must have sufficient sources and loads reasonably matched to maintain stability. If a large load suddenly turn off, how fast can the generator respond? Conversely if a large load turns on, is there sufficient excess generation capacity to maintain voltage and frequency?<br><br>I wonder sometimes if those “excess claims to real wealth” Nicole Foss discusses will be extinguished simply by the loss of records and data. “Sorry, we have no record of that account”. But the thing is, this would seem to benefit those who owe the money, not the banks who are owed, and so it is unlikely to be the way it happens – so if the data is lost, how does it play out such that the little guy still loses?<br><br>I guess I do believe that in spite of the massive amounts of data that are gathered on all of us and all we do, that ultimately this will become irrelevant as the complexity required to use and maintain that data fails, or is overwhelmed by chaos.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c7798290005881133208 title="comment permalink">6/9/11, 12:37 PM</a><br><br>

It's when you stop thinking of resources as a pile of stuff sitting somewhere, and start thinking of flows and cycles, that the doors start opening up. <br><br>Evan, that's quite a workable strategy. And of course there's also the possibility that you might develop a taste for venison ;-)<br><br>Sage, nicely phrased. <br><br>Siani, that's good to hear. I'm not sure what those medieval alchemists used to make their cylindrical copper reflectors, but it should be replicable -- and I'm working on a design for a solar thermoelectric device that uses a conical reflector rather than a parabolic one, anyway, which would be a piece of cake to make. <br><br>Remnant, it's already coming apart, at the usual pace for a crisis of overcomplexity. Remember that even the faster collapses that history has on display seem fairly slow when you're living through them!<br><br>Planner, well put.

You're well ahead of the game. <br><br>Yupped, glad to hear it. Like most things solar, solar cooking takes a knack, but a little practice will do it. <br><br>John, that's what makes PV potentially such a valuable bridge -- all the energy needed to make it and use it is invested up front, and then you get the energy payoff for decades thereafter. Since energy is relatively cheap now, and will be much more expensive later, it's a way of leveraging energy costs across time. <br><br>Avery, all in good time. I've long thought that by the time all this is over, they'll be strip mining the national parks, with the enthusiastic support of people who used to call themselves environmentalists. <br><br>Rake, I'm glad to hear it resonates with you!

Not an engineer myself, but I have a vague recollection from a few decades ago of a party held by an engineer co-worker who demonstrated for us one of his prize possessions: a tesla coil. I don't remember anything about how it works; only a vague recollection that we could have had low-cost electricity without the physical grid. Or something to that effect.<br><br>Houyhnhnm, going back to our discussion of horse "technology," while I've found the humidity knocks my arabs back a bit, it certainly doesn't knock them out. Of course here in Maine we don't have tropical temperatures...yet. Also, there was a herd of spanish barbs from the original imports that survived and thrived on a Caribbean island (forget which one), living in the woods there. Their descendants are still there hundreds of years later, or at least were a few years back. They ran into trouble when their forest burned and they were driven into the plantations. The rich grass, sedentary life and lack of wear and tear left them foundering, and the hoof person I trained with was hired to try to save them. Interesting video of trimming loose feral horses restrained only by a tranquilizer dart, surrounded by a ring of people...<br><br>That brings me to my main worry about arabs. Sparse vegetation and coarse sand keeps their feet in balance in the desert. Constant maintenance is the rule with rich grass and soft terrain.<br><br>I don't expect to find the useful arabs in the barns of the big halter-breeders. They can, however, be found in the small, backyard breeder barns. There are still likely plenty of davenports around these parts at least. There was a davenport breeder in Massachusetts a couple decades ago, so their influence can be found here. My mare's damline while mostly crabbet, has multiple davenports in her background. The sireline is polish and old egyptian (Bask and Hillany Mistany). The CMK breeders are another source of the original desert type that are round, muscular and tough. <br><br>As for the riders that aren't competent even in climate-controlled indoors, well, I won't be losing sleep over them. The adult amateurs did a lot of damage to horses and the horse world in general, in my experience. In the real world, they'll either give up (if they haven't already) or learn respect for those of us who learned the hard way...after they've eaten some dirt, of course.<br><br>Finally, I think there's a bit of a difference between riding unknown terrain in the dark and plowing a fairly flat field or walking along a gravel road.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c1149479825711064711 title="comment permalink">6/9/11, 1:08 PM</a><br><br>

All those empty shopping malls and buildings? What better way to stash resources, so that you can hire people to dismantle and strip them ten or twenty years from now!<br><br>Raven, if you're going to build the boat, don't bother with the garden, insulation, etc., because while you're on the ocean someone else will occupy what used to be your property. As for cargoes, how much do you think most Americans would pay for coffee beans in a future in which they're no longer being shipped here by the industrial system? <br><br>Isis, that's an extremely good point. Thank you. <br><br>George, er, this is all that came through. You might want to resend. <br><br>August, the Russian lantern-powered thermoelectric generators, which produced enough power to run tube-based radios, used alternating strips of zinc-antimony and constantan, which is a copper-nickel alloy. I'd probably start with that as a first try. <br><br>Chris, I think you're overestimating the long- or even middle-term impact of fracking; the ferocious decline rates and the way that fracking is being used as yet another excuse to put off conservation, my guess is that it's going to be a bubble-and-bust phenomenon on the grand scale. As for your second comment, er, I have no idea how you got that from my writing; I've been saying all along that the Long Descent is going to be a very ragged process, proceeding at different rates in different areas, and affecting different groups of people in very different ways. <br><br>The current holders of wealth and influence, though, will likely be among those who lose biggest; their wealth and power depend on their mastery of systems that are going to bits around them, and if they withdraw to gated communities with armed guards, well, you might look up the phrase "Praetorian guard" for a glimpse at who will actually have the goodies once the dust settles. <br><br>Karim, exactly! A sustainable technology, by and large, will rely on things you'd have to hand anyway.

The reason this is the "biggest in 5 years" is that we have been in a solar minimum (a perfectly ordinary 11 year cycle) from which we are emerging in a perfectly ordinary and normal manner.

Here's his comment: <br><br>"I remain very interested in the thermoelectric generators which you are the first to have told me of. I'd be very pleased if someone could point me to a good web source dealing with "sturdy sun-tracking mounts." I wonder how feasible it is to make ones that operate mechanically like a watch or a clock? It seems a shame to waste scant electrical energy on something that could be handled by spring power or the like <br><br>"I'm still working on a rather fancy design for a solar cooker, involving a parabolic dish whose face is not perpendicular to its axis. It's designed to be placed in a window. I'm discovering ways of conveniently locating the hot spot and extending the period of the reflector's solar exposure, even without a sun-tracking mount or indeed any movement at all, by playing certain geometric tricks with dish design. <br><br>"I've never liked the way that PV panels are typically hooked into the grid as you've described, even when I didn't know that this makes them dependent upon it and useless when it's down. The whole approach with which that technology is handled commercially rather grates upon me. This past Earth Day at an eco-festival I heard a speaker who runs a PV business describe how homeowners can get a big system with no money down due to government subsidy, which is a great deal if you own your home - but if you're a tenant and request such a thing, your landlord gets the break and you in all likelihood due to the improvement will get to pay higher rent, doing your landlord a favor at your own expense. Talk about a disincentive! <br><br>"What I'd like are little PV panels I can stick in my windows according to the time of day. The small amount of juice from them might power a little laptop or radio, or be decanted into a battery for later use in high-efficiency electric lighting. And they can't be stolen so easily as from a back yard, which would be my other alternative. People will want freestanding photovoltaics ever more as the grid disintegrates, I fancy. <br><br>"Unless you say otherwise, I'm assuming that salvaging is one of the tactics you refer to which deliberately take advantage of the process of deindustrialization, conservationally metabolizing the detritus of catabolic collapse.

I live in north central Pennsylvania where there is a lot of gas drilling activity going on. <br><br>The sheer amount of truck traffic associated with the gas drilling boggles my mind. A lot of it is tanker trucks carrying water to and from the wells. But there are many other trucks carrying machinery and supplies, and quite a number of Halliburton mobile cementing rigs. Add to this the drill rigs, generators, and support equipment at the well pads. Then, there is an amazing number of large white pickup trucks with Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado plates crisscrossing our rural roads. Now we're seeing passenger cars from these places as a sign that the gas people are bringing their families.<br><br>Here's the thing that really gives me a headache: They are using immense amounts of petroleum to extract natural gas from the shale. Meanwhile in Canada, they're using immense amounts of natural gas to extract petroleum from the tar sands. <br><br>What's wrong with this picture?

It is precisely because we have the capacity to salvage the embodied energy in the material culture around us that we will be reliant on the products of past fossil fuel energy use. We also will be exposed to embodied energy in the biophysical systems, especially climate change but also centennial scale ecosystem succession, that will take hundreds of years to dissipate. <br><br>David Holmgren makes the same point in Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability; a book I recommend to you all if you havn't read it. He says we should embrace our culture's recent experience with recent constant technological change as we move into a "descent" culture. So even Holmgren is moving beyond the "Permanent" in Permaculture. <br><br>Are there principles to descent-culture salvage or are we just "coping ugly"?

He worked on developing a method to harness the 'Telluric Currents' that naturally flow through the body of the planet, but nobody to date has been able to take this very diffuse electricity and concentrate it into a useful form. I would imagine if somebody were to do it successfully (and it seems possible although unlikely), it would be much like a solar oven or solar hot water rather than a steam turbine; a concentration of heat energy to do relatively modest heat energy things, like heat other stuff up. So a successful telluric current collector would likely be very, very large and generate a modest current to do modest things.<br><br>He also had some theories on over-unity electricity generation using the earth as a type of battery or dynamo to regenerate and reinforce the system. These have been latched onto by the over-unity dreamers and remain in just that place; a dream and a wish but nevertheless a failure under our old friend thermodynamics.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c1357286992534609995 title="comment permalink">6/9/11, 9:43 PM</a><br><br>

If the mount is misaligned, one tank will get warmer, pushing freon to the other tank until the mount balances, facing the sun when both tanks are the same temperature. Unfortunately, they tend to rock back and forth a bit when the wind blows. I use one for our small (160 watt) water pumping system. I found it in a junk pile behind a woodstove shop. The owner wasn't sure what it was; left behind by the previous owner. Gave him 20 bucks. Most days it works really well. Whatever is mounted on a Zomeworks needs to be balanced above the pivot point.<br><br>One guy who posted an article in Homepower years ago used a spring and a tank of water. During the day, water would be slowly added to the tank, adding weight and pulling against the spring, slowly rotating the mount. I think he used a drip irrigation timer to add water several times a day, giving the array several positions, but if one did the math, one could use pressure compensating drippers to constantly add water, slowly increasing the weight of the tank and rotating the mount.<br>In the evening, a small valve is opened, slowly releasing the water (watering his fruit trees), allowing the spring to slowly pull the mount back to the east. If one had a good source of gravity water, activated the system in the morning, opened the drain in the evening, and spent some time calibrating the system, this would be a neat solution, until things get cold :-/ <br> <br>As I've posted, I use old satellite dish mounts and control electronics from www.theanalogguy.com.

However, as with most things I believe both the optimists are far too optimistic and the pessimists are far too pessimistic. I have actually been on two wellpads in PA in the past year and have had frank discussions with engineers and operators working in these plays. <br><br>Most of the propaganda about shale gas does indeed underestimate both the costs and decline curves of individual wells. However, the resource is quite large and somewhat (although not completely) homogeneous. Basically anywhere you drill a hole into one of these shale formations you are going to get a great deal of gas out. It may not be quite the exact same amount, but it's WAY more uniform and less "risky" than conventional natural gas. The scale up problem is that you only have so much equipment to drill and frack so many holes. This limits the ultimate rate at which the total resource can be extracted, but also extends the life of that resource (at least from the perspective of the whole play). <br><br>This is ultimately a good thing from a sustainability of the resource standpoint. We aren't going to maintain the status quo on shale gas, but we may be able to get something like 10-20% of what we currently use for well over 100 years as long as society doesn't completely break down. Given that quite a few countries currently survive on vastly lower energy demand than we do, I believe it has the potential to act as useful backstop or at least "long ledge" on the way down the long decent. <br><br>We will have to disagree on the "elites" however. I find many of the arguments that they are going to fare worse than the rest of us "normal but prepared" to be more aspirational than logical. Sure I'd love to see rich wallstreet bankers starving in the streets and begging at the door of some liberal's organic farm, but I just don't see it happening. Yes many of the current elites may in fact lose much of what they have and certainly many current institutions will crumble or lose influence over time. However, my point was not about specific elites, only that there will always be an elite class. Exactly who inhabits that class may change many times over the course of the decent (as it has throughout history), but there will always be the rich and powerful and those with money and power will seek to maintain as much of current modern technology and comfort as they can afford.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c1063136548225068446 title="comment permalink">6/10/11, 7:50 AM</a><br><br>

I think the idea of complexity limits is particularly useful. Last year I had an article published titled "A paradox of military technology" (http://www.adfjournal.adc.edu.au/UserFiles/issues/182%202010%20Jul_Aug.pdf, from p. 44). The paradox is that "the advantage provided by the increased complexity of a military capability increases<br>the vulnerability of that same capability to systemic collapse due to its reliance on complex<br>supply chains." Whilst focused on the military it is relevant to all modern technology. I have displayed this as a diagram on p. 50. Adding a complexity threshold or limit to this diagram would suggest that virtually all modern technologies are beyond that threshold as you so eloquently describe.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Cam from Oz<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c8397962004873510850 title="comment permalink">6/10/11, 10:01 AM</a><br><br>

I could see it happening that way.<br><br>But I think the key to the way things will play out is gong to be <a href=http://www.feasta.org/documents/risk_resilience/Tipping_Point.pdf rel=nofollow>what David Korowicz calls </a> the 'operational fabric' of our society - which has nothing to do with the technical aspects of oil or gas extraction. <br><br>In order for any of that extraction to persist, for example, we need functioning credit and equity markets (and either commodity markets or some substitute such as multi-lateral arrangements), a functioning transportation system, access to those proprietary chemicals used in the process (which implies a functional chemical engineering system), relatively stable governance and social structures (at least regionally), etc. <br><br>It is these things that I think put shale gas at risk, because of the level of inter-connectedness between them - meaning when one goes down it will tend to drag the others down (aka counter-party risk). <br><br>It's the feedback loops that will rip the system apart, and impact downstream technologies like shale gas extraction in ways impossible to predict.<br><br>Remember what happened to the Baltic Dry Index during the '08/'09 crisis? It dropped by 94% - to the point where they were parking hundreds of merchant ships in the middle of the ocean and just leaving them there. The Daily Mail did <a href=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1212013/Revealed-The-ghost-fleet-recession-anchored-just-east-Singapore.html rel=nofollow>a fascinating piece on this in 2009.</a><br><br>This is what it looks like when the operational fabric begins to fray. It affects everything, and I think it becomes impossible to make sensible predictions based on technical aspects that may appear to have merit in current circumstances.<br><br>We'll just have to see. :)<br><br>"...my point was not about specific elites, only that there will always be an elite class. Exactly who inhabits that class may change many times over the course of the decent (as it has throughout history), but there will always be the rich and powerful and those with money and power will seek to maintain as much of current modern technology and comfort as they can afford."<br><br>I certainly lean toward agreeing with this - I had misunderstood you to be saying the current elite class would ride the waves of crisis out and remain on top. Any reading of the history of most (though not necessarily all) civilizations would support the statement you've made above. Crisis = danger + opportunity, right? And some will find themselves in a position to leverage such opportunity.<br><br>That said, I am, I have to admit, fond of pointing to potlatch based societies, which have flourished in the past (especially in low energy use cultures), in which status was achieved by giving valuables away, rather than by accumulating them. So in this sense, I think the absolute nature of your statement - 'there will always be' - may not be appropriate. It does, though, seem likely that this mode of being will persist for some time, and in may areas. <br><br>I can always hope, though, for some revival of the potlatch sensibilities in some areas and among some communities. I won't count on it, but I would do what I could to encourage and participate in that.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c4177512609907048423 title="comment permalink">6/10/11, 10:08 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you. <br><br>This past year my wife and I made a useful exercise of cataloging all of the items in our house that utilize electricity, figuring out exactly how much these items use, and then using this data as a baseline, we undertook a process of unplugging and replacing energy-reliant appliances with items that do not require power. It is amazing to see how much better some of the old hand-cranked items in the kitchen, for example, work as compared to their electricity-draining counterparts. The purpose of this exercise was to see how much we could cut our usage by and the results have been fairly impressive. The most rewarding part of this has been learning to live with less energy through trial and error. <br><br>It has been a slow process at times, and we are definitely still learning, but with each passing month I think we learn ways to get by with a lot less power. This was always the key to thinking about alternative energy sources for us because, as you stated, no alternative energy source is sustainable enough in the long run to power the typical American home. I learned this lesson quickly when I started to look into how many solar panels would be needed to power our old electric baseboard heating system -- let's just say that those plans did not get very far off the drawing board. I quickly learned that a solar system of the scale that we could afford could only power a few essential items, a refrigerator and freezer being some of the most important on our small farm. <br><br>With these efforts to power down firmly in place, the next step is to invest in some self-installed PV panels so that we can begin generating our own power. I am glad to see that my plans for this type of thing are still valid, however, I would love to learn more about solar thermoelectric generators but I fear that my engineering skills are nowhere near up to par for this type of activity.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c2590246960778629578 title="comment permalink">6/10/11, 10:08 AM</a><br><br>

But now, as the recent post was of the right subject and just about technical enough, I'd like to openly wonder about an idea I've had about electricity-generation for some time now.<br><br>I live in Finland, that is 60 degrees latitude, which means long seasons of scant sunlight and also heavy heating of the living spaces for a big part of the year. Now I've come to wonder wouldn't it be a reasonable idea to try converting the heating energy we get from wood first to something else, namely electricity, compared to just burning the stuff for the heat only? As long as the electricity is used and batteries are stored inside, the heat is not going anywhere anyway. When I think of a well burning fireplace I have to say I can't help but to think it could generate a nice amount of electricity, just in the season it's most needed and most difficult to get from wind, solar or any other source.<br><br>So, I wonder if anybody knew of anything like this? Some fireplace-boiler-turbine stuff or whatever you could have? Or if there's some serious pitfalls on this? Since I'm no engineer I can only guess what there could be. But so far I can only see the fireplace-powerplant as an obvious choice. I mean there is really concentrated heat roaming around that fireplace for the whole winter so why not try to refine it first and let it dissipate from there?<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c2114001982989221346 title="comment permalink">6/10/11, 12:12 PM</a><br><br>

It sounds like you're getting a more diverse range of vegies which is a good thing. Out of interest, do you keep the seeds from these or let them go wild? The reason I ask this is because I'm doing both and it's quite interesting to see wild vegies popping up in strange places. I'm not sure which is the better way to go.<br><br>Back in winter land though, we had snow here last week, although you guys probably wouldn't get excited about it like we do. It blanketed the ground for a few hours at most. It killed off some of the new growth on the citrus trees which are fruiting nicely. There's less fruit this year though because of all the rain (710mm already this year). Still it's better than a drought.<br><br>Strangely enough, I've had wild rocket seedlings germinate last week. Go figure that out? The wild rocket seedlings have a stronger taste than the original seedling stock, which is no bad thing.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c773187919277832634 title="comment permalink">6/10/11, 4:28 PM</a><br><br>

It would take a lot of years of trials to reverse this situation.<br> - Back then the organic matter in the soil would have been very high as nutrient loops were often closed or not as leaky as today. Current agriculture is akin to strip mining. This is not the case today and growing vegetables in a forested area as you suggested makes no sense. Fruit trees yes, but vegetables no. I'm happy to expand on this if you'd like as the answer relates to soil biology.<br>- The reliance and supply on oil, fertilisers and pesticides cannot be guaranteed. <br>- The reliance on heavy machinery in agriculture means that there is little to no skills in the current population. This is no small issue. Look at what happened in Cambodia, when the crazy Pol Pott regime moved everyone out of the cities to create some rural ideal (which the actual purpose was to grow rice for export so they could buy weapons and luxuries).

That way you could move them around as the season changed and you used different pieces of equipment. I assume as long as there is a temperature difference between hot and cool sides you would continue to generate electricity, so some sort of heat absorbing mass insulating the flue with the wires going thru it would keep electrical output going even when the stove wasn't actively burning fuel.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c4690773160038298218 title="comment permalink">6/10/11, 5:06 PM</a><br><br>

Ironically enough, I have much the same education as Adam Smith -- he took a clergyman's degree, which at that time meant a lot of classics, a lot of classical philosophy in particular, and a fair amount of old-fashioned theology and metaphysics, which is not too far from my own training. <br><br>Tom, thanks for the link to the post; the only difference I can see is that my concept covers a very, very wide range of potential things to salvage, not all of them as tangible as wood. <br><br>Mac, glad to hear it!<br><br>Cam, good. Very good. You're on top of an issue very few people have noticed yet. I've got some points to make on that same theme, though it'll be a while -- I need to finish up the sequence of posts on green wizardry before it'll be time to start talking in detail about the end of American empire, in which military issues of that kind will likely play a significant role. <br><br>Troubador, excellent! Don't worry about the thermoelectric generators right yet -- cutting your energy use has to come first anyway, and there are many good ways to get the modest amount of power you'll need once you do that. Right now, a few PV panels on the roof are likely as good an option as any -- and by the time those aren't available any more, I'm hoping that the mad scientists will have worked out the bugs on solar thermoelectronic devices. <br><br>Timo, welcome to the conversation! There are certainly ways of turning heat into electricity; just remember that the electricity isn't free. You'll have to burn more fuel to heat your home and generate electricity than you would need just to heat your home, due to the laws of thermodynamics. That said, if you've got plenty of fuel and can use either a thermoelectric generator or a heat engine of some kind hooked up to a generator, you can probably make it work. <br><br>Evan, good. Hunting skills are worth having, for more reasons than one. <br><br>Chris, I save seeds and plant deliberately. My garden is small and very intensively worked (think double-dug raised beds with all the compost and organic matter I can get worked into them each spring), and I rotate crops so that the same plants don't grow in the same bed two years running, to keep pests down. Mind you, I still got two volunteer tomato plants coming up in the middle of a radish and parsnip bed; the radishes have already been eaten and the parsnips can handle the competition, so they'll stay. <br><br>Dltrammel, that ought to work!<br><br>Sofistek, that's a good way of putting it. The distinction between ecosystem limits and complexity limits, though, is important, since a lot of people lose track of the fact that our ability to maintain any given level of technology over the long term -- whether or not that technology is ecologically harmless -- also has to be assessed.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c8543429555083629951 title="comment permalink">6/10/11, 9:13 PM</a><br><br>

Am I missing something obvious here?"<br><br>I may be wrong, but I think what you are missing is the notion of entropy - embodied in one of the peskier of the physical laws of the universe: the second law of thermodynamics. Basically, this says that there is no such thing as the 'closed system' as you are thinking of it. The energy lost during conversion becomes diffuse heat (this is the tendency toward maximizing entropy that ius embodied in the second law) which is so high entropy that it becomes useless to 'do work' - it takes a considerable infrastructure to increase the efficiency of such a process, and even then, you will lose much if not most of the energy in the conversion. I think most conversion processes are only about 30 - 40% efficient (the rest is lost) - there may be ways to increase that by recapturing at least some of the 'waste' heat, but I think you are still going to wind up losing most of it. <br><br>Hopefully, someone here with a better practical knowledge of thermodynamics as applied to home conversion systems will respond if I've steered you wrong! :)<br><br>A couple of essays you may find interesting:<br><br><a href=http://energybulletin.net/stories/2011-05-19/thermodynamics-intelligent-living-universe rel=nofollow>The Thermodynamics of an Intelligent Living Universe</a><br><br><a href=http://www.energybulletin.net/stories/2011-05-15/entropy-peak-oil-and-stoic-philosophy rel=nofollow>Entropy, peak oil, and Stoic philosophy</a><br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c7361573081489567969 title="comment permalink">6/11/11, 9:09 AM</a><br><br>

As a child, I thought everyone stopped along roads to see what someone else had (foolishly) tossed out. In the 50s, Dad had boxes in the shop for copper and other metals. Mom had storage boxes in the attic, the garage, everywhere. It was a Depression-era game and my parents played it even after they had the money to buy things new. <br><br>Since I view it as a challenging game, I never lost my enthusiasm for it. Buying things new never interested me. Where’s the sport, the imagination? One doesn’t often say, “What can we do with this?” when picking up a package with a price tag on it. <br><br>One of our best scores was a trove of cobblestones (actually Belgian blocks or setts) tossed away by the city of Tacoma. I was quite young, but, if memory serves, in the late 50s or so, Tacoma ripped up lovely streets made from stone which Europeans had earlier ripped up to use as ballast when ships were sent over for loads of cement back in the late 19th C and early 20th C. We spent a summer bringing home load after load of these exquisite, discarded blocks. From European streets to ballast to American streets to American family garden walls—talk about international recycling. <br><br>I love salvage.

While long term, hands on work with an expert is essential, reading can speed shorten the process. Short courses can be helpful, but many just instill false confidence or avoidable frustration. <br><br>It takes years to learn to use horses in a manner that’s safe and without suffering—for horse or human. As Kunstler noted in one of his books, cruelty to horses (and other draft stock) will likely be much more common in the future. <br><br>Too many of us push buttons and expect an immediate, uniform response. Unfortunately, horses are not machines. “Pushbutton” horses exist, but it takes a long time to learn how to push those buttons, so often even the best trained horses are unwittingly abused.<br><br>For example, in his teens, my father worked with a forest logger. One day he and a friend hitched Ben and Frank, the logger’s team, to an over-sized load and soon had a pair of frantic drafters, jumping around, hitting their collars individually rather than together. Seeing this, the team’s owner way up the hill bellowed a deep, rumbling “WHOA!” and the team froze. (The boys had been calling “WHOA!” too, but, as with most novices, their inexperience induced a nervous upward inflection that horses hear as “GO!!”) Once the horses and the boys were quiet, the owner called out each horse’s name to bring him to attention and then yelled, “PULL!” Both horses hit their collars at the same time and the load moved. Fifty years later, Dad said he still remembered almost every word of the lecture they got from the owner when he scrambled down off the hill. <br><br>Most people are ignorant of horse physiology too. I’ll admit to being shocked by this article on <i>TheHorse.com,</i>, a great source of veterinary news: <a href="http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=16625" rel=nofollow>“Summer Riding: When the Rider is Hot, the Horse is Hotter."</a><br><br>Here are a couple of significant passages: <br><br>“Horses also rely to a significant extent on sweating to cool them off. They can sweat 15 to 20 litres per hour in cool, dry conditions and up to 30 litres per hour in hot, humid conditions, but only 25-30% of the sweat produced is effective in cooling the horse by evaporation.”<br><br>“It only takes 17 minutes of moderate intensity exercise in hot, humid weather to raise a horse's temperature to dangerous levels. That's three to 10 times faster than in humans. Horses feel the heat much worse than we do."<br><br>So a humid climate in the midst of a serious drought is pretty much a worst case scenario for a horse. <br><br>And that brings me to the current drought in Cuba, the model of sustainability for so many: <br><a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=55784" rel=nofollow>“Rainy Season Off to a Poor Start"</a><br><br>Water is being trucked into cities, and many cattle and horses are starving. No spring grass. <br><br>Houyhnhnm<br><br>P.S.

But some kind of generator working with physical movement would be ok. This original situation, my reasonably well insulated house with my reasonably efficient wood burning device we could call a "closed enough system", for practical purposes anyway. Let's say that it is a system inside of which it doesn't matter if a higher form of energy converts to heat.<br><br>So, now I carry a nice pile of wood inside, close the door and proceed to burn it. Once it's gone up in smoke I'm left with x-amount of heat from the wood's stored energy in the house. <br><br>Then, the next day, I've put some kind of a generator, a closed steam powered system for example, one that doesn't leak the heat outside any more than the original system without the electricity generator would. I once again proceed to burn the wood, wait for it to be gone and realise I am now left with x MINUS the electricity generated -amount of heat in my house. So far so good. But this, I think, is not the end of the story. The reality is cyclical rather than linear.<br><br>The way I see it, and trust others to see it too, is that I have lost no greater amount of energy compared to the situation with the stove only here, just temporarily put some on a kind of a "savings account". Ok, so I have my batteries stored up in the same heated space and so are the regularly used electronic appliances too. Now how I see it is that if I manage to use all that electricity inside the house (let's even close the curtains for the light not being able to escape) before I burn the next load of wood, I should be left with the original x-amount of heat, with the added benefit of having been able to recycle some of it through my lamp and my radio first, making them in essence the extensions of my wood burning stove, radiating heat into their surroundings as they were used. I mean, to me, this is thermodynamics as simple as it gets. As long as I have emptied the batteries before the heating season is over, I've lost nothing that I wouldn't have lost anyway in the first place, and have been able to meanwhile enjoy the benefits of a modest amount of electricity at my service.<br><br>Of course there might be some practical issues with this, some loss due to some strange quirks of creation, but in principle I cannot see anything wrong with converting some of your self-generated heat into electricity given that you don't compromise your insulating capacity/heating efficiency in the process ie, keep the system as closed as it was and that you store and use the electricity in the same space that requires the heating.<br><br>Thanks for everyone on their time, I hope (for my sanity, since this seems to me so fundamentally clear) that we are getting into an agreement here...<br><br>Cheers!<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c4045574049131729032 title="comment permalink">6/11/11, 1:40 PM</a><br><br>

More on this soon. As for the learning curve for horses -- good gods, of course! People who know how to work with horses, and can teach other people how to do so, will be at a premium in the years to come; I'd encourage anyone who's interested to get to work learning about that now. As in yesterday, if not sooner. <br><br>Lewis, that does sound spooky. Here in Cumberland we're on a busy rail line, and the boxcars we see are rolling east or west; the pileup on your end of the continent suggests that the import economy may be in worse trouble than anybody's admitting yet. <br><br>Timo, heat won't do work unless you have a differential between hot and cold, and in the process of doing work, that differential is decreased. If your system is closed, there's no differential and the heat can't be made to do work. Please do some reading on thermodynamics; better still, try to make your scheme work, and when you discover that it won't -- any more than hooking a generator and a motor to the same shaft, connecting the terminals of the one to the other, and giving it a spin will produce perpetual motion -- you might find it easier to understand why.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c2529690372672284587 title="comment permalink">6/11/11, 2:05 PM</a><br><br>

And PV, for that matter. Or perhaps selling long the Seebeck / Peltier effect. <br><br>When I read the Wikipedia article on thermoelectric materials, I see some not-so-pedestrian nonferrous metals like Ytterbium Trialuminide and Constantan, which will be pretty difficult to achieve for the backyard metallurgist. <br><br>On the other hand, you don't need semiconductor grade silicon for a PV cell. For semiconductor grade, the silicon has been completely converted to chlorosilane, distilled, then reconstituted to get the impurity level down to one part in 10^11 or better. It takes some high tech, and a lot of energy. On the other hand, PV silicon works at one part in 10^6 or so, which can be achieved without the expensive purification step. <br><br>The PV effect has been known since 1839 (per Wikipedia). It can be observed in that galena crystal you use for your catwhisker diode. Selenium cells were made long before silicon became the material of choice. <br><br>So what I'm saying is that both of these power generation techniques require some nonferrous metallurgy and other technology unknown prior to the 19th century or so. And I'm inclined to think they will be similarly achievable in a post-industrial world. <br><br>... <br><br>On another energy-saving topic, I'm sort of curious why CHP (Combined Heat and Power) has not come back into vogue in the cooler climates. <br><br>An apartment I once lived in was built in 1910, according to the cornerstone. It had the remnants of some large steam pipes in the basement, which I understand came from the (defunct in 1970) electric power station across the street. The oversized pipes had been reconnected to a gas fired steam boiler, reflecting the energy profligacy of that time.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c7049766091355807109 title="comment permalink">6/11/11, 2:13 PM</a><br><br>

They are identical, except that the other has a small thermoelectric generator attached to the side of it, working on the heat difference of the side of the stove and the room around it, which always remains cooler than the side of the stove. The generator is connected to a small radio and is capable of producing just enough electricity for the radio to play music on a silent volume. The radio always plays the man's favourite tune.<br><br>Now I would like to know why would the man in any situation in which he feels chilly enough to feel the need to fire up one of the stoves choose the one that will not allow him the added pleasure of his favourite tune?<br><br>Only thing I'm arguing here is that the man is, on the whole, not losing anything when he chooses to use the stove with the radio attached, but only gaining the small enjoyment of listening to his favourite song for a while.

Many common N. American staples are introductions from Eurasia, yet thrived here. Heirloom varieties are the minority now, but they're still around. The interest in local Ag and gardening is ever growing and this just leads to more local adaptation and fitness. It'll take time to get back to the quantity and quality of the early 20th Century, for sure. But we do have some time. I'd bet that with the Descent upon us now, the only way the Americas will be required to support the current numbers will be as populations begin to migrate back toward the richest resource areas. Even a fast version of this should take decades.<br><br>3. Oh, I don't see anybody getting very far with current industrial Ag practices! If they listened to me, my State and Federal Representatives would be working themselves to the bone to enact a rolling changeover to industrial organic as a legal baseline with subsidies or incentives for "beyond organic" practices of local, urban, permaculture, biointensive, etc. They're not listening so far. ;) As to the other, I'm not actually suggesting growing the vegetables in the forest, I'm suggesting that if population pressures continue to rise, the forest will be cleared for agriculture. Much of the successful agriculture in the U.S., even before fossil fuel use, has been on cleared land. Done the wrong way this will be an ecological disaster and reek havoc. Done right it might change things a lot but still provide a liveable world for many, many people. Last, silviculture, and "forest gardening" have a big role in the future of feeding people. Check out "1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus" for a gloss of the recent research on pre-Columbian food forests in Amazonia and beyond. Once again, a big, unlikely course change would be involved, but such practices would seem tailor made for feeding the rising populations of the tropical regions.<br><br>4. (&amp;5) No question about it, industrial Ag is done for. Dead. It's just that the giant is so damned big, he's taking forever to hit the floor! Time is needed for skill-building, for sure. But skill-building becomes the goal of more and more people everyday. Is there time enough for a switch to be made with out nasty nastiness ahead? I'd say no, along with JMG. But I'm not sure that we're going to get out of the population problem just because of some seriously rough times. IIRC, JMG and many others do. They envision a general decline of "civilization" with some places declining slower and others faster. They may well be right. Six days out of seven I envision that same thing. But on the seventh day I rest from that and see instead a future where the bumpy ride down for fossil fuels and the globalized corporate capitalist system and the U.S Empire, shakes enough people awake fast enough that the future may well be both much lower energy-consuming, and MORE "civilized". And in some places -just as populous. <br><br>What can I say? It's a hobby. ;)<br><br>But keeping in mind that the original subject was the morality of choosing to reproduce (or really the moral authority of lamenting over-population when one has reproduced) when population pressures are pushing current techno-social systems of utilizing resources past their limits. I say that if most folks would just wise up and then use their power to get things changing even with some people still being fools, we could still transition fairly comfortably to an ecotechnic system. So why should I look to the continued foolishness of the majority instead of the growing size of the wise minority as a guide for my choices?<br><br><br><br>-Matt.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c9086613377731083115 title="comment permalink">6/11/11, 3:27 PM</a><br><br>

Wild vegies are one of nature's bonuses so I hope the tomatoes work out - if nothing else they'll probably be pretty tough if not moved or disturbed.

You never know what you are going to get with agriculture.<br><br>You mentioned double dug garden beds. I had to look up what this meant. Sounds like an excellent way to start a vegie bed. I'm jealous of the productive soils you guys have over there! <br><br>I run 12 raised vegie beds 300mm to 500mm deep (made out of old leaky water tanks which are a waste product and people seem to want to get rid of) so only add compost on the top as the soil level drops. I can't really afford to dig much as it upsets the soil structure too much - just keep top dressing and when I'm finished top dress some more.

This is certainly feasible, but what is the mechanical efficiency of the steam turbine? How much fuel does it consume compared to how much work it performs? <br><br>If you heat your house with a highly efficient wood-burning furnace, would it consume less fuel than a combined steam turbine electrical generator/house heater? <br><br>You always need an open system to make any heat-to-electric system work, because that's the only way any sort of work is accomplished. <br><br>Somehow, somewhere there has to be an opening in the system where something useful (high potential energy) is being brought in and something less useful (low potential energy) is being tossed out. <br><br>What are the openings in your system?<br><br>1) Bringing in firewood.<br><br>2) Cracks (or a vent) letting in cold outside air.<br><br>3) Your chimney exhausting hot waste gases to the outside.<br><br>4) Ashes from the firebox that you eventually take outside.<br><br>You carry in firewood. Oxygen from the outside air is fed into the firebox, which combines with the C’s and H's in the cellulose of the wood (high potential energy) to produce heat, and CO2 and H2O wastes (low potential energy) go up the chimney to the outside. Then you carry out the ashes.<br><br>If you don't supply the firewood and O2 from outside the envelope, then work doesn't get done.<br><br>If you don't allow the CO2 and H20 to escape the envelope, then work doesn't get done.<br><br>If you don't carry out the ashes - well, then you're probably going to get yelled at until you do. :-)<br><br>So you're not just bringing firewood into the house - you also have to bring in outside air, and you have to let the waste products out so that you can exploit the difference in the potential energy. And the wastes have to move from hot to cold.<br><br>From a heat loss standpoint (at least when it's cold outside) it certainly would make a lot more sense to put the steam turbine inside the building envelope than outside in a shed where it's directly heating the great outdoors.<br><br>But a machine designed for one purpose only (to heat a house) is probably going to lose less heat up the chimney than a machine designed for two purposes (to heat a house and to produce heat-embedded-in-electricity), particularly when one of those purposes is producing “smart” high end electricity as opposed to just “dumb” low end heat. Or the machine may incorporate a lot of energy in its manufacture to minimize those efficiency losses. Or it may use a lot of energy while it’s running to minimize those efficiency losses.<br><br>Due to the efficiency losses of the steam turbine (even though the vast majority of those losses would be heat losses which you would be recapturing), I suspect that you would have to burn more wood (or somebody somewhere had to input more energy into the system)to get the same amount of house heat plus heat-embedded-in-electricity. More waste heat would probably be lost up the chimney. <br><br>But your idea still makes a lot more sense than putting the steam turbine outdoors in a shed. You would be recapturing the main efficiency losses (low grade heat) that occur when electricity is generated, and are normally dumped directly into the air. So it would definitely minimize (although not eliminate) whole system heat losses.<br><br>(By the way, thermoelectric would work well in your climate because of the big indoor/outdoor temperature differential during most of the year.)<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c4426576493021441992 title="comment permalink">6/11/11, 6:55 PM</a><br><br>

We have had two and are quite happy. The first iteration (optimal power usage but somewhat troublesome in day to day use) was a standard chest freezer with an external thermostat attached (they are sold as ‘kegerator’ thermostats, you just stick the temperature sensing end into the freezer, and then plug the freezer into the thermostat – it turns on the freezer when it needs to cool, which only needs a short burst, so it uses less power: Google is your friend, we got ours from somewhere or other online). The problem with the chest freezer was the condensation – we got a lot of water in the bottom, plus, it was hard to dig around in there for what you needed. We have ‘upgraded’ to an upright freezer – but with the same thermostat thingie. It still gets ice crystals or water droplets dangling off the top shelf, but we just wipe it off with a towel every so often and live with the drips – it uses very little power compared to a standard fridge and is WAY cheaper than a SunFrost! I had a conversation with some likeminded folks about it here: http://www.homesteadingtoday.com/showthread.php?t=330967&amp;highlight=freezer+fridge<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c5938599125094529538 title="comment permalink">6/11/11, 10:50 PM</a><br><br>

English is a foreign language to me and I wasn't fully aware how strong theoretical connotations it had.<br><br>Secondly, I suggest you to think about this matter in a bit more simple way. For example, imagining a small closed-loop steam generator, that looks like a small kettle, sitting on top of your usual stove, just generating a tiny bit of electricity. There is no need to consider efficiency here, for with a stove without the kettle generator the efficiency for electricity production is 0%. There is no change in the chimney fumes or any other property of the stove. There is no need for any changed structures to grasp this theoretically.<br><br>You could also think of this through an other type of a device. For example, a proverbial exercise-bicycle in your living room. You can just as well make it harder to pedal by pushing against the wheel with a simple physical object to induce drag, thus generating heat directly, or you could put a generator there to induce the same drag, to generate heat and electricity. The only difference, heatwise, is that the version with the generator makes the energy eventually dissipate into heat though a complex piece of electrical engineering and finally, maybe through a light bulb. But the point is, there is no difference in the final amount of heat generated/dissipated. If you are in a situation where the fact that all energy eventually degrades into heat does not matter to you, you are in a situation where you can play around with it as much as you want without any losses whatsoever. That electricity you generated will degenerate into heat before it leaves your house and thus give you warmth just as much as the energy that went straight away into heat. I promise.<br><br>@JMG<br><br>I'm sorry I cannot at present circumstances test this, but actually I intended the question to be more of a question of logics than of practical measurement. I thought it to finally clear out that I was not making any extraordinary claims here, in fact, quite the opposite. As such, I'm a bit surprised by your answer.<br><br>Well, I think it's time to put this subject at rest now, at least from my part. Five posts arguing the same thing and not reaching agreement is just about the limit for civilised men and just a bit too heavy of an introduction from my part... Let's just all keep studying our physics and heating our homes when necessary, and maybe one day there forms a consensus!<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c9159533301191412493 title="comment permalink">6/12/11, 4:30 AM</a><br><br>

If you trap a significant amount of heat before the exhaust gases finish escaping into the open environment -- you diminish the amount of air drawn up the chimney by the heated (and now not-quite-as-heated) air and combustion products.<br><br>Let us say that the effect of cooling the exhaust -- re-using the chimney contents -- is negligible.<br><br>Re-using the heat of chimney gases is not new.

I also heard about significant condensation problems and so rejected the idea at the time.<br><br>I hadn't yet talked to anyone who's using a modified upright freezer, though. That sounds like a perfectly workable solution. Thanks for that great tip!<br><br>I've also considered the more radical option of eliminating the fridge altogether. However, I'm not sure that makes sense for a family of two adults, since we don't go through food very fast. For example, I typically fix up a big mess of beans in our 1950's-era pressure cooker once per week, dress it with vinegar and oil and spices, and stash it directly in the fridge, so we can help ourselves from the pot for several days running. We also freeze quite a bit of the produce from our garden in the fall. I'm planning to experiment with more dehydration this year, though.<br><br>If I could get rid of the fridge, or somehow seriously knock down that consumption, our household usage would drop to only 5 or 6 kWh daily. I see that's still twice what Chris is using, humph. I have to run the clothes dryer about five times per week to handle the laundry from my massage therapy office, which accounts for roughly another 3 kWh per load. So that's another major energy hogging appliance in our house. Without the fridge and the clothes dryer, I think we'd be quite close to a very respectable 3 kWh per day.<br><br>I'm nervous about our audit tomorrow. I feel like I'm back in school and have test anxiety. Having already done a self-assessment of our house, I'm aware of several things which are not up to snuff. We're going to do better after a few improvements, though, especially in the natural gas category (where we're currently consuming only slightly less than average).<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c3894548072493161699 title="comment permalink">6/12/11, 7:17 AM</a><br><br>

I have wired our 38 foot wooden boat in which the longest run was about 20 feet (40 feet in the DC world). Even with LED lighting the wiring, the size demands are large, especially when connecting the battery bank. And where will the copper wiring come from? Old houses, I guess, for a while. At least in housing you can use solid wire. Perhaps that will bring back one of the very old metal working skills, making wire in small quantities. At any rate, the smaller the structure and the more centralized the "grid" of the house, the better. We've done that with the boat, keeping most high electrical use draws (ham and marine radio, GPS, refer compressor, computer, engine alternator, inverter) within a few feet of the battery bank. The wiring (a grueling job for the non-acrobat), made me realize how simple it would be, both for building and also long-term maintenance, to just have oil lamps and a marine wood stove (now several back on the market perfect for tiny houses as well). The smaller the "controlled environment" such as house or boat, the smaller the energy needs.

I built the current house myself specifically with low energy use in mind. Living in the housing estate was like some sort of purgatory for me - must have done something bad for sure!!! Strangely enough, I achieved better outcomes from a 1890's Victorian terrace double brick house. I suspect the neighbours where heating their houses and the bricks (there were 4 bricks between each adjoining house)transfered the heat into mine! It always stayed cool over summer too. One neighbour used to really pump the heat and I noticed a sharp downturn in the average temperature in my place after they moved out.<br><br>The refrigerator here is the single biggest user of power behind the solar system itself. You don't actually need a refrigerator, it's a luxury really you could preserve all your food stocks and have an in ground root cellar (or a dark well insulated cupboard). I've only just started preserving this year and the most successful method has been jam (blackberry and peach is my favourite). I'll open the bottles (we use a Fowlers Vacola which is an Australian thing) of fruit in the next week or so.

Consistently readable. I too participated (as a debunkster of course) in that amazingly silly TOD thread about orbital power-beaming satellites. Genuine technocornucopianism beggars any attempt to satirise it (it's also beggaring all of us, on a planetary scale, but I'm preaching to the choir here).<br><br>I live aboard my 40 ft junk rigged sailboat in the PNW and may report in later on my own "footprint reduction" project, energy usage etc. -- at the dock I do use BC Hydro power for the laptop/wireless-modem and a tiny fridge/freezer, but one 15 y-o PV panel takes care of all the (LED) lighting. A small and wicked-efficient wood stove provides more than ample heat in winter: learning how to moderate its output has been a challenge. Given the stove's overproduction of heat at the drop of a hat, I too have been wondering how to generate some DC off it. Diversify, diversify!<br><br>In the meantime, chiming in on the subject of shipping. Here in the Vancouver area we see lots of bulk carriers anchoring off Nanaimo -- possibly because Vancouver's rodestead is full? -- and waiting for (probably) grain or coal. Also we see the endless parade of log carriers (whole log exports, in other words clear cutting and sending the raw logs to China, Japan, etc -- no "jobs" in this deal except for a handful of mechanised logging operators). BC's sawmills are mostly moribund or shutting down. [The near shore fishery has collapsed in all but name. The smaller coastal communities are atrophying, people are concentrating in the urban centres. Whole 'nother story.]<br><br>The bulk carriers carry all kinds of flags, but about half of them are officially Chinese.<br><br>There's a local fishery -- to me an obscenity -- in herring roe. When the herring come to spawn, the roe boats selectively kill the female herring and strip the eggs for sale to affluent Japanese consumers (roe on kelp delicacy). You can see the cloud of milt in the water, and the boats gathering like vultures. This year the fishery was "a bust" due to Fukushima plus tsunami, depression of the Japanese economy etc. I find myself weeping for the Japanese while cheering for the fish: this is the dreadful position we are placed in, the predicament of our times... everything that is bad for money is good for the living world and vice versa, but humans have placed their bets (or been forced to join) on the side of money and hence suffer when money suffers.<br><br>And don't even get me started on "farmed" (CAFO) salmon...<br><br>Back to topic: I'm seriously into salvage. One of the reasons I bought this boat -- there were many -- was that her interior was constructed out of used BC Ferry signboards. There is no finer marine ply on the market :-) and I rather liked the artfully random apprearance of NO, RKING, DETOU, PASSE and other fragments of exhortation and prohibition that decorate some of the unpainted surfaces. We have an interesting dumpster in the boat yard which I check every couple of days. It's amazing what people throw away! I realise that in exploiting this "waste" stream I'm just parasitising the gross wastefulness of the consumer economy -- being a flea on a rabid dog, as we might say. But heck, better than letting it go to the landfill. A lot of the stainless on board came from the scrap yard -- most of it old parts from decommissioned sawmills and pulp mills.<br><br>More discussions on salvage please... I see salvage and bricolage as our future, such as it is. In a way a satisfying future, while the stock of salvageable junk lasts (it should last my lifetime anyway): far more creative than the "go buy something" decades.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c6320536304068267079 title="comment permalink">6/13/11, 1:00 AM</a><br><br>

This is a low-tech version of the CIGS thin film technology that's currently moving into production from the labs. <br><br>I don't know what efficiency can be obtained this way, it's probably pretty low.

You place the device on top of your woodstove, where the heat from the stove warms a semiconductor thermoelectric pile. A large heatsink is affixed to the "cool" side of the pile, to allow for as great a temperature differential as possible. The thermopile generates enough current to drive the small motor+fan, which helps circulate warm air from the stove into the room.<br>While it might be tempting to take apart one of these fans to get at the thermoelectric pile, the piles alone are readily available from many dealers in surplus electronic components.<br>Also, such semiconductor piles can be permanently damaged if overheated, whereas old-school thermopiles made from dissimilar metals are not quite so touchy.<br>Finally, to JMG, I've been a long time reader of the Archdruid Report, and am so thankful for your depth of thought, your concise yet comfortable way with words, and your patience in taking on all comers in the comments.

LOL.<br> <br>If your daughter hasn't already had a couple of years of riding/driving lessons, I'd use an empty paddock as incentive for her to become experienced before she gets her own horse. <br><br>Were I you, I'd be looking for a neighborhood with experienced horsemen nearby. A good many of us are aging and enjoy working with horsey kids in exchange for labor. For example, my students don't pay me; in return for lessons on riding, ground work, health care, handling, and just about everything, they clean runs, cart hay, repair fences, and groom trails and fields as well as horses. <br> <br>While waiting to see if your daughter's interest holds, you can also start a propaganda campaign, (a) extorting the virtues of ride-drive horses and (b) the importance of learning how to school horses herself once she achieves basic competence with someone else's well-schooled animals. That'd not only help you avoid the immediate purchase of a horse for a couple of years, but it’d test her resolve. <br><br>Over 95% of all horse owners lose interest when they discover the effort and skill required, but if she sticks with it, she'll have a valuable skill. For example, one of my former students went to a posh college where many young women brought horses with them, but they were show riders who didn't know how to "tune up" their horses when the pushbuttons got sticky. Consequently, my student continued riding and was paid well to do so.<br><br>Delaying horse purchases has yet another advantage. If the daughter is still into horses after a couple of years working with neighbors or nearby folks, she should then know about what sort of temperament and type fits her to make a wise choice when you start shopping for her own horse, be it old time Morgan, Norwegian Fjord, Haflinger, Arab, or whatever. (And, if she's a teenager then, don’t let her sell you on her “need” for a Friesian or any other currently fashionable breed.) <br><br>Hey, worst case scenario will be that you might have to break up badly compacted soil in an old horse paddock for more garden space if the daughter fails to maintain interest long enough to justify buying her a horse. <br><br>Houyhnhnm<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c5341780219779661015 title="comment permalink">6/14/11, 9:17 AM</a><br><br>

But bridge building without decent foundation at either end is something of an exercise in futility. At this stage of predicament grand investments in hypercomplexity untethered to observable condition represent not so much a bridge as a punji pit. Sojourners on course to an ecotecnic stability will not all tread the same path, nor will the many crevasses between here and there be spanned by a single enterprise. Since only the general nature and direction of coming events is at all predictable, deployment of many small and simple constructs addressing in small and manageable parts the immensely daunting challenge ahead is the more flexible response. For most of us this of necessity means preparing for a much more frugal existence.<br><br>Last week I suggested that one way of building such a bridge was to practice for electric grid collapse contingency by purposefully shutting off the mains; running a drill, if you will. Since I've been thinking about how that concept might be applied to petrol dependence. Simply doing without the car for a few days or even a few weeks somehow just doesn't seem comparable, mostly because the car is essentially used for one thing - mobility, whereas the electric grid services multiple needs. Then again, the grid is a rather critical element of the petrol delivery infrastructure, as was and continues to be demonstrated in NE Japan. So, while sudden and permanent supply disruption is clearly a possibility, the hoped more probable and certainly more easily prepared for scenario is one of scarcity, intermittent supply and increased expense. What if gasoline were to cost eight or ten $ per gallon; what if electricity rates doubled? What about phone service, or cable TV? What about food, or water? And then suppose through job loss household income was cut in half.<br><br>How can such circumstance be prepared for? How to build that very local, very critical bridge? A little at a time. It is easy to double the cost of your vehicle fuel. Every time you buy some, take the same amount of $ and put it in a 'bridge building fund'. Try paying only cash. That way for a $30 fill up you will need $60 on hand. Do this for your utility bills as well and your bridge fund will grow pretty quickly. Eventually you will have enough to pay for that solar hot water system - another small local bridge that needs building. Also eventually, and perhaps even quite soon if you add food or mortgage interest to the scarcity practice, you will have to start using less, buying less - because there isn't enough $ to go around. But even if you only pay double for petrol, or for the electric bill, you will be the better able to consider realistically the prospects for your frugal future from the perspective of experience. It is not the whole bridge but it is the beginnings of a foundation.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c7496011543933299757 title="comment permalink">6/14/11, 7:09 PM</a><br><br>

With a junk rig's unique design that spreads the loads on the cloth using battens, you could probably use local skills and materials to make successful sails of cedar cloth (maybe not as strong as tradition flax, but more rot resistant).

All the ones that plug into the mains AC outlets have AC to DC converters (also known as “power supplies”) built into them to provide the required DC. If you know what you are doing, it is not too difficult to cut the converter out of the circut and run the electronic unit directly from a DC source such as a battery or solar panel. I did this years ago with a record player when I lived off grid. 12 volt solar panels and batteries just need a simple solid state voltage regulator to drop the 12 volts to whatever voltage the electronic units needs.<br><br><a href=bridge-to-somewhere.html#c5180651744091188022 title="comment permalink">6/15/11, 1:53 AM</a><br><br>

All she really wants is for me to throw the ball one more time.<br><br>Advice? First off, forget all you've heard about not giving your dogs leftovers and scraps. They've been eating our scraps for thousands of years. Just watch the calories and salt. Since quality dog food is over a dollar a pound here, we supplement with raw chicken. We can get frozen leg quarters for $0.60/pound here, about half what their regular food costs. I also grind chicken (bones and all) and make frozen patties, adding oats, beans, whatever veggies are getting old in the fridge, a bit of garlic for fleas, some olive or fish oil. I'll also grind and add bream (small fish) from our pond sometimes. <br><br>Google human foods that dogs can't tolerate (onions, grapes, a few others), and make sure their regular food has <b>no corn products</b>. Keeping them healthy is a good start.<br><br>Since we have five dogs we do most of our own vet work. We're lucky, our Vet is an old college/frat buddy, and works with us on stuff. We give our own vaccinations (except rabies) and order medications online. We keep a good canine medical kit and have learned to use it. We still have some vet costs, but they are minimized, (and far cheaper than kids' medical care).<br><br>I do all grooming and bathing. Frequent 'hands on' builds a good relationship and lets you really assess the condition of the dog; catch any maladies early on.<br><br>Plenty of excercise and praise keeps their mental health good. My dogs take me for a walk every day, and they make sure I have a collection of balls to throw.<br> <br>As for your Girl, thanks for the photo. She looks sweet and wise.<br>I know what you're going through, and someone sent me this a few years ago when we lost our little Terrier after 16 years. Not sure of its origin.<br><br><i>God summoned a beast from the fields and He said:</i><br> <br>“Behold man, created in my image.<br> <br>You shall protect him in the wilderness, shepherd his flocks, watch over his children, and <br>accompany him wherever he may go - even into harms way.<br> <br>You shall be his companion, his ally, his slave.<br> <br>I will endow you with these traits, uncommon to other beasts:<br> <br>Faithfulness, Devotion, and Understanding, surpassing those of man, himself.<br> <br>Lest it impair your courage, you shall never foresee your death.<br> <br>Lest it impair your loyalty, you shall be blind to the faults of man.<br> <br>Lest it impair your understanding, you are denied the power of words. <br>Your eyes shall convey the truth of your heart.<br> <br>Lest man’s attachment to you grow too great, the span of your life shall be brief. <br><br>Walk by his side, sleep in his doorway, forage for him, and ward off his enemies.<br> <br>Carry his burdens, share his afflictions, love him and comfort him.<br> <br>And in return for this, man will fulfill your needs and wants –<br>Which shall be only sustenance, shelter and affection.<br> <br>So, be silent and be a friend to man.

In 1919 they hovered around 20 to one and then rose to 30 to one during the age of big oil field discoveries in the 1960s. Now they've declined to 10 to one. "Society is now living on old oil fields and we're spending more energy to find less and less energy," says Hall. Moreover North America has built a society dependent on energy returns higher than 10.<br><br>Given such grim declines, industry is exploiting ever more extreme and difficult resources (from the tar sands to Arctic oil). (Or it burns more oil to create ethanol from corn than ethanol's net return.) Yet these high-priced fuels deliver less and cost more in terms of water, land and capital. (Oil analyst Peter Tertzakian calculates that the energy-eating tar sands, for example, offer returns of seven to one for raw bitumen which drop to three to one once the junk crude has been upgraded and refined into gasoline.)<br><br>Neoclassical economists, of course, reply that technology and markets will magically overcome depletion and even resolve dramatic losses in energy gains, the heartbeat of every civilization.<br><br>But Hall says that's bunk. He argues that economics -- which is currently touted as a social science, is really about "stuff" and how people change the natural world to get stuff. Not surprisingly, he wants to reconnect economics with the reality of resource depletion, and has started a whole new school of thinking called biophysical economics.
