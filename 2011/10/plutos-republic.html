Last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post ended with what might, without too much exaggeration, be called a cliffhanger. Talk about magic, as we’ve been doing for the last few weeks, and point out that using magic to help people think more clearly has to be done one at a time with the active cooperation of the person in question, and it’s a sabfe bet that very quickly someone’s going to ask, if people en masse can’t be made to understand, might it be possible at least to make them behave?<br><br>That’s the question I posed last week. It’s a common notion, and unlike most common notions about magic these days, it has some relation to the actual possibilities of magic. To answer the question, though, it’s going to be necessary to start with a corpse in a bathroom.<br><br>The bathroom in question was on the University of Chicago campus, on an otherwise pleasant spring day in 1991. The corpse belonged to Ioan Culianu, a Romanian emigré who had a stellar reputation in academic circles as a brilliant historian of religions, and a quieter but no less impressive reputation in certain other circles as a modern practitioner of Renaissance magic. Culianu had been shot once in the back of the head by an unknown assailant. It’s been suggested that his murder had a good deal to do with his involvement in Romanian politics, as one of the most vocal opponents of the regime that succeeded the Communists in that country, but the case remains unsolved to this day.<br><br>Back in 1984, Culianu defined himself as one of the rising stars of the academic firmament with a book titled <i>Eros and Magic in the Renaissance</i>. The academic study of Renaissance magic had been a hot field since the Sixties, when Frances Yates finally blew the lid off a generations-old habit of scholarly disdain for occultism, but even by the standards of the Eighties Culianu’s book was startling. It took magic seriously as a system of psychological manipulation that used the cravings and desires of its target—the “eros” of the title—to shape human behavior. It suggested on that basis that modern advertising, which does exactly this, is simply the current form of magic, and that contemporary Western nations are “magician states” governed by the magical manipulation of public consensus.<br><br>None of these ideas were new. Culianu got most of them from the same place he got much of his magical training, the writings of the renegade Dominican sorcerer Giordano Bruno, who ended a colorful career by being burnt at the stake for heresy in 1600. Bruno’s writings on magic describe magic in much the same way Culianu did, as a system of manipulation that casts out lures for nonrational desires. It’s a common way of thinking about magic, the kind of magic I’ve labeled thaumaturgy in earlier posts. The interesting thing here is that Culianu also discussed the very different figure of Marsilio Ficino, who was an even more important figure in the history of magic than Bruno, but who practiced the other kind of magic, the kind I’ve called theurgy.<br><br>Ficino was a Neoplatonist theurgist of the kind I’ve described earlier, practicing magic as a preparation for philosophy. He was also a physician, and much of his magic focused on what he called melancholy and we call clinical depression, the occupational disease of Renaissance intellectuals. Instead of manipulating other people by means of nonrational lures, he taught students to direct the nonrational aspects of their own minds, so that they could think more clearly and avoid the distortions of thought and feeling that clinical depression brings with it. While Ficino has a place in Culianu’s book, though, the theurgic dimension of his work gets very little exposure there.<br><br>The fault line between these approaches runs straight back to the origins of Western occult philosophy, and we need to follow it to make sense of the whole pattern. For all practical purposes, we can start with an ancient Greek thinker named Aristocles, whose very broad shoulders got him the nickname Plato. One of the most influential minds in human history—Alfred North Whitehead, himself no intellectual slouch, characterized all of Western philosophy as “a series of footnotes to Plato”—he played a central role in redirecting philosophy away from arbitrary speculations about the nature of existence, and toward close attention to how human beings know what exists and what doesn’t. Even if you’ve never read a word Plato wrote, you use concepts he invented practically every time you think.<br><br>Still, it’s not exactly rare for those who define the cutting edge to make a fair number of mistakes along with their insights, and then leave the resulting mess for later generations to work out. Plato did that, in spades. Much of the history of classical philosophy consists of attempts by later thinkers to sort through his legacy, build on his achievements, and quietly chuck his less useful notions into the trash. In the process, they had to deal with his political opinions. So does everyone who confronts Plato; they remain a live issue right up to this day.<br><br>Plato was born into a wealthy and politically well-connected family, and grew up in an Athens that was torn by decades of savage political struggles following its catastrophic defeat in the Peloponnesian War. There were two parties—this may sound familiar—one of which was dominated by the rich, while the other was nominally democratic but mostly just consisted of everyone on the outs with the other party. Plato had family connections to what we might as well call the Republican party, but distanced himself from it because its rule over Athens was blatantly corrupt and unjust. When the Democrats staged a coup, though, things didn’t get noticeably better, and Plato’s teacher Socrates was executed on trumped-up charges in the reaction that followed.<br><br>Plato responded to all this the way quite a few people are responding to the failures of political systems today, by trying to imagine a system that would somehow evade the pervasive human habit of making really bad political decisions. None of his attempts worked, and it’s important to understand why they didn’t work, because the same flaws pervade today’s notions about getting people to do the right thing when they pretty clearly don’t want to do so.<br><br>The most famous of all Plato’s dialogues, <i>The Republic</i>, focuses on this issue, and takes the form of an inquiry into justice. It covers an extraordinary landscape of ideas, and raises points that are well worth study today, but at its core is the imaginary construction of the world’s first utopia—yes, that’s one of the concepts that Plato invented. His utopia, like most of the ones invented since then, is ruled by the minority of the population who have the brains and the education to do the job right. They’re supported by a larger minority of the population that’s motivated by concepts of honor and social expectations, who provide the muscle for war and crowd control; and these two classes rule the rest of the population, who are motivated by their appetites.<br><br>Underneath this, as my regular readers will have guessed already, is the same way of thinking about the individual that gave rise to Plato’s chariot metaphor: the differentiation of the whole self into reasoning, social, and biological parts. Each caste fills one of the three roles—the leaders are the reasoners, the guardians are social, and the workers are biological—so that the Republic becomes an exact analogue of the individual. Plato, being Plato, works the metaphor in all sorts of directions, and later generations of Platonists took those and ran with them in quite a few useful ways, but there’s a little problem with the Republic: Plato’s conclusions clash disastrously with core insights of the rest of his work.<br><br>In the dialogue <i>Meno</i>, to note only one example, Plato has Socrates demonstrate a point about the deep structure of the human mind by walking an illiterate servant boy through a geometrical proof. The boy doesn’t know a thing about geometry, but he is able to follow Socrates’ logic, and by the end of the process has understood what at that time was cutting-edge mathematics. Socrates’ point is that anyone, anywhere, could be taught the same thing—and that’s a point for which Plato’s Republic has no room at all. In the Republic, reason is for the few; honor and social commitments are for another minority, separate from the first; the majority has nothing but appetite. It’s therefore fair to say that in the Republic, nobody is allowed to be more than one-third of a complete human being.<br><br>That’s always the problem with utopian schemes; the inhabitants are never allowed to be fully human, though the restrictions are rarely handled with the geometric precision Plato displayed. When a utopian scheme is put into practice, in turn, what inevitably happens is that whatever dimension of the human is supposedly abolished happens anyway, and defines the fault line along which the scheme breaks down. Marxism is a great example; in theory, people in Marxist societies are motivated solely by noble ideals; in practice, getting people to go through the motions of being motivated solely by noble ideals required an ever-expanding system of apparatchiks, secret police and prison camps, and even that ultimately failed to do the job. One way or another, trying to create heaven on earth reliably yields the opposite; whatever resembles Plato’s Republic on paper turns into Pluto’s Republic in practice.<br><br>The would-be political thaumaturge, the person who wants to use magical manipulation to make people do what he thinks is the right thing, is subject to the same rule. He’s trying to do the same thing Plato wanted to do in his imaginary Republic by different means. As thaumaturgy is subtler than jackboots, the political thaumaturge gets his disastrous results in a subtler way.<br><br>When you’re practicing thaumaturgy for yourself or another person who wants to work with you, it’s possible to aim symbolic and ritual stimuli very carefully at specific details of the nonrational mind, and the effects are observed and managed by the rational mind; this sort of thaumaturgy very often spills over into theurgy if the person receiving the work is open to that. When a client comes to a practitioner of old-fashioned Southern conjure magic, for example, most of what happens on the first visit is meant to give the root doctor a clear idea of exactly what the client’s real issues are. Many practitioners have a canned divination rap—the term for this in the trade is “cold reading”—that covers all the usual bases; it sounds very impressive, which is good for building the client’s confidence, but the skilled root doctor watches the client carefully while giving the cold reading, looking for the signs that show what’s really going on, so the magic can be aimed precisely where it’s needed.<br><br>You can’t do that with political thaumaturgy. If you want to influence the thinking of a nation, or even a community, you have to paint with a very broad brush. That means, first, you have to aim at one of a few powerful nonrational drives that affect most people in much the same way; second, you have to pile as much pressure as possible onto whatever drive you have in mind, so that you can overwhelm whatever the psyche of the individual might throw at you; and third, you have to weaken the reasoning mind, because that’s the part of the self that most often trips up efforts to work magic off basic drives, especially when those efforts aim at goals that most of the targets think are against their best interests.<br><br>Two awkward consequences follow from these considerations. The first is that there are things that political thaumaturgy can’t do at all, because they contradict the requirements of the method. Getting people to think clearly by encouraging them not to think clearly is not a promising strategy, and it’s not much better to try to use basic drives to convince people not to give in to their basic drives. The old delusion that techniques are value-free is as misleading here as elsewhere; any technique is better for some ends than others, and thus privileges the values that favor those ends above others. (It’s probably worth pointing out that a sane response to peak oil, which requires clear reasoning and the ability to look beyond those basic biological drives, is among the things political thaumaturgy is almost uniquely unsuited to accomplish.)<br><br>The second awkward consequence is that the political thaumaturge is always affected by his or her own magic. The old-fashioned Southern root doctor just mentioned is in no danger of being caught in the work he does for his client; he aims his magic at the client’s psychological buttons rather than his own, and the root doctor isn’t even present for most of the work—the cleansing baths that remove unwanted emotional states, the daily rite of putting a drop of Van Van oil on a mojo bag that directs consciousness toward certain things and away from others, and a good deal more, are done by the client in private. Political thaumaturgy can’t be precisely aimed, though, and can’t usually rely on talking people into practicing complex rituals in their spare time; instead, it relies on mass media, and relies on repetition and compelling verbal or visual patterns that sidestep the critical faculties of the reasoning mind.<br><br>Just as you can’t spread raspberry jam on toast without getting it on your fingers, though, you can’t spend your time creating words and images that appeal to the nonrational mind without your own nonrational mind being influenced by them, and the more compelling your thaumaturgy is, the more surely you will be caught by your own spell. Since political thaumaturgy requires you to weaken the reasoning mind and overwhelm the defenses of the self by pounding on simple, powerful nonrational drives, the impact of this work on the mind of the political thaumaturge is far from helpful, and it helps explain why practitioners of political thaumaturgy so often end up messily dead.<br><br>Whether or not this is what happened to Culianu is still an open question; his biographer Ted Anton notes that a good part of Culianu’s last months went into writing blistering propaganda pieces assailing the Romanian government, a process that might best be compared to poking a grizzly bear with a stick, but speculation about the role this played in his murder remains exactly that. Still, it’s par for the course for political thaumaturges to end up as true believers in their own propaganda, and in the hardball politics of post-Communist eastern Europe, this could well have been a fatal mistake.<br><br>It’s a common enough mistake, too. In <a href=../../2010/06/waiting-for-millennium_16.html>a post last year</a>, I discussed Adolf Hitler, whose career is among the best documented examples both of the power and of the pitfalls of political thaumaturgy. Hitler’s meteoric rise to power and the extraordinary control he achieved over the imagination of the German people are a remarkable example of thaumaturgy at work, and readers interested in figuring out how political thaumaturgy functions could do worse than study the Nazi regime’s systematic transformation of an entire nation into ritual theater hammering on a handful of primal biological drives. The result of that effort is just as telling; the process of convincing Germany that he was invincible convinced Hitler of the same thing, and he proceeded to destroy himself and his regime in a crescendo of blunders that all followed from his inability to imagine that he could be mistaken.<br><br>For an example much closer to home, consider the way that the privileged classes in contemporary America by and large support policies that, in exchange for absurdly huge short term gains, are sawing away at the basis of their wealth and privilege, and may ultimately leave many members of those classes dangling from lampposts. Awarding multibillion-dollar bonuses to bank executives when their banks are losing money and most Americans are going broke is, shall we say, not a strategy with a long shelf life. It may be possible for a while to insist that all that money is going to trickle down and create jobs, but when the jobs don’t appear—and they won’t, because diverting money from the productive economy of nonfiscal goods and services to the unproductive economy of high finance is an effective way to cause jobs to be lost rather than gained—that claim isn’t going to hold up well.<br><br>John Kenneth Galbraith’s comparison of the American political class to the French aristocracy on the eve of the Revolution thus may yet turn out to be even more prescient than Galbraith thought. That America’s privileged classes don’t see this coming is another example of the way thaumaturgy recoils on its practitioners: decades of public relations meant to justify the parasitic habits of the finance sector have produced generations of financiers who believe implicitly in their own propaganda. Thus they’ve been repeatedly blindsided by the failure of the economy to conform to their beliefs, and it doesn’t seem likely that they’ll do any better when the stakes in the game change from money to blood.<br><br>In any other context, to be sure, comparing Ioan Culianu to the faceless apparatchiks who run Goldman Sachs and its equivalents, to say nothing of Adolf Hitler, would merely insult the memory of a brilliant scholar. The sole thing these disparate figures have in common is their use of political thaumaturgy. This in itself makes the point that, to my mind, most needs making here, which is that it doesn’t matter why you attempt political thaumaturgy. You can try to use it to overthrow a repressive government, to line your pockets with unearned wealth, to impose a murderously twisted ideology on a vulnerable nation—it really doesn’t matter; it’s not going to get you the results you want.<br><br>What might produce the results that are wanted, and needed, as the industrial world begins to skid down the far side of Hubbert’s peak is another matter, and one that I’ll begin to trace out next week.

Some living things focus on short-term gain, others don't, and human beings in a good many societies have shown a pervasive habit of relating their lives and choices to the long term -- for heaven's sake, even in America, people save money for retirement and buy cemetery plots. <br><br>You might want to read up a bit on evolutionary ecology before insisting that maximizing resources at the maximum rate is by definition the only winning strategy; that's far from true. For that matter, in past declines of civilizstions, it hasn't generally been a matter of a few lamppost danglers -- it's been entire elites, pretty much en masse, as they were the ones who had the resources most conveniently concentrated for others, better prepared for the decline, to take. <br><br>I've spent the last year and a half talking about constructive suggestions; if you haven't heard them, I'm not sure what else I can do. As for mass thaumaturgy, yes, it serves base ends, but it does so in a self-destructive manner. There are other, more successful options.<br><br><a href=#c674522505399041554 title="comment permalink">10/12/11, 8:13 PM</a><br><br>

I had not heard of the book, nor of its author, Herman Hesse. However I downloaded a copy; I was impressed and decided to purchase a printed copy of the book (along with one of yours, of course). <br><br>You comment in this week's essay that, "It’s therefore fair to say that in the Republic, nobody is allowed to be more than one-third of a complete human being." On the same lines, Knecht, the principal character in The Glass Bead Game, states, "I am not inclined to urge Plato's thesis that the scholar, or rather the sage, ought to rule the state". And also, "The Castalian, therefore, should not become a politician." Knecht understands that the rational mind is not sufficient to control the complete non-Castalian world. <br><br>Which therefore begs the question, who is to rule the state? This question was probably best answered by Churchill, "It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried."<br><br>Regarding Peak Oil and other systemic issues that we face, I found the sentence "Probably we who are Magisters today will be able to complete our terms of office in peace and lie down to die in peace before the danger comes so close that it is visible to all" spoke to my condition. I am in my mid-60s, and I suspect that my generation will be able to ride out many of the upcoming changes. But, and there's always a "but", we have children and grandchildren. We must plan for them as best we can. And Joseph Knecht went further, he accepted responsibility for society as a whole, particularly the education of young people.<br><br>In Chapter Twelve, Hesse starts a poem with "In all beginnings dwells a magic force". I would be curious as to your interpretation of this poem. And do you think that our society will create a Castalian Province say a hundred years from now?<br><br>Thank you for introducing your readership to this subtle and thought-provoking book.<br><br>One final question: what is the distinction that you are making between Plato and Pluto, a god of the underworld?<br><br><a href=#c2221856188549895988 title="comment permalink">10/12/11, 10:44 PM</a><br><br>

This is a much more successful survival strategy. If you look at a patch of forest, that patch holds only as many species as it can support and no more - everything is in balance. Nature is the arbiter. <br><br>For an example closer to home. I have wallabies, wombats and kangaroos grazing the herbage in my orchard for the majority of the night. They convert the herbage into fertiliser. I'm mostly vegetarian, but if I chose so I could eat them and wallaby and kangaroo are quite good meat - yummy! But their services outweigh the one off benefit of eating them. So I have made the choice not to eat them, but to share the products of the orchard.<br><br>Your belief is only possible because of your current access to fossil fuels. If you admitted that you and your family are part of nature and had to exist on the minimal energy available in the environment around you, you would sing a different tune for sure!<br><br>I'm happy to debate this issue with you because it is important. Our ancestors understood these concerns intuitively, that's why 90% of the population had to be involved in agriculture. It's hard and involves more than just getting away to a place where it is not just an "obvious disaster area". That strategy is not a guarantee of survival for your genes, it buys time and that is all. <br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c3281351775647667801 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 12:45 AM</a><br><br>

However, certain aspects have left me a bit off balance and confused. <br><br>For instance, from what I gather, it seems that magic is mostly applied psychology to oneself or to willing or unwilling subjects at a personal level or at a societal level. <br><br>So my first question is: are there certain things a magician can do or know of that a clever psychologist cannot do or know of? <br><br>Secondly, magical literature also speaks of magical beings that belong to some non physical universe, like deamons, monsters and the sort. Is that delusional thinking on part of authors or is the existence of such beings part of the belief systems of magicians who then are trained in the arts of manipulation of such entities? <br><br>Thanking you in advance for your responses!<br><br><a href=#c3993089662959866611 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 1:13 AM</a><br><br>

Then you only had to say '101' and everybody fell about? But you still had to be careful how you told the joke. Jokes, memes, these float by and usually we forget what they were in the first place, but still react. Sometimes though something goes 'ping' right across the nation. A kind of seizure - you can feel it: I remember post-imperial Britain when the Falklands got 'occupied' (big word lurking) by the Argentines, and a failing British kind-of-early-neo-con was on her way to stardom. There have been others here - perhaps the death of Diana, and I don't know where that lurks, to reappear when people take sides? And I guess that intentional provocation 9/11 is worth a mention. (These were sons of Saudi oilmen were they not?) Now what will be the long term results of that hit on American self-consciousness?<br>I can think of history as attempts at self-fulfilling prophecy, or mostly unintended consequences?

Sigh. I forgot that birthday weekend was coming. A lot of magical happenings, but not time for as search. Highly ironically the gift list included a number of Harry Potter Lego sets.<br><br>I was curious about the murder of Ioan Culianu so I looked it up. When I saw it involved a . 25 caliber round alarm bells went off. .25 is the smallest center fire round available. It fires a round similar to our .22LR rimfire, but the .25 center fire is more reliable. I have a .22LR automatic, and it is not at all uncommon for a round to misfire. It has been (as near as I can tell) popular with European hit men for years. They use it much like the firearm version of an ice pick.<br><br>In looking around I did see this very interesting quote from a Washington Post article by John Crowley (of “Little Big”).<br><br>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/reviews/erosmagicandthedeath.htm<br><br>Start of Quote: In "Eros and Magic" Culianu studies a little-known work by Bruno in which Bruno shows that the bonds of desire, in the broadest sense, can be manipulated by the worker who understands how to project images that can compel the hearts of all men. Culianu saw in Bruno's prescriptions a more sophisticated Machiavellianism, not using the brute tools of force and fraud but foreshadowing the whole panoply of propaganda, public relations and mass media that all modern states would be based on.<br><br>Anton [author of the Culiano biography (that you noted) being reviewed] errs in supposing that Culianu saw in the lies and manipulations of the Communist regime an expression of the bonds Bruno described. Culianu distinguishes between two types of polity: the magician state -- such as the United States or Italy, where he lived when he came to the West -- and the police state. The police state becomes a jailer state, "changing itself into a prison where all hope is lost," repressing both liberty and the illusion of liberty in order to defend an out-of-date culture in which no one believes. It is bound to perish. The magician state, on the other hand, can degenerate into a sorcerer state, providing only the illusion of satisfaction, keeping the controls hidden; its faults are too much subtlety and too much flexibility. "Yet the future belongs to it anyway," Culianu says. "Coercion and the use of force will have to yield to the subtle processes of magic, science of the past, of the present, and of the future." : End of Quote.<br><br><a href=#c1628112861096867717 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 2:46 AM</a><br><br>

It always rang false, with all that emotionally-charged presentation of "values" issues that seemed peripheral at best. You can see better from a distance how it was aiming to manipulate. And now looking back on politics in the UK in the 1980's, I can see the same thing in some ways too (socialism vs the market). So each time we have an election cycle here, and you see the old themes getting cranked up (watch out, the gays are marrying, shock-horror!) I try to tune out. <br><br>As you say, the manipulators (politicians, corporate leaders, evangelists for whatever) probably buy a pretty good amount of their own message. I'm still naive enough to believe that most start out with a genuine belief that their ideas are right, rather than an ice-cold interest in social control and self-advancement. But somewhere along the way leaders stop being able to change their minds as the evidence piles up that their ideas are not working. Is that because they have thaumaturged themselves, or is it their salary now depends on believing what they have been saying, or can they just not admit a mistake? Such a complicated tangle. Whatever it is, it's a good argument for term-limits for all leaders everywhere.<br><br><a href=#c5813229914974242649 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 3:58 AM</a><br><br>

Rationalization is part of it, but a much larger part is the fact that thaumaturgy works with the nonrational mind using emotionally charged symbols and the like, and so sidesteps the filters of reason in the thaumaturge just as much as in his targets. <br><br>Katsmama, I do my best. ;-)<br><br>John, excellent! The end <i>never</i> justifies the means, because the means inevitably reshape the end in their own image. <br><br>Farmer, glad to hear it. <br><br>William, if they or anyone else sets off civil war, they and the systems that undergird their power and influence will be among its first victims. The irony is that they may be the last to realize this. <br><br>Joel, I think you've misunderstood me. The political sphere is by no means limited to mass thaumaturgy; that's simply one tempting but self-defeating tool of politics. There are plenty of other ways of doing politics that have nothing to do with the thaumturge's art. <br><br>ChemEng, if I've gotten an engineer reading and thinking about Hesse, I've done very well indeed. I know it's unfashionable these days, but I agree with Churchill; despite its many flaws, constitutional democracy is still the least bad way to run a state. As for Plato and Pluto, it's a pun -- the reference is to the passage just beforehand, about attempts to build heaven on earth that reliably produce the opposite. <br><br>Tiago, thank you. <br><br>Thijs, got it! You're in the contest. <br><br>Cherokee, I know. In and out of power, on the right, the middle, the left, and the fringes, there are always people who are convinced that the end justifies the means and that they can work mass thaumaturgy without being swallowed up in it. They're always wrong, but that doesn't keep them from falling into the trap. <br><br>Kieran, bingo. Repeat a slogan such as "Just Do It" at people often enough, and they'll come to see "just doing it" as natural. <br><br>Karim, those are good questions. In theory, a clever psychologist could do anything a mage can; in practice, the mage has the advantage of a couple of thousand years of accumulated tricks that the psychologist doesn't know about, and so the mage's results tend to be very difficult for the psychologist to match. <br><br>Second, one of the things that happens when you start dealing intensively with what we might as well call mental experiences, is that some things you encounter in, or with, or through your mind act like separate persons. What are they in reality? That's a very hard question to answer. Jung, who called them archetypes, thought that they were basic patterns hardwired into the psyche; other people have other interpretations, including the one you've mentioned -- that they are actual beings living in a world of their own. Some systems of magic do a lot with them, other systems don't, and whether or not they have an objective reality has surprisingly little to do with the possibilities of magic in either case.<br><br><a href=#c6466845407302673303 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 6:40 AM</a><br><br>

Not that Plato is simplistic. ;) <br><br>And his politics--sheesh! Still, one could draw parallels between the organization of his republic and our own, starting with the ivy league-educated ruling classes, continuing to our huge military and police forces, and on to the grouping of children to be reared in <i>creches</i> so that all adults would be free to serve the state, or in our case, the corporations.

What are the romantic mindset, wishful thinking, incantation and revitalization but the dangers of buying a manipulative spell with one’s whole heart?<br><br>The all-powerful progress myth is regularly reinforced by thaumaturgy with thought-police backup. ‘Economics’ requires it. Those recent UK riots showed how deep commercial conditioning has reached, people threw off their chains to embrace… their chains. (Or purse-seine.) Probably many will mention Adam Curtis’ <i>Century of the Self</i> in the comments this week (the full four hours <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyPzGUsYyKM" rel=nofollow>here</a>), a TV series about “how those in power have used Freud's theories to try and control the dangerous crowd in an age of mass democracy”, intelligent stuff. <br><br><b>JMG</b>: <i>When you’re practicing thaumaturgy for yourself or another person who wants to work with you, it […] very often spills over into theurgy if the person receiving the work is open to that.</i><br><br>That legitimate use of ‘thaumaturgy’ is what hypnotherapists do -- within the purview of science, just. I use this to undo the sickness caused by the current societal programming. I’ve seen major nervous breakdowns caused by trying to live the promises of <i>The Secret</i>. The individual is always stronger in the end, with patience and the right method, once they have become ‘sick of sickness’ as Lao-tzu says. <br><br>Not that it can replace a commitment to deeper individuation and activating the best stuff within.

One of the basic strategies of defense against mass thaumaturgy is to distance yourself from manipulations of that sort. Yes, we'll be getting into "Defense Against the Dark Arts" class presently. <br><br>Russell, good. John Crowley is, as usual, very well informed about these things. I wasn't familiar with the details about the bullet, but it makes perfect sense. <br><br>Robert, have him get the story in by the end of this month if possible. My interest is by no means waning; I've simply been waiting for people to get their stories in, so I can start picking the best for the anthology. <br><br>Yupped, I think it's all of the above -- and remember that all these folks grow up imbibing the same thaumaturgy as the rest of us, and have the same distorted patterns of thinking in the deep levels of their mind. <br><br>Edward, excellent! You get today's gold star. Stay tuned...<br><br>Greg, I'll be interested to see what you think of it when we get there. <br><br>Hadashi, why, yes. <i>Commando Cody</i> was a particular favorite, though of course I only got to see them as reruns. <br><br>Siani, glad to hear it. <br><br>Nomad, no, that's only one part of mass thaumaturgy, though it can be an important one. <br><br>SquarePeg, Ficino's book on the subject is available in English translation as <i>Three Books on Life</i>, though it's a little difficult to understand without some background. <a href=http://www.skyscript.co.uk/ficino.html rel=nofollow>this essay</a> might be a good place to start, and Frances Yates' <i>Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition</i> has a good section on Ficino. <br><br>Ventriloquist, you're certainly right about the approaching drawdown, but size isn't a good predictor of a society's attitudes toward time, deferred gratification, etc. Traditional China was at once a very large society and one with a clear sense of long timescales -- one that repeatedly kept it from pursuing imperial overstretch, for example. The sources of attitudes of the sort we're discussing are complex, and don't take well to deterministic analyses. <br><br>Chris, it's quite probable that the next round of politics will see OWS and the Tea Party at each other's throats, when they'd be considerably smarter to make common cause. Still, each movement is changing the political and economic debate in this country; the OWS movement, for example, is doing an excellent job of spreading the 99%-1% meme, and as that flows into existing lines of fracture, it could very easily spark further explosions. As usual, the various squabbling elites will manage to keep a lid on things...until they don't, and then very suddenly it'll be lamppost time. <br><br>Twilight, excellent! Yes, we've gotten very lazy, though the habit of giving up learning and personal growth around the age of 25 or 30 goes back a long ways; it's simply been easier to get away with in recent years.<br><br><a href=#c3044749680569183444 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 9:02 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, the moon's been glorious to watch. <br><br>James, no, the master key is your own capacity to become conscious of the workings of your own mind. The thaumaturges of the advertising industry are fumbling around with crowbars and other blunt instruments. All that hardwired stuff can work for you, rather than against you, if you learn how to use it deliberately yourself, rather than letting others use it -- and you. <br><br>Justin, you're using the term "nonexistent" in your post in a way that seems very strange to me, but if it works for you, good. The basic recognition that there are things that can be changed by changing consciousness, and other things that can only be changed by moving matter and energy around, is a useful one. <br><br>Sekenre, I was hoping that some of my readers would fall for that! <br><br>Adrian, yes, a good deal of that is thaumaturgy of one kind or another; what differentiates thaumaturgy from other ways of manipulating people is that thaumaturgy relies on pushing nonrational buttons. As for Druidry, every religion -- without exception -- is the basis for a system of theurgy, and most religions have developed at least some basic methods along those lines. Since Druidry borrowed a lot from Neoplatonism and the Hermetic tradition over the last three centuries or so, it's got quite a bit of theurgic material, but it's far from unique in that.<br><br><a href=#c6180214565411740537 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 9:11 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, hypnotherapy -- to the extent that I understand it, and I don't claim to be anything like knowledgeable about it -- does seem to be one modern school of thaumaturgy, though it lacks some of the colorful elements of the older schools. As for the objective existence of "boogies," the concept of objective existence is sufficiently complex on a philosophical level that I'm not at all sure I want to tangle with it; what matters to me is that certain things have certain predictable effects on the universe of our experience. <br><br>Will, rephrasing what I'm talking about in terms that are inoffensive to the intellectual status quo is somebody else's job. Like Popeye, I yam what I yam, and that happens to be an archdruid and operative mage who's spent most of his life in the study and practice of old-fashioned occultism. That inevitably means that some people are going to reject me and everything I say out of hand, but that can't be helped; I'd lose them anyway the moment they looked up the books I've written, for example. I find it much more useful to speak in the language of the traditions I've inherited, knowing that this will allow me to communicate with maximum clarity, even though some people won't be able to listen.<br><br><a href=#c4831630819935670719 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 9:22 AM</a><br><br>

Although pretty low in the corporate food chain myself as a research scientist, I was at one point working on a project that was a particular favorite of the CEO. As a result, I met all of the people up the line from me, including the CEO, at least once. I was also friends with several of the technicians who formed the bottom of my food chain, and I was active in the local professional organization and thus worked with a range of people from the corporation I worked for and other area corporations.<br><br>I observed that similarly to a biological food chain, the lower orders were both more numerous and more diverse, and numbers and diversity decreased as rank in the chain increased. The interesting thing, what I think is evidence of corporate thaumaturgy, is that the decrease in diversity was less steady than the decrease in number. That is, even at my level, people were pretty diverse. First-rank management above me still showed some diversity, although already much less, especially in acceptance of the basic corporate directive that profit is the only thing that matters. At the director level, acceptance of the basic corporate directive was complete; diversity became very low, and what little there was became even lower in the remaining three levels including CEO. It seemed pretty obvious to me that it could be no other way; one couldn’t rise to director level or higher without having adjusted one’s basic personality and values to match the corporate value set. Without doing that, it wouldn’t have been possible to perform and keep one’s job. The ways that corporations try to manage the more unruly elements of the lower end of the food chain amount to thaumaturgy; those who rose in the corporate world swallowed the bait so completely, changed so much, that they had no trouble, at least not outwardly, in putting out the bait for others once they got into mid-level management. The prevalence of heart attacks among management ranks suggests that deep down they knew something was wrong with the program, but they no longer could acknowledge it publicly or privately. The few who did have an attack of conscience left the corporate world. I left it while I was still low enough to avoid being caught in the thaumaturgy.<br><br>You did seem to leave us a way to practice thaumaturgy ethically, in the case of the root doctor. Since political diversity is lowest at the lowest levels, perhaps each of us could act something like the root doctor toward the first link in the political chain above us, so that change happens from the bottom up.

I don't know what to call it, but many of us would have experienced it.<br><br>When I came face to face with peak oil, resource depletion and economic collapse, I went through the same stages of denial, anger, grief, frustration, etc.<br><br>Fortunately, there were two things that helped me back to my senses; first, I understood from a deep reading of history that collapse or decline is not unique to our times, and that there are ways of dealing with it. Second, I had my roots in a culture that was different from the contemporary culture, and was much more sustainable. So, I knew that if I was willing to give up my expectations, I had an alternate way of living, which was proven to work over a long period of time.<br><br>I went through a long period of mental tug-of-war between my rational self and my socially-conditioned nonrational self. I would say that the second fact I mentioned above played a major role in tipping the scales in this contest.<br><br>In the mainstream culture in current times, both an understanding of history and an appreciation of alternative cultures and lifestyles are missing. In fact, both of these have been set apart for tha academic realm.<br>Most people have trouble formulating a workable response to the troubles they face because they don't know of any choices other than what the mainstream culture offers.<br><br>The strategy would be to show people, both in word and in deed, that alternatives to current lifestyles exist, and that they are plausible. The current state of world affairs is such that many are ready to accept anything that will work, only they don't know. This is similar to magic, but people first accept the situation out of practical necessity, then their rational mind convinces them why it is the right thing to do.<br><br>People like us would need to show the others that such alternatives do exist. I think this will be effective if we work from the bottom up, rather than go the mass media way. (Which I think is an underlying theme of this blog.)<br><br>I tried this successfully on my family, but each of them took their own time to understand.

Some commenters are pointing out the difficulty of getting uber-rationalists to engage critically with ideas coming from a Druid; as a rationalist myself, I find that level of close-mindedness saddening. All that matters is whether an argument is coherent, clearly explained and transparent. The source and the labels are most often a distraction.<br><br>As a second point, I take issue with the equating of the Tea Party and OWS as two sides of the same coin. The Tea Party is the embodiment of blind belief in the myth of progress and absolute denial of resource limits. Tea Partiers tend to be older, members of the generation that took that famous vacation from reality 30 years ago, when it was in its prime. <br><br>I am sure on the other hand that many within OWS have already more or less accepted that "there is no bright future ahead". What they are fighting for is not an unattainable middle class lifestyle sustained by cheap energy, but rather the mere means of survival: to be freed from crushing debts, and be given a job to put food on the table. Bread and land, in other words. The classic demand of all peasants revolt, and a telling sign of the approaching scarcity society.<br><br>So if I am allowed to take the historical metaphor further: I see OWS as peasants; and the Tea Partiers as landsknechte.<br><br>And while I can't say I'm hoping for the Bastille - I can never cheer for bloodshed - I'm nonetheless terrified that what we will get is Frankenhausen.<br><br><a href=#c6898482175779563416 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 10:20 AM</a><br><br>

He frames the subject differently, but talks about a framework for state power that borrows from jailer states and from sorcerer states. Titles like "Homo Sacer" and "State of Exception" might be read as outlining the mechanics of a necromancer state, wherein power is maintained by making examples of a few people, by reducing them to "bare life" in a way calculated to demonstrate the state's power to remove much of a person's humanity while preserving their physical life.<br><br>@JMG: "whether or not they have an objective reality has surprisingly little to do with the possibilities of magic in either case." <br><br>This reminds me of nothing so much as the five varieties of metaphysics that are consistent with quantum mechanics. Some physicists use a framework of alternate universes, others a framework of pilot waves, and most seem to be deliberately agnostic. The math works out the same, regardless, so they all can work together even if they never agree on what, exactly, they're working on.<br><br>"I find it much more useful to speak in the language of the traditions I've inherited..."<br><br>Well put! I've struggled to say something similar when asked why I identify as Christian despite being almost directly opposed to the sorts of Christianity portrayed on TV.<br><br>It's interesting to me that Christianity acknowledges "powers"/"heavenly beings" and encourages people variously to avoid or confront them, without any consistent message as to whether they fall into modern categories of "real" or "imaginary." I wonder if it would be an unforgivable misuse of a mathematical term to call such things "complex."<br><br><a href=#c1201584600008166379 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 10:28 AM</a><br><br>

Come to think of it, it seems to me that the neoconservatives were guilty of thaumaturgy to an extent - using "noble lies" and seizing advantage of horrific, emotionally charged events to push for the invasion of the Middle East. Unlike other war critics the left, though, I don't think they did this because they're particularly monsterous - rather, while they tell one noble lie to others, they tell another to themselves, and they've convinced themselves that they act out of deep patriotism - that someone must make these tough decisions to preserve the country, and fortunately, they have the toughness to do so.<br><br><a href=#c8609806441257271162 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 10:49 AM</a><br><br>

I've been following The Archdruid Report for awhile now and it has become my favorite blog--peak oil or otherwise. I find your writing consistently clear, your reasoning easy to follow, and your conclusions typically novel and illuminating. You eschew the too-easy grand solutions sometimes advocated by other peak oil writers while also avoiding the too often overbearing and meanspirited negativity of people like Kunstler (whose blog, however, I also am an avid reader of--despite its propensity to piss me off.)<br><br>I just picked up The Wealth of Nature at Powells a few days ago and devoured it. Your ability to break down our complex economic system and present it in a very easy-to-understand (and -abhor) way, as well as cogently explain our current recessionary realities in the context of both corrupt political and economic institutions and resource depletion proved exhilarating. I'll be both lending this book out to others and perhaps donating a copy to my local OWS protest library.<br><br>As a 31-year-old apprentice farmer, I have spent the last few years of my life trying to understand the full implications of peak oil, resource depletion, overpopulation, environmental devastation, a corrupted financial and political system, and massive social injustice. Your writings have proved some of the most insightful into these realities and are serving as quite the guideposts for me as I try to reimagine how to live my life and comprehend what my future might hold (as incomprehensible as that always is!)<br><br>So anyway, just a general note of thanks and appreciation. You have so far proved, personally, one of the very best peak oil writers and a thinker with many fine and unique points to share.

A common method for casting a spell to bring about some external result involves imagining the desired result in great detail, and then pumping up one's own emotions in the manner of a coach giving a locker room pep talk before the game. A person who does this over and over with the same goal in mind cannot avoid having his or her own outlook and expectations affected.<br><br>Part of the technical training for this kind of work is learning how to do a clean release mentally.

After discussing the minimum required for a state, there's a part where Socrates says that his ideal state would be the very simple one they'd gotten to so far. They go on to describe a more complicated state with guardians and all that jazz, but that's because Glaucon wants the people of the city to have luxuries. This means that the state described in most of the book is _not_ plato's idea of an ideal state (he says this explicitly in that passage in book II), though he does say it serves to make clearer justice and injustice.

I deeply appreciate your posts about green wizardry, and totally concur. My wife and I are in fact reclaiming a very hilly 20 hectares of old farm: planting figs, olives, macadamias, sequoia sempervirens, pinus pinea, Douglas fir, and many native (to New Zealand) species in old cow pasture, and helping the 10 or so hectares of "native bush" (original forest, once selectively logged) recover from decades of having its understory grazed. The idea is not just to have a retirement project that keeps us fit, and to do the land some good, but to give our growing grandchildren the right kind of good experiences outside the city life they ordinarily live, which I think is close to the magic you are talking about. And to provide a family fallback place if the city becomes untenable, though that is less likely to happen here than in the US. We would have called it "biodiversity acres" or "the food farm" but as you point out, setting an example is the way to go, not being preachy, and what we're doing (no grazing) looks strange enough to the neighbors as it is.<br><br><a href=#c7033882676421369276 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 4:07 PM</a><br><br>

Monsters from the Id!"<br><br>JMG:<br><br>By a strange coincidence, I am currently reading <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> by the economist Friedrich A. Hayek, which was first published back in 1944. Hayek covered a lot of the territory you covered in this week's post, although from a slightly different direction; for example:<br><br>"If we wish to find a high degree of uniformity in outlook, we have to descend to the regions of lower moral and intellectual standards where the more primitive instincts prevail."<br><br>"[The leader] must gain the support of the docile and gullible, who have no strong convictions of their own but are ready to accept a ready-made system of values if it is only drummed into their ears sufficiently loudly and frequently. It will be those whose vague and imperfectly formed ideas are easily swayed and whose passions and emotions are readily aroused who will thus swell the ranks of the totalitarian party."<br><br>"To make a totalitarian system function efficiently it is not enough that everybody should be forced to work for the ends selected by those in control; it is essential that the people should come to regard these ends as their own. This is brought about by propaganda and by complete control of all sources of information."<br><br>"The most effective way of making people accept the validity of the values they are to serve is to persuade them that they are really the same as those they have always held, but which were not properly understood or recognized before. And the most efficient technique to this end is to use the old words but change their meaning."

I suspect that they are all doing their utmost to turn the substance of the universe into more copies of themselves. The apparent moderation we see is the outcome of the complex competition among them all, together with the evolved cooperation that also serves the competition. I trace this conviction back to a long-ago day in Eugene, OR, when (with some chemical help) I realized what a fierce struggle all the plant life was engaged in, with those beautiful spring flowers doing everything in their power to advertise their presence to pollinators (special colors, patterns, chemical attractants, elevation above the surroundings, good food for visitors as sweet nectar and excess pollen - hey this is SEX we're talking about!), and that both trees and grass were using their own particular strategies to snag as big a proportion of the incoming solar energy as possible. Our good trick as big-brained humans is to consciously work out the best deal for ourselves as members of the biological community, and choose to abide by the terms of the deal, rather than yielding to the earlier (and still present) go-for-it instincts and getting weeded out if we carry that too far. I totally agree about the need to be able to live on current income. But I also think it prudent to take maximum advantage of the energy boom to obtain some enduring advantages like tools that I couldn't make for myself from available materials.

However tempting it may be to watch Goldman Sachs executives strung up from lampposts violent revolutions never achieve their aims.<br><br>This is partly because so much more of the old society always continues into the new one than the revolutionaries want or realise, and partly for another reason. There is a situational logic in revolutions. Disparate groups unite to overthrow an existing regime but once they have succeeded in doing so the cause that brought them together has gone, and they then fight one another to fill the power vacuum that they themselves have created. These internecine struggles, usually savage, among erstwhile allies perpetuate the revolutionary breakdown of society far beyond the overthrow of the old regime and delay the establishment of a new order. <br><br>The population at large begins to feel itself threatened by unending social chaos and in these circumstances a strong man who can bring the warring factions to heel and impose order comes forward and meets with widespread support, or at least acquiescence. Thus a revolution carried out in the name of civil liberties, or equality, or to bring a tyranny to an end, will itself end by putting into power a Cromwell, a Napoleon or a Stalin. All revolutions are uncontrollable, and all revolutions are betrayed. It is in their nature that these things should be so. This fact makes belief in violent revolution as a means of changing society not only irrational and delusory but profoundly immoral.<br><br><a href=#c2314854877829631375 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 4:37 PM</a><br><br>

The main struggle for hears has been between the relatively conservative working classes, on the one hand, and the relatively liberal middle classes on the other, and the working class has taken it in the teeth over and over again -- Obama's health care legislation, which will load an immense financial burden on the working classes, is only the latest example. That's why so much of the working class supports the GOP; it's a matter of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend." Thaumaturgy is involved, to be sure, but it's as much that this is how the left has blinded itself to the impact of its policies on the large segment of Americans between the middle class and the poor. <br><br>Alphonse, thanks for giving it a second try!

Although I doubt he had thaumaturgy on his mind, it seems to have had that effect on many people. Although he knows his geography well, I have many criticisms of his attempts to fit all of history into a geographically deterministic model.<br><br>I won't go into my criticisms here as it would be a long off-topic post, but what's relevant to this discussion is the emotional reaction I've gotten from many different people when I voice them. Their defensiveness about Jared Diamond's theories is much more than a book of its type usually gets, and often there's little possibility of a rational discussion of the book. Keep in mind that I'm never saying the book is horrible, just that I have disagreements with certain parts of his theories.<br><br>I think I've figured out the reason for all these strange responses. Starting in the introduction, Diamond portrays his theories as the one alternative to racism, and continually refers back to that throughout the book. That places a dichotomy in many people's minds that causes them to think that if someone has any criticisms of the book, they must be racist. <br><br>Of course, there are many other alternatives to geographical determinism that don't involve any notions of racial superiority, but Diamond sure does push the buttons of people's unconscious. Would that be considered unintentional thaumaturgy? I have no idea whether he actually believes in his own dichotomy or if he just did that to secure his position of high regard among the political left. In either case, it only hinders real discussion on the issues at hand, and in my opinion takes away from his respectability.<br><br><a href=#c6994852121788147776 title="comment permalink">10/13/11, 10:25 PM</a><br><br>

I have been working on a novel for several years now, and today was shocked to find one of its central points- the backfiring of what you term mass thaumaturgy- so clearly explained. The goal of my labor is, as I explained to someone a few weeks ago, to cause the reader to change their perceptions. I did not consciously think of this as magic (although I admit that aspects of its plot were strongly influenced by Tim Powers, a writer whose style is sometimes termed, "magic realism." However, among the various villains and antagonists in the plot is a society whose members consider themselves "one-eyed men" in the world of the "blind," and thus naturally entitled to manipulate the perceptions of the masses, who couch their teachings in occult terms.<br><br>It is odd, but I find that recently, I have found resources for my goal in the most unlikely of places- I never considered that I might find a perspective such as yours linked to a website about resources and economics! Another incidence, in Jungian terms synchronous, was a friend asking my help in locating a book- Homo Sacer, by Giorgio Agamben. I was shocked to find the political philosophy of the villain of my story clearly an echo of Agamben!<br><br>What I mean to ask you, though, is if you might direct me to any further resources along these lines. The novel considers reality as a Rashomon-type exercise, but with hard-to soft cosmological scientific underpinnings- i.e., the reality we perceive is an artifact of our movement in spatial dimensions which are not apparent (such as theorized in Superstring Theory) which we unconsciously navigate using our irrational minds; generally, and often tragically, to find the things we expect and fear.<br><br>I look forward to your future posts, and thank you for any help or advice you may be able to give.<br><br><a href=#c4918451256274418538 title="comment permalink">10/14/11, 12:16 AM</a><br><br>

It says a lot about those commenting. Also, I think calls for revolution are indicative of a desire for an apocalyptic way out of their own messy domestic situations. Therein lies the appeal for some. It is the ultimate in not having to clean up your own backyard!<br><br>The end point for both OWS and the Tea Party is that their supporters both just want jobs to earn an income and put food on the table - using the mental programs that they have learned to date. It's not much to ask for really, but with 10% official unemployment over in the US and a more than likely chance of an imminent depression, few in power seem to be listening and therein lies the fuel for the fire.<br><br>Speaking of fire, I wonder if those that lit the wick of the Tea Party understand what they've set in motion? My opinion is that they believe they can control the animal that they've set loose. But will it be a candle or a powder keg? Only the future can tell.<br><br>I was wondering if you've ever watched the outstanding UK 7up series? What an amazing social experiment and voyeuristic entertainment for us! I note that by the age of 49 most of the people had lost their spark. No disrespect to them, but I think the accumulated concerns of peoples domestic situations tend to muddy the waters which is why "the habit of giving up learning and personal growth around the age of 25 or 30 goes back a long ways" - in reality they're tired and overwhelmed, some are just lazy, but it is the life that they have chosen!<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c3604398579351741250 title="comment permalink">10/14/11, 2:47 AM</a><br><br>

This is not sustainable and differs from the forest example that I provided where the animals are abiding on the resources that they can gain from their immediate area. <br><br>By the way, I also accumulate tools, knowledge and soil fertility using fossil fuels.

In three essays, you've helped me jump over a number of hurdles in my own practice, both of a theurgical kind and a thaumaturgic kind.<br><br>First, I have a tendency to read your essay on Thursday mornings before purple color breathing (thank you for another technique!) and select a thought or two for my morning meditation. It's been... illuminating.<br><br>But these three essays from you have also coincided with a massive increase in the number of requests that I've gotten from others to do magic — thaumaturgy — on their behalf. That is to say, from zero to about twenty... one or two the first week, seven or eight the second, and ten this third week. Mostly this has consisted of divinatory work, but sometimes something more.<br><br>A good many meditations of my other days, and a good many pages in my journal, have been filled with considering the ethics of thaumaturgy, and the role of the mojo-maker in helping people with problems. The injunction/suggestion of doing a divination before working magic on someone else's behalf seems highly perceptive here. <br><br>One doesn't rush into magic, but instead uses a divinatory process to observe the client, study the relevant forces acting on the client and their 'constellation' of related issues and persons. That data-gathering phase sometimes reveals the client's underlying challenge — which the meditations and rituals of theurgy help the magic practitioner to see! The consultation of books, and charts of correspondence, and the smelling of herbs and the careful weighing of the effects of one against the other... it's all a carefully-calculated process to help reach into the subtle places and help someone unlock their own greater potentials.<br><br>To use that same process to lock someone into a broken mindset, or limit their faculties, or damage their psyche... it's monstrous.<br><br>How much more monstrous when practiced on a whole people or nation! How much more monstrous when practiced on one part of a nation to the detriment of the other! <br><br>So now some things about politics and magic become clearer, too. <br><br>Thank you.<br><br><a href=#c5607562956954356381 title="comment permalink">10/14/11, 5:17 AM</a><br><br>

I readily concede that there are things that don't exist in this sense but are nonetheless parts of our reality. I wouldn't insist that free will, agency, beliefs and so on do not exists or are any less relevant than the things that do exist even though there is no substance in the human body that is the equivalent of the human free will hormone, or that a Christian gene and so on. As I said, I think my vocabulary is simply failing me here because I get why it may be confusing. I am decoupling the question of existence and non-existence from real and unreal. I think this is real because what exists is primarily dealt with using our physical bodies and what doesn't exist can be dealt with using our minds. Before science, it was almost impossible to sort this out, because we pile layers and layers of non-existent meaning atop of existent reality and the two interact often.<br><br>For insance, money is nothing more than a bit of metal or paper with a few distinguishing physical features. Nothing more, nothing less. As a social construct, it obviously has a lot more meaning and impacts/mediates how we can access and utilize other pieces of existent reality. You can't deconstruct a social construct by yourself, almost everyone knows that money does not really exist, but that doesn't mean you can just ignore its role. You do have complete control over the non-existent parts of your reality that influence and shade your interaction with the existent. It does mean you can redefine your relationship to it, such as your message of voluntary poverty.<br>To change your understanding of the non-existent, or subjective, reality takes a lot of hard work. But its an inside job.<br><br>To do so for others, to dispell others of the unreality of money, or the contemporary definition of progress and the good life takes a lot more work. Its not as simple as telling people that a social custom can be ignored to get them to do so. That is my take of where you are going with this. <br><br>Maybe I should have used subjective and objective instead of existent and non-existent. <br><br>I'll add that a more explicit thanks for your work here. I am currently in the process of changing my objective and subjective reality. Not entirely thanks to you, I spent years before encountering your writing and ideas considering all the issues in our society and my role in them. The part that you have been an immense help in is taking action to change my self and my own role rather than sitting around and wondering why 'people' don't wake up to what is going on and do something about them, without being aware of the irony that here I was still going into an air conditioned, climate controlled, energy intensive office to work on computers.<br><br><a href=#c2306289812783213442 title="comment permalink">10/14/11, 5:49 AM</a><br><br>

A few quibbles quickly come to mind though.<br><br>First is the question of proportion between the old socio-psychological knowledge (be it secret or not) and the knowledge added in the last 100 years. I would rather guess that, although social knowledge is not as academically precise as physical laws, the recent humanities knowledge might overshadow the ancient knowledge still. We not only have vast academic (psychoanalytic, clinical, neurological, anthropological) fields established, but novel “unorthodox” developments (such as NLP, Timothy Leary, fusions with Eastern practices) as well, and then commercial management evolution, even secret government programs (such as MK-ULTRA). We might argue about quality and completeness of the new knowledge (public or not), but why would Plato know everything better than us? Isn’t the number of recent human interactions and control attempts dwarf the total of tricks in thousand years? The star motivators might be missing something, but they do help certain people to manage themselves and others. And what is the mundane CGT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy) if not involving the charioteer ahead of horses? Can everything be fitted into the distinction between theurgy and thaumaturgy?<br><br>Secondly, talks about Plato’s <i>Republic</i> usually assume either a <i>social organism</i> utopia or something even rosier. But motivation for social control might be either as mundane as your own sole benefit (by all neo-Darwinian cannons), or something beyond lazy imagination. What if resolution of peak oil and the overshot is already in the cards, say, through <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones rel=nofollow>population control</a>? Why wouldn’t some elites only pretend that they strive for a stable financial and social environment, or oil in Iraq? Couldn’t they possibly know something better in a rather near horizon?<br><br>A modern example of a <i>managed republic</i> (and <i>getting people to do the right thing</i>) is a large corporation (h/t SLClaire). How much thaumaturgy or something better is there? One side facet however: the top corporate officials are not exactly governors of their corporate realm. They are just thoroughly representing the owners and/or shareholders. And their top pay reflects this role, not the added product value.<br><br><a href=#c3569339860965491870 title="comment permalink">10/14/11, 6:21 AM</a><br><br>

If modern psychologists know nothing compared to ancient hermits, that may mean that there are significant obstructing factors against the mainstream research. But particularly the surreptitious social knowledge could be growing in the 20th century in leaps and bounds beyond hermits’ dreams. If the bolshevik or Nazi propaganda was crude (and even rather intellectual), the advertising and media manipulation (plus rat race and mortgage pressures, broad shock therapies and selective approval by Nobel prizes and Oscars) could have brought old bad thaumaturgy to impressively workable heights. I come to repeating my suspicion that a global scale political-economic management has been conspired. Hitler did not raise to power only by his thaumaturgic skills. Rather he was silently groomed and supported by a social stratum of good mannered wealthy Germans, and not only Germans. Tellingly, Hitler could defy the 1930s depression with his funny money and social discipline without pressing attention of big financial players - in contrast to the fate of Weimar’s Republic. Ever more controversially, even <a href=http://reformed-theology.org/html/books/bolshevik_revolution/index.html rel=nofollow>Lenin and Stalin</a> are suspected to be projects of bored Western super-industrialists.<br><br>I am rather bemused by some developments since the 1990s. Right after the fall of the Soviet Union, most East Europeans appeared to be strangely well educated about financial and other imperatives from the West. In no time a small circle (of recent apparatchiks, mostly) learned most profitable privatization and financing strategies. A larger circle, almost a majority, was already fixated in emigrating to the West or scoring a quick profit at home, even ready to hook on pyramid schemes, three-card-monty games (and eventually, onto real estate bubbles). Plato’s three strata in action?! I found it also remarkable how massive was the perception of young women’s focus on foreigners, or cash-rich or other neo-Darwinian stereotypes - but I was naturally more tuned for that awareness then. After a series of self-fulfilling clichés the majority of population there is seen as poor loosers - and when you think of children, how much Darwinian sense is in there?<br><br>Public perceptions in the West are shifting no less coherently. The stock market was not the center of the world until the 1980s, the real estate craze did not take up until 2000, the liberals were not ridiculous until that time either, and the urgency of terror changed in one day. Sure, some patterns of human folly repeat in cycles - but, hmmm, I find it worthwhile to wonder how much <i>intelligent design</i> is here behind.<br><br><a href=#c8066990801956462368 title="comment permalink">10/14/11, 6:22 AM</a><br><br>

They actually ran an ad with the words "Stop pedaling ... start driving."<br><br>What has been pleasant, however, was to see the civility in the responses from the cycling community. There's plenty of indignation, and a good bit of sarcasm, but somehow the shrill tone that permeates most political discourse in the US seems absent.<br><br>The ad actually says "Stop pedaling ... start driving."<br><br>@cherokee I would dispute that human's can only be dominant with oil. We've done pretty well historically with, by modern standards, some pretty basic tools. Even at hunter-gatherer stage we managed to spread across the entire planet to a degree unparalleled by any other species. And even before the advent of agriculture, we were pretty good at causing major ecological damage. Technology (and ultimately oil) has sped that up over time, but fire, clothing, spears and speech were about all it took.<br><br>@madtom Oh I wasn't accusing you specifically of Social Darwinism. I had that in mind because I've been seeing the argument put forward from the right lately that the poor are poor through some failure on their part. This goes alongside the recent resurgence of Libertarianism -- the belief that competition between individuals under laissez-faire capitalism is the solution to all of society's problems is nothing short of Social Darwinism.<br><br>But I was specifically noting, like others here, that evolution is not as simple as a "frenzied scrambling for short term gain", although that is a commonly held societal myth useful to those who would try to justify Social Darwinism. At the minimum, evolution selects for successfully making it through one reproductive cycle. And individual's offspring not only have to survive, but have to successfully produce their own offspring. In that form it is selecting for behaviors that result in gain over a generation-long time period. <br><br>But it goes further, since a more important unit of evolution is actually the species, rather than the individual. Over speciation-length time (abut 2 million years a species, on average), the selection is for behavior that ensures the survival of the species. This selection pressure selects against species that exhaust their environment (e.g. parasites which kill their host too quickly).<br><br>I recommend looking up <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_history_theory rel=nofollow>life history theory</a> (the descendant of r/K selection theory). It's a pretty modern view of how evolution works in practice, backed up by empirical evidence.<br><br><a href=#c8812550228366759221 title="comment permalink">10/14/11, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

I'm still following. I think I'll wait for the complete arc before any major comments, including addressing the question you asked me, a few posts ago, about applying empirical methods to consciousness (and hence, to magic).<br><br>But one point in the meantime, which I don't think anyone brought up in connection with last week's post: some people's social horses are a bit lame to begin with. (Coincidentally, "lame" is currently among the milder of the insults that kids fitting that description should expect to hear from their peers.) For us, not a lot of initiating is needed to learn to detach our rational selves from the distractions of our social selves. It's the opposite, learning to engage and value our social "horses," that takes some work.<br><br>Perhaps for that reason (or perhaps for some other), I've always found the kind of mass thaumaturgy you decry, in this week's post, transparent and easily disregarded or "shorted to ground." For one trivial but illustrative example, I decoded the admittedly not so subtle geis in TV ads for high-sugar children's breakfast cereals while I was still in the target age range for the ads. (The cartoon kids invariably chase, trick, or thwart other more powerful-seeming cartoon characters to obtain or keep the cereal; the overt message is "you want this cereal" but the hidden payload is "you must struggle with your parents for this cereal.") Whether it's car manufacturers selling uncluttered roads or special traffic privileges they obviously can't provide, evangelists upselling this era's version of indulgences by bundling good fortune in the name of God, or politicians giving away free samples of today's up-to-the-minute flavor of fear, I wonder who could possibly be gullible enough to fall for it--and then watch with familiar disappointment as so many rush off to buy.<br><br>Thank you for providing greater insight into why that happens.

I use the term "Marxist" for those political systems that derive from the thought of Ksrl Marx partly because that usage has been standard for nearly a century, partly to differentiate them from other forms of socialism -- of which there are quite a few, of course -- and partly because the flaws of the political systems in question unfold directly from problematic aspects of Marx' own theories. <br><br>In Russia these days they have a useful saying: "Everything Marx said about communism was false, but everything he said about capitalism was true," and that's a reasonable summary of the situation. Marx' critique of capitalism is something with which any student of political economy has to deal. His prescription for what should replace capitalism, though, is cruelly flawed -- an apocalyptic fantasy in secular drag that, in practice, consistently turns out police states with no respect for human rights. <br><br>That's far from a dead issue, either. Sometime in the next decade or so, I expect to see a serious attempt to revive Marxism as a revolutionary ideology on the American left, and the rhetoric they will use will doubtless attempt -- as you seem to be attempting -- to distance Marxist theory from all previous attempts to put that theory into practice, dismissing them as "not really Marxist." I don't find that a useful project, quite the contrary, and if you expect me to change my manner of speaking in a way that will further it, I have to say you're going to be disappointed. <br><br>Stogie, other than encouraging you to read the Ioan Culianu book mentioned in the post, I don't know off hand of anything else to suggest. It sounds like a fascinating project. <br><br>Brazza, I'm pretty sure I must be misunderstanding you. "All forms of manipulation of matter"? Whether you mean by magic or in general, that's vastly too broad; you manipulate matter with every breath you take. Magical ethics is a complex issue, as indeed is any form of ethical thought; the problems with mass thaumaturgy are simply one subject within that broad realm. <br><br>Cherokee, I haven't owned a TV in my adult life, so any question about whether I've watched a series is going to get the answer of "no." I think you're quite right, as it happens, about the Tea Party and its likely trajectory. It's very easy to start a populist movement, and very hard to control the direction in which it ends up going!<br><br>Tubaplayer, glad to hear it. <br><br>Andrew, good. Yes, it's monstrous, in the strict sense of the word; like the mixing of religion and politics, it produces a hideous hybrid having most of the worst features of both parents. <br><br>Rainbow, er, I don't recall saying that Obama represents the left. Like every successful Democratic politician in recent decades, he denounced the GOP until he got into office and then copied its policies word for word. The people who call him a sellout would do the same thing if they got into power, because any other set of policies would cut into the privileges of the classes to which they belong, and which they represent. Now of course the GOP is no better; one of the common pathologies of democracy is that it routinely turns into an arena in which class interests appear in a degree of nakedness bordering on the obscene. Still, I find it intriguing that you would consider this view, which is evenly applied to both sides, a form of scapegoating.<br><br><a href=#c3058997526912616141 title="comment permalink">10/14/11, 4:10 PM</a><br><br>

I'll pass this time, thanks. <br><br>Void, that's an interesting question. Toynbee argued that the 1% doesn't start off parasitic, but becomes that way once it fails to provide meaningful leadership and settles for domination instead -- leading promptly to the decline and fall of the civilization it rules. You might have an interesting time weaving his ideas into the analysis you're developing.<br><br>Ceworthe, Jim and I are fans of each other's work -- I read his blog religiously first thing every Monday morning. <br><br>Huntgather, that's one of the things about being a Neoplatonist; the Neoplatonic tradition absorbed Aristotle's logic and rhetoric, not to mention Stoic ethics and Pythagorean mathematics, in the course of filling in the many gaps Plato left behind, and patching up the holes where his more egregious mistakes got chucked. <br><br>Kieran, thank you! I'll see if I can manage to humiliate GM a bit in an upcoming post. That slogan deserves death by sarcasm. <br><br>Joe, it's been a very, very long time since I last read <i>One-Dimensional Man</i>. Remind me of his relevance to the present argument!<br><br>Grrl, well, it's your time, money and all, but I'd sooner gnaw on a rat's pancreas than go to a Weight Watcher's meeting. One of these days I'm going to have to do a post about the manufacture of the "obesity epidemic" and the tangled mess of collective emotions that gets dumped on the people among us who current body-fashions label "fat." That's not a project I want to do, because most Americans are basically not sane about food and body weight these days, and I'm confident that the response will include a lot of gibbering and even more spluttering tirades. Oh, well...<br><br>Scepticus, equating the history of culture to the sum of mass thaumaturgy is a bit like insisting that bassoons are the only instrument in the orchestra. It's one factor among very, very many. As for long-term factors in selection, good heavens -- I take it you haven't studied evolutionary ecology. Evolution is simply the sum total of what works to maximize long term reproductive success, you know, and long term strategies such as investing parental energy in childraising are among the common things that work. By and large, long term strategies are at least as common in living things as short term ones; you might look up the difference between R-selected and K-selected reproductive strategies, for example, just as an intro to the literally millions of examples. <br><br>Myriad, the cereal example is great -- thanks for passing that one on. I had similar experiences with some other kinds of commercials as a child, but that seems to be fairly rare. <br><br>Thijs, one of the problems with trying to discuss these matters in weekly posts, written on the fly, is that a lot of subtleties get left out. That's one of them! The philosopher kings weren't theurgists, not quite -- it was exactly the fact that Plato's mode of education proved to be insufficient to get the nonrational and rational aspects of the self into a state of balance governed by reason that led to the evolution of theurgic magic.<br><br><a href=#c7218402093699936875 title="comment permalink">10/14/11, 4:54 PM</a><br><br>

It looks to me like both the protestors and their detractors are trying to frame the debate over the protests, to define what the protests are about.<br><br>At first, there was no clearly defined goal of the protests, and there was a loud complaint from the media over the protest's lack of an "agenda." Unlike a lot of people, I didn't have a problem with that. I think it's OK for a protest to be about, well, just simply protesting something. In this case, I thought they were performing the valuable service of just pointing fingers where they needed to be pointed.<br><br>Over the last couple of weeks, though, I've seen the "99%" meme begin to take center stage. I'm sure that's got some rhetorical expedience, but it looks to me like a perfect example of looking for the emotion-based incantation. I'm guessing this usually involves more than just a "dumbing down" of the message, but also looking for easy targets for all of that emotion.<br><br>Now those that would rather the finger not be pointed where it needed to be are also busy casting spells to get the debate in the same direction, so it becomes a matter of simple "class warfare" and they can exploit a certain large reservoir of sympathy for the rich and famous. I've heard a lot of "I work hard for my money, who are they to say I shouldn't ..." as if the protests are aimed a lot more wider than Wall St.<br><br>The danger is that it might become a self-fulfilling spell.<br><br><a href=#c7105103672806335441 title="comment permalink">10/15/11, 12:38 AM</a><br><br>

It will be interesting to see where it all ends up, it may even fizzle out, who knows? But I reckon the job issue is going to be really hard to gloss over in the not too distant future. My gut feeling is that they'll point to a scapegoat before too long and start yelling. It's at that point that the movement will run away from the fat controllers (the reference to fat controllers is an attempt at humour).<br><br>I quite like the 1% - 99% story, it has impact and creates quite an image, without providing a background story. It's very powerful. However, I've travelled a bit of the developing world and want to point out something obvious to the readers here, which may otherwise be lost on them. A lot of people in the developing world see us as the 1%. Think about that!<br><br>Someone mentioned psychopaths (I'll also include sociopaths). Unfortunately because of my occupation I have had more than my fair share of contact with this lot. A tell-tale sign with them is that they are unable to empathise with others, although this is not conclusive proof. There are plenty of souls who struggle with this. However, when their lack of empathy extends to assuming that they are smarter than the rest of the population you know you've hit the jackpot. You don't have to worry about asking searching questions, they'll happily tell you all you need to know. Good luck with that one! Avoid them, they mean you no good.<br><br>Kieran - You are correct, I hadn't considered that. I guess what I was trying to get at was the question of degree. The use of fossil fuels (from my perspective anyway) simply allows the overshoot to be that much greater.

Boogies and other interesting effects are never absent from this school either.<br><br>I liked Adrian Ayres Fisher's comment and your reply:<br><br><i>every religion -- without exception -- is the basis for a system of theurgy, and most religions have developed at least some basic methods along those lines.</i><br><br>People might not see these systems even when they're in plain sight. They fruit off from the spiritual traditions in which they grew. On my blog I've called this the <a href=http://lightningoak.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/the-bud-off/ rel=nofollow>bud-off</a>. Yoga budded off from Indian spirituality and ch'i kung (qigong) from Chinese. Kabbalah budded off from Jewish traditions to be snapped up by Hermetics, which itself probably budded off from Hellenistic Thoth cults. Hesychasm has budded off from Orthodox Christianity and is heading West. Etc. Every one is theurgy.<br><br>The spiritual traditions need not be directly religious -- much is associated with the martial arts for example, and with healing. Both of those applications are legitimate thaumaturgies.<br><br>People with a yen for a quest have a lot to choose from. Transpersonal psychology has got to grips with some of the effects, including interesting phenomena I describe in my <a href=http://lightningoak.wordpress.com/2011/10/15/genius/ rel=nofollow>current post</a>. (As Thoth became philosophised so kundalini has been psychologised, language-wise.) People tend to become more aware of all this work as they exit the standard groupmind beliefs, which paint it all as manipulative indoctrination.

In the same way that we can call a huge amount of physical matter a 'table' in terms of its purpose and what it is used for in relation to humans rather than listing 10^25 particle positions and velocities, you can call an idea or philosophy something real in that it tends to produce effects in the human world as a result of the actions of people who hold it in their minds. The idea has no physical existence (at least as anything but the most incredibly subtle and ephemeral patterns in their brains that no human currently has the capacity to decode), just as the table has no intrinsic 'purpose' inherent to its matter. But both have definite effects in the context of human life, and to ignore that is just making things harder for yourself.<br><br>My vocabulary/parsing for talking about thaumaturgy around me is probably still screwy, but I also couldn't help but note the way that these movements can start off organically, but then get captured by some existing power structure, as a counterpoint to one getting started off with some intention and then getting away from its creators. I'm more concerned about that in relation to the current set of disturbances sweeping the country/world, as each time the energy of the people gets redirected it seems that the vested inerests get more dug in and the disturbance required to shake things up gets larger.<br><br>----<br><br>I do have hope about my generation's ability to break off some of the spoonfed stories and get something done for themselves. I just got back from the university farm that has just started up this year; we harvested hundreds of pounds of organically grown sweet potatoes today, and the enthusiasm of the dozen plus people who helped out was palpable. We spread out slips cut from the vines between everyone to try to nurse through the winter in various ways and keep alive until planting time in the spring. Many dozens of people come there at least occasionally and everyone there is learning a lot and coming to value real things. This is the farm's first year, and the interest from the student body is already taking off - hopefully it can be a place to teach people things that are really important...<br><br><a href=#c8821526868215705055 title="comment permalink">10/16/11, 1:29 PM</a><br><br>

While the crowd might be described broadly as "progressive", the majority were a wide cross-section of fairly non-radical people.<br><br>This was also clear in the messages coming out in placards and chants. The overwhelming message protesting against income disparity, the brokenness of the global financial system, and the damaging influence of financial interests in an ostensibly democratic system of government (all three of which are strongly interrelated) was pretty clear.<br><br>The great strength of that message, and especially the 99% meme is its inclusiveness. During the march, chants of "we are the 99%" morphed into "you are the 99%" as the march wound through Saturday shopping crowds, and "police are the 99%" as it went past police officers escorting the march and keeping hotheaded downtown motorists from ploughing through it. Ultimately, this makes it pretty difficult for critics to pigeon hole (and marginalise) the movement, when it states outright that it is representing them, too.<br><br><a href=#c3438913512176579442 title="comment permalink">10/16/11, 2:27 PM</a><br><br>

Realistically speaking, there are plenty of the ultra-rich outside of the US, although wealth remains pretty concentrated there.

I wish I could share your optimism, all, but I'm not sure the OWS protests are going to work. The public DOES seem to feel sympathy for stockbrokers and bankers, despite John Michael Greer's predictions.<br><br>Why do I say that? I just found out today that there's a backlash movement now called "We are the 53%". I won't repeat some of their more foul language, but basically they think that the OWS movement is protesting over nothing, that the 53% that constitute the "middle class" are paying for the "working class" to protest and by the way, anyone who emulates Toynbee and protests the 1% is a "childish brat who needs to clean up his mess and go home, I pay my taxes and work hard so all those other people who are jobless and homeless are just whiners! Nobody else in the country has the right to complain but ME!!! I'M getting screwed out of my riches to pay for those BUMS!!!"<br><br>And that's the NICER language. Take note, by the way, that this is not coming from the rich. It's coming from the public, who DO in fact prize wealth over everything else, and cannot get rid of straw man arguments claiming the protestors "just don't want to work in the mailroom," when in fact many of the protestors have no jobs mailroom-or-otherwise and no prospects for ever having a job. <br><br>The American public LOVES the "rich and successful." I'm not sure how many thinking people understand that; this is not a case of domination by the rich, this is a case of the public loudly sharing the 1%'s "value system." That the working classes, or thinkers like the brilliant John Michael Greer, might have a good point does not occur to most people in America.<br><br>I'm worried the OWS movement will fail unless it first reinvents the public's value system to prize something in life other than money, and I'm not sure that can actually be done, money-worship is as American as apple pie, and the tendency to prioritize one's own complaints while angrily dismissing everyone else's right to complain (which is what the 53% counter-movement is really about) is equally as American as apple pie.<br><br>However, carp, thank you very much for the Guy Debord reference, I'll check that book out.<br><br><a href=#c6837382692165413014 title="comment permalink">10/17/11, 6:43 PM</a><br><br>

Always food for thought and I'm always hungry.<br><br>I'm beginning to wonder if there is such a thing as rational magic. One becomes a practioner of, say, horticulture with a solid grounding in one's pursuit and also maths, logic, the sciences and so on. However, one also develops an ability to leave the rational aside occasionally and let more random thoughts or possibly intuitions interlope leading to connections that wouldn't normally crop up in a completely rational analytical environment. It becomes a delicate balancing act of knowing that you are giving rationalism a rest or letting it ally with other modes of non-rational or random contemplation. You then can take the new connections/patterns/thoughts and experiment or play with them responsibly to measure their efficacy. (I also wonder if the goals of such a line of enquiry must necessarily be broad based and established within loftier intent?)<br><br>I then wonder, if one can develop this mode, whether another level can be explored?

One of the things that continues to fascinate me about the readership of this blog is that I seem to have stumbled across a patch of common ground on which rationalist engineers and religious mystics can find something to talk about amicably!<br><br>Hapibeli, interesting. I think it's pretty much a given at this point that the US will come apart in the decades ahead, and divisions of the sort that article traces are among the many factors pushing in that direction. <br><br>Maria, glad to be of help. Given your background, you might find my book <a href="http://www.cleispress.com/book_page.php?book_id=433" rel=nofollow>Apocalypse Not</a> entertaining as well. <br><br>Grrl, good. That's a narrative that could use more attention these days. <br><br>Tony, that's excellent news about the university farm! I learned much of what I know about organic gardening from just such a campus farm, so can vouch for the fact that it can be a very valuable project. <br><br>Richard, quite often. Whenever a civilization goes down, its elite classes are the first ones up against the wall, and there are plenty of other occasions -- think the French and Russian revolutions for starters -- in which the former elite class of a society faces that awkward little choice between flight into exile and extermination. Thus it's quite conceivable, even before industrial civilization goes down, that the survivors of today's US banking and political families may fifty years from now be embittered exiles living in Europe and daydreaming about the old times, when they still had wealth and power. <br><br>Mark, that's a typo I've made myself!<br><br>Carp, now there's a blast from the past! I should reread "Society of the Spectacle" one of these days. <br><br>Joel, "pleasantly surprised"? Gah. When the mobs come for them, I hope somebody says "Just do it!" seconds before tearing them limb from limb. Seriously. <br><br>Kieran, of course you're quite right; I should have specified the American middle class, which is well represented in the current round of protests. <br><br>Rainbow, the "53%" people are those who haven't lost their jobs yet, and are loudly trying to distance themselves from those who have. The OWSers are those who have. I'm more concerned myself about the efforts of political hacks of the MoveOn variety to hijack the OWS movement and harness it to business as usual. <br><br>X, of course there's rational magic; it's only in the rhetoric of materialists that that can't exist. The competent ceremonial mages I know always test their results against objective standards. It's a matter of alternation of states of consciousness; when you're working magic you have to put yourself fully into the work and suspend the critical faculties; outside of ritual space, you can assess the experience and its effects critically, and draw conclusions -- and in fact many of the details of magical practice are intended to facilitate the shift from participatory to critical states of consciousness.<br><br><a href=#c881219708263575962 title="comment permalink">10/18/11, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>
