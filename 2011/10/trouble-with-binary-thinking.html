Last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> discussed the magical implications of getting out from under the influence of the mass media and popular culture, and thus from the dumbing-down effects these things exert on the mind. That’s a crucial step, but it’s only a first step, because as soon as you extract all that thaumaturgy from your mind, something is going to fill the resulting void. <br><br>Entire industries exist to see to it that what fills the void is simply another version of what you tried to get rid of. The sorry fate of the so-called Voluntary Simplicity movement of a few years back makes a good case study of the way these industries work. It was a bad move right at the beginning, to be sure, that the founders of the movement watered down Thoreau’s original and far more powerful phrase “voluntary poverty” so that it didn’t frighten their middle-class target audience. As soon as the idea began to attract attention, that first mistake became the opening wedge that admitted a series of marketing campaigns that pitched supposedly “simpler” consumer products to a mostly privileged audience at steep prices. <br><br>Before long a glossy concept magazine packed with ads surfaced on the newsstands, and the whole mvoement devolved into one more mildly exotic lifestyle choice for bored yuppies who were tired of the older options for conspicuous consumption and wanted to try a new one. Not simplicity, but a set of abstract cultural representations of simplicity that were heavily marketed to sell products, became the hallmark of the movement, as torrents of overpriced goodies manufactured in Third World sweatshops and marketed through lavish catalogs and websites came to define what had started out as a not unreasonable attempt to raise questions about the contemporary cult of clutter. What Thoreau would have thought of all this, while stepping out of his shack at Walden Pond with an ax in his hand to split firewood in the chill October air, does not bear imagining. <br><br>My more perceptive readers may have grasped from this example one of the reasons why I persist in using the old-fashioned and hopelessly unpopular word “magic” for the inner disciplines and traditional philosophies I’ve been discussing in the current series of posts. “Magic,” like “voluntary poverty,” is an unappealing focus for mass marketing in the context of today’s popular culture. Repackage it under some more comfortable label, and it’s a safe bet that within a few years at most your new label will have been hijacked by the thaumaturgists of marketing and advertising departments, turned into yet another cheap sales pitch, and used to pimp attitudes and ideas, as well as products, that are antithetical in every way to what your label was originally intended to mean.<br><br>That’s exactly what happened to the New Age movement, which started out as an intriguing attempt to find common ground between cutting edge sciences, traditional wisdom, and the experiences of contemporary visionaries, before it got mugged by the marketers in the dark alleys of the early 1980s. For heaven’s sake, Gregory Bateson used to count as a New Age thinker. What he would have thought of today’s New Age scene—well, let’s just say that if he suddenly stepped out of a shack at Esalen this evening with an ax in his hand, I’m not sure how confident I would be that he had firewood in mind. <br><br>Still, the machinations of marketers are not the only difficulty that has to be faced here. Certain inborn habits of the human mind, even in the absence of modern mass media or the equivalent, tend to leave a nasty trap in the way of the aspiring mage, or for that matter anybody else who recognizes that there’s something wrong with the worldview of a dysfunctional culture. Enough of my readers may have one or another part of their anatomy caught in the jaws of this particular trap that it’s probably wisest to follow the approach standard in magical instruction—that is, to present the model as an abstraction first, and only then move into the potentially controversial territory of actual examples. <br><br>A bit of jargon will unfortunately be necessary. Human beings, according to the teaching you’re about to receive, normally think in <i>binaries</i>—that is, polarized relationships between one thing and another, in which the two things are seen as total opposites. That habit is universal and automatic enough that it’s most likely hardwired into our brains, and there’s good reason why it should be. Most of the snap decisions our primate ancestors had to make on the African savannah are most efficiently sorted out into binary pairs: food/nonfood, predator/nonpredator, and so on. The drawbacks to this handy set of internal categories don’t seem to bother any of our primate relatives, and probably became an issue—like so much that’s part of magic—only when the rickety structure of the reasoning mind took shape over the top of the standard-issue social primate brain. <br><br>The difficulty, like so many of the difficulties that beset humanity, is one of overgeneralizing a good idea. There’s no significant middle ground between food and nonfood, say, or between predator and nonpredator, and so the reactive response we’re discussing excludes the possibility of middle ground; it’s either edible (or considering you as edible), or it’s not. The more complex classifications that the reasoning mind can use, though, admit of a great deal of middle ground, and so do the equally complex relationships that develop in societies once the reasoning mind gets to work on relationships between social primates. When we have the opportunity to consider such things carefully, it’s not hard to see this, but the hardwired habit of snap judgments in binary form is always right below the surface. In most cases all it takes is a certain amount of stress to trigger it. Any kind of stress will do, and over the years, practitioners of mass thaumaturgy have gotten very good at finding ways to make people feel stressed so that the binary reaction kicks in and can be manipulated to order. <br><br>That’s when thinking in binaries goes haywire, the middle ground becomes invisible, and people think, say, and do resoundingly stupid things because they can only see two extreme alternatives, one of which is charged to the bursting point with desire (food rather than nonfood) or fear (predator rather than nonpredator). Watch the way that many people on the American right these days insist that anybody to the left of George W. Bush is a socialist, or tfor that matter the way that some people on the American left insist that anybody to the right of Hillary Clinton is a fascist. Equally, and more to the point in our present context, think of the way the peak oil debate was stuck for so long in a binary that insisted that the extremes of continued progress and sudden catastrophic collapse were the only possible shapes of the postpetroleum future. <br><br>In the tradition of Druidry I mostly teach and practice, there’s a neat mental trick for sidestepping the binary-producing mechanism when it’s not useful. It consists, first, of learning to recognize binaries at sight, and second, when a binary is encountered, looking for a third option that will turn the binary into a <i>ternary</i>, a threefold relationship. Back in the day, beginning students used to be assigned the homework of picking up the morning paper each day, writing down the first nine binaries they encountered, and finding a third option to each binary. <br><br>This useful little exercise has at least three effects. First of all, it very quickly becomes apparent to the student just how much binary thinking goes on in the average human society. Second, it very quickly becomes at least as apparent to the student how much of an effort it takes, at least at first, to snap out of binary thinking. Third and most crucial is the discovery, which usually comes in short order, that once you find a third option, it’s very easy to find more—a fourth, a ninety-fourth, and so on—and they don’t have to fit between the two ends of the binary, as most beginners assume. Take any political debate you care to name; inevitably, there are possible choices more extreme than either of the two sides, as well as choices in the space in between, and still other choices that aren’t in the same continuum at all. Ternary thinking helps you pop out of the binary mode long enough to see this. <br><br>What makes the process of ternary thinking fascinating is that its effects are not necessarily limited to the person who practices it. Fairly often, when a discussion is mired in reactive binary thinking, it only takes one person resolutely bringing up a third option over and over again, to pop at least some of the participants out of the binary trap, and get them thinking about other options. They may end up staying with the option they originally supported, but they’re more likely to do it in a reasoned way rather than an automatic, unthinking way. They’re also more likely to be able to recognize that the other sides of the debate also have their points, and to be able to find grounds for mutual cooperation, because they aren’t stuck in a mental automatism that loads a torrent of positive emotions onto their side of the balance and an equal and opposite torrent of negative emotions onto the other side. <br><br>At this point, as my readers have doubtless guessed, we’ve strayed into the realm of magical combat. You’ll notice that lightning bolts from wands and incantations in bad Latin are not involved; those belong to cheap fantasy fiction, not to actual magic. Instead, the combat is a struggle of narratives or, if you will, of ways of structuring experience. Among the tools that practitioners of mass thaumaturgy use to weave their spells are emotionally charged images and ideas that trigger the hardwired binary reaction in our brains. Among the effective options for doing battle with them, in turn, is ternary logic, which defuses the binary reaction so that whatever issue is up for discussion can be put back into its actual context, and is no longer seen exclusively through the filter of food/nonfood, predator/nonpredator, and the like. <br><br>This can only be done, though, if you’ve already learned how to deactivate the binary automatism in yourself. In magic, as in so many of the things we’ve discussed in this blog, the starting point is always your own life, and of course that’s unpopular; trom Al Gore’s carbon footprints to all those gay-bashing preachers who end up being caught with their boyfriends, America these days is awash in people trying to demand changes from other people that they haven’t been able or willing to carry out themselves. That’s ineffective magic in any context, and especially so when it comes to ternary thinking. If you try to work with ternaries when you’ve still got a great deal of emotion and personal identity invested in binary thought patterns, for example, you’re probably going to fall into a binary between the abstract concepts of binary and ternary thinking, see ternary thinking as “food” and “nonpredator” and binary thinking as “nonfood” and “predator,” and pile on the binary reactions while convincing yourself that you’ve transcended them. <br><br>I wish this were merely a theoretical possibility. Those who think it is might be well advised to pick up a copy of Matthew Fox’s book <i>The Coming of the Cosmic Christ</i> and read what Fox has to say about dualism—that’s his term for binary thinking in a religous context. He denounces it in harsh terms, but he then goes on to say that there are basically two kinds of religion, dualist and nondualist, and dualist religion is bad while nondualist religion is good! At one point—it’s on pages 134 and 135 of my copy—he sets out a convenient list of the differences between the two, and it’s all a matter of hard oppositions between contending extremes. All in all, it’s hard to think of anything more dualist this side of 3rd century Johannite Gnosticism, and yet Fox, at least when he wrote the book in question, was apparently convinced that he wasn’t a dualist. <br><br>The problem with binary thinking—or, if you will, with dualism—is not that it’s bad. It’s simply that it’s very often overused, and even more often used inappropriately. If you’re at risk of starvation, or being stalked by a predator, the hardwired binary reaction with all its emotional force is more likely to keep you alive than a philosophical attitude toward eating or being eaten. There are other times and contexts, furthermore, in which a nonreactive, thoughtful dualism, like the Taoist conception of yin and yang, is a very flexible and useful tool. The point of learning to think in ternaries, in turn, is not that ternaries are good and binaries are bad; it’s that learning the trick of ternary thinking widens your range of options. The same traditions that taught (and teach) ternary thinking go on to explain that every number denotes a way of conceptually dividing up the world, and teach more advanced students how to use a range of whole numbers—anything from the first seven to the first twenty of them, depending on the tradition in question—as abstract models for thinking, each in its own proper place and each with its own distinct effects. <br><br>The details of how this is done belong to the technicalities of magical practice and so, like some of the other points raised earlier, don’t belong in these essays. The crucial point I want to get across is simply that any binary division that comes to mind, unless it has to do with food, predators, or a handful of other very basic biological drives, should be regarded with a significant amount of wariness. This is especially true, by the way, in American politics. The two main parties have spent the last century or so cashing in mightily on the binary reaction; their rhetoric always treats the choice between them as though it’s as absolute as the choice between yes and no, or at least the one between A and Z. In reality, of course, it’s more like the choice between N and Q; even in the alphabet of contemporary political thought, there are plenty of other options, and there’s also the very real possibility of bringing in, say, Σ or Ж from another alphabet entirely—but of course any such variation is exactly what the two major parties fear most, and they put a great deal of effort into trying to forestall it. <br><br>The same logic applies to plenty of other binaries in circulation these days. Think of the number of times you’ve heard people insist that doing without some specific technology we use these days is equivalent to doing without all technology, and going back to living in caves. Think of the broader discourse from which this derives, in which any alternative to continued progress along the lines that (supposed) progress is (allegedly) progressing is equated to catastrophe. Think of the people who insist that their political movement, or religious movement, or activist movement or, really, any kind of movement you care to imagine—barring the one obvious and scatological exception—is the only alternative to whatever the horrible future du jour happens to be. <br><br>Some of these are innocent enough, but a great many more are the result of deliberate thaumaturgy, and if you trace back the rhetoric to its source, it’s not hard to see the thaumaturgy at work. If the source is a book, look for the couple of chapters right up front that describe the horrible future we’re going to get, barring a miracle, and notice further on that the plan of action offered by the writer doesn’t actually promise the miracle; the resulting doublebind heightens the stress on the readers and thus makes the binary reaction harder to shake off. If it’s visual media, watch for the same things, heightened by sharp juxtapositions between images that have radically different emotional charges—the famous ad run by the Johnson presidential campaign in 1964, alternating images of a hydrogen bomb going off and a little girl plucking daisy petals, is a classic of the type. <br><br>Other media have their own distinctive strategies of thaumaturgy. There’s a certain amount of entertainment value to be had in making such analyses, but to be quite frank, it’s more useful in practical terms to minimize your exposure to the phenomenon. The work of noticing the overfamiliar effects of thaumaturgy, analyzing the intended manimpulation, and using ternary logic or any of the other practical methods of the operative mage to pluck out one barbed emotional hook after another—well, let’s just say that it gets old very quickly, and once the lesson is well learnt there’s rarely much of a point in repeating it. <br><br>Certainly it’s possible to have a significant impact on the collective conversation of our time without exposing yourself to the thaumaturgic media. Though most mass media in every age are designed to force the recipient into a passive relationship to the incoming stream of information, disinformation, and thaumaturgy, there are always a few options that give the individual a voice or allow a conversation to take place, or both. The blogosphere is the current example of the species; a lively world of noncommercial monthly and weekly journals did the same thing through most of the twentieth century, and will no doubt do the same thing again through the second half or so of the twenty-first. There are other modes of shaping collective consciousness as well, of course, with the influence of personal example standing out in many ways as the most potent of the lot. <br><br>Still, there’s another dimension to binary thinking that has to be discussed in this context, one that reaches right down to the roots of what this blog and the peak oil blogosphere generally are trying to do. We’ll talk about that next week.

Now imagine a false choice that has been dressed up with emotionally compelling images and buzzwords so that most people don't even think about it, they just react -- that's binary thaumaturgy. <br><br>Ryan, sure. You pick up your morning newspaper, and there's an article on the front page about national politics here in the US. Some Democrat is saying that to decrease the deficit, it's going to be necessary to raise taxes; some Republican is arguing that no, we have to cut wasteful social programs instead. They're talking as though those are the only options. <br><br>Stop right there. Write down another option. It can be anything from "cut the Pentagon's budget" to "default on the national debt." If you've got a few moments, as you sip your coffee, think about the implications of your alternative choice; then go to the next paragraph, or the next story and do the same thing.

When Barack Obama began to perpetuate and normalize many of the policies that fueled the righteous outrage of the Bush years, we discovered to our dismay that our favorite righteous bloggers were just another class of Kool-Aid drinker.

(I suppose the other hand could also be the simple denial of peak oil, eg. abiotic oil.) <br><br>So does the nonbinary conversation about peak oil posit outcomes where 7, 8 or 12 billion humans survive on sustainable energy sources? That would seem to be in the realm of miracles, not magic. How do you inspire the masses to take painful, proactive steps- voluntary poverty- if it involves them contemplating the demise of of their genetic lineage.<br><br>Nevermind, I think I just answered my own question. Or maybe not, I will 'stay tuned' to this channel.<br><br><a href=#c6576321199288698735 title="comment permalink">10/26/11, 10:27 PM</a><br><br>

(I put it in parentheses so as to distinguish it from the common conception that is against my religious sensibilities, not to argue with your use of the term.)<br><br>I've had a vague understanding of these concepts for a while, half-formed and dancing in and out of my mind from time to time, but you've crystallized them in a way that will permanently alter my way of thinking, and for that I thank you.<br><br>One nagging thought still gets to me about this whole series of articles, though: the (admittedly implied) concept that society can do without these forms of, shall we say, mental scaffolding. Thaumaturgy as a concept seems, to me, not an absolute negative given the nature of people as a whole. When it is disingenuous or done for personal gain, then it certainly is, but when it is used to promote, say, noble ideals, national pride, enforcement of appropriate social mores, etc., I don't see how we could go on without them frankly.<br><br>I know that you covered this in your previous essay talking about how appealing to nonrational desires is uniquely unsuited for achieving a rational effect. But call me an elitist, I have always considered rational humanity to be a small subset of the general populace. Our efforts in the US, over the course of two hundred years of trying to create an informed, politically rational populace, have failed miserably (though you may argue thaumaturgy has much to do with that).<br><br>It's not that I don't admire the idea of everyone behaving rationally; rather, I agree that it is by far the best option if it were doable. I just think that it's wildly, wildly unrealistic to think you'd ever have more than a small minority of people actually thinking and acting rationally. These concepts are fairly deep, even if intuitively grasped, and as you've said they need to be more than simply conceived of to have an effect.<br><br>I'm sorry for the rant; the long and short of it is, do you really believe we could actually have a society that was entirely (or even mostly) rational?

I remember back in the 1990s how Clinton’s political strategy was referred to as “triangulation” in the media, usually with a sneer. I wasn’t particularly a fan of the boy from Hope, but it did seem a little churlish to sneer at attempts to find a third way forward, even if he was doing it for convenience. A popular stereotype back then was to describe a pragmatic person as wishy-washy and “running for congress” – just telling people what they want to hear. That imagery seems out of whack with our now more apparently ideological politics.<br><br>Coming into this series of posts I was holding on to the naïve idea that politicians did believe what they say, and that the polarizing ideology that crept in over the last decade or two reflected a hardening of commitments and beliefs about stuff (social policy or belief in the market or whatever). I didn’t understand this, and really didn’t get how serious people could get so worked up over concepts and details. I’m realizing now that political polarization is probably mainly the result of the perfecting of political marketing along those binary paths you discuss. Which makes me even happier that I stopped believing in political solutions a good while ago.<br><br>On a minor quibble, while I understand your frustrations towards the somewhat high-jacked and compromised aspects of New Age, Living Simply and the like, your dismissal could be interpreted as being slightly dualistic. Mostly, people do need to be met where they are to start a change, and a lot of people are just not ready for hardcore poverty talk. My dear wife, for example, who at one time was keeping the big-box industry in business is now living very simply indeed, composting and foraging in the fields with the best of them. But it took a while, and did indeed start out with that simply awful magazine and meandered through various phases of crystals and incense.

Examples of this process are everywhere and it is really useful to be challenged to consider them in everyday life. My day job for the last 20 years has been as a trial attorney in the criminal justice system, and I have worked both sides of the street. To me, a criminal trial is a classic example of magical combat between two thaumaturges. Someone calls the police and reports that their bicycle has been stolen. In most cases there is simply no evidence that is absolutely conclusive, like a video tape clearly showing the defendant stealing the bicycle. The prosecutor works the binary side, and the defense attorney works the ternary side. Endless books have been written on the subject, but your model can be elegantly applied.<br><br> Stated simply, the prosecutor calls a police officer who testifies that a bicycle was reported stolen, a witness who testifies that someone stole their bicycle, and a witness says they saw the defendant steal the bicycle. The choice presented to the jury is a very simple one, thief or not thief, and the presentation of that choice is frequently a forced choice: are you going to accept the testimony (and therefore the beliefs) of the uniformed and official protectors of society, or are you going to let a crime go unpunished? The more serious the crime, the higher the “primal factor”, and the more the playing field is tilted in favor of the state. Unfortunately, the “primal factor” can become so high that a fair trial is almost impossible.<br><br> A good defense attorney asks the jury to consider alternatives to each fundamental “truth” presented by the state. A police officer may have a good faith belief that the bicycle was stolen, because it was reported stolen, but really all that is only evidence of the report of the theft, not the theft itself. The owner testified to the theft, but what other evidence is presented to corroborate first the ownership and then the loss of the bicycle? What alternative motives exist for reporting the loss? Finally, eyewitness testimony has been empirically shown to be moderately reliable at best - there is a standard litany of questions that demonstrate this weakness. The jury is challenged over and over to look at alternative scenarios and explanations, and to reject the core message of the state -“do not let this crime go unpunished..” Once in a while, a defense lawyer can completely reverse the playing field and use binaries against the state. The classic example is the O.J. Simpson murder trial where the jury was told “If the glove doesn’t fit, you must acquit!”<br><br> In the end, the thaumaturge who presents the most convincing “illusion” prevails. I use the word “illusion” because it is very rare that either side in a criminal case actually knows all of the facts, or is able to produce only unbiased witnesses. A highly skilled trial lawyer can in fact create a nearly impenetrable illusion - it is truly instructive to watch one work. In the days before television and such, local courthouses were packed whenever their was an interesting trial and the proceedings were the topic of lively conversation in the community.<br><br><a href=#c3050548706802576516 title="comment permalink">10/27/11, 5:30 AM</a><br><br>

And lots to comment about…<br><br><i>As soon as the idea began to attract attention, that first mistake became the opening wedge that admitted a series of marketing campaigns that pitched supposedly “simpler” consumer products to a mostly privileged audience at steep prices.</i><br>Yes! When that magazine “Real Simple” came out, I almost vomited – what a load of marketing crap! And yet I’ve seen it in homes of friends and families, who are entranced by the slick/sleek images and supposedly “helpful” articles… they don’t really want to give up their middle-class lifestyles; they just want manufactured confirmation that they are “trying to simplify”. It’s really disheartening. And I remember when a clothing line called “Ideology” suddenly appeared in ads – again, really disgusted me… by then I was already trying to pull back from the consumer culture.<br><br><i>What Thoreau would have thought of all this, while stepping out of his shack at Walden Pond with an ax in his hand to split firewood in the chill October air, does not bear imagining.</i><br>Are rumors correct that Thoreau actually lived next to a main thoroughfare, a mile from “home” and went home for cooked meals and received throngs of visiting friends? When I read that, I was disappointed in Thoreau, too…<br><br><i>That’s exactly what happened to the New Age movement, which started out as an intriguing attempt to find common ground…</i><br>Yup. I remember that. When the first “New Age stores” showed up, they were small collections of books you couldn’t get otherwheres and handmade items that might help someone in a meditation practice. By the time they got to rooms full of imported crystals, candles, gongs, CDs and glossy books (thousands!), I knew the movement had been co-opted… <br><br><i>It consists, first, of learning to recognize binaries at sight, and second, when a binary is encountered, looking for a third option that will turn the binary into a ternary, a threefold relationship.</i><br>In Jungian practice, it’s described as “holding the tension of the opposites” until the transcendent third appears. That phrase I think more adequate describes the pain that one undergoes when trying to deal with what seem like polarities… if all our binaries where simply mental, it would be much easier – a mental exercise. But so many are emotional (move/stay where you are, divorce/no divorce, whistleblow/keep silent). And the third doesn’t easily appear. I have practiced the Jungian method, and the transcendent third is most often not at all what you can arrive at simply mentally. <br><br><i>it’s that learning the trick of ternary thinking widens your range of options.</i><br>It’s also that each time you “expand” from a set of polarities, your psyche (inner nature) has grown, and matured a bit more… <br><br><i>of course, it’s more like the choice between N and Q; even in the alphabet of contemporary political thought,</i><br>Reminds me that from my 20’s I often wondered what would have happened if they had framed “black vs white” as “brown vs. pink”… <br><br><br><i>If the source is a book, look for the couple of chapters right up front that describe the horrible future we’re going to get, barring a miracle,</i><br>We used to call that “setting up a paper tiger”… as in a false enemy to be destroyed.<br><br><a href=#c1477574483433406491 title="comment permalink">10/27/11, 7:26 AM</a><br><br>

At my friend D's wedding two weeks ago, we learned that the fridge wouldn't hold all the food for the reception. The two immediately apparent options, "let the food stay warm" and "buy a new fridge" were neither really good options. It led immediately to a ternary, "find a way to keep the food cold." And that led to "Lots of big coolers from a camping store, or big coolers from WalMart?" Which wasn't good either... around and around... We finally built temporary coolers out of four spring-loaded yard clean-up bags ($7.00 each) and three bags each of cheap ice ($1.49 a bag) from a nearby convenience store. So, instead of buying an $800 new fridge, or $250 worth of large coolers, we improvised, and solved the problem with around $50 worth of materials. We probably could have gone even cheaper.<br><br>Similarly, in our school's design lab, a group of students built some cloth sound baffles to reduce the echo in the high-ceilinged, hard-walled chamber, out of $4 worth of string, $15 worth of fabric, and $3 of PVC pipe.... all of which would have cost $5000 or more for the sound engineer and his pre-made solutions. <br><br>Last week, @physicsdoc asked what one could gain from the study of magic, and part of it (for me) was this: Increasingly I think about building and making and creating my tools, toys, and entertainment rather than relying on the entertainment of others. And I encourage others to do the same. There's a miniature community of designers and thinkers and tinkerers that's springing up (or let's be honest here — was already here in central CT, but is now more connected as a result of) around the Druid ritual in my living room every six weeks-ish. But it took two years or more of my regular practice — as a magician, as an artist, as a thinker, as a person who refused TV and film —for that mindset to appear in me; and another two years for me to have the confidence to begin to open that mindset to others.<br><br>So Peladan's example from last week of being a light to others is critical, yes. But equally critical (perhaps <i>a priori</i>) is learning to see many options, and not just the first two most obvious choices.<br><br>@rashakor, I'd encourage using the term ternary, because many people think in binary terms — and there is also a group out there trying to make use of the "Third Way" meme as a thaumaturgical weapon. It's not the case that we want people to think of our "Third Way" as the only "Third Way"... it's the case that one wants people to <i>search for the third way</i>, and so wake up from the binary thaumaturgy that's been cast on them — not become the new "better half" of the new dualism. <br><br>I hope I got that right. I may not have. :-)<br><br><a href=#c4270453528679288761 title="comment permalink">10/27/11, 8:55 AM</a><br><br>

But some reading turns up all kinds of interesting bits of trivia.<br><br>Indeed, some theoretical work was done on <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic rel=nofollow>ternary logic</a> in the early 20th century, in the form of ternary logic systems that preceded <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic rel=nofollow>fuzzy logic</a>. <br><br>In terms of actual ternary computers, way back in the 1800s, <a href=http://www.thomasfowler.org.uk/ rel=nofollow>Thomas Fowler</a>, (who incidentally also invented the thermosiphon), made one out of wood. At the time, however, his use of ternary was a step down from Charles Babbage's difference engine, which used decimal (and was consequently massively complicated and impractical).<br><br>More recently, the Russians built a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setun rel=nofollow>functioning digital electronic ternary computer called Setun</a>.

I still use that term to describe our lifestyle. I guess I'm ornery that way.<br><br>I am aware of the term "voluntary poverty," as well, I but haven't adopted it because I don't think I've earned it. I do periodically flirt with it, though. I'm now about three months into a year-long "Buy Nothing New" experiment. This idea is not original to me—I'm following a set of guidelines that I've modeled on <a href=http://sfcompact.blogspot.com/2006/01/new-years-resolution.html rel=nofollow>The Compact</a> of San Francisco. Ironically, I first learned of The Compact several years ago while skimming an article in <i>Yoga Journal</i> (a magazine which I don't like very much). The author made a placating remark to the effect that we don't have to go to such extremes as those folks who are using toilet cloths (washable fabric wipes which replace toilet paper). And I thought, "That doesn't sound all that extreme to me."<br><br>I'll likely return more or less to my usual way of living after this experiment is over. That's partly because it'd be extremely difficult to abstain from purchasing new items indefinitely, but mostly because it feels a bit miserly to me. Among other things, I miss being able to at least occasionally buy a new work by my favorite authors and musicians. Bartering for those items would be a great ternary alternative, except that tends to be impractical when long distances are involved or if needs and/or wants are mismatched.<br><br>Regardless, I still consider the project worth doing for the specific time frame I've set. Exploring the edges of a binary (mindless consumerism vs. a near complete opt-out) helps me determine whether my own middle ground lies where I imagined it to be.

I haven’t seen that happen. You have so far demonstrated a discipline that provides ample reason to have faith in your character. But this is America, after all, so there's always the risk that anybody could sell out at any time.

I have basically no exposure to the culture of legal trials, but your description makes perfect sense. <br><br>Mage, exactly. The numerical scales in Agrippa (and in other works by mages of the same period) were meant precisely for that purpose -- to teach the student to move from one set of abstract world-models to the other. <br><br>Robert, thank you. If I could convince even a small minority of readers of this blog to follow the cue of the first line of the chorus of "Spanish Pipe Dream," I'd figure all the effort this blog has taken was well spent. <br><br>Rashakor, binary thinking isn't bad, or limiting; it's simply overused. Thinking in ternaries, in turn, isn't the be-all and end-all, but -- as I explained -- it's a useful trick that makes shifting out of the binary reaction much easier. <br><br>Yupped, well, that's good to hear! Apparently some good did come out of it, then. <br><br>Nano, thanks for the link. <br><br>Mike, no, there are three kinds of people in the world -- those who divide people into two categories, those who don't, and those who find some other option!<br><br>Cathy, well, yes, Walden Pond wasn't out in the middle of the wilderness by any means, and Thoreau did visit his parents now and then. In the context of the time, it was still an interesting experiment. As for the Jungian approach, oh, granted, once complex emotions get tangled up in a binary, getting out of it can be a very painful process. One of the benefits of thinking in ternaries in less charged situations is that the habit makes it a bit easier to see your way out of binaries of the sort you've described. <br><br>Rainbow, thank you! Er -- a breath of <i>hot</i> air? <br><br>Justin, exactly. I compare magic to the martial arts frequently when teaching; it really helps get the point across that this is not just a head trip -- it has to be practiced relentlessly, woven into your nervous system and your body, so that you can respond appropriately at once whenever you need to. As for the financial article, good -- though it's always worth remembering that any ternary option you come up with is only one such option, and there are always others.<br><br>Andrew, thank you. Yes, you got it right. <br><br>Richard, sorry -- I meant us social primates, the ones belonging to the species reading this blog post. <br><br>Fran, thanks for the link. <br><br>William, I suppose not having been raised in a Christian family makes that binary fairly abstract to me. There's also the monotheism/atheism binary, which is far more pervasive these days, and can be neutralized in any number of ways.<br><br><a href=#c6269739845648395316 title="comment permalink">10/27/11, 11:07 AM</a><br><br>

As I was having this mindblock it was as if I was looking into the 'machine' and saw that contrast was the way it worked. Being able to distinquish between shades of grey is harder than high contrast distinctions.<br><br>Although most people think of their conscience as an arbiter of truth or righteousness it also has this bi-nary aspect. It even speaks to the old biblical tale of the fall of man. Eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The good or evil is never a nuanced factor. <br><br>Appeals to peoples 'higher' self or moral nature is also a form of deceptive manipulation. Whenever anyone tries to make an argument like this with me I always tell them I only have one self and they need to go pedal their wares elsewhere. Charitable organizations are especially prone to use this tactic.<br><br>I also am of the opinion that at least in the English language the moral usage of right is confused with something being correct as in logically consistent or factual. <br><br>Being correct in an argument [that is, your evidence is better than your compatriots] is conflated with being morally correct or right. Therefore political arguments become polarized more easily into moral stances. Some groups have even labeled themselves, such as the moral majority.<br><br>This mental binary tendency [probably an artifact of bilateral symmetry]has been over accentuated because it is a form of control of others. Parents start it when they want to control the children's behavior and associate certain behaviors with being 'good' children and punishment or rejection for 'bad' behavior. <br><br>I cringe when I hear someone say 'I follow my conscience' and think, poor baby, if you only knew that it was a cultural artifact and not a guide to right action. <br><br>All of this is not saying that we don't need acculturation but being able to step back and recognize the weaknesses of the system [both the structure of thinking and the culture you find yourself in] is a partial antidote to the worst pitfalls.<br><br><a href=#c645050209494850726 title="comment permalink">10/27/11, 11:09 AM</a><br><br>

Your lack of television is no doubt contributing to your clarity in these matters. I indulge in things like deconstructing media messages mostly for the sake of my own foolish entertainment and for the enlightenment of my children, ages 7 &amp; 8. I well remember sitting in my living room in the early 60’s, watching (b. &amp; w.) television with my mother, who would put up a running critique of the advertisements. Her recurring theme was, “They must think we are stupid.” She missed her calling as an editor for Ad Busters. In some ways, I think it inoculated me. As a counter-incantation, it worked wonders to break the spell. I do the same with my children now, when I’m unable to turn it off for them altogether. From reading your post today I realize I’m introducing the ternary into the whole “buy vs. don’t buy” dichotomy. It is: “Don’t want, or need.” Or, as Ma would have said… <br><br>For others I love, I wish they could see more clearly the perniciousness of the magic being leveled at them. My wife was raised in a small Southern (GA) town, where courting the positive opinions of others was, and largely still is, seen as the best use of one’s time. When you marry that to the gigantic discontentment machine of modern advertising, especially as to the content of the average “woman’s” magazine, you can put yourself (with help) in a box with no lid. You become only as good as you think others consider you to be. This, I am convinced, is the number one crippler of young adults everywhere.<br><br>Your post today also brings me back to one of your recurring themes that has always resonated with me. That is, the nation’s turning away from appropriate technology in the late 70’s and early 80’s, to pursue….what, exactly? I think it was Neil Young who frankly admitted in an interview once that he spent the entire decade of the 1980’s completely bewildered by his (adopted) countrymen. Got that one Neil, for sure. In 1980 I was a newly minted B.A. degree holder from a college just east of you (Carroll County, MD). Given all that I knew then about the probabilities of resource depletion and ecological degradation, the path we were veering onto struck me as completely nuts. And of course, once you have that knowledge, you can’t ever pretend you don’t. That conviction has cost me dearly in my personal relationships over the year, especially for the women who misjudged just how deeply those certainties ran with me. The upshot has been, for over three decades, I am completely and irrevocably unfashionable. <br><br>Which leads me back to your musings on binary thinking.<br><br>When I look back at those days, my lingering memory is of a time when you were constantly being asked to choose between two poles. You could choose to throw your lot in with those who were said to be clinging to the outmoded values of the hippies, or you could get with it, make a bunch of money, buy a snappy disco outfit and join the “winners.” In America, as we all know, it is always about being identified as a winner or a loser, and that is why the magic is so pernicious, isn’t it? I see you as someone earnestly trying to tear down that false dichotomy. Go man.<br><br>Wade<br><br><a href=#c3458680955519675396 title="comment permalink">10/27/11, 12:28 PM</a><br><br>

Trouble is, while it's trivial to robustly sense and generate the two extreme states of some signal, the introduction of a third state adds great complexity to each logic cell, thus increasing materials cost and power dissipation -- none of with which you or I would be on board, I think. :) Functionally speaking, three-valued logic tends to be prone to ambiguity (noise), not a desirable trait in numerical processing, and slow, further increasing the amount of energy per unit work.<br><br>Analog electronic computing machines, however, were quite well developed before ENIAC and for a couple or three decades afterward, eventually carrying their real-time heritage into audio synthesizers as epitomized by the ARP 2600.

It ends up that nothing gets done unless there's something in it for "big bigness": in the financial/insurance/real estate sector, the medical sector, and the so-called content sector, those players large enough to conduct interstate commerce are seeing their interests particularly well cared for lately at the expense of the social welfare they purport to serve.<br><br>I'm greatly enjoying this series.

I thought it was funny -- and wondered if you live in a cold climate, where a bit of additional heat would be welcome. <br><br>Ploughboy, there was a lot of very nasty binary-bzsed thaumaturgy going on in the 80s. That wasn't the only factor at work by a long shot -- the collapse in energy prices was a huge factor, as was the extent to which the Ecotopian left had allowed itself to become dependent on government subsidies -- but it certainly played an important role. <br><br>Marxmarv, thanks for the info on ternary computing. As for fascism, you know, that word actually does have a meaning; it's not simply a generic political snarl, nor is it a synonym for "conservative" -- the Nazi movement was not conservative in any imaginable sense, which is part of why the conspiracies against it that came closest to blowing Hitler to smithereens all came from the right, not the left. Fascism is a very specific kind of politics and, as I pointed out <a href=../../2007/11/fascism-feudalism-and-future.html rel=nofollow>in a post a while back</a>, the current habit of flinging around "fascist" (and "feudal") as all-purpose denunciatory words really isn't helpful. <br><br>Zach, it doesn't take a perfect storm. The basic m.o. of mass thaumaturgy using binaries is to get people locked into a binary, and then pile on the emotional goads until they literally can't think clearly about anything. As for Lewis' comment, though, we'll be getting to that in a bit; Aristotle had some useful things to say along those lines.<br><br>Grrl, er, please do specify which stupid robot you're talking about -- I wondered for a brief moment if you were addressing Cathy in those terms!<br><br><a href=#c697956035453906271 title="comment permalink">10/27/11, 1:29 PM</a><br><br>

There are some people I know, maybe myself at times too, for whom emphasizing ternary thinking can become a problem too, and constantly contemplating the complexity of everything, they create a binary between binary and ternary thinking (I sometimes see this in some academic-types who are good at analyzing things, but can't make a strong position of any kind). For instance, someone who can see multiple sides of an issue, may never be able to take any stand at all, just wallow in the complexity of everything. Certainly there are situations where being caught up in the complexity of everything and not having a strong opinion, can paradoxically become a simplistic stance by default. Sometimes a simple "NO!" (or "YES!") may be the most honest and appropriate response to a situation.<br><br><a href=#c6582808663300738689 title="comment permalink">10/27/11, 1:54 PM</a><br><br>

In order to name something, and express its relationship with something else a mark, or division must be made, or there is simply nothing that can be "talked" (thought) about.<br><br>There are, of course, more, shall we say, impressionistic manifestations of consciousness that I believe would correlate with what you are reaching for with the concept of ternary or nondualistic. I have a quibble with this being an enhancement or outgrowth of a more "primitive" binary mode - perhaps that is not what you meant but it is what such terminology implies.<br><br>I believe this conceptualization is at the root of what trapped Fox to unconsciously create the binary "dualism vs. nondualism" in his reach to escape it.<br><br>Bottom line is that I think that these "modes" exist in tandem - and that the impressionistic form of consciousness is the more primal of the two. It's just that gaining the ability (habit) of rational thought can cause one to "forget" (or demote) the other.<br><br>So, I would say that one does not have to <i>develop</i> this nominal "ternary" awareness, but rather permit it to come to the fore more frequently - to learn to "fall back" on impressionistic observation. This thinking is congenitally incapable of making judgments, and as such is a valuable information source to inform the "talking" part of the mind, which tends to get trapped in concepts that are by definition dead, or stale.<br><br>Of course, none of this contradicts the overall points of your analysis - I hope, rather, that it can be seen as an augmentation.<br><br><a href=#c8924645651021074240 title="comment permalink">10/27/11, 5:53 PM</a><br><br>

I’d heard that the former consisted of mainly either/or argumentation about which of two boxes things fitted into. That same dualism took away from my enjoyment of Zen and the Art of Motor-cycle Maintenance too.

Yes, he lived near town and was not self-sufficient. <br><br>However, I didn't get any impression from Walden that he was claiming to be subsisting fully from the land, in fact he states clearly about the grain he buys. His experiment was never about sustaining himself from the land, and it wasn't the same pressing issue in his day when the majority were small farmers as it is now. That's not to say sustainable farming or wilderness survival wouldn't have been a worthwhile goal at that time, it just wasn't Thoreau's.<br><br>As for criticising him for living close to town, that's just a straw man argument, as he never claims otherwise in Walden. He states that he likes to spend the majority of his time alone, but also writes of his walks around town and his interactions with others. You can spend most of your time alone without being fully isolated.<br><br>Thoreau was demonstrating that it's possible to live a fulfilling life with minimal material things, and how voluntary poverty can actually allow more time to persue other thing, such as his naturalistic and his spiritual work. This is at least as relevant now as it was in Thoreau's time. <br><br>It's striking to me when reading Walden how so much has changed, yet much is the same as well. Thoreau's contemporaries had the same obsession with material wealth as modern America, it's just that fossil fuel affluence has immensely multiplied the toys available. Walden as a way of thinking outside the cultural box and living for something other than material progress is quite relevant today, even though he's not the source to go to for the nuts and bolts of living more sustainably.<br><br><a href=#c6082059029117758461 title="comment permalink">10/27/11, 8:45 PM</a><br><br>

Of course there's a binary dimension to logic, but the binary reaction I've discussed here -- the freezing of thought into a yes/no pattern charged with intense emotion -- isn't a logical process; furthermore, ternary thinking isn't a vague intuitive state, it's a specific practice meant to override a nonrational reaction and free up the reasoning process. <br><br>Stan, not only have I seen the fnords, I'm a properly ordained Chaplin in the Legion of Dynamic Discord; I read <i>Illuminatus!</i> when it first came out, and went through a Discordian phase over the couple of years that followed.

For an arbitrary example, and this was BEFORE you suggested that I sit down with a Tea Party member and do more listening (I may still do that on my upcoming trip to another state), I recently spoke to a Republican whose opinion was something like this:<br><br>"The right wing is ALWAYS RIGHT, because the left NEVER takes responsibility for its own actions, but blames others instead. Obama is the President of not my fault, and we Republicans were right all along, because WE'RE man enough to take responsibility, and YOU aren't."<br><br>I'm paraphrasing, of course, this was months ago.<br><br>So, I attempted to persuade him that in a complex society like ours, EVERYONE (including myself, because I kept asking my parents to buy me videogames as a kid instead of books) had a part to play in contributing to this mess, including the Republicans just as much as Obama since the Republicans angrily declared that they would make Obama a one-termer before he even took office, prioritizing Obama's defeat over the health of the country. I refer of course to Rush Limbaugh "I hope the country will fail so Obama will be out of office" or Mitch McConnell "We must make Obama a one-termer at all costs."<br><br>I thought I was just pointing out the obvious when I said that if you always accuse others of avoiding personal responsibility, and you say you always take it, that's actually a means of AVOIDING (not taking) personal responsibility on your part, because you've egocentrically controlled the debate so that your own criticism is legitimate, while everyone ELSE'S criticism is scapegoating.<br><br>In short, constantly accusing others of "blaming others" IS ITSELF a way of "blaming others," and most Americans, including Democrats (I just chose that one Republican as an arbitrary example), don't understand that. How's that for a mind screw? ^_^<br><br>Or is saying that wrong of me? If it is, please tell me.<br><br>What do you think, John Michael Greer? Have I added to complex understanding to what's going on in this country, or should I not have brought any of this up?<br><br><a href=#c8402029421641298006 title="comment permalink">10/27/11, 9:44 PM</a><br><br>

As an outsider to your system, there doesn't seem to be that great a difference between the policies of the two parties.<br><br>It kind of seems obvious to me, but the two parties don't actually own the electoral system and as much as it may irk them, they do have to go to the polls on a regular basis. You guys are actually in control of that system whether you believe it or not.<br><br>Nothing would improve the political tone and debate in your country than the establishment of a more centerist leaning party. A third choice. I guarantee that it would get the attention of the two main parties who are probably pretty comfortable with each other.<br><br>Sorry, people but I'm dismissing the Tea Party outright because they are a radical fundamentalist off shoot of the Republican party.<br><br>Over here, we have a third choice party in the Greens who control the upper house of Parliament. They tend to have a moderating influence on the legislation passed through Parliament. No bad thing. Rarely does a single party gain control of the lower and upper houses here and usually the outcome for that party is not good because they persue ideological concerns.<br><br>By the way, I'm very excited because a bird is visiting my garden which is not even meant to be in this range. It's a gang gang cockatoo and you can't miss it, because of the bright red head and it also sounds like a really loud squeaky door.<br><br><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang-gang_Cockatoo rel=nofollow>gang gang cockatoo</a><br><br>PS: Much respect John, for fielding and responding to all of the comments that you do.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c2281255014848757981 title="comment permalink">10/28/11, 12:34 AM</a><br><br>

I also read your 2007 post re 'fascism' and 'feudalism' that you pointed to just now.<br><br>The formation of societal 'uber' structures might cause us to think further about the relevance of 'voluntary poverty' in this time, (Wordsworth's 'take' was 'plain living - high thinking'). Persons having hard-won elite skills or specialisms could play an especially important and favourable role, not by 'taking charge' or propagating dubious forms of 'thaumaturgy', but by especially embracing voluntary poverty? I can think of many heart-warming examples where this has worked happily, while consuming minimally, and thereby reducing the 'need' to commandeer the service of others. Not being 'that bothered' or even rejecting with humour 'my wholly deserved rewards' or 'heirarchical status'? Indeed, I am warming myself by reflecting on examples of such just now - don't even need rosy nostalgic or sentimental filters on the end of my nose. There must be caveats of course, and jokes about persons we might otherwise look up to, but generally, the valuable persons I am remembering had grasped that point!<br><br>Seems perhaps a way that in our mass society we could encourage and be encouraged and could expand an existing loveable and valuable tendency?<br><br>Just dreaming!

A growing portion of the American electorate does not identify with either major party and would support a third if it had any prospects.<br><br>Election of the chief executive is separate from election of the legislature. In a Presidential election, a third party only acts as a spoiler. By dividing the votes of relatively like-minded people between one of the majors and the third party, it makes it easier for the other major party to win a majority in the Electoral College.<br><br>This has happened twice in recent years: the Clinton/Bush/Perot election, in which the conservative populist Perot gave the Democrats the victory, and the Nader/Kerry/Bush the Younger election, in which a candidate running to the left of the Democrat produced a near dead heat and the Republican squeaked through.<br> <br>Because of this structural feature, third party presidential campaigns get organized around individuals and don't outlast them. There has not been a significant ideologically based third party in the U.S. since the Great Depression.<br><br>A third party delegation in either house of Congress can make the difference between whether a bill passes or fails. That potentially gives it bargaining power. <br><br>However, when and in what form the bill comes to a vote is controlled by committee chairmen. In order to become a committee chairman, one must either belong to the party with the most members in that house or form a permanent alliance with that party, Senator Bernie Sanders being an example of the latter.<br><br><a href=#c2078358469057607672 title="comment permalink">10/28/11, 2:11 PM</a><br><br>

Many surveys show that it is almost like an addiction, with a short-term benefit leading to long-term unhappiness and remorse. Such viewers say that they would prefer to watch less than they do....<br>At the same time, what happens mentally is as important as what happens physically. Television and related media have been the greatest purveyors and conveyors of corporate and political propaganda in society....America’s TV ownership is almost entirely in private hands, and owners make much of their money through relentless advertising....<br>The same, of course, has happened to politics. American politicians are now brand names, packaged like breakfast cereal. Anybody – and any idea – can be sold with a bright ribbon and a catchy jingle...<br>Many neuroscientists believe that the mental-health effects of TV viewing might run even deeper than addiction, consumerism, loss of social trust, and political propaganda. Perhaps TV is rewiring heavy viewers’ brains and impairing their cognitive capacities....</i><br><br>And he agrees with your “cure”:<br><i>Of course, the best defense is our own self-control. We can all leave the TV off more hours per day and spend that time reading, talking with each other, and rebuilding the bases of personal health and social trust.</i><br><br>I do think neuroscience would discover impairments due to tv (if the PTB allowed such studies to be funded!) – it’s not just a harmless bit of relaxation, IMO.<br><br><a href=#c2804421154262072990 title="comment permalink">10/29/11, 7:05 AM</a><br><br>

I will go back and read all of Walden (now that I’m almost done Glass Bead Game). I generally criticize “preachers” to the same extent that they are criticizing others – ie: if they are railing against others’ behavior, then their behavior had better be exemplary! If they are compassionate toward others, then I am less critical... and it’s mostly criticism of the hypocrisy, not the point of views. <br><br>And I certainly agree that you can spend most of your time alone w/o being a full hermit – that’s how I live… days w/o seeing or speaking to anyone, except perhaps to wave at a neighbor from a distance, or to compose a response to a blog. I appreciate the ability to pull back and examine my own semi-conscious thinking and feeling… this is an insistent and intense culture, and w/o distance, it becomes difficult to catch the sneaky thaumaturgy – for me, at least.<br><br><a href=#c2381918707332096939 title="comment permalink">10/29/11, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

I did a fair amount of reading on "occult" matters, mostly in the mid to late 70s, although I didn't adopt any practice. Now it has become apparent that much of what I have done has been the result of the subconscious influence of this reading.<br><br>For instance, I have a mental habit that has grown over the years which I have always regarded as a neurotic mental tic that can be seen an exercise in ternary thinking. It was prompted by a book or pamphlet on numerology that I read in about 1974 that I never believed for a minute. I have also done many things over the years that many would regard as mistakes that have helped to ensure that I wasn't temped by degenerate boomer consumerism. I wonder how much this was a subconscious response of my reading of works influenced by people like G. I. Gurdjieff.<br><br>You should mention to your readers the benefits of pursuing esoteric knowledge in the community of like-minded people as you have done. Many traditions believe that there are dangers in a solitary pursuit.<br><br>Do you have an opinion of Gurdjieff's method? One thing I know is that his followers expect you to give them a whole lot of money.<br><br>I should point out that there is more than one person whose responses appear here under the name "Robert".

The generated amount is seasonal, being highly dependent on snow melt and rainfall. Ten years ago, this was balanced out by importing electricity from the US in bad years, and exporting it to the US in good years. In the past ten years, however, consumption has increased to a point where BC Hydro is importing nearly every year, but rates have not been increased (in fact, for some businesses, they have been cut). As an aside, they have been spending a certain amount of money on energy conservation advertising lately, and this would go a long way to explaining why.<br><br>Now BC Hydro is run as a semi-independent government corporation, with "profits" going back to the provincial government. In the past, to stabilise the cash flow to the government, "deferral accounts" (going into debt) were used to make the "profit" roughly equal in either good or bad years. Now, however, there is no such thing as a good year, but the government needs a stable cash flow from the utility, or they would, presumably, have to increase taxes. At the same time, they don't want the utility to increase its rates, as that would be as unpopular as increasing taxes, and they are hurting for popular support at the moment. So instead, BC Hydro has continued to use the deferral accounts, and is racking up vast debts, which will one day have to be repaid in the form of much <a href=http://www.vancouversun.com/business/Hydro+ploy+hike+costs+users/5627758/story.html rel=nofollow>higher electricity rates at some point in the future</a>. It's a fascinating local study in mortgaging the future for a little bit of comfort today.<br><br>New accounting standards that are supposed to be adopted Canada-wide would stop them from doing this, but the provincial government is considering legislation to exempt the utility from these standards. This is the immediate and real binary at question, but the problem itself is at least ternary, with the government juggling costs back and forth, and ultimately vanishing them into the coat sleeves of costs to future generations while everyone is watching the birdie of increased rates.<br><br>But even more interesting is looking at the comments below the article, where people try very hard to shoehorn the issue into various other widely popular binaries. For instance, proposing that privatising the utility would solve everything (while ignoring the point that a for-profit company with a complete monopoly is the exact opposite of a free market). Another that seems to come up is outrage that the government takes money out of people's rates (while ignoring that the money has to come from somewhere, be that taxes or rates). There are also, of course, plenty of 99% comments, which may have some point to them (the highest paid executives in BC work for public companies like BC Hydro), but also miss the bigger point.<br><br>All in all it makes me agree even more strongly with you about the future of North America. Judging from this issue and the general response, when the reckoning comes, it will be a very serious shock to a lot of people.<br><br><a href=#c2129539369083735207 title="comment permalink">10/29/11, 10:49 AM</a><br><br>

This is indeed not about rejecting the dual thinking, but setting it aside sometimes. Fran’s video suggests that the two brain hemispheres play a different role in this, hmmm, duality. One morning this week,<br>after listening to Paul McKenn’s hypnotic tapes, I distinctly felt the hemispheres differently - a funny sensation.<br><br>Allying with most of the compliments, I wish to back marxmarv’s remark about yet another political equivalence in your text. In R.A. Wilson’s terms, those standard equivalences of political sides are just opinions inside your head; the correspondence with the outside could be better and less lazy. I would say that what the Republicans are doing is more or less the straightforward thaumaturgy than many know in some way or other. The Democrats are practicing methodical betrayal, spending their public capital in dishing everything they are supposed to stand for. The 99% movement just shows how many unforced concessions they made in the last decades. My “theory of everything” for the last 30 years is summed up in one word: corruption. One party follows unabashedly the dictate of some part of 1% (that just amassed the share of financial power beyond any proportions known to humankind perhaps), while the other tries to make stronger opposing appearances for as long as possible while doing the same dirty droppings. Neither role looks attractive, for sure. But what repeated equivalences do is they relieve the latter party from any pressure to live up to their pledges. No one in politics is left to question the ridiculous dualism capitalism-or-socialism. Ha, if Obama is indeed a socialist, then Nixon was even more so, and there was not THAT much difference between the Cold War sides after all. This dualism (like many others) has the tragical consequence that many perfectly good ideas are being cheaply rejected and distorted, probably for a long time.<br><br><a href=#c8968772888970554684 title="comment permalink">10/30/11, 7:26 AM</a><br><br>

As I learned while painting watercolor, sometimes your mistakes end up being the best part of the painting if you learn to take advantage of them.<br><br>Interesting that you brought up the false binary of monotheism / atheism. How do the Hindus feel about that, eh? That reminds me of a funny example of ternary thinking that a friend of mine in college used on a fundamentalist Christian preacher. Unfortunately for the preacher, my friend had just gotten out of philosophy class where he was studying Existentialism. So, when the preacher confronted my friend with the binary question “DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD OR NOT?”, my friend immediately replied, “It doesn't matter, because either way we are still free.” <br><br>Actually, as an atheist, that does really describe how I feel – I'm an atheist who thinks that the question of the existence of God doesn't really matter that much – I think we are all obligated to act morally whether God exists or not, whether we're rewarded or not for doing so – acting morally is it's own reward. So if someone is a sincere Christian and that helps them act in a truly moral fashion, I respect that. The biggest fault I find with (some) Christians (and many believers in other religions, such as Islam) is the belief that theirs is the only path to God, or putting it another way, the only way anyone should live. Of course, many atheists fall into this trap as well, and it took me some time to get out of it. I was helped by – you guessed it – seeing the example of people who tried to quietly live as true Christians rather than run their mouths about their piety.<br><br>I'm in my mid 40s, so by the time I heard of the New Age movement, it had already degenerated into marketing theme marked by an unintelligible mishmash of ideas coupled with a vague, (and seemingly to this skeptically-inclined engineer) unjustified giddy optimism. But I was able to see how astonishingly quickly the Voluntary Simplicity ethos was changed into a marketing scheme, despite the ludicrousness of buying more stuff in order to live simply. Same idea as “Buy these expensive products in order to save the environment.” Reminds me of my response to an acquaintance who was puzzling over her task to write up how a new luxury resort would be environmentally sustainable for a marketing brochure - “That's easy – don't build it, and it will be sustainable.”<br><br><a href=#c8337630174598974532 title="comment permalink">10/30/11, 9:09 AM</a><br><br>

For example, when reading one of Sharon Astyck's blog posts about how feminism predictably resulted in lifestyle changes consistent with more consumption and consumerism (two- and three-car families, outsourcing of more and more daily tasks such as food preparation and childcare from inside the home to outside the home, basically, the commodification of the family life), it struck me that that outcome is what cultural conservatives are talking about with their concern over the demise of the family, though they may not realize it. Now to be clear, I think the cure is not to go back to the nuclear family model of the 1950s, but for everyone to start tilting the work / home balance back to home. And many conservatives would probably agree with me – while they may promote the 1950s family as the ideal, in reality they are quite proud of their daughters' career achievements.<br><br>Same with your observation about how liberals promote policies that damage the working class. For example, the (elitist) liberal stance on illegal immigration. First, they use a bit of transparent thaumaturgy by calling illegal immigrants “undocumented workers,” like they are victims of some kind of clerical mistake instead of more accurate terms like “modern-day slaves.” And then dressing up the exploitation of illegal immigrants as some kind of broadminded charitable exercise, instead of a means of keep working-class wages at brutally low levels while incidentally adding to our overpopulation problem in the process. I remember clearly my reaction to hearing an National Public Radio commentator making the tired claim that Americans don't want to work as nannies and lawn-mowers. My first reaction was the thought that I know of no one personally who has a nanny. My second reaction was to ask how then my neighborhood has somehow produced a long succession of white teenaged boys who will carefully cut your lawn and trim the bushes for a reasonable price. <br><br>Regarding the OWS protestors and the comparison to communists, one tactic that has worked pretty well with my conservative friends is to point out that the biggest threat to free markets in the US are not the protestors or the government in and of itself, but large corporations, which do whatever they can including gross political manipulation to eliminate competition and lock up markets. <br><br>Finally, speaking of fallacies, another fallacy I see quite often in the political realm is “arguing the consequent.” For example, I'm an advocate of building out a decent passenger rail network in the US as a means of reducing CO2 emissions and preserving long distance travel in a future where high oil prices bankrupt the airlines and put air travel out of reach of all but the rich. Inevitably, the argument comes back that “America is too big for rail travel – people won't stand having to travel for two days to get across the country.” But wait – wasn't I just making the point that air travel will be out of reach? Sometimes, how much you want something has no bearing on how available it is. Besides, this response ignores that rail networks held the US together from the 1870s to the 1950s quite well.<br><br>Hey, it goes without saying but I'll say it anyway – another great essay. By the way, I find that it often is easier to write my comment in a word processor, then cut and paste it into Blogger. That way it can't log you out.<br><br><a href=#c1134706957328221776 title="comment permalink">10/30/11, 9:11 AM</a><br><br>

My best guess, without devoting hours of research to this topic, is that even though the term "voluntary simplicity" has been around a while, it began to surge in popularity only in the 80's. A book by Duane Elgin helped to revive it in 1981. In what I'm sure was a completely unintended consequence, glossy new catalogs like Gaiam started to pop up by the late 80's and early 90's. The term "ethical consumerism" entered popular use in 1989. And so, within a few short years, "voluntary simplicity" came to be widely regarded as a business opportunity.<br><br>I ran out of time yesterday to look for Gregg's essay (I've put myself on a digital diet, along with everything else). <a href=http://www.soilandhealth.org/03sov/0304spiritpsych/030409simplicity/SimplicityFrame.html rel=nofollow>It's here</a>. I haven't quite finished reading it myself, but it's not extremely long, and you might enjoy it. He even references Toynbee. Here's one quote which might be relevant to your past few posts:<br><br><i>"To those who say that machinery and the apparatus of living are merely instruments and devices which are without moral nature in themselves, but which can be used for either good or evil, I would point out that we are all influenced by the tools and means which we use. Again and again in the lives of individuals and of nations we see that when certain means are used vigorously, thoroughly and for a long time, those means assume the character and influence of an end in themselves. We become obsessed by our tools."</i><br><br>I'm afraid I'm having a minor identity crisis because I've long considered myself a practitioner of voluntary simplicity, and I can't seem to find a better term for it. The way it's now used in the mass media, though, is definitely quite different from my own understanding of it. It's frustrating. I think you are wise to stick with less popular words.<br><br><a href=#c1810710965960880917 title="comment permalink">10/31/11, 8:40 AM</a><br><br>

In contrast, I think it took them longer to demolish Voluntary Simplicity because, during the 1980s and 1990s when simplicity became something of a trend, people were working longer hours at less satisfying jobs and questioning whether they in fact wanted to live their lives that way. Simplicity, as a means of buying and needing less, allowed for the possibility of working fewer hours. How could a company sell something that would allow a person to work fewer hours?<br><br>The book Confronting Consumption, edited by Thomas Princen, Michael Maniates, and Ken Conca, includes a chapter on the voluntary simplicity movement. Maniates, the author of that chapter, notes the popularity of the movement during the late 1990s by discussing what scholar Rich Hayes describes as the first national gathering of the voluntary simplicity movement, held in September 1998 at USC. What surprised Hayes and Maniates about the gathering (both attended it) was first of all the astonishingly huge attendance, close to 1,200 people despite limited advertising. They had expected something closer to 200 people. <br><br>What also surprised them was that Kalle Lasn, publisher of Adbusters, drew the only standing ovation of the day by speaking powerfully about both the need to simplify one’s one life and to work collectively to change the larger structures that make it difficult to simplify. Maniates had spent a number of previous pages discussing what he saw as the apolitical nature of the movement, its emphasis on personal restraint rather than on challenging structural and sustainability issues. He hadn’t realized that people involved in the movement did, in fact, see challenging the structural issues as part of what they were doing - but they couldn’t do much about the larger issues till they’d managed to free up some time and space from the work-and-spend cycle they felt caught in.<br><br>It may be worth noting that the book was published in 2002.<br><br><a href=#c3022281130083741607 title="comment permalink">10/31/11, 9:50 AM</a><br><br>

When I was in my associate's degree nursing program, I was required to take a class on "critical thinking". I nearly failed it, mostly because for me they broke the process down so far that it no longer made meaningful sense to me, and also because there was something about it that just seemed 'wrong.' Like I can't put my finger on this but it's not logical to do it this way kind of wrong. <br><br>I finally realized what it was - it was the process (for me at least) of taking someone who does NOT think in binary forms and forcing them to do so. <br><br>My *not* thinking in binary was subject for comment during my bachelor's program research/critical thinking class, mainly because what I wanted to know was who funded the research - for me that would tell me more, or at least as much, about the validity of the research than the raw statistics would. And while my approach was frowned on, it was generally agreed that funding HAS to become a recognized part of evaluating research due to the massive problems with fraud that are acknowledged to be present. <br><br>Slightly off topic, I am sad to report that, while I apparently did an OK job of teaching my children not to think in binary, I did not do a good enough job (or I didn't teach them to think critically well enough, not sure which). My middle son has gotten involved in a multilevel marketing scheme. I am not sure how to handle this. Any ideas would be appreciated. My only idea so far has been to research the company, the upper level staff, and their claims regarding the ingredients.

Nowadays, we all work for money and spend money to buy everything we need. But 75 years ago, my grandmother only participated in the money economy by selling eggs and butter on the weekend in the county seat. Otherwise, they grew their own food and made their own soap and clothes. Now, I'm not saying that 1935 in the American South was better. What I do suggest to my listeners is that our current environment is way more unnatural than we realize, and, if they look around, they can see for themselves that it's not working for most people - everyone's stressed over money, everyone's time is fully taken with work, shopping, and family obligations, many people have to carve out time for the basic exercise everyone needs, and no one has time for creativity. <br><br>Just a simple conversational point that does seem to work to get people reconsider the idea that what is now is what always was or what should be - a way to get the fish to realize it's living in a sea of water.<br><br><a href=#c256608694279140163 title="comment permalink">10/31/11, 4:49 PM</a><br><br>

We don't describe ourselves as Voluntary Consumers or Voluntary Shoppers. Granted those things could be argued to be much less voluntary than choosing simplicity, but my point is, freedom of choice is assumed.<br><br>Voluntary seems to be trying to indicate a chosen path. Is it important to assert our path is chosen to separate ourselves from the run-of-the-mill poor folks? We are shabby by choice!<br><br>And then Simplicity. Except for a very few people who have a neurological disorder, I doubt many of us yearn for simplicity. We yearn for freedom from expectations, freedom from bills, freedom from work, independence from messy houses, liberation from chores. Do we say all those things because we really want more time to read books? That is a positive statement of desire--read more books. Maybe swim in the ocean every day. <br><br>Some might even disagree with a desire to be free. "After enlightenment, chop wood and haul water." So chores can be seen as a necessary part of a life well lived. Of course, that doesn't mean all the Buddhist monks are tagging their pictures in Facebook and assigning custom ringtones to each friend in their cellphone's address book. Some chores are just too much...<br><br>So maybe rather than saying we practise Voluntary Simplicity, we could say we are Buddhists, or snorkelers, or writers, or readers. Heck, just call yourself an artist.<br><br><a href=#c5271155563653087781 title="comment permalink">10/31/11, 10:20 PM</a><br><br>

The National Institute of Oceanography and Experimental Geophysics, which is running a two-day workshop here, thinks oil science will remain relevant for a while yet.<br><br>''A couple of years ago, it was estimated that world oil supplies would last 130 years,'' explained Italian geophysicist Aldo Vesnaver, who spends six months a year teaching Saudi researchers new extraction techniques. ''They will last longer. However, it is in speculators' interests to stoke public perception that oil is about to run out (in order to raise prices)''. The estimates are based on existing oil reserves, but multinationals are still prospecting for new oilfields, because privately produced oil supplies, not national ones, are running out, explained Vesnaver, who is presenting a new technique for measuring underground deposits thanks to micro earthquakes.<br><br>''Oil is produced using two wells, one for extraction and one for pumping high pressure water,'' he explained.<br><br>''This causes tiny fractures in the rock, which can be sounded out using highly sensitive seismographs. Studying these subterranean creaks can tell us a lot about the size of the deposit.'' The same technique can be used to measure how much gas can be pumped from a deposit. Researchers from around the world, including Brazil, France, Pakistan, Slovakia, Saudi Arabia and the United States, are attending the workshop, as well as representatives from the National Iranian South Oil Company and Saudi Aramco. Another hot topic is hydrated gas. Made essentially of frozen methane, it is capturing worldwide scientific attention, because it could be the key to an almost inexhaustible new natural gas supply.<br> <br>http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2011/09/01/visualizza_new.html_729652274.html<br><br><a href=#c4500682437529600858 title="comment permalink">11/1/11, 12:36 PM</a><br><br>

Glad to hear of your steps toward a less mediated life, too. <br><br>Grrl, it's not merely nonsense, it's meretricious nonsense. It's amazing what codswallop the media will print. All the factors they've named in the article have been taken into account in peak oil analyses for years. <br><br>Hal, I prefer to do business with people who don't think that their religion justifies denying me the freedom to practice mine. The vast majority of the fundamentalist Christians with whom I've discussed the matter insist that pagan nature religions should not be protected by Constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion; the excuses vary but the sentiment remains the same, and I see no point in buying goods and services from people who will donate part of my money to churches that want to take my rights away. <br><br>The great majority of Christians, by contrast, understand that their freedom of religion depends ultimately on everyone having that freedom, or simply grasp the point of the old adage "live and let live."

One of the early posts by Derv really struck a nerve with me. <br><br>DERV Said <br><br><i><br>I know that you covered this in your previous essay talking about how appealing to nonrational desires is uniquely unsuited for achieving a rational effect. But call me an elitist, I have always considered rational humanity to be a small subset of the general populace. Our efforts in the US, over the course of two hundred years of trying to create an informed, politically rational populace, have failed miserably (though you may argue thaumaturgy has much to do with that).<br><br>It's not that I don't admire the idea of everyone behaving rationally; rather, I agree that it is by far the best option if it were doable. I just think that it's wildly, wildly unrealistic to think you'd ever have more than a small minority of people actually thinking and acting rationally. These concepts are fairly deep, even if intuitively grasped, and as you've said they need to be more than simply conceived of to have an effect.<br></i><br><br>I see the knowledge I gain personally as being secondary to how to move society at large toward awareness of the entrapment of binary thinking and mass psychosis. The past posts on television only underscores this. <br>Like Derv I don't want to sound elitist but a huge segment of the population isn't ever going to grasp what we discuss here which means that without some attempt at "benevolent control" we are doomed. And this raises the question of to what purpose do we as individuals gain the knowledge of the mechanisms that influence society into dysfunction if we don't apply these to having a better control of the narrative. <br><br>Ultimately wont thaumaturgy inevitability be applied? Don't we have to set boundaries of consumption and population for example within a dogma of some future theology or societal taboos? <br><br>Simply because there always will be that 70% 0r greater of society that will not question authority and the status quo and who will choose to stay asleep.<br><br>Once again, what a wonderful thread and community here contributing to this most enlightening topic.

It was only intended to force me into black vs. white thinking in a concrete way. I had great difficulty with it because there is ALWAYS a line of grey between black and white. And an infinite number of shadings within that grey. The course did not allow for the grey at all, let alone all the shadings within it. It was a most disappointing start to nursing school. I was thankful when it was over.<br>And believe me, I have a natural gift for visualizing things running their natural course to the final outcome in an instant, which since I do NOT have the gift of tact means that I tend to really p!$$ people off when they try to foist their ideas on me (especially overbearing low level managers). They don’t want to know that their logic is flawed, they don’t want to know there’s another option, they just want people to follow along. <br>JMG, you are so very right! My grandparents were the middle class success story – children of large families, lived through the depression, made good in the fifties. They often had cardboard covering the holes in the soles of their shoes when they were young but they always had books. That love of books and reverence for classical literature is one of the things they passed on to me. I grew up reading basically anything I could get my hands on, from pulp fiction to Aristotle. My mother was a master debater; she would make us argue a point to exhaustion and then make us argue the very point we were just defending against! I used to absolutely HATE that about her but looking back it was some of the best training in logic I could have gotten. I think these two things were what gave me the basic grounding in critical thinking – becoming an adult and a parent is what brought it to flower though. <br>I don’t patronize those businesses either, and for the same reasons. I am lucky though in that there *are* other places to shop that don’t necessarily involve big box stores. <br>CE, thank you for the links. I don’t hold out much hope at this point; his brother and sister in law as well as his wife are all completely involved and that is how he got involved. I told him it was like a religion and he actually agreed with me. And worse yet, he was OK with that! I guess he needed a community. Too bad he chose one that will only impoverish him, both spiritually and monetarily.<br><br><a href=#c3975882665930165111 title="comment permalink">11/2/11, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

Have you ever thought that perhaps there is no box at all?" The increasing energy put into binary thinking in the past decade and more has been increasingly distressful to me, because it seems this emphasis is what keeps us from coming to any kind of practical solution to the problems facing us.

Take any political debate you care to name; inevitably, there are possible choices more extreme than either of the two sides, as well as choices in the space in between, and still other choices that aren’t in the same continuum at all. Ternary thinking helps you pop out of the binary mode long enough to see this.</i><br><br>I could draw another parallel between this way of thinking and negotiation or bargaining advice. One of the tricks mentioned over and over again in http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/negotiation.html for example is: if the conflict seems to be binary/ zero-sum (you get more = I get less), find a way to bring more terms to the table. In mathematical terms if we're arguing over how to divide a fixed pie (http://books.google.com/books?id=XkyNgU3oK0wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bargaining+theory&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q8bwUfr_LpWw4AOMkoCYBw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bargaining%20theory&amp;f=false) then I'm looking for an orthogonal dimension to add in so hopefully the conflict will not be head-to-head.<br><br>I think you can see this in the choice of party planks (http://books.google.com/books?id=q3h_M3QI7OYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=persson+tabellini&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g8bwUeasAsPE4APllYH4CA&amp;ved=0CDAQuwUwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=dimension&amp;f=true) as well, although in a 2-party system with perfect knowledge of voter preferences it becomes about choosing which combination of dimensions can be credibly brought together to create the right majorities across voting districts (president, congressional districts,etc) i.e. defining new binaries and Jenga-like fitting a platform together, whereupon you and your opposite party are going to (Binarily) box each other.<br><br><a href=#c7482626787566524143 title="comment permalink">7/24/13, 11:36 PM</a><br><br>

Being stuck in second gear is limiting to greater speed in a car. Likewise, being stuck in binary thought mode is limiting to greater opportunities and awareness as a thinking species. The advantages of ternary thinking are mainly protective to the individual with respect to social thinking and can then lead to greater acceptance and adoption by the whole due to the demonstrated superiority of the nature of it with respect to certain more advanced and complex aspects of human social life.<br><br><a href=#c4242182647912975377 title="comment permalink">7/27/14, 8:50 AM</a><br><br>
