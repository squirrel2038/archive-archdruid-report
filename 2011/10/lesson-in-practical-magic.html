Up to this point in our discussion of the intersection between peak oil and magic, we’ve mostly talked about what doesn’t work. That couldn’t be avoided, since the misunderstandings of magic that run barefoot through contemporary culture have to be dealt with before it’s possible to make sense of anything more substantive.<br><br>Still, I hope that by this time my readers have grasped that magic is not a substitute for technology, a way of making an end run around environmental limits and the laws of physics, or for that matter a means of forcing society as a whole to deal constructively with the rising spiral of crises that dominates the emergent history of our time. It’s an old and subtle craft that deals with the interface between consciousness and the universe of our experience, using the buttons and levers of the nonrational mind; it has remarkable potentials for good and ill; and some of those potentials have quite a bit to offer in the face of peak oil. Now that the misconceptions have been more or less cleared away, we can get down to the details of practical magic.<br><br>There’s a significant parallel between the material we’re about to cover and the “green wizardry” of the Seventies appropriate-tech movement that we discussed at such length a little while back. The key to green wizardry is that it starts with the individual; instead of pursuing vast top-down changes, the organic gardeners and renewable-energy wonks of the Seventies put gardens in their own backyards, solar water heaters on their own roofs, and insulation in their own attics. In the same way, the effective practice of magic begins with the individual student of the art, and works outward from there.<br><br>How to begin, and how to work outward from there, varies from one system of magic to another, and very often from one teacher to another. Since the purpose of this blog is to discuss peak oil and topics related to it, rather than to offer a course in magical training for beginners, I’m going to skip most of the technical details here; those who are interested can find them in the standard textbooks of the art. It’s more useful for the present purpose to give the context in which those details find their place and have their meaning, and that might best be done by introducing you, dear reader, to one of the more colorful figures in the entire history of magic.<br><a href=../../img/alexandreseon-josephin-peladan-14d4a7-g95.jpg onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border=0 id=BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5665400920645161266 src=../../img/alexandreseon-josephin-peladan-32ffcc-g95.jpg style="float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; cursor: pointer; width: 182px; height: 320px"></a><br>If I say that Joséphin Péladan was a French conservative of the 19th century, nearly every person who reads that phrase will misunderstand it; the English-speaking world has never had anything like continental European conservatism, and even in Europe the conservatism of Péladan’s time is all but extinct. If I go on to say that he was one of the leading lights of the Decadent movement in French literature, the author of lushly erotic and wildly popular novels, as well as a dandy and an esthete who out-Gothed today’s Goths a hundred and twenty years in advance, my readers may have some difficulty squaring that with my first comment; and when I go on to explain that he was at one and the same time a devout if eccentric Roman Catholic and a significant figure in the Paris occult scene of his time, I trust I will be forgiven for listening for the distant popping sound of readers’ heads exploding.<br><br>Péladan <a href=../../img/salonrosecroix1892-d89dc5-g95.jpg onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border=0 id=BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5665401376602576402 src=../../img/salonrosecroix1892-31be47-g95.jpg style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 138px; height: 320px"></a>was all of that, and quite a bit more. He’s the man Oscar Wilde was imitating when Wilde went strolling through London in velvet clothes with a drooping lily in his hand. Péladan claimed descent from the ancient Chaldean sages, sponsored a series of Rosicrucian gallery shows that came within an ace of changing the history of Western art, and ran an occult order that had no less a figure than Erik Satie as its official composer. (Fans of Satie’s early music will recall his <i>Sonneries de la Rose+Croix</i>; those were written for the meetings of Péladan’s order.) “Do you know what is meant by the expression ‘That man is a character’? Well, a mage is that above all,” Peladan wrote, and he certainly was.<br><br>All the colorful details, though, were in the service of an utterly serious purpose. Péladan belonged to that minority of late 19th century thinkers who recognized that the European societies of their day were headed for disaster. More clearly than any of his contemporaries, he understood that what was facing collapse was not simply political or economic, but the entire cultural heritage—aristocratic, Christian, Latinate—that linked the Europe of his time with its historic roots in the ancient world. What set him apart from the sentimental conservatives of his time and ours, though, is that he recognized that this heritage was already past saving. “We do not believe in progress or in salvation,” his <i>Manifesto of the Rose+Cross</i> announced to a mostly bemused Paris in 1891. “For the Latin race, which goes to its death, we prepare a final splendor, to dazzle and make gentle the barbarians who are to come.”<br><br>His work as an operative mage and a cultural figure focused on that theme with the frantic intensity of a man who knows he’s going to lose. His core work of magical theory and practice, <i>Comment on devient mage</i> (<span style="font-style: italic">How To Become A Mage</span>, 1892), contains not a single magical ritual. Its theme, to borrow a typically ornate term from his writing, was ethopoeia—the making (poesis) of an ethos, one that would enable individuals to stand apart from the collective consciousness of their time in order to think their own thoughts and make their own choices. “Society,” Péladan wrote, “is an anonymous enterprise for living a life of secondhand emotions”—and the particular emotions on offer, as he discussed in some detail, are not picked at random. Ioan Culianu’s description of modern industrial societies as “magician states” that rule by manufacturing a managed consensus by the manipulation of nonrational lures would have been music to Péladan’s ears.<br><br>His unwavering focus made <i>How To Become A Mage</i> the most detailed text of its time on the fine art of freeing the individual will, sensibility, and understanding from bondage to unthinking social reactions. It was very much a book of its era, full of references to current events, and it also uses the utterly Péladanesque strategy of infuriating the reader by poking as many of those social reactions as possible. Liberal, conservative, radical or reactionary, every reader of Péladan’s treatise could count on finding a good reason to throw it at the nearest wall, and the effect would be even stronger today, since the cultural differences between Péladan’s time and ours would step on a whole new layer of sore toes. In spare moments, I’ve gotten about halfway through making an English translation of <i>How To Become A Mage</i>, but it’s purely a private hobby; it’s hard to imagine a more unpublishable book.<br><br>Still, the same theme appears throughout the literature of the 19th century occult revival. Partly that’s because everybody in the occult scene read Péladan, but it was also because the 19th century saw the emergence of the first generation of effective mass media and the foreshadowings of the mass movements and political thaumaturgy of the century to come. An extraordinary range of magical literature at the time, and right up through the Second World War, assumed as a matter of course that contemporary European civilization was, as we now like to say, circling the drain.<br><br>Whether “the barbarians who are to come” would be domestic or imported was a matter of some discussion—Péladan himself thought that Europe would eventually be conquered by the Chinese, a theory that seems rather less far-fetched today than it did in his time—but very few people in the occult scene doubted that they worked their magic in the twilight years of a dying civilization. Of course they were quite correct; the old cultures of Europe, in every sense Péladan would have recognized, died in the trenches of the First World War; the forty years from Sarajevo in 1914 to Dien Bien Phu in 1954 saw Europe’s nations flattened to the ground by two catastrophic wars, overwhelmed by cultural change, and reduced from the status of masters of the planet to pawns in a game of bare-knuckle politics played with gusto by the United States and the Soviet Union.<br><br>All this made Péladan’s lessons more than usually relevant, because the catastrophe he foresaw had a clear magical dimension. Read contemporary accounts of the way that Europe stumbled into war in 1914 and it’s hard to miss the weirdly trancelike state of mind in the warring nations, as vast crowds cheered the coming of hostilities that would cost millions of them their lives, and left-wing parties that had pledged themselves to nonviolent resistance in the event of war forgot all about their pledges and swung into step behind the patriotic drumbeats. The collective consciousness of the age was primed for an explosion, partly by the thaumaturgy of any number of competing political and economic interests, and partly by the rising pressures of intolerable inner conflicts that, in magician states ruled by a managed consensus, was prevented from finding a less catastrophic form of expression.<br><br>It took an extraordinary degree of mental independence to stay clear of the trance state and its appalling consequences, but that was one of the things the magical training available in those days was intended to do. Péladan was inevitably the most outspoken of the period’s occult writers on this subject, as on so many others, and filled a good many of the 22 chapters of <i>How To Becone A Mage</i> with advice on how to open up an insulating space between the individual mind and the pressures that surround it. Many of the same points, though, are made in quieter ways by other writers of the time, and in the instructional papers of magical lodges of the same period. All this advice is aimed at the social habits of another time and has not necessarily aged well, but the basic principles still stand.<br><br>The first of those principles is to limit and control the channels by which the mainstream media and their wholly owned subsidiary, public opinion, get access to your nervous system. Now of course that raises the hackles of quite a few people nowadays. When I suggested two months back that those who wanted to reclaim some sense of meaning from today’s manufactured pseudoculture might consider pulling the plug on popular culture as a good first step, I fielded the inevitable responses insisting that popular culture was creative, interesting, etc., so why did I have such a grudge against it?<br><br>It was a neat evasion of my point, which is that contemporary mass-produced popular culture exists solely for the purpose of emptying your wallet and your brain, not necessarily in that order. In terms of the classification I’ve suggested in recent posts, popular culture is a vehicle for mass thaumaturgy; it works, as mass thaumaturgy always works, by inducing you to think less and react more. Thus, in the strictest sense of the word, it makes you more stupid. I don’t think any of us can afford that right now.<br><br>One point Péladan made that remains valid today is that spending time among a crowd of people whose minds and conversation are utterly conditioned by popular culture is not noticeably different from getting your popular culture firsthand. If anything, it’s even more of an issue these days than it was in his; I suspect most of us have had the experience of hearing a conversation between two people in which every single word spoken was a sound bite from some media source or other. There’s no need to become a hermit, but it’s a good idea to choose your crowds with some care.<br><br>Steps such as these will cut down on the influence that the mass thaumaturgy of our time has over your thoughts, feelings, and decisions. Still, the empty space has to be filled with something better, or there won’t be much of an improvement; this is the second of the principles I mentioned earlier. That’s the perennial mistake of Romanticism, the notion that all you have to do is fling aside the fetters of social expectations and do what comes naturally. The problem here is of course that “what comes naturally” to every one of us is the product of a lifetime spent absorbing social cues from the people around us and the media directed at us, all of which triggers a set of unthinking and unconscious reactions we share with our nonhuman relatives: social primate see, social primate do.<br><br>Being who he was, and living when he did, Péladan phrased that dimension of the work in terms of art, music and literature, and that’s certainly one of the available options. If you happen to be a dandy and an esthete, and live in a city with good art galleries, concert venues, and the like, you could do worse than to follow his recommendations—he was particularly partial to Renaissance paintings, German classical and romantic music from Bach through to Wagner, and Shakespeare’s plays—but I don’t recommend copying him and Oscar Wilde and strolling down the streets with a lily in your hand. Their wives clearly had to put up with a lot. (You didn’t know that Wilde was married, did you? Her name was Constance; she was an initiate of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the most influential magical order in late 19th century Britain; and yes, she did have to put up with a lot.)<br><br>Still, that’s only one option, and the last thing you should do in this sort of practice is rely on someone else’s notions of what ought to feed your mind. “’Fear the example of another, think for yourself,’” wrote Péladan; “this precept of Pythagoras contains all of magic, which is nothing other than the power of selfhood.” As I suggested in <a href=../../2011/08/twilight-of-meaning.html>the earlier post</a> mentioned a few paragraphs back, the important thing is simply to choose things to read, watch, hear, and do that you consider worthwhile, instead of passively taking in whatever the thaumaturgists-for-hire of the media and marketing industries push at you. What falls in the former category will vary from person to person, as it should.<br><br>All this seems relatively straightforward, and indeed it’s quite possible to get to the same decision by plain reasoning starting, say, from the shoddy vulgarity of mass-produced entertainments, and going from there to the realization that there’s much more interesting mind food to feast upon. That making such choices also makes it easier to think clearly would in that case be merely a pleasant side effect of good taste. The operative mage in training does the same thing deliberately, not just to think clearly but to feel and will clearly as well. As the training proceeds, however, those effects begin to reveal another side, which is their effect on other people.<br><br>Péladan hinted at this effect in <i>How To Become A Mage</i>, though custom in the occult scene back in his time didn’t favor spelling out the details. “Do not look for another measure of magical power than that the power within you, nor for another way to judge a being than by the light that he sheds To perfect yourself by becoming luminous, and like the sun, to excite the ideal life latent around you—there you behold all the mysteries of the highest initiation.” What he did not quite say is that “the ideal life latent around you” is in other human beings, and that—especially in times of cultural crisis—stepping outside the lowest common denominator of the mass mind has an effect rather like induction in electrical circuits; put another way, it can be as catchy as a lively new tune.<br><br>You can catch that tune, so to speak, from a person; you can catch it from a book, which is why Péladan wrote his 22 novels, each of them exploring some aspect of the relation between the initiate and a corrupt society; you can catch it from other sources, the way Rainier Maria Rilke did from a statue of Apollo; you can also catch it all by yourself, by climbing out of collective consciousness for some other reason and discovering that you like the view. Now of course far more often than not, those who step out of the collective consciousness of their society promptly jump back into the collective consciousness of a congenial subculture, which from a magical perspective is no better—thinking the same thoughts as all your radical friends is just as much secondhand living as is thinking the same thoughts as the vacuous faces on the evening news—but there’s always the chance of getting beyond that, and some subcultures make it easier to get beyond that than others.<br><br>Does this seem vague and impractical? If so, dear reader, I would encourage you to glance back over the history of the peak oil movement. Fifteen years ago, next to nobody anywhere was talking about the hard fact that global oil production was approaching hard planetary limits. Ten years ago, there were people talking about it, but they were voices in the wilderness dismissed by all right-thinking people. Five years ago, the idea that an archdruid would take an active part in a national and international conversation on the future of industrial society might have made a great idea for a comedy skit. This year—or, more precisely,a few weeks from now—the archdruid in question will be speaking at <a href=http://www.aspo-usa.org/conference/2011/ >ASPO-USA’s annual conference in Washington DC</a>, practically in the shadow of the Capitol. Five, ten, and fifteen years from now? We’ll see.<br><br>Many factors contributed to the remarkably fast rise of the peak oil movement, to be sure. Still, from the perspective of an operative mage, it’s hard to argue against the idea that the induction effect Péladan didn’t quite mention—the magical equivalent, to be precise, of personal example—had at least some role in it. As for the deeper implications and applications of that effect—well, here again, that’s a subject for next week’s post.<br><br>*****************************<br><br>On a note that Péladan would have appreciated, I’m delighted to announce that <i>Rise &amp; Fall</i>, a modern dance piece choreographed by Valerie Green and performed by DanceEntropy, will have its premiere at the Baruch Center in New York City on January 20-22, 2012. Regular readers will remember that <i>Rise &amp; Fall</i> is partly inspired by my book <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/L/The-Long-Descent>The Long Descent</a>. Further information about <i>Rise &amp; Fall</i> and its companion piece, <i>Inexplicable Space</i>, can be found <a href=http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/project/rise_fall_inexplicable_space>here</a>. I’d encourage any of my readers who will be in the NYC area then, and enjoy modern dance, to take it in.

In the Golden Dawn system, where I had my original training, Israel Regardie's <i>Foundations of Practical Magic</i> and <i>Ceremonial Magic</i>, Gareth Knight's excellent little books <i>Occult Exercises and Practices</i> and <i>The Practice of Ritual Magic</i>, and Dion Fortune's <i>The Mystical Qabalah</i> are pretty standard, though other operative mages would probably have their own lists; I might throw in <i>Learning Ritual Magic</i>, which I cowrote with Clare Vaughn and Earl King Jr, and is the text I use for personal students who don't have a lot of previous experience. Druid magic -- well, there's very little in print; most orders keep their magical work very private, though AODA has broken away from that a bit with my <i>The Druidry Handbook</i> and <i>The Druid Magic Handbook</i>. Other systems, you'd have to ask somebody who's studied them.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c762685610852004343 title="comment permalink">10/19/11, 8:23 PM</a><br><br>

(Yes, the irony of sending this from my glowing screen to yours is not lost on me.)

It might work alright for some persons in some places, but be unproductive for others.<br><br>I come from Iceland for example. Our society is very close-knit and family ties are highly valued. Cutting ties would be hard. Since it is also a small society (relatively few people), there isn't the social diversity for one to conveniently pick the exact subculture that matches one's personal views, and there's no guarantee the subcultures aren't ruled by "baboons" as you put it so nicely. I've gone down this road myself and I sensed it only led to personal misery - even though I'm a fairly independent thinker and introverted person.<br><br>I believe that by divorcing your immediate "mainstream" society you reduce your possibilities of influencing it. I feel mentally "strong enough" to resist the thaumaturgy even while paying attention to what it's saying and therefore what may be going on in the minds of the "mass" around me.<br><br>But that said, considering the state of mass society in the United States, perhaps you're perfectly right in that context and I just need to adjust my interpretation to what's appropriate to my own place and what's not.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c1001256787378389963 title="comment permalink">10/20/11, 4:39 AM</a><br><br>

For whatever reason, this has been a focus of much of what I've done. It is so hard to think, to see, to understand with all the noise. At first I thought I could absorb it and it would have no effect because I had caught on, but this is almost impossible to maintain. Blocking it out is also required, both by simply shutting it off when possible and by means of your own defenses when not. In all things one must be active in seeking out experiences of value, and not afraid to make such judgments for one's self. Passivity just leaves you open for someone else to insert their thoughts for their own reasons (usually profit or power in our society). <br><br>Replacing the noise of popular culture, once you've got past the icky feeling that you're doing something wrong, that you're weird and strange, opens you up for a lot of joy discovering new things. I have discovered some great authors (obviously), some wonderful music, found satisfaction in connecting and understanding things that had long confounded me either consciously or not. The internet is a major source of noise, but it's too good of a resource to resist, so I use it a lot while it still functions. I find that there is a small community of sorts that has formed around the Peak Oil meme, both of authors and some commenters, and often people who I've grown to respect have contributed worthwhile ideas and views, and spurred research in interesting new areas.<br><br>It does take time to build a useful distance and to fill the void with knowledge. But you don't have to flaunt it in everyone's faces or to adopt all sorts of affectations. It is not necessary for everyone to know all your thoughts. There will be moments when you can make a connection to others - open up someones' eyes to a different viewpoint or receive that from them, help someone gain an understanding, or just discover someone else who understands and enjoy the company. And ultimately, use that wisdom to make better choices. That is enough.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c441581814144475447 title="comment permalink">10/20/11, 5:46 AM</a><br><br>

I still remain friends with lots of people (well, for me, about 10-15 or so) from all periods of my cultured/social life in the sense meant here; from football college kid, to corporate deck hand, to dissident, and so on. Its not that hard to talk to people without the crutch of pop culture. I would say that its easier, people have learned not to reference the latest sitcom or movie around me. Instead, they say something else. We don't discuss football or tv shows like they matter. The social programming is very skin deep, in my experience. People who are steeped in pop culture have lives as well, they may tend to mediate or make sense of the universal through the frame of pop culture, but that does not mean they cannot make sense of their lives in their own way, privately. I imagine everyone has their own running dialogue, and has occasion to wonder if they aren't crazy for thinking some kinds of thoughts. The mistake we who try to go through the process of shedding pop conciousness may tend to make is a common enough one to all of man, hubris. <br><br>Absent pop conciousness, I can still have conversations with people, friends, etc. who are more plugged in. I think there is often a lot of relief at not to have to go through the charade on all parties and just to be able to talk, and I think that because most of my friends seem to really enjoy it when I can make it to a get together with them, and quite often a few of them will very specifically ask me what I think about something going on (like the U.S. bombing Libya) because they know they are not going to hear a regurgitated opinion I harvested from CNN or Fox News, or the New York Times, or Saturday Night Live. <br><br>Get over your selves, assume that everyone is as self-aware as you about this stuff even if they may not be. The propaganda of pop conciousness is clumsy and painted in broad brush strokes, that's what makes it so easy to dispense with to begin with.

The suspension of disbelief cannot be disrupted or held up when it no longer exists.<br><br><br>Watching movies and tv shows is mostly unenjoyable for me because I am usually deconstructing the manipulation of the present moment. I spent several years reading McLuhan, Debord, Chomsky, and so on to understand how it all works and to be able to see it for what it is. And for a time that entertained me, and you can find plenty of sub-cultures ranging from internet meme-ophiles who are ironically self-aware about pop culture to more politically charged media critics to get involved in, but at some point the interest for all of that fell away; its like learning to tie your shoes, I get it, got it, done it. It just does not hold my interest. And to see a movie and understand instantly that the way they are framing a shot is to manipulate me into feeling afraid, or what a commercial is striving for, or the ham handed patriotic sentiments of a sporting event is less than offensive, it is distractingly boring. I imagine that for someone who finds this stuff interesting to some degree another, whether they are fully bought in or if it exists as a 'guilty' pleasure, this probably sounds like extreme minimalism. That is missing it, I never set out with the goal of rendering the artifacts of pop conciousness distracting, boring and irrelevant to me.

And that sense of "belonging" is what makes subcultures so attractive. <br><br>In my teen's it was skateboaring &amp; punk rock. Then at 18, when I was initiated into a magical order, it started shifting towards those in the occult &amp; pagan scenes. Even so, I always felt like I was on the periphery of this stuff in one sense. Most of my ritual and inner work has been on the solitary end. <br><br>On through my twenties I entrenched myself in Cincinnati's experimental music, literary, &amp; arts scenes... and again, even though I'm a participant always felt like I was still on the periphery. I don't mean to suggest this in terms of being an "Outsider" as Colin Wilson talks about in his book of the same name. I'm a very sociable person. <br><br>One of the things I've become interested in over the past few years, though not a participant at all really, is the subculture of hackers. I wrote an essay (it needs another pass) about the similarities between Occultist and Hacker subcultures. Now I see that these traits apply to many kinds of groups...<br>...especially now that my wife and I started taking a speedskating/roller derby class to get some exercise... <br><br>I guess I always knew in the back of my mind that my magickal practice was part of the reason I've always felt to be involved yet still on the periphery, and in touch with my own thoughts and feelings about things outside of groupthink.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c8917906235111102728 title="comment permalink">10/20/11, 6:40 AM</a><br><br>

You follow through with said plans, if you are lucky in a few huge leaps but most probably with a lot of small, disciplined steps over a good amount of time. And along they way, you get tempted to form another mindset, perhaps of the “committed spiritual person” or “low-carbon footprint person” or “wise philosopher/seer” or something. And off you go again, spending another few years playing a role, which will end up in disappointment or disaster. <br><br>On my own spiritual path, the destination seems to be to reach a level of consciousness that is free of egotistical role-playing, or at least is conscious of it, so that you just play with roles and have fun but don’t take them too seriously, and certainly don't believe in them. You learn to accept life as it comes, and that acceptance brings a gentleness and compassion that is quite freeing.<br><br>So how would a Mage see the “destination?”<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c8104691415307766845 title="comment permalink">10/20/11, 6:44 AM</a><br><br>

I remembered reading this decades ago and it has stuck with me (See??!!)<br><br>The other thing your post reminded me of this week, was the movie "Exorcist 2: The Heretic" with Richard Burton and James Earl Jones. Yes, it is a perfectly awful movie in most respects. But always remember there is a bit of Yang in Yin, and Yin in Yang, and the worst of pop culture can have a tiny gem hidden in its folds.<br><br>In this case, the origins of the reason for Regan (Linda Blair's character) becoming possessed by Pazuzu the demon is explored. Burton (as the priest) discovers that a little African boy (Jones), his gift, is to be able to cease the phenomenon whereby normal grasshoppers cluster and turn into the terrible locust flight where crops are devoured and famine begins. The boy has a spiritual gift to do so, and he uses the sound of a bullroarer to calm the locust hordes.<br><br>It turns out that just as the madness can spread from individual locusts clustering and gathering for flight, an individual grasshopper of rare type can calm the others and prevent such a flight.<br><br>The priest eventually finds out that Regan had this natural gift as well, and that is why Pazuzu, who is attributed with starting locust plagues, targeted her for possession, to nullify her gift to calm hordes (not only of locusts, but by implication, to calm crazed people/crowds in the same way). The ultimate battle has Regan using an imaginary bullroarer in the final scene to calm the locusts and the madness of the priest as well.<br><br>It is worth thinking about. Your post and the memory of this movie combined to evoke in me a passage from the New Testament, something Jesus said: "Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 5:15-16).<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c810426419798590470 title="comment permalink">10/20/11, 9:36 AM</a><br><br>

I hardly think that turning off the TV and reading JMG qualifies as cutting free from the current culture. Seems just the way the culture is going anyway, some of us at the front, some in the middle and some bringing up the rear. It's evolutionary not revolutionary. And, ah, seriously, it's Elitist - we are the intellectual elite oh gosh look at how clever and free we are!<br><br>3. The true prophets of change will probably be burnt at the stake (or the modern equivalent). To my mind the magic that will be most potent will be that which renders all the current schools to a common pool of blood - i think Gordian Knot.<br><br>4. I suggest that an example of a true change in group think will come when every aspect of current common world views are shed like the deconditioning of Pavlov's dogs - and under like conditions (cold hard confrontation with imminent death)<br><br>5. Fundamental changes in cultural thinking/behaviour do not come about as a consequence of Casandras or Druids pointing out the obvious. They come about as a consequence of the existing collapsing under the weight of its blindness to truth. Think Japan and Nuclear power and you only just start to understand. <br><br>In some ways, however much we might like great art, writing, thinking - whatever - most of it is not much different to fiddling as Rome burns.

In 2014 I think it might be useful to have a party to celebrate the centennial of the beginning of Western civilization's decline and fall; though there were plenty of signs of incipient breakdown before then, I'd call the beginning of the First World War that actual start of the downfall.<br><br>Hal, remember when I said that one of the routine effects of mass thaumaturgy is that people become stupid? <br><br>Texas, I haven't done a lot of study of Gurdjieff or the other Fourth Way teachers, but yes, they're talking about many of the same things that I am, or for that matter that Peladan was. The advice you've quoted is certainly good. <br><br>Zach, funny robes, chants and symbols -- well, doesn't that apply to your religion just as much as to my magic? And for good reason -- those things are tools for shaping consciousness, and stay in use because they still have the required effect on the mental states of the participants. <br><br>Jim, I'd say instead that DARPA wants to practice magic, pure and simple. That suggests that the rest of us need to learn how to take control of our own narrative-shaping functions as soon as possible. <br><br>JD and Robert, got 'em. <br><br>Susan, it's a great attitude. <br><br>William, good. You're getting it. <br><br>Richard, excellent. I've had the same experience -- the occasional difficulties of pulling the plug on the popular culture machine are massively offset by the immense benefits. <br><br>Andrew, in my experience it takes as much time and effort to become a capable magician as it does to receive teacher's qualifications in a traditional martial art, or -- well, to complete any other serious training program worth doing. What you get back from anything in life depends on what you put into it.<br><br>Jean-Vivien, vast amounts of ritual material online, yes. Useful explanations of how and why it works? That's much rarer. You might visit <a href=http://www.hermetic.com rel=nofollow>Hermetic.com</a> and do some digging there; there's quite a bit of good stuff there. <br><br>Kat, you won't find it under that name!

That's the edge behind Galbraith's wit; what he's talking about is always going on somewhere, with some asset or other. In the US right now the big bubble is student loans -- there's a trillion dollars of those outstanding as of this year, up by some stunning figure over last year.

Still, you might try ditching popular culture -- say, throwing away the TV -- as a good first step. <br><br>Karen, that's very good to hear! It's often necessary for any of us on this path to say very little in social settings, because people who are still in the belly of the beast do indeed get acutely uncomfortable in the face of an actual diversity of ideas; I'll be writing about that down the road a bit, because it's an important symptom. <br><br>Twilight, exactly. Exactly. <br><br>Justin, well put. Some people will turn their backs, no question, but many others will get used to the fact that you're just a bit weird. It can even become a running joke of the sort that friends have among themselves -- "Don't ask John about the football game!" <br><br>Mage, I'll have to look at those one of these days. I haven't really kept up on the whole neo-magical movement -- my tastes tend toward the old formal disciplines -- but it's good to check up on current developments now and then. <br><br>Larry, that's a useful habit -- and anything that gives you a better grasp of history is worth its weight in light sweet crude oil. 1844 was a hugely important election, no question -- it set the US definitively on an expansionist path and lit the fuse of the Civil War, just for starters. <br><br>Justin, excellent! I do very little visual media these days, for much the same reason. <br><br>Ando, the Hindu tradition has an immense body of practical magical lore, and quite a bit of it draws heavily on the Vedas -- so, yes, the connections are there. I'll look forward to your analysis!<br><br>Chris, thank you. <br><br>Bruce, funny you should mention Krishnamurti. I did <a href=../../2010/06/pathless-land.html rel=nofollow>a post about him</a> a while back, which I dug out the other day as fodder for an upcoming book on magic and peak oil. (For which I now have a publisher lined up -- more on this later.) His stuff is well worth reading. <br><br>Rsven, got it. <br><br>Chris, I'd like to suggest a simple ostensive definition: if it's advertised on TV or another mass medium, it's popular culture. (That includes TV programs, of course, which are heavily advertised on TV.) <br><br>Justin, bingo. The mage can hang out with people in subcultures, or in the mainstream culture as well, but the passive, unthinking immersion in collective consciousness -- no, that door is closed for good. You get used to it after a while, and again, the corresponding benefits are immense.<br><br>Yupped, I don't think that there's just one destination. The old title for someone who has achieved the highest level of initiation in the Hermetic tradition is Ipsissimus, which means "most completely oneself;" the implication is that each person has a unique potential and the disciplines of magic enable him or her to fulfill that potential to the utmost degree.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c6018623009915734599 title="comment permalink">10/20/11, 4:26 PM</a><br><br>

What we like to call "coincidence" goes haywire; I suspect experiences of this kind are what led Jung and his physicist friend Wolfgang Pauli to invent the concept of synchronicity. <br><br>Adrian, the definition of magic is inevitably fuzzy, for the same reason that, say, a definition of healing is hard to pin down. What does and does not count as a healing method? It depends hugely on circumstances. As for the borderlands, I'm not really in a good position to speak to that; I speak from where I stand, and hope that what I say has some value to those who stand elsewhere. <br><br>It's important not to practice color breathing with the same color too constantly, by the way -- it tends to feed imbalances -- and that's especially true if you concentrate on the color you find easiest to work with. Practice with a different color each day and the results are better. How do I experience color? Visually, but only after years of practices; it doesn't come naturally to me at all, but I can do the thing. <br><br>Justin, I'm not a great fan of the Matthews book; it's rather too heavy on dubious history, and light on meaningful practice, for my taste. The Kraig book is another matter; I long since lost track of the number of people I've met who got their start in magic from it. <br><br>Twilight, thanks for the link. <br><br>Kellerman, thank you! I'd somehow missed that Thoreau essay, which is appalling; we don't have saints in Druidry, but if we did, he'd be one.

I knew I'd seen an online copy somewhere, but didn't remember where and hadn't had the chance to google it. <br><br>Parus, yes, I was afraid somebody was going to bring Evola up sooner or later. You're probably right that I need to discuss him, though I should give fair warning -- I'm not a fan of Traditionalism at all; despite its virtues, and at times because of them, it's had a largely negative influence. I see the whole movement as an exercise in the particular kind of bad faith that comes from claiming unearned authority. More on this later. <br><br>Thomas, I'll see what I can do about the pictures; I used images once before, in the post about Rosie the Riveter and HAL 9000, and nobody seemed particularly excited at the time. As for titles, Druidry puts very little store by those; there is no official form of address for an archdruid, and I sincerely hope there never is. Personal names, or convenient monikers such as "JMG," are standard usage. <br><br>Lance, you know, the ability to find a useful point in one of the worst movies in history is also a strange and mystical power; I'm impressed. ;-) I'm pretty sure Peladan meant to evoke that particular Gospel passage, for what it's worth.<br><br>Ghung, actually, the Seventies appropriate tech stuff is primary; the magic, in this context, is an add-on. Decouple yourself from the material systems, and your mind will begin to follow whether you intend it to do so or not. Mind you, if you combine the two approaches, there's a synergistic effect -- which, again, I'll get to later on. <br><br>Richard, as long as you follow the house rules -- which are posted for everybody's convenience over the comment screen -- you're welcome to post here. Same goes for everybody. <br><br>Lynford, it's not ironic at all. It's the natural response to a manufactured pseudoculture that provides no better nourishment for the mind and heart than mass produced junk food does for the body -- people go looking for other options, and just at the moment the internet is a very easy way to find them. <br><br>Miles, of course you're right about getting people to read source material; it's been my experience that most people nowadays won't read anything older than they are unless you force them to it. Still, Peladan was astonishingly good at being unacceptable. How many people can deal with a guy who despised democracy because of its inherent militaristic and imperialistic tendencies? Or one whose attitude toward women was utterly sexist, but in a way that modern sexists find intolerable? I'll doubtless finish the translation as time permits, and there's been enough interest shown here that I'll doubtless find some way to get him into print, but every copy that gets sold will end up being thrown against the wall at least once!<br><br>Poet, you ought to know better; have you forgotten Shelley's comment about poets being the unacknowledged legislators of the world? The people with swords -- or the modern equivalents -- who think they despise poetry and magic and culture in general, are inevitably mouthing words, thinking thoughts, and taking actions put into their heads by the poets and mages of a generation or so before. <br><br>Petro, excellent. <br><br>Raven, Gray's a very mixed bag. His early stuff is belligerently self-important in a very unhelpful way -- it really does get old that every generation of bright young mages convince themselves that they're the first people ever to understand magic, and Gray did quite a bit of that early on. His best work, from <i>The Talking Tree</i> through the Sangreal material, is very good but very idiosyncratic; you can't combine it with anybody else's material, with the admitted (and valuable) exception of his student RJ Stewart. Thus I don't recommend him to beginners, though a student with some background can get a lot out of his work.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c1627872171857187713 title="comment permalink">10/20/11, 7:06 PM</a><br><br>

I suppose Peladan's point, updated for today, is to live so that you have something interesting and worthwhile to talk about. <br><br>Philip, got it -- it's already in the competition. <br><br>Joel, the trick to learning how to will is to treat it just as you would a muscle that you're exercising. Do things for no other reason than because you will to do them. Start very small and simple, with things that don't have any emotional charge at all. The classic mistake is to start with something like losing weight or quitting smoking; that's practicing failure, and you need to build the habit of success instead. <br><br>For example, leave a note on your desk reminding you to do some simple action, and every time you sit down at the desk and see the note, do the action, right then, no matter what. There's a lot more -- there were once entire books full of will training exercises -- but that's the basic principle: do something each day purely because you decide to do it, and for no other reason; change the exercise at intervals, adding difficulty in very small increments, and you'll end up with a very strong will. <br><br>Andrew, I figured, but the point had to be made for the benefit of others. Congrats on your lodge, by the way! <br><br>Whiffle, it really doesn't matter what you choose to begin with, so long as you choose one that you can stand practicing, and stick with it for at least a year. You'll get the same skills in either case. it's not a good idea to start out trying to practice two different schools when you're a beginner; remember, though, that you can always add more later on. I'm a case in point; I started with the Golden Dawn, went on to Druidry, and have also done fairly extensive work in old-fashioned Southern conjure, Renaissance astrological magic, and several other things. So you're not closing any doors by choosing a style to start with. <br><br>Maria, glad to be of assistance!<br><br>Thijs, he's worth rooting for. I disagree with a lot of his stances, to be sure, but the guy had integrity. <br><br>Edward, exactly.

I don't have a very magical vocabulary and have a hard time following a lot of this but I think I get the gist of it. It's all about pulling yourself out of the collective culture and learning to think for yourself, to become your own person. You mention one thing that could happen is becoming in-step with just an alternate culture or subculture. So like, how do you find the balance between identifying with other groups (political, religious ... whatever) and thinking for yourself? It would still be possible for you to identify as part of a group and have your own thoughts, for example, you of course do it as a druid.

The harsh innocence of spring and the fleeting radiance of autumn.<br><br>I am thankful for the colors and textures of my world, the variegated, nubby greens of the forest and shrubs, knotted and quilted together. The flowers in all their pastels shapes and sizes on filigree vines and stems. The smooth, enigmatic mirror of a lake or a pond reflecting back the moods of the forest and the celestial bowl of the sky.<br><br>I am thankful for the velvet muzzle of a horse and the satin feel and shine of it's hide as it slides over muscle and bone. The grace and power of the horse as it lopes and turns at the touch of heel or rein, mane flying and tail flagged as their hooves barely touch the ground that, for a moment, lets me feel like I'm riding Pegasus.<br><br>I am thankful for all these moments of perception and I cherish them as memories for I know they will all pass soon enough.

I’ve been reading them all avidly, though I have had little time recently to create a reply – still busy with harvest, and also reading The Glass Bead Game, and the various submitted short stories. Keeping me busy!<br><br>Your description of Peladan and his influence on people reminds me of the physical presence of some holy people I’ve met. The effect of how they actually <b>are</b> speaks so much more loudly than words. <br><br>And I’ve been mulling over the similarities of your descriptions of rituals and symbols getting in under the logic-radar, and comparing it to my experiences making and using art. As a (retired) art therapist, I have seen some powerful effects from creating artwork that grapples with the problem at hand. I have seen families silenced and shaken by the evidence of their own group drawing that they supposed would be just “doodles”. I have watched wounded teen girls go through a growth process that was reflected in their series of drawings, paintings and sculptures. And I myself have moved through some deep, deep pain by switching to making art, wordlessly, as I tried to give expression to the pain – some of those art pieces are scary-looking, but in each case, I found that I had in some ways shifted the pain, made some inroads into dealing with the situation. Art is powerful magic, IMO, although I’m not trained in magic. <br><br>You remind me (thank you!!) of the power of the art that I have within me, and that it’s time to take it up again as I make these shifts toward green wizardry. Practical prep is very good, but there also needs to be that activity that to my logical mind seems “impractical”…that wordless wandering inside that brings up surprising symbols. <br><br>And pertinent to the discussion on detaching and yet staying in the world, I have mentioned before (I think) Marsha Sinetar’s “Ordinary People as Monks and Mystics” which is the result of a study she did of people who had pulled back from the world in various ways, because they were “called” to something different and/or simpler – I read it when I was 30, and it changed my life. It’s not necessarily about Christian values; many respondents said they had no religious beliefs. It’s about what JMG refers to as uncoupling from the popular culture.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c7819839491059242393 title="comment permalink">10/21/11, 10:04 AM</a><br><br>

We have spent more on police forces and building prisons than any other, we are the world's leading prison country with the highest percentage per capita and total head count among other countries.

Either way, if it works for you, excellent. <br><br>Ezab, thank you. <br><br>Hadashi, I don't know if this is large enough to be a subculture, but the peak oil scene has the makings of one. We'll see how it develops. <br><br>Grrl, glad to be helpful! As far as I know, I don't have ADD, but I do have absent-minded professor's syndrome -- it's easy for me to get caught up in thinking, and lose track of things I meant to do. <br><br>Adrian, there's probably at least what Wittgenstein liked to call a "family relationship" between them. The version of color breathing I practice relates to an early 20th century set of Druid teachings that was one of the things I got handed along with the hot seat in AODA, and it doesn't have any hard and fast connection to the seasonal cycle -- but that doesn't mean that one couldn't be evolved. Tradition is a much more fluid thing than many people seem to think. <br><br>Justin, I haven't read that one of Matthews' books. I'm mostly a fan of his work on the Arthurian legends. <br><br>Huntgather, the mainstream of European culture in Peladan's time was as convinced of the onward march of progress as anybody is nowadays; Trotsky, like the fin de siecle Decadents, were on the fringes, in rather the same way that peak oil is today. The armies that marched to war in 1914 were one and all convinced that they'd be victorious by Christmas! It's that blind optimism that's the great danger now -- that, and another, subtler issue with hard survivalism and a great many other ideologies, which I'll be discussing in a bit. <br><br>Greatblue, no argument there. I loathe the contemporary habit of having TV screens blaring on all sides; it's as though people are so terrified of stepping outside the media-generated fantasy that they have to have a TV yelling at them night and day. <br><br>Cathy, the personal creation of art is a hugely important process -- that's one of the reasons, though only one, why mages habitually make their own working tools. I need to do a post one of these days about the contemporary delusion that there's this thing called talent, which some people have and others don't, and the presence of which can only be judged by a combination of media opinion and mass popularity. It's hard to think of a more wretchedly untrue and horribly damaging belief system. <br><br>Zach, good. Did you mean, by the way, to post your other comment to the post on the Glass Bead Game? It seems relevant to this post instead. <br><br>Justin, I don't see that as leading to dystopia, simply as the normal practice of an overcentralized empire that's on its way down. As Toynbee pointed out a long time ago, it's par for the course for such societies, having given up the ability to inspire, to settle for the power to coerce -- and it always, without exception, fails. <br><br>Doctor W, funny! Still, I think of the TV industry as like Phil the Prince of Insufficient Light from <i>Dilbert</i>, waving their oversized spoons and darning people to heck.

(In fact, that reminds me... must see about robes for our acolytes...)<br><br>I think I see where I became confused. You've been busy for weeks now exploring how "magic" is a wider practice than one might have previously thought, and yet in this first "Lesson in Practical Magic" you're involving funny robes, chants, and symbols (FRC&amp;S). My confusion is because I failed to keep distinct what magic <i>is</i> ("change in consciousness according to will") from the tools one might use to practice it (FRC&amp;S).<br><br>This also gets back to the distinction I wanted to keep clear between religion and magic.<br><br>So: from your perspective, when we enact our liturgy using <i>our</i> funny robes, chants, and symbols, what we are doing is magic, because it is using one of the standard "toolkits" of affecting states of consciousness. And also at the same time, what we are doing is religious, because we are doing it as a response to the Divine.<br><br>Then for this weeks post, you are advocating the use of ritual magic (as well as fasting from media) for what I would call a "secular" purpose -- namely, creating a mental space between yourself and your society, from which you can critique it rather than mindlessly participating in it.<br><br>Am I back on the same page?<br><br>It occurs to me that we Christians are all urged to this practice -- after all, we <i>do</i> have "Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind...", "Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?" etc. as part of our Scriptures. These passages are often misunderstood, especially by non-Christians, as urging contempt for nature -- but in traditional Christian theology, the <i>kosmos</i> we are to remain separate from is the patterns and perceptions of one's culture and age. So in terms of this blog, perhaps a good paraphrase might be "Don't let yourself get suckered by the mass thaumaturgy going on around you."<br><br><br>peace,<br>Zach<br><br>P.S.: Verification word "fixatics."

I also suspect that at its origins it was interpreted by its followers in metaphorical terms, which is why they also had no problem adopting pagan beliefs and traditions. The evolution of the Church has turned it literal.<br><br>To take a few examples, I think the holy trinity is more coherent if it is taken to be understood as a diagram of conciousness, two individuals communicate through the symbolic realm of conciousness, which can be understood as its own personality without a literal person. The resurrection is not a physical resurrection, but an observation that the concious can persist after self-awareness and the physical body dies. As JMG said, we all use Plato's ideas every day in our lives, in that sense, he has been alive for millenia. I also think one could credibly reinterpret the story of Jesus in metaphorical terms as an allegory of what happens in society when we become immune to the suffering of others. Jesus is a metaphorical embodiment of moral concious, and that dies for our turning away from those social ills. <br><br>Also, JMG.

For the past few years we have been cleaning it up, replanting some native species, generally making it more wildlife friendly. The more time I spent on the land the more I realized that nature was my "religion," especially when I was among the timber on our land. Anyway, about a year ago I thought I needed guidance in my new found religious awareness and discovered the archdruid's blog and books. I started the study he outlines for the druid path. While I've strayed from the prescribed path somewhat, and gone very deeply into the herbalism of the plants native to my land, I have noticed things are different for me now. My perceptions are different, I more easily see broad connections in plant communities, built communities, personal and work relationships. This has allowed me to situate myself more to my liking, and hopefully- I think without harm and mostly usefulness to others. I don't know if I can attribute this change to my druidic studies, but it is now the major intellectual influence in my life and timewise corresponds very closely.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c6677428439736023548 title="comment permalink">10/22/11, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

One approach I have found helpful is to adopt the language of games such as chess and go, in which the players are ranked by "strength." I no longer say, "She is a talented musician." Instead, I say, "She is strong at the violin." I no longer say, "That person is a saint." Instead, I say, "That person is strong at compassion and the sacred." Similar to your comment earlier about characterizing will through the metaphor of the muscle - if we identify unproductive vocabularies and replace them with helpful vocabularies, we can begin the long work of gradual improvement. In this case, the replacement vocabulary reminds us that we can become stronger, and suggests the next step of finding the appropriate action that will contribute to strength. <br><br>(Relatedly, there was a great study several years ago by the psychologist Carol Dweck, described in her book Mindset and elsewhere: students at a failing school who learned the mantra "The mind is a muscle, the more I use it the stronger it gets" broke out of thinking of themselves as stupid and wildly outperformed the control group.)<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c1662201380345411340 title="comment permalink">10/22/11, 11:23 AM</a><br><br>

When I was checking out the possible originality of that thought, I came across some interesting things.<br><br>'Being a bore' goes back to the 18th century. Boredoms first known use was in 1852. Charles Dickens, "Bleak House." The French came on board about the same time with 'ennui' and the Italians with 'noia.' <br><br>So just as the world is industrializing, boredom rears it's ugly head. Interesting. <br><br>Even as a child I don't remember being bored. If I wasn't building a castle out of milk cartons, paper towel and toilet paper rolls I was chasing down possible new hobbies. Tropical fish, rock collecting, leather craft and inventing new ways to torment my younger brother come to mind.<br><br>Boredom is the failure of imagination.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c32454702412085830 title="comment permalink">10/22/11, 2:23 PM</a><br><br>

Since starting the druid path studies about a year ago, here are some things I've noticed that have changed in my normal routines. I have unconsciously set up what would seem for me to be rituals. They aren't fancy, but it gets my awareness in a different place. For example, when I go to work on our farmland, I have particular sets of clothes that I only wear for that-- my land clothes. After a couple of years, it seems that when I am in that costume, my mind and body know what will be needed from them. I feel physically stronger and more aware of what I need to do to accomplish that task. Another ritual -- there is a particular white oak on our land that lost a big branch and the healed over stump looks like an offering cup. So when I am in that part of the woods, I always put an offering to the forest there. It really is just part of a granola bar or whatever that will be found by a squirrel. That may be silly, but it might not be. <br><br>For my day job rituals, it is cup of tea, check emails, check this blog, read something about trees, etc. Then I work. What I have discovered is that rituals helps focus and narrow the distractions. In my case, what I feel has been magic, (although I don't know if the practicing mages would think so) a few months back, I needed a situation which would allow me the earn income, but with a schedule that was completely set by me. My new found rituals, gave me the ability to concentrate on what was important, formulate a goal, evaluate my resources and figure out how to achieve that goal. I clearly stated to my husband what I wanted to have happen on a Sunday, described to him how I wanted it to work, and by the following Wednesday totally out of the blue, I was presented with a work opportunity that was exactly what I needed. Everyone I know was amazed and asked how that happened. I told them it was magic. They laughed, I don't. For me it just seems like what these recent discussions might call magic.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c2514132407007533502 title="comment permalink">10/23/11, 10:50 AM</a><br><br>

I think boredom is the result of the narratives that inform your imagination not aligning with whatever it is you are observing. The narratives that inform your imagination are derivative. The point of cutting yourself off from pop culture is to cut off that source of the contrived narrative structures that you are exposed to and form the default patterns of thought to describe whatever it is that is going on around you.<br><br>Spending thirty minutes or so to study a caterpillar crawling around and overcoming various obstacles, or just to get a sense of the rythm for thow their peculiar bodies move is only boring if you're framework of what is entertaining is informed by the underlying narrative structure of our fictional media. Boring is a value judgment, and it is evaluated against a normative standard. You can control the value judgment indirectly by deconstructing your normative standard.<br><br>Boring is not the failure of imagination, it is the failure of reality to conform to the expectations of your imagination, and those expectations are learned. I think that is what the real value of excising pop culture and mass media from what you are learning.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c6110266327598125496 title="comment permalink">10/23/11, 11:01 AM</a><br><br>

Still, the idea of trying to influence an archangel is not something you'll find in the old lore; angelic beings are not subject to human influence, being outside of time and change. You might as well try to change the movement of the Sun around the galactic core by throwing rocks at it. <br><br>Candace, that's always a judgment call, and almost never one that can be made on the basis of abstract principles. Hierarchies of the kind that dominate the US economy these days are hugely dysfunctional in times of crisis, because they insulate decision makers from what's going on down on the ground; even bright leaders usually end up clueless about the contexts and consequences of their actions because the information they get is filtered by so many levels of bureaucracy. Still, now and again it's possible to have an influence, and you have to make your own call when that's a realistic option, and when it's time to cut and run before the whole tottering mess comes crashing down on you. <br><br>Zach, good. Magic is a means that can be applied to any number of ends, and religion is one of those ends; some religious traditions make quite a bit of use of magic, while others avoid it. You might be interested to know that Druids stray all over that distinction; there are Druid traditions that use all the ceremonial bells and whistles they can, and others that tend toward a very spare, ritual-free approach. <br><br>Do those scriptural passages, by the way, use <i>kosmos</i> for "world," or do they use <i>oikoumene</i>? Pun not intended, there's a world of difference...<br><br>PhysicsDoc, I've tried to be as nonvague as possible, but the biases of our culture -- and of your training, presuming that your moniker means what it seems to mean -- all stand in the way of understanding it. Let's put it this way: you wouldn't want to do an experiment with equipment that was uncalibrated, questionably accurate, and gummed up with extraneous matter. The human mind and personality is the instrument we use to experience the world, and in nearly all cases it can be described in exactly the same terms I've just used. Magic is one very effective way to get the crud out and make sure that your own mental states, and the various influences that are directed toward you, are not interfering with your perception of the world. Does that make any more sense? <br><br>Phil, a lot of educational systems, past and present, had and have for their unstated purpose the task of making sure that the bottom of the economic ladder was well tenanted with people who believed they couldn't do any better. Your father ran afoul of that process. <br><br>Jason, of course you can be a Goth and still be clueless! Peladan's genius was in realizing that there was an entire class of young men in his time who could be encouraged to detach themselves from the collective consciousness, not just so that they could turn into a reactive counterculture, but so that at least a few of them could become individuals. As for martial arts, that's something for a later post. It's a loaded issue, since so many people are still caught up in apocalyptic fantasies and the violent aspects of martial arts training can unfortunately feed into that. There's more going on than angry white pajamas, though.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c1222793277795902526 title="comment permalink">10/23/11, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

Of course people have different degrees of innate strength, to use your term, but any degree can be developed through exercise. As for sainthood, though, I've long thought the Catholics are very sensible not to use that term of anybody living!<br><br>Lewis, in a certain sense, yes. In my experience, though, boredom is also a message that tells you that you're not paying enough attention. It tends to pop up in magical training right before you suddenly realize that there's a whole new level of the work that you haven't been noticing until just then. In the same way, when a t'ai chi student gets bored doing the form slowly, the best response is to have them do it even more slowly, until they start to notice what it is that they're missing. <br><br>Lady I., a subculture is a good stepping stone, but it's a lousy final destination. Whether or not human beings can get completely beyond social thought, fortunately, isn't at issue; the point is that we can certainly reach the stage of being able to interact intelligently with the thinking habits of our society, and act on them rather than merely being acted on by them. <br><br>Bill, good. The words "Yes! We are all individuals!" also comes to mind. <br><br>Das Monde, historically speaking, a great deal of magic has been practiced by people who felt themselves to be disempowered or disadvantaged. I'd expect to find quite a few people among today's downwardly mobile yuppietariat turning to magic as a result. <br><br>Malcolm, thanks for the suggestions!<br><br>Justin, well, I've already offered my suggestion. <br><br>Jennifer, good. Of course all of us are average and mediocre in most respects; it's one of the traps of contemporary culture that suggesting that will raise the hackles of almost everyone.

Another example: I worked on a child psychiatric unit, and had had a very bleak day – I needed a way to grapple with the grief of very sick children. I made a container that I covered with psychiatric diagnoses and terminology, glued some real gemstones inside and poured tar into it… I hesitated (always hate to “waste” things), but I could feel the grief nagging – once I poured the tar inside (it evoked tears), thus enacting the “waste” I had seen in the unit that day, my grief peaked and then eased… I hadn’t changed their pain, but I had expressed my grief and my acknowledgment of the reality, physically, and that changed something inside that all the thinking and even journaling didn’t touch.

My question is about the relation between magic as described here, and overt satanism. In college I studied Yeats pretty extensively, and it always seemed to me that the process you describe here, the unshackling of one's mind if you will, if not done within an ordered context, tends to lead toward disorder, sometimes pretty sever disorder at that. Anton Levy, who was a fellow member to Yeats in the Order of the Golden Dawn is a good representation of that. 'Do what thou wilt' - is that whole of the druid's law? <br><br>You're exactly right about the correlation between traditional religions and druidry - the bells, incense and robes - but in the one they drive us towards heaven, and the other, at best spreads us out on a more horizontal plane.

It's like the magic ring in the old Sufi tale, that would always make its owner happy when he was sad, but would make him sad when he was happy. It was a plain gold ring with an inscription: "This, too, will pass." <br><br>Sean, no, the techniques are not universal between systems -- they vary quite a bit -- and they can't be boiled down to a small set. You really need to study more magic! There's been a mania for watering down magical traditions in the last century or so; Crowley watered down the Golden Dawn, Spare watered down Crowley, the chaos magic types watered down Spare, and no doubt somebody's trying to come up with a watered down form of chaos magic as we speak! <br><br>The old magical traditions are overwhelming in their richness, complexity, and range of technique; it takes a couple of decades of hard work to get a good working mastery of any one of them -- which is doubtless why so many people nowadays want to take the easy way out. Still, it's quite easy to get to work learning any of the old sytems; you just have to be willing to start at the beginning and do the work a step at a time, like every other student has done down through the centuries. <br><br>Joel, that's a good metaphor. As for angels, though, remember that eternity doesn't mean "a very long time," it means outside of time. For beings of the angelic realm, according to the traditional lore, the creation and end of the universe and everything in between are all <i>now</i>. <br><br>Zach, interesting. <i>Aion</i> makes perfect sense in context, but <i>kosmos</i> seems hard to interpret in any way that doesn't involve hostility to the universe itself -- that's the typical phrasing of Gnostic literature, though of course the Gnostics gave a very different valuation to the aeons. <br><br>Agrarian, you're confusing "Anton Levy" -- I assume you mean Howard Levy aka Anton Szandor LaVey, who was a California poser in the 1960s and '70s -- with Aleister Crowley, who was a very good example of how not to practice magic. (If you begin life rich, handsome, talented, and charismatic, and end up a burnt-out heroin addict in a small town flophouse with an estate worth 14 shillings and a name that's a laughing stock on three continents, you're doing something wrong.) No, I don't consider Crowley the "prophet of the New Aeon," and "do what thou wilt" is to my mind neither the whole, nor even a significant part of the law; Crowley was an aberration, and not even a particularly interesting one except as an object lesson. <br><br>As for your distinction between your religion and mine, well, yes, I know you guys believe that you have an exclusive relationship with God and the rest of us are simply out of luck. The rest of us don't share that opinion, and what you've called the vertical dimension is found in a great many places other than your church. You don't have to believe that, but it might help communication if you recognize that the rest of us do. <br><br>Hapibeli, that seems sensible enough. The cognitive dissonance that comes from grappling with the possibility that your own society is hopelessly corrupt can be a very difficult pill to swallow.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c3362810411959670224 title="comment permalink">10/24/11, 8:01 PM</a><br><br>

Your expertise in, say, geometry, does not hinder you from later developing expertise in number theory. However, your expertise in one kind of magical practice, however, can hinder (or, at times, even block) all your subsequent efforts to become an expert in certain other kinds of magical practice. It is very hard indeed to "unlearn" one kind of magic, after you have learned it thoroughly and made it your own.<br><br>There is, for example, a kind of magic that involves strengthening one's will to the maximum possible, and prevailing over circumstances by the force of that strong will. And then there is a second, rather different kind of magic that involves discovering one's so-called "true will" and doing that strongly. Both are magics of strength, but the sort of strength is cultivated is not quite the same in the two practices.<br><br>Moreover, these two are not the only kinds of magic that exist. A third kind of magic requires one to weaken one's own will more and more, thereby rendering oneself transparent to Something Other than oneself, which has a will of its own -- presumably a will with which the magician is in sympathy. This Other can then work through the magician to exert its will in our world.<br><br>And a fourth kind of magic ignores the will entirely, seeing it as just scum on a pond that prevents the magician from "seeing the moon in clear water," or rather, grasping how the great living fiery web has been woven that connects all things in all times and places, Having grasped this, you may also understand when, where and how you are meant to tug a little on this or that strand in the great web, and what will come about when you have don so.<br><br>And there are other kinds of magic as well . . .<br><br>I do not see how one and the same magician might train himself to be *equally* adept in these four kinds of magic. How can one follow a regimen of practice designed to strengthen the will, and at the same time also follow another regimen of practice designed to weaken the will, or one that ignores the will altogether? And just *which* will, out of the several we have mentioned here, is the will that we shall strengthen, or weaken, or ignore? <br><br>No, I think that magic is not one thing in the sense that one might hope to devise a unified theory and practice of magic valid for all magicians. <br><br>Robert Mathiesen /Mageprof<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c2065553883570940273 title="comment permalink">10/24/11, 8:48 PM</a><br><br>

The mathematical models and theories do not explain what nature is just how it behaves in certain regimes or circumstances. The power comes from its relative generality and predictive capabilities. There are many deep mysteries that most physicists ignore since the math works and explains how things behave. There are of course many theoretical physicists trying to unify quantum physics and general relativity into one unified and mathematically consistent theory, but that does not stop the two existing theories from being successfully used in many circumstances.

I have some comments on your treatment of popular culture and the starting point for your argument. <br><br>Starting from a value judgment on popular culture - that it is vulgar, vapid, useless, etc - seems to somewhat defeat the point of using magical practice as a means of achieving independent thought. Even though it encourages a person to question narratives, it starts from a position of a person accepting a narrative. In other words, listen to my opinion - which happens to be that you should form your own opinions. <br><br>Furthermore, a lot of the wonderful old pieces of culture you reference as being worthwhile, valid, etc, were often considered just as lurid and trashy as you might consider a good bit of our current popular culture. Shakespeare is a great example, as the very notion of going to the theatre was for a very long time considered not a very classy thing to do.<br><br>I don't want to take your points out of context, because you made a great many solid arguments and your general thrust is to encourage independent thought, which I agree is sorely needed and figures heavily into the rise of the peak oil movement. However, I think the place to start is not, "the mainstream culture is wrong," but perhaps "the mainstream culture does not seem connected to facts on the ground. Why?" Especially when we're talking about how the human brain works, which seems to be an important topic in magical work, I would argue that leading a person to discover and ask their own questions is more effective than leading them to any particular answers. The answers they come up with after independent, thoughtful review are generally going to be the ones that have the most meaning and staying power. I think we probably agree on that in essence, and I'm really just making the point that starting from a position of "popular culture is not good", without examining why it is not good, is skipping ahead a step. Anyways, you have probably covered that particular topic in other posts, but I think in this post it could have strengthened your thesis.<br><br>Full disclosure - I am an actor and so I have a very different process for processing popular culture than many do. While I see a lot of the nonsense for it is, from the point of view of being a professional story-teller, I have to take a wider view than many do of the interaction between popular culture and popular thought, subconscious, etc. This probably informs my arguments a great deal.<br><br>-z<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c2353295588808641258 title="comment permalink">10/26/11, 11:30 AM</a><br><br>

If you're going to critique my ideas, you know, it would be helpful if you take the time to figure out what they are first!<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c7585475675925250110 title="comment permalink">10/26/11, 12:21 PM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c751138792377248396></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/00156725035502913180 rel=nofollow>Zach Livingston</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>JMG, I went back and re-read your post, and my comment. It looks like I conflated your statement about the aims of popular culture - to empty the wallet and the mind - with a value judgement on popular culture. Oops.<br><br>However, that's tangential to my central point. To avoid confusion, I will go directly from your text:<br><br><i>It was a neat evasion of my point, which is that contemporary mass-produced popular culture exists solely for the purpose of emptying your wallet and your brain, not necessarily in that order. In terms of the classification I’ve suggested in recent posts, popular culture is a vehicle for mass thaumaturgy; it works, as mass thaumaturgy always works, by inducing you to think less and react more. Thus, in the strictest sense of the word, it makes you more stupid. I don’t think any of us can afford that right now.</i><br><br>In this paragraph, you make a fairly vast generalization that, though it may be supported in your past posts, is not supported here. Of course, one can't express every idea in every post, however: asking your reader to absorb such a claim - that popular culture exists only to empty the mind and the wallet - without providing some support for that claim, isn't much different than the creators of popular culture asking consumers to implicitly absorb the unsupported claims that are carelessly thrown about on television every day. (And really, support for your claim could have been as simple as a link to a previous post. But I digress.)<br><br>Thus, even though the rest of your argument might be sterling, it's based on an unsupported idea that you are implicitly asking your readers to simply accept and move on with. My point is that popular culture often communicates its messages in a similar fashion. Proceeding from that, if there is much value in promoting people thinking outside the mainstream, then it might be more constructive to lead them to questions about the inadequacy of that mainstream, rather than general statements about the mainstream that simple render it valueless. And yes, I am saying that claiming something exists only to empty your mind and your wallet is claiming that it is of little, if any value. <br><br>To be very clear, this is not a comment in defense of popular culture, though I do disagree with your characterization of the concept. I am simply pointing out that you are asking your readers to perform the same thought process in reacting to your work that popular culture asks its consumers to perform in reaction to its content: namely, the process of accepting an unsupported idea as fact, simply because someone important has said it is so. <br><br>Ignoring the somewhat shaky underpinnings of your otherwise fine argument by pointing out that you're intending to go somewhere else with it is akin to a used car salesman ignoring the flat tire you just noticed so he can show you how great the engine is running. Is the flat tire a huge, impossible problem? No. But there it is.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c751138792377248396 title="comment permalink">10/26/11, 10:26 PM</a><br><br>

A simple "see post x and y from date z" would have sufficed. I'm not exactly asking for a bibliography. Call me old-fashioned, but historically the burden of providing references is on the writer. If the response is that I should spend more time following the general train of thought on the Report, then all I can say is what I tell my friends who love those HBO hour long dramas so much - I don't have time to follow all the content. All I'm asking for is a link or a date, and with all due respect to you, I don't think that's too much. I am actually very interested in reading your previous posts on popular culture, but searching your site for particular arguments is not always an easy task.<br><br>Second, I actually quite agree with your conclusions in this post and I have no interest in scoring points. I support your work in general or I wouldn't bother to participate in the discussion. Again, I do not take issue with your conclusions in this post, but rather the way that you arrive at your conclusions. I find it frustrating that you are apparently not seeing this distinction.<br><br>@otherotherZach - Thank you for citing a source. No, this is not new ground, but that fact does not render sources meaningless. In any case, "advertising" is not the same as "popular culture", though there is certainly a lot of interplay between the two.<br><br><a href=lesson-in-practical-magic.html#c6460514253187549443 title="comment permalink">10/27/11, 7:58 AM</a><br><br>

When I called you on the mischaracterization, you offered another, based on the really rather rude assumption that I was just pulling the statements I made out of my hat. Normally, the best description for someone who uses that sort of cheap debating tactics is that useful term "troll." <br><br>Now maybe you're the exception to that rule, but you know, if you're not sufficiently interested in the conversation to follow it from the beginning -- which you'll find <a href=../../2011/09/clarkes-fallacy.html rel=nofollow>here</a>, on the off chance that you'd like to do so -- I really fail to see any point in rehashing it for your benefit.

In which we have multiple, effective, fully-developed systems, yet if one simply mixes-and-matches techniques from different systems, it's easy to end up with something less than the sum of its parts?"<br><br>I don't know enough about martial arts to really give this question the full answer it deserves, but it is not *just* that the resulting whole can be less than the sum of its parts. <br><br>It is also that the human organism is not a universal skill-acquiring device. You cannot "undevelop" a skill that you once developed just to clear the way to developing a contrary skill. Can a body-builder like Arnold Schwarzenegger by any means "undevelop" his muscles and acquire a scrawny body, able to crawl through tight, narrow passages? Hardly! <br><br>As with the body, so with the mind, the soul and the spirit.<br><br>Again, some magical systems require the magician to develop skills that he will never after be able to "undevelop," should he wish to learn certain other systems that require opposite skills and opposite gifts.<br><br>When one tries "to distill some sort of simplified, universal system" from several magical systems, what one sometimes gets is not "another system," but no coherent result at all.
