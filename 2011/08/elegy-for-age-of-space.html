The orbiters are silent now, waiting for the last awkward journey that will take them to the museums that will warehouse the grandest of our civilization’s failed dreams. There will be no countdown, no pillar of flame to punch them through the atmosphere and send them whipping around the planet at orbital speeds. All of that is over.
<br> <br>In Houston, the same silence creeps through rooms where technicians once huddled over computer screens as voices from space crackled over loudspeakers. The screens are black now, the mission control rooms empty, and most of the staff have already gotten their pink slips. On the Florida coast, where rusting gantries creak in the wind and bats flutter in cavernous buildings raised for the sake of a very different kind of flight, another set of lauch pads sinks slowly into their new career as postindustrial ruins.
<br> <br>There are still rockets lifting off elsewhere, to be sure, adding to the globe’s collection of satellites and orbiting space junk. The International Space Station still wheels through the sky, visited at intervals by elderly Soyuz capsules, counting down the days and the missions until its scheduled deorbiting in 2016. In America, a few big corporations have manned space projects on the drawing boards, angling for whatever federal funding survives the next few rounds of our national bankruptcy proceedings, and a few billionaires here and elsewhere are building hobby spacecraft in roughly the same spirit that inspired their Gilded Age equivalents to maintain luxury yachts and thoroughbred stables.
<br> <br>Still, something has shifted. A tide that was expected to flow for generations and centuries to come has peaked and begun to ebb. There will still be rockets surging up from their launch pads for years or decades to come, and some few of them will have human beings on board, but the momentum is gone. It’s time to start coming to terms with the winding down of the age of space.
<br> <br>Ironically, one of the best pieces of evidence for that was the shrill reception given to an article in <i>The Economist</i> announcing <a href=http://www.economist.com/node/18897425>The End of the Space Age.</a> The irony was particularly delicious in that <i>The Economist</i> is a British periodical, and Britain has already been through its own retreat from space. During the first half of the 20th century, the British Interplanetary Society was among the most prestigious groups calling for manned space missions, but dreams of a British presence in space collapsed around the same time as Britain’s empire and industrial economy did. It’s hard to miss the schadenfreude in <i>The Economist</i>’s editorial stance, but it was even harder to overlook the bluster and denial splashed across the blogosphere in its wake.
<br> <br>A little perspective might be useful here. When the space shuttle first came off the drawing boards, the much-repeated theory was that it would be the first of a new breed of spacecraft that would make a flight from Cape Canaveral to orbit as commonplace as a flight from New York to Chicago. The next generation would swap out the shuttle’s disposable fuel tank and solid-fuel boosters for a fully reusable first stage that would take a shuttle-equivalent most of the way into orbit, then come back to Earth under its own power and get refueled for the next launch. Further down the road, but already in the concept phase, were spaceplanes that could take off from an ordinary runway and use standard jet engines to get to 50,000 feet or so, where rocket engines would cut in for the leap to orbit. Single-use rockets? In the minds of the space-savvy, they were already as outdated as Model T Fords.
<br> <br>Yet here we are in 2011, the space shuttle program is over, the replacements weren’t built, and for the five years of scheduled life the International Space Station has left, its crews will be getting there via the 1960s-era technology of Soyuz space capsules atop single-use rockets. As for the rest of the steps toward space everyone in the 1960s assumed we would have taken by now—the permanent space stations, the base on the Moon, the manned missions to Mars, and the rest of it—only the most hardcore space fans talk about them any more, and let’s not even discuss their chances of getting significant funding this side of the twelfth of never.
<br> <br>Mind you, I’m not cheering. Though I realized some years ago that humanity isn’t going to the stars—not now, not in the lifetime of our species—the end of the shuttle program with no replacement in sight still hit me like a body blow. It’s not just a generational thing, though it’s partly that; another large part of it was growing up where and when I did. By that I don’t just mean in the United States in the middle decades of the last century, but specifically in the triumphant years between John Glenn’s first orbital flight and Neil Armstrong’s final step onto lunar soil, in a suburb south of Seattle where every third family or so had a father who worked in the aerospace industry. Yes, I remember exactly where I was sitting and what was happening the moment that Walter Cronkite told the world that Apollo 11 had just landed on the Moon.
<br> <br>You didn’t grow up as a geeky, intellectual kid in that sort of setting without falling in love with space. Of course it didn’t hurt that the media was filled to the bursting point with space travel—turn on the tube any evening during my childhood, and if you didn’t get <i>Lost In Space</i> or <i>Star Trek</i> you’d probably catch <i>The Invaders</i> or <i>My Favorite Martian</i>—and children’s books were no different; among my favorites early on was <i>Ronnie Rocket and Suzie Saucer</i>, and I went from there to <i>The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet</i>, <i>The Spaceship Under the Apple Tree</i>—well, you get the picture. (I won’t even get into science fiction here; that’s a subject that deserves an entire post to itself.) Toys? The G.I. Joe accessory I treasured most in those days was a plastic Mercury space capsule with space suit to match; I also played with Major Matt Mason, Man In Space, and plenty of less efficiently marketed toys as well.
<br> <br>The future that most people imagined in those days had plenty of options primed to catch a young boy’s imagination, to be sure. Sealab—does <i>anybody</i> remember Sealab these days?—was the Navy’s attempt to compete with the romance of space, complete with breathless <i>National Geographic</i> articles about "a new world of limitless resources beneath the sea." (Ahem.) For a while, I followed Sealab as passionately as I did the space program, and yes, my G.I. Joe also had a wetsuit and scuba gear. That was common enough, and so were my less scientific fixations of the time, the monster lore and paranormal phenomena and the like; when you’re stuck growing up in suburbia in a disintegrating family and the only source of hope you can come up with is the prospect that the world isn’t as tepidly one-dimensional as everyone around you insists it has to be, you take encouragement where you find it.
<br> <br>You might think that a kid who was an expert on werewolf trivia at age ten would have gone in for the wildest of space fantasies, but I didn’t. <i>Star Trek</i> always seemed hokey to me. (I figured out early on that <i>Star Trek</i> was a transparent pastiche of mid-1960s US foreign policy, with the Klingons as Russia, the Vulcans as Japan, the Romulans as Red China, and Captain Kirk as a wish-fulfillment fantasy version of Gen. William Westmoreland who always successfully pacified his extraterrestrial Vietnams.) Quite the contrary; my favorite spacecraft model kit, which hung from a length of thread in my bedroom for years, was called the Pilgrim Observer: some bright kit designer’s vision of one of the workhorse craft of solar system exploration in the late 20th century.
<br> <br>Dilithium crystals, warp drives, and similar improbabilities had no place in the Pilgrim Observer. Instead, it had big tanks for hydrogen fuel, a heavily shielded nuclear engine on a long boom aft, an engagingly clunky command module up front bristling with telescopes and dish antennas—well, here again, you get the picture; if you know your way around 1970s space nonfiction, you know the kit. It came with a little booklet outlining the Pilgrim I’s initial flyby missions to Mars and Venus, all of it entirely plausible by the standards the time. That was what delighted me. Transporter beams and faster-than-light starflight, those were fantasy, but I expected to watch something not too far from Pilgrim I lifting off from Cape Canaveral within my lifetime.
<br> <br>That didn’t happen, and it’s not going to happen. That was a difficult realization for me to reach, back in the day, and it’s one a great many Americans are doing their level best to avoid right now. There are two solid reasons why the future in space so many of us thought we were going to get never arrived, and each one provides its own reasons for evasion. We’ve talked about both of them in this blog at various times, and there’s more than the obvious reason to review them now.
<br> <br>The first, simply put, is that the United States has lost the space race. Now of course it was less a single race than a whole track and field competition, with the first event, the satellite shot-put contest (winner: Russia, with Sputnik I), followed by the single-orbit dash (winner: Russia, with Vostok I) and a variety of longer sprints (winner: much more often than not, Russia). The run to the Moon was the first real US gold medal—we did half a dozen victory laps back out there just to celebrate—and we also scored big in the planetary probe toss competition, with a series of successful Mariner and Voyager missions that mostly showed us just how stunningly inhospitable the rest of the solar system was. The race that ultimately counted, though, was the marathon, and Russia’s won that one hands down; they’re still in space, and we aren’t.
<br> <br>Behind that unwelcome news is the great geopolitical fact of the early 21st century, the decline and imminent fall of the American empire. Like any number of empires before us, we’ve gotten ourselves wedged tightly into the predictable downside of hegemony—the stage at which the costs of maintaining the economic imbalances that channel wealth from empire to imperial state outstrip the flow of wealth those imbalances are meant to produce. Once that stage arrives, the replacement of the failing empire by some new distribution of power is a foregone conclusion; the only question is how long the process will take and how brutal the final cost to the imperial state will turn out to be.
<br> <br>The Cold War competition between the United States and the Soviet Union was a standard contest to see which empire would outlast the other. The irony, and it’s a rich one, is that the loser of that contest was pretty much guaranteed to be the winner in a broader sense. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia had an empire wrenched out of its hands, and as a result it was forced to give up the struggle to sustain the unsustainable. The United States kept its empire intact, and as a result it has continued that futile but obsessive fight, stripping its national economy to the bare walls in order to prop up a global military presence that will sooner or later bankrupt it completely. That’s why Russia still has a functioning space program, while the United States may have trouble finding the money to launch cheap fireworks by the time its empire finally slips from its fingers.
<br> <br>It’s our decidedly mixed luck, as discussed here more than once in the past, that America is entering on the downslope of its imperial decline just as a much vaster curve has peaked and begun to arc in the same direction. That’s the second reason that the space age is ending, not just for us but for humanity. In the final analysis, space travel was simply the furthest and most characteristic offshoot of industrial civilization, and depended—as all of industrial civilization depends—on vast quantities of cheap, highly concentrated, readily accessible energy. That basic condition is coming to an end around us right now. Petroleum has already reached its global production peak as depletion rates shoot past the rate at which new fields can be found and brought on line; natural gas and coal are not far behind—the current bubble in shale gas will be over in five or, just possibly, ten years—and despite decades of animated handwaving, no other energy source has proven to yield anything close to the same abundance and concentration of energy at anything like the same cost.
<br> <br>That means, as I’ve shown in detail in past posts here, that industrial civilization will be a short-lived and self-terminating phenomenon. It doesn’t mean, or at least doesn’t have to mean, that future civilizations will have to make do with an equivalent of the much simpler technological suites that civilizations used before the industrial age; I’ve argued at some length here and elsewhere that an ecotechnic society—a civilization that supports a relatively advanced technology on a modest scale using the diffuse and limited energy provided by sustainable sources, without wrecking the planet—is a live option, if not in the immediate future, then after the dark age the misguided choices of the recent past have prepared for us.
<br> <br>Still, of the thousands of potential technological projects that might appeal to the limited ambitions and even more strictly limited resources of some future ecotechnic society, space travel will rank very, very low. It’s possible that the thing will be done, perhaps in the same spirit that motivated China a little while back to carry out a couple of crisp, technically capable manned orbital flights; ten thousand years from now, putting a human being into orbit will still probably be the most unanswerable way for a civilization to announce that it’s arrived. There are also useful things to be gained by lofting satellites for communication and observation purposes, and it’s not at all impossible that now and then, over the centuries and millennia to come, the occasional satellite will pop up into orbit for a while, and more space junk will be added to the collection already in place.
<br> <br>That’s not the vision that fired a generation with enthusiasm for space, though. It’s not the dream that made Konstantin Tsiolkovsky envision Earth as humanity’s cradle, that set Robert Goddard launching rockets in a Massachusetts farmyard and hurled Yuri Gagarin into orbit aboard Vostok I. Of all people, it was historical theorist Oswald Spengler who characterized that dream most precisely, anatomizing the central metaphor of what he called Faustian civilization—yes, that’s us—as an eternal outward surge into an emptiness without limit. That was never a uniquely American vision, of course, though American culture fixated on it in predictable ways; a nation that grew up on the edge of vastness and cherished dreams of heading west and starting life over again was guaranteed to think of space, in the words of the <i>Star Trek</i> cliché, as "the final frontier." That it did indeed turn out to be our final frontier, the one from which we fell back at last in disarray and frustration, simply adds a mordant note to the tale.
<br> <br>It’s crucial to realize that the fact that a dream is entrancing and appeals to our core cultural prejudices is no guarantee that it will come true, or even that it can. There will no doubt be any number of attempts during the twilight years of American empire to convince Americans to fling some part of the energies and resources that remain to them into a misguided attempt to relive the dream and claim some supposed destiny among the stars. That’s not a useful choice at this stage of the game. Especially but not only in America, any response to the crisis of our time that doesn’t start by using much less in the way of energy and resources simply isn’t serious. The only viable way ahead for now, and for lifetimes to come, involves learning to live well within our ecological limits; it might also help if we were to get it through our heads that the Earth is not humanity’s cradle, or even its home, but rather the whole of which each of us, and our species, is an inextricable part.
<br> <br>That being said, it is far from inappropriate to honor the failed dream that will shortly be gathering dust in museums and rusting in the winds that blow over Cape Canaveral. Every civilization has some sprawling vision of the future that’s destined never to be fulfilled, and the dream of infinite expansion into space was ours. The fact that it didn’t happen, and arguably never could have happened, takes nothing away from the grandeur of its conception, the passion, genius, and hard work that went into its pursuit, or the sacrifices made on its behalf. Some future poet or composer, perhaps, will someday gather it all up in the language of verse or music, and offer a fitting elegy to the age of space.
<br> <br>Meanwhile, some 240,000 miles from the room where I write this, a spidery metallic shape lightly sprinkled with meteoritic dust sits alone in the lunar night on the airless sweep of Mare Tranquillitatis. On it is a plaque which reads WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND. Even if no other human eyes ever read that plaque again, as seems likely, it’s a proud thing to have been able to say, and a proud thing to have done. I can only hope that the remembrance that our species once managed the thing offers some consolation during the bitter years ahead of us.

It's a necessary part of human and planetary evolution ... and devolution.<br><br>As I read this post, I realized I already knew the Space Age was over, without having fully recognized it. The pictures from Hubble have helped to blunt that knowing -- seeing what human eyes will never see in person and pretending that maybe, someday, future humans will be there. <br><br>Looking back, the space age dreams of the 60's and 70's ended for me when Challenger blew up. Columbia confirmed it. Those two explosions took the fantasy and glamour away, replacing them with the reality of human frailty and the fact that our inventions reflect that very frailty -- they always have. <br><br>At the same time, I feel a relief. We can no longer divert ourselves with dreams of adventure on strange new worlds. Expansionist human history (including the Space Race) was based on myths of a species equivalent to the divine right of kings. That story still runs strong ... and I remember the few times when I've been in an area of natural disaster. Strangers came together. People who wanted nothing to do with each other were suddenly active parts of a momentary community of mutuality. There was heightened awareness of the actual workings of the ecosystems and environments around us. We knew we weren't in control. As a species, we are capable of that.

In the future, trash pickers sweeping over Florida will find the ruins of Cape Canaveral and write <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ruin rel=nofollow>a heart-wrenching poem</a>. For someone who lived through the space age, this will suffice.<br><br>Just as the material ability of the American empire peaked and curved downwards in the 1980s, and just as the world's material capacity for building and launching space rockets has only just peaked, there were a vast curve of the imagination throughout the 20th century; science fiction that did not just fulfill people's desires for excitement and distraction, but charged their imagination with the mystery of space. And the way it started was pure thrill: space is next, we're on our way there for sure, and we're going to have fun!<br><br>As the century went on, what we wanted to see in space became more mysterious, anticipatory, and religious: Lensman and Skylark were over the top, the original Star Trek may have been a little too silly, but the <i>promise</i> of unknown intelligences, challenging the human race with risk, knowledge, danger, became all the more important, and the space and SETI programs became the means to get these important sci-fi futures started in real life rather than ends unto themselves. This ended with Carl Sagan in a decidedly non-fiction series of books and films bidding us to go to space, not because something good was out there, but because it was our teleological duty. It is his distilled and perfected form of space worship that shows no signs of abating in 2011, and will likely still go on even after the Chinese space program fails.<br><br>And perhaps Saganism is not such a bad thing. Maybe, by the twists and turns of the human mind, it will lead to a happier society more aware of its nature and the nature of the world around it.<br><br><a href=#c6695847238354004039 title="comment permalink">8/24/11, 10:47 PM</a><br><br>

But hey, it folded, right? This, I think, is the clearest proof (among many) that the lunar landing was a glorious group fantasy, a prop erected by Hollywood East on an elaborate set of the epic film, "American Superiority". Too bad the pride couldn't have been earned, but it is typically American, isn't it, that we conduct our lives as a virtual reality exercise? That we arrogate to ourselves the capacity to create reality rather than merely live in it? Until people gain the capacity to emancipate themselves from identification with Americanism, they won't be able to place this fantasy event, or any other, into the psychological contexts where they really belong. Until then, murdering these myths, dreams and fantasies, once they have exceeded their useful lives, remains a delicate business.

Apart from whatever factual realities, the space program has been the ultimate icon of unlimited progress through technology. "We can and will conquer all limitations, go anywhere, do anything we please". As you so well note this is coming to an end. Big surprise, there are limits. So, what are the implications of this for the our collective identity and the stories of who and what we are? I think you've nailed a lot of it. <br><br>But one other quick thought: The space program was also part of leaving nature and also the local - or at least it was indicative of the shifting trend. This is gets into a discussion that's too much for a comment, but certainly traditional people lived with an experience of the sky, of the stars, that was central a feature of the natural world. But I think that we have been living with a different sort of sky. For us it's been a sort of sterile "frontier to be conquered" and not a place of natural wonder.<br><br>I think the space program has also been part of our having left an awareness of nature. From within the sterile, artificial, consumer world, we looked to a sterile "space" as the latest project, "the final frontier" as you note. By the late 20th century homo suburbus was no longer noticing the myriad subtleties of, for instance, the insects in the world. By that time, the various subtleties of the local, slow, wonders of the natural world were lost . By 1960 (I was 6) consciousness was already mostly colonized by the stuff of television, and space was a central piece of the emerging collective mythology. It is true that a few of us were still playing in the creeks and thickets, noticing the subtleties of dragonfly wings and decaying racoon carcases, but I'm afraid that now even that is lost to the I phone and lady GaGa. <br><br>I don't post much JMG - but I do love reading your blog every week.

We're not getting off the rock.<br><br>I am minded, too, of the ways in which the airlines are increasingly finding ways to add additional charges to the costs of flights. Part of the effect is to discourage people from bringing bags, or at least bringing them as "carry-on" luggage rather than stowing them in the hold... but ultimately these extra charges are symptoms of an industry that can't maintain the ticket and cost structure necessary to keep their planes in the air. <br><br>First we will be shut out of space, and then we will be shut out of the atmosphere.

Regards. Chris<br><br>This is in response to the issues Bill raised last week:<br><br>Hi Bill,<br><br>I have kept your words in quotes so that you have some context. I'd appreciate yours and others thoughts as the issues you raise are important.<br><br>“By the way, one thing I have noted in all this in recent years that may become very significant -- young men are feeling increasingly emasculated and at a loss to even identify what "masculine" is anymore. Watch your headlines for the backlash against this in the not-too-distant future, I expect.”<br><br>Agreed in part. The term masculine has little contemporary meaning. Traditional masculine roles bear little relevance to most males lives in industrial countries. I beg to differ though about the backlash and my reason for this is that a lot of males put themselves in a sole provider role within the family unit. Once unemployment inevitably creeps up they will not be able to conform with their accepted standard of this provider role. I reckon society is based upon conformity. Aren't people trained to conform from an early age? People in general seem to have difficulties adapting to new roles and situations. It's my observation that they hang onto the familiar beyond its use by date. The unfortunate outcome of this situation is though: despondency; dependency; and domestic violence. Backlash – no. My reasoning for this, most people tend to internalise their distress rather than externalising it – unless hope is lost and then all bets are off. A further reason for my thinking about the lack of a backlash is that most males will not depart from this provider role from fear and really, they lack the skills to see the bind for what it is. If you still don't believe me, have a look at what's become of traditional indigenous cultures – why would the middle/working class act any differently to them once their culture is undermined?<br><br>In most traditional cultures the female role is as highly valued as the male role – although they are different. One of the worst uses of fossil fuels was the emasculation of females. In contemporary culture, the household economy has apparently little value and this situation has been encouraged in order to boost consumption and increase workforce participation (ie. Workforce labour productivity). This benefits the few at the expense of the masses. What other society can indulge in this sort of behaviour for half of the population without adversely affecting their food production?<br><br>“JMG -- True; in the 1970s in response to feminism, young men just grew facial hair and wore their shirts open at the neck to reassert their masculinity.”<br><br>On the feminism debate – Wasn't the whole issue about being able to choose differently from your antecedents for women? Well, they do, but they also don't. I see few women opting to choose a different style of living over their parents. Women now tend to delay choices however, they still seem to opt for the same choices as their parents. Perhaps it's because they have few role models or they get little in the way of support if they do choose to do something different? Sounds much like your concerns about masculinity really. I’m thinking that you are looking at one side of a two sided argument. I also wonder whether when you speak about “reasserting” you actually mean “confusion” because fashions such as facial hair, whilst symbolic actually serve little purpose. Whilst we are discussing fashions, it's worth pointing out that the latest rebellion trend is tattoos on women. The problem with fashions is that it quickly becomes passe. It's also worth noting that many women now are competitive mothers. Have you noticed the one up man ship of natural births, breast feeding and pram size/brand over their peers choices? Is this any different to the, my job is more important / earns more than yours questions? I don't think so.<br><br>cont...<br><br><a href=#c5616149352349618119 title="comment permalink">8/25/11, 3:07 AM</a><br><br>

Take away the job and you take away the masculine identity. I think hypermasculinized super heros and gansters are an attempt at fantasy escape from the reality of being dependent on others to support you instead of you supporting others. Like everything else in the present day, image is used to attempt to substitute for unsatisfactory reality.”<br><br>Agreed. Early in my work life (1992) I was made redundant and it was a good life lesson in not putting your self-esteem in the hands of your employer. The problem with Super heroes is that they work as individuals, whilst successful long term cultures tend to work on co-operation. The super heroes are a myth whilst co-operation is considered a female trait in Industrial society and thus of little consequence. This is the old divide and conquer strategy writ large in our culture. How many males do you know that can ask for help, even when they really need it? The image of the lone cowboy as a cultural icon has run it’s course.<br><br>“I have long maintained that the mass culture plays the same disempowering game on men as on women, but using different strategies. In both cases it creates an ideal gender definition based on standards that inherently cannot be achieved by any but a small minority. For women this has been the beauty queen, June Cleaver, the supermodel, and now the supermom. For men the game is played out as power -- a real man is the one who is on top of the hierarchy, be he the gangster, the CEO, or the pro athlete.”<br><br>Agreed. It is a myth that is promulgated to either: sell us stuff; keep us busy; keep us out of mischief; or keep us docile. I'm not suggesting that evil overlords are responsible (or space lizards for that matter), it's simply a case of death by a thousand cuts. It's only sustainable whilst the energy and resources are flowing, beyond that it will have to revert back to an equilibrium and won't that be interesting?<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c2440753209019539787 title="comment permalink">8/25/11, 3:08 AM</a><br><br>

But the time comes to put aside childish things. I still think we <i>could</i> have made it (at least in theory), if we'd <i>really</i> tried - but it would have taken several decades of sustained, focussed effort of the sort that could never have been mustered in the face of the Cold War, or by a "free" market economy. To borrow from Knustler, SUVs, Cheez Doodles, and plastic salad shooters turned out to be more attractive, at least in the short term.<br><br>But still, the fact that my expectations of the future seem to have gone from "Have spacesuit, will travel", to something more like "Have <i>scythe</i>, will travel" is a bit of a kick in the teeth... ;)<br><br>At the end of the day, what space mostly had to offer was <i>dreams</i>. Now, I'm certainly not one to underestimate the importance of dreams, but once we got there, it turned out that dreams alone weren't enough. We haven't really colonised Antarctica, or the remote reaches of the Gobi desert - so why would we colonise the Moon? The fact that stories of space travel make gripping reading for geeky teenagers doesn't necessarily mean that it will turn out to be practically viable. Which brings us back to the need to put aside childish things...<br><br>Still, it was a nice dream while it lasted, and a good deal better than many of the other dreams our species has spent its time on over the millenia. It would be good if we could salvage something of that dream, even as we recognise that we will never live it. The image of the Earth seen from space is one of the most powerful, evocative, and <i>important</i> artefacts our culture has ever produced. All life, all human history, right here, on this pale blue dot, this mote floating in a sunbeam...

The war is background; the problem is declining resources and how the culture is making every effort to meet the problem. All right - so Brin's characters pull a technological rabbit out of a hat. That's not the theme, it's just the plot, and the rabbit is a side effect of them trying to solve another problem.<br><br>"Anathem" is far-future, not-earth-but ... and shows a fully developed culture, roughly late 20th C level, where fuel comes from fuel trees and "mining" is salvaging ruined cities, and civilization crashes have punctuated their recent (past 3500 years)history the way it did China's. And the theoreticians or anyone who wants to become one are herded into self-sufficient monasteries living on a very simple but healthy level. The makeshift that gets the heroes into space to meet an alien menace are what you'd expect of such a culture, and quite clever - and scary, unless you're 19 like the hero.

Joe Space capsule :-) We were supposed to be flying around like the Jetsons too now, and remember "2001: A Space Odyssey" with people flying between Earth and Jupiter on space jetliners? That was supposed to have happened ten years ago, a decade!<br><br>I remember when T.V. used to sign off at night; they had a short film of a jet pilot climbing higher and higher into the realm between sky and space, to "touch the face of God." <br><br>Which brings up another unspoken narrative that merges with the Manifest Destiny narrative that expanded from the frontier of the west to the frontier of space.<br><br>It is the ancient narrative of the Gnostics (and even older than they), the escape of the spirit from the material, the scientific afterlife. The idea that the material (aka the flesh, aka Earth) is polluting and a trap to the "real us", the spirit itself. In this case, to speed away from the "spirit trap" that is the drab Earth, and flight into the realm of spirit: the stars, the Milky Way, the Native American Road of the Dead, Heaven, the hosts of Angelic Hierarchy, the Planetary Spirits and the Zodiac and Constellations of heroic immortality.<br><br>And yet even if the dream had come true, and we had traveled the stellar realms, still we cannot escape Earth, for we ARE Earth. Although we are star stuff, our substance, our history, IS Earth. We can never escape Earth, for we cannot escape ourselves.<br><br>So different from that narrative, the speech of Chief Seattle (and yes, I am aware of the controversies of its origins and variations/editing), ...authentic it may not be, yet of truth it is:<br><br>"Your dead cease to love you and the land of their nativity as soon as they pass the portals of the tomb and wander away beyond the stars. They are soon forgotten and never return. Our dead never forget this beautiful world that gave them being. They still love its verdant valleys, its murmuring rivers, its magnificent mountains, sequestered vales and verdant lined lakes and bays, and ever yearn in tender fond affection over the lonely hearted living, and often return from the happy hunting ground to visit, guide, console, and comfort them. <br><br>...Ever part of this soil is sacred in the estimation of my people. Every hillside, every valley, every plain and grove, has been hallowed by some sad or happy event in days long vanished. Even the rocks, which seem to be dumb and dead as the swelter in the sun along the silent shore, thrill with memories of stirring events connected with the lives of my people, and the very dust upon which you now stand responds more lovingly to their footsteps than yours, because it is rich with the blood of our ancestors, and our bare feet are conscious of the sympathetic touch. Our departed braves, fond mothers, glad, happy hearted maidens, and even the little children who lived here and rejoiced here for a brief season, will love these somber solitudes and at eventide they greet shadowy returning spirits. And when the last Red Man shall have perished, and the memory of my tribe shall have become a myth among the White Men, these shores will swarm with the invisible dead of my tribe, and when your children’s children think themselves alone in the field, the store, the shop, upon the highway, or in the silence of the pathless woods, they will not be alone. In all the earth there is no place dedicated to solitude. At night when the streets of your cities and villages are silent and you think them deserted, they will throng with the returning hosts that once filled them and still love this beautiful land. The White Man will never be alone. <br><br>Let him be just and deal kindly with my people, for the dead are not altogether powerless."<br><br><a href=#c3203579343595429679 title="comment permalink">8/25/11, 5:17 AM</a><br><br>

For example, in an age of access to unbelievable quantities of available energy, I find it shameful that this largess facilitated great single-serving technological feats like space exploration while millions of American citizens - let alone the millions more in the developing world - went hungry, homeless, poorly clothed, and un-immunized.

After the last moonshot, all things 'space' seemed a bit anti-climatic.

It was one of the few programs that was openly progressive and presented a world (overly Cartesian perhaps) in which logic and common decency always prevailed and cynicism was nowhere to be found. On the other hand I won't weep much for the loss of manned space flights as I will soon be joining, under duress, the bold new no careers and no recognizable middle class economy. Having lost my position at a community college and unable to find other work I will soon be living on a very small farm owned by a close relative.

I didn't expect this one to get a response on this scale. Because of time limits I won't be able to respond to everyone this time around. Some comments, though: <br><br>Ryan, understood. It has to be said, but it's no fun to hear. <br><br>Bill, I'm quite sure Titan is quite hospitable to whatever's living there -- and I hope there is something chemosynthesizing, or slithering, or even having a conversation, there in the methane swamps. Still, part of the dream of space was the hope that the universe would be hospitable to us, and it's not. As for 2016, I didn't find a confirmed date change when I searched the point; we'll see. <br><br>Mtngirl, I hope more people take the end of the space age the way you have.<br><br>Avery, I'll be talking about a lot of that next week. <br><br>Matt, no, the shuttle -- at least in theory -- was the first step toward the transformation of space travel from a risky experiment to an ordinary part of life. Of course there were failures and casualties -- air travel involved similar risks at first, and jets still fall out of the sky now and then. It's just that the wealth and the resources to follow up on those first steps weren't there and, in the final analysis, couldn't have been there. <br><br>Surio, I wasn't aware that space was as big a thing in India, though I'm not surprised. Dmitri's quote is priceless--and of course he's quite right; in America, as elsewhere, we have exactly the politicians we deserve. <br><br>Vic, I got that same program!<br><br>Mustard, I like pointing out that most of the numbers that put human footprints on the Moon were crunched using slide rules. You want rocket science? A good log/log slide rule, that's rocket science. <br><br>Isjarvi, I've always thought of the "fake moon landing" business as the least convincing and, if I may be blunt, the most despicable of the various giddy conspiracy theories fashionable these days. I've known quite a few people who worked on the Apollo project and other space projects. Since it's a choice between your handwaving and innuendo and their detailed, consistent accounts (backed up with plenty of documentation) and full of pride in a difficult job well done, well, let's just say I have no doubt who to believe. <br><br>Ichabod, I'm not sure that the quest for a sterile cosmos played all that huge a role in it, though it was there. Do you remember when the first images of the moons of Jupiter came back from Voyager -- how awestruck the space scientists were, looking at the dazzling landscapes of a dozen little worlds? That was the same fascination you turned toward a dragonfly's wings.<br><br><a href=#c6147270430041568661 title="comment permalink">8/25/11, 10:33 AM</a><br><br>

I don't think we'll be entirely shut out of the stmosphere -- hot air balloons are cheap and sustainable, and I'm guessing that once people stop thinking of airplane engineering as a matter of using lots of energy to force something through the sky, and get to work on the lessons learned by sailplane pilots and ultralights, light planes may be part of the human heritage for the long term. Certainly I hope so. <br><br>Macro, just don't let that dream blind you to the hard work ahead of us here and now. <br><br>Andy, I think we could have done more than we did. The great migration into space? Not a chance -- but it would have been good to know a little more about the solar system before the Long Night (if I may borrow an Asimovism) closes in. <br><br>Les, excellent! That sounds like a first-rate project; please keep the <a href=http rel=nofollow>Green Wizards forum</a> posted on hos it goes. It would be good to see a bunch of shops like that scattered around the world. <br><br>Raven, presumably you've heard of Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain, for example. It's been a lot more than a couple of generations since then!<br><br>Grrl, thanks for the tips. I've read very little recent science fiction for the last couple of decades, largely because the obsessive rabbits-out-of-hats and the future cliches (how many more times do we have to sit through yet another cyberpunk corporation-run geek future?) that seemed to obsess so many writers. Still, I've been considering Stephenson, and may break down and read a thing or two of his one of these days. <br><br>Siani, you're welcome. And you're right, of course; the dreams don't die, even if they don't come true. <br><br>Lance, whoever wrote the Chief Seattle speech, it's worth reading in its entirety, and thinking about, hard. <br><br>Mister Roboto, did you ever have the chance to read Jacques Vallee's <i>Passport to Magonia</i>? It's one of the UFO books nobody in the UFO scene these days talks about, precisely because it asks the hard questions about the parallels between UFO lore, faery lore, etc. <br><br>Mary, thanks for the quote!<br><br>Nodsavid, dreaming the impossible dream is free; it's trying to make it happen that costs. Whatever the future may hold in the very long term, right now our job is to make a successful landing here on Earth, and establish a sustainable colony on this strange and challenging planet.<br><br><a href=#c8029640819814245629 title="comment permalink">8/25/11, 10:51 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, Lewis was as uaual on top of such things; it's not often remembered that he and Tolkien were both avid readers of pulp science fiction between the wars, and wrote much of their own work in response to it; that's how the standard "the stars are ours!" rhetoric got so efficiently parodied in Weston's mouth, and how Tolkien ended up putting Madame Blavatsky's Atlantis, hook, line, and sinker (by way of scores of heavily Theosophy-influenced fantasy stories) into Middle Earth. <br><br>Adrian, thanks for catching that. To my mind it's the one really important suggestion in the post. As for weather satellites, good gods. If there's one thing that would be worth keeping from the age of space, that's it -- but of course an empire in decline can't see things that way. <br><br>Mustard, thank you, but it's going to take something a little more on the scale of <i>The Iliad</i> to do justice to the theme. <br><br>Eric, thank you!<br><br>Kenaz, oh, granted. It's just that neither you nor I have much influence on what silly pipe dream the last resources of the industrial world get wasted on. <br><br>William, you don't misread.

Being born in 1964, I grew up assuming that humans would live and work in space. I knew enough physics to understand that Star Trek was never a possibility, but at least we would establish ourselves on the moon, near-earth asteroids and at the earth-moon L2 point, with Mars as a distant possibility. While I <i>mentally</i> accepted that this wasn't going to happen a while ago, watching the last shuttle launch really hammered it home: Ain't gonna happen.<br><br>I remember SEALAB III and all the strangeness surrounding it until it was finally scrapped. I seem to recall Cousteau messing about in a submerged soup can that looked similar to the original SEALAB as well. And of course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQsceAylvyU" rel=nofollow>Hello Down There</a>.

On the evening of my seventh birthday, our suburban neighbors gathered in our no-longer-gravel, now-asphalt-paved suburban street and pointed up at the shining Russian satellite as it passed in the blackness overhead – and the adults called it Russian, not Soviet. The Russians were up there, over America.<br> <br>The adults were very serious. This was an unacceptable development, and the adults were going to do something about it.<br><br>Part of the adult response was when Congress passed the National Defense Education Act in 1958. The Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) and the Physical Sciences Study Committee (PSSC) resulted, and major changes were made in science education.<br><br>My high school friends and I were the beneficiaries of that change in science education, which was based on hands-on experiments which rigorously taught the scientific method, unlike today’s memorization and endless test-taking which leaves "No Child Left Undumbed".<br><br>At the time, though, it didn’t seem to be working for me.<br><br>I was one of thirty students in Mr. Hunt’s Honors Physics class. Over the blackboard hung a five-foot long, fully-functional Pickett slide rule. Years earlier, Mr. Hunt had taught Pickett physics, and Pickett had built and presented the tool to the school in appreciation, and to help us learn to be good scientists.<br> <br>I was sick one day, and when I came back to school, my classmates said, “Boy, was Mr. Hunt mad at you! He said that he’d just learned that you were about to be named a National Merit Scholarship Semifinalist, and he said that you hadn’t done any work in his class all year. He said that you were the worst underachiever in the history of the school!”<br><br>Since we had over 1,000 kids in our graduating class, and Mr. Hunt had taught for decades, I felt quite honored: I was outstanding in a crowd of 30,000. At least I wasn’t average.<br><br>The scientific method must have sunk in by osmosis, though. I eventually won some research awards and got a patent, although I never made much money - not even the debt-backed, unreal paper that we currently refer to as “money”.<br><br>But as an adolescent teen-ager, my priorities were different.<br> <br>Priority #1 was learning about girls; and priority #2 was learning to play bass guitar, since playing in a rock band was a great way to meet girls – not necessarily the sort of girls that you would want to marry, but interesting girls nonetheless, in their own way; exciting, adventurous girls that you could do exciting, adventurous things with and make your adolescent mistakes with so that when you finally met a nice, sensible adult woman who you could have a mature relationship with, then you would already have gotten the adolescent mistakes and immature craziness out of your system, and you could enjoy a happy, stable marriage.<br><br>Sort of like the American space program: As adolescents, we Americans did exciting, adventurous things for a while and some of those things were spectacularly successful and some of those things just totally blew up in our faces; and now we have to settle down to the mature realities of living here with Ma Gaia, where you learn that as an adult, you have to limit your exciting, adventurous activities for your own good.<br> <br>But as long as you stay within those limits, you can still have lots and lots of mature, adult fun.<br> <br>Within limits, of course.<br><br><a href=#c8306543655508972077 title="comment permalink">8/25/11, 11:44 AM</a><br><br>

The sadness hit me at that time, since like you apparently, I grew up a total sci-fi geek. Still am, to be truthful. But as a sci-fi connoiseur, I will soldier on; there is still quite a lot of excellent futuristic fiction to be read (and written) which doesn't involve passing beyond the Earth/Moon Trojan Points. And yes, I remember Sealab quite fondly.<br><br>I survived the sadness of your implications here. Just like I did with D&amp;D so many decades ago, I am ready to draw a line and say that fantasy is on one side, and reality is on the other. I will enjoy reading (and also <a href=http://www.processedworld.com/Issues/issue2001/pw2001_95-99_Already_a_Winner.pdf rel=nofollow>writing!</a>) a good sci-fi yarn for years to come, but you have convinced me that the Columbus-like interstellar voyages belong in the realm of fantasy, not fiction. Convincing me of that is no small feat, I assure you.<br><br>Ironically enough, all you have really done is prove how apt the imagining of <i>Star Trek</i> really was. The Columbus-like interstellar voyages of discovery I just mentioned, the space wars and alien alliances, all those tropes and memes throughout almost all popular sci-fi from Asimov to the present day... those memes were products of the optimism and the politics of the late-'50s/early-60s. Therefore it is only fitting that the iconic image we have of space travel is the original <i>Star Trek</i>, where 52% of the crew went out into interstellar space dressed in a uniform of beehive hairdos, low necklines, micro-mini-skirts, and go-go boots with stiletto heels. If the meme of human interstellar travel is to be forever chained to that bygone decade, then isn't it only fitting that we envision those clothing fashions and the "I Grok Spock" hippy sixties culture when we think of space travel?<br><br>:D<br><br><a href=#c8685144536798748466 title="comment permalink">8/25/11, 12:20 PM</a><br><br>

But I still think the above qualifies as an accurate distillation.<br><br>Since -without fusion or some other form of near-limitless sci-fi energy source- that kind of "Space Age" notion of a future where folks are constantly whizzing around orbital, sub-lunar, and inner-solar for some vague reason- wasn't feasible, and never made much sense, I tend to focus on the practical reasons for the thing.<br><br>Basically, my take is that the "Space Race" had been an excellent catalyst/cover for aerospace, missile, and general "high" tech development during the "hot" years of the Cold War. So the Money Boys and Military Boys, demonstrating one of their unfortunate mental habits, figured the "Space Shuttle" and "Space Stations" could do the same for aerospace, space-warfare, and "high" tech development in the waning years of the same pseudo-war, and so they threw their weight behind it.<br><br>By the '90s it became clear -to them- that "computer" tech negated the need for human operators of space machines/weapons and the Cold War wasn't coming back as a raison d'etre for near-pointless research budgets. Also, the worthwhile research - potential impactors, potential lifeforms, general surveys of objects, data for astronomers, physicists, etc.- did little or nothing to secure second homes in the Hamptons nor non-combat promotion.<br><br>So they drop the "Space Shuttle".<br><br>Other interests try and hold it together for awhile, it carries the momentum of a Government program, 15-20 years later -and over late- it's dead.<br><br>(Please note that I am not imagining shadowy conspiracies in the above, just the separation between funds generation and allocation and public and participant enthusiasms and dreams.)<br><br>You all talk about an "elegy", but I feel like I'm at a wake for a dummy! :)<br><br>Seems to me that the Space Shuttle, NASA, and the older generation's concept of a "Space Age" ran into an insurmountable wall of "Why Bother?" when I was 7 years old, and now they have finally given up and stopped bashing themselves against that all.<br><br>But, nice essay in any case. :)<br><br>I agree with a poster above that these last two have had a special quality in the writing. Not that your prose and what-have-you is not always top notch, but there is a... force... to these two essays that is not always there. Really good stuff IMHO.<br><br>And lastly I would highly recommend Stephenson to you -he has grown much since "Snowcrash".<br><br>But I wouldn't start with "Anathem" if I was you. I found it to be one of his best, but it presupposes a world of -generally, there are historical collapses - current tech sustained for 3,000 plus years. There are clever tricks employed to make this work. But in the end, a couple of arbitrary-feeling ancient achievements in genetic engineering are necessary to provide the world with, amongst other things, the "Fuel Trees" that substitute for Fossil Fuels and "Allswell" a chemical inserted into food crop DNA that induces background contentment in the people that eat that food.<br><br>I would recommend "The Baroque Cycle" though. Since those books are set in the historical past, his writerly abilities can shine without possible LOL tech-utopia moments.<br><br>-Matt.<br><br><a href=#c3617543958002612840 title="comment permalink">8/25/11, 2:43 PM</a><br><br>

A flooding sea of hot air; it seemed as if someone had left a bakery door open. The heat pulsed among the cottages and bushes and children. The icicles dropped, shattering, to melt. The doors flew open. The windows flew up. The children worked off their wool clothes. The housewives shed their bear disguises. The snow dissolved and showed last summer's ancient green lawns.<br>Rocket summer. The words passed among the people in the open, airing houses. Rocket summer. The warm desert air changing the frost patterns on the windows, erasing the art work. The skis and sleds suddenly useless. The snow, falling from the cold sky upon the town, turned to a hot rain before it touched the ground.<br>Rocket summer. People leaned from their dripping porches and watched the reddening sky.<br>The rocket lay on the launching field, blowing out pink clouds of fire and oven heat. The rocket stood in the cold winter morning, making summer with every breath of its mighty exhausts.

The diverse and constantsly squabbling assortment of power centers and pressure groups that make up imperial America's political class don't have a single agenda -- and if they did, the chance that they'd keep to it for decades at a stretch is less than minimal. I'll be discussing at some length, down the road a bit, the popular fantasy that a single, well-organized "them" is responsible for all the dumb decisions of the last half century or so. <br><br>In the meantime, I'd suggest instead that back in the 70s, when the space shuttle was first funded, the coalition of interests that wanted a major space program -- for a wide range of reasons, to be sure, many of them venial as all get-out -- was able to build enough of a base to make a major step in the direction they wanted to go, but then lost momentum and support, and weren't able to keep opposing interests from diverting the funds to other pet projects.

We took the simple-minded, inefficient, bureaucratic, pour-incomprehensible-amounts-of-money-time-and-energy-into-it approach because that was the path of least resistance. It hasn't needed to be anything else, because NASA is pretty much a jobs/money-diversion program as stated.<br><br>You don't strictly need fossil fuels: rocket fuel is hydrogen and oxygen, products of hydrolysis, old-school fuel.<br><br>You don't need computers: as stated, slide rules got us there.<br><br>You don't need to take such extreme safety precautions that in the end you create a degree of complexity that winds up being the biggest source of danger in itself: in the final analysis life really is pretty cheap. We spend a great deal of our mental energies trying to tell ourselves otherwise, but that don't make it so. Conk someone over the head and shove them in a capsule galley-slave style or offer an actuarially laughable premium in salary to put their life on the line fisherman style and you've got yourself an astronaut, if they don't sign up just for the thrill. It's always somebody else's rocket that's going to blow up, not mine, at least if I made the choice to get on it.<br><br>You don't really have to manufacture everything here and launch it and it's fuel up the gravity well: there are some pretty good raw materials up there relatively untouched by entropy for the past 5 billion years to work with. It doesn't necessarily have to be pretty, it only needs to work. Again, we never really went down that path partly because we never really needed to.<br><br>We took one specific, kludgy, doomed-to-failure approach to space because that was the path of least resistance given the current situation. Don't mean that's the only way.<br><br><a href=#c7917252994875082339 title="comment permalink">8/25/11, 6:07 PM</a><br><br>

It is very, very good, and it shows that you wrote it from some inner depth, that the subject truly mattered to you.

I am a pretty serious sci-fi buff, though, and I've read the classics, Assimov, Clarke, etc. <br><br>While it is sad to think that space exploration is dead for the foreseable future, because it plainly is, there's no way of knowing what will happen father into the future. I still think there could be advancements in certain scientific areas in the future. And it doesn't take sci-fi pseudo-science to envision a utility for space travel. The main problem is the gravity well, i.e getting enough payload into orbit. If that can be done in the future in a cheaper way, or if someone in the future is willing to do it on a longer time-frame (think hauling components for a spacecraft for 20+ years, to be assembled in orbit), there are a lot of things that could be done, even on the inhospitable solar system. There's a lot of energy in outer space, both from potential large solar panels, as well as the possibility of using nuclear power withouth fear of pollution, and a lot of raw materials. In a way, perhaps the dream of colonizing space with human habitats (a parallel of the colonization of America and other parts of earth), which is as difficult as to be pratically impossible and of doubtful utility is something that we ought to leave behind, replacing it with a more prosaic vision of space as a complementary part of earth, in the role of factory floor, perhaps.<br><br>There's also something to be said about the philosophical side of space travel, as Bill said it.<br><br><a href=#c2884681107380301649 title="comment permalink">8/25/11, 8:58 PM</a><br><br>

I'm of a younger generation, but I still was quite into space exploration fantasies when I was a child. I was also interested in any other stories that involved strange and unusual (from my perspective) ways of living, which included primitive tribes as well as space exploration.<br><br>However, I pretty much lost all my interest in space when I realized that the solar system was inhospitable to human life and traveling beyond was pretty unlikely because if interstellar travel was feasible the galaxy would likely have been colonized long ago. At the same time, I was realizing the immense ecological impact of space travel and decided that the exploration of all the undervalued aspects of planet Earth were more interesting than any space fantasy. I haven't kept up with anything space-related for years with one exception, I do still think the ongoing discoveries about extrasolar planets are interesting enough for me to check up on every once in a while, even though we'll never go there in person. However even that knowledge I'd trade for greater wisdom about ecological matters any day. Radio communication such as the Star's Reach scenario would be pretty interesting, but I'm not betting on it. <br><br>The end of the manned space mission however has little emotional impact on me, and I admit my bafflement similar to what Bill said that so many here, who've read other posts concerning things that will have so much more impact on all our lives than the end of a space program that only involved a small percentage of people, choose to say this post is the saddest one they've read.<br><br><a href=#c5531843213678067757 title="comment permalink">8/25/11, 9:55 PM</a><br><br>

The Dream is too powerful to just roll over and die. And, frankly, I'm still holding out hope that it'll get us out of this mess.<br>In the 1970s, O'Niell spelled out in a book called "The High Frontier" a vision of a future where we spread out in giant space stations, funded by solar power sent back to Earth to maintain industrial civilisation. It was a conscious plan to short-circuit the Limits to Growth that were being acknowledged then, and if we hadn't collectively turned our backs on reality in the 80s, we'd likely have Island One instead of ISS. <br>Thing is, that plan isn't dead. As long as there's a glimmering of industry on Earth, you'll be dealing with the dreamers. Those billionaires? It's not gilded age copious consumption. I've met people who travel at the top of New Space circles, and they all dream the dream. It's mostly true believers. <br>There's a few sci-fi titles dealing with resource-constrained space programs. Niven-Pournelle's "King David's Spaceship" and Poul Anderson's "Orion Will Rise" both have visions of how we can get back Up There, even with civilisation knocked back.<br>Orion, in case you've forgotten, is Dyson's plan to launch a ship with atomic bombs. <br>Speaking as a spacer, we can get our hands on some nukes, we'll use them. A little more fallout (a few more bombs on top of the ~2000 already tested) is a small price to pay to save the civilisation that's keeping most of us alive, we think.<br>Wang's Verne Gun would harness an underground nuclear test (no detectable fallout) to launch 280,000 tons to orbit; more than enough to kick-start an orbital economy. One bomb, and we get enough space-solar-power to save Western Civilisation. <br>I know, this is way too techno-triumphalist for this blog. You'll say I still buy into the myth of human progress; maybe I do, though I think that every major decision since at least the 1900s on was in error... some progress. <br>I just haven't given up. You know how the Captain goes down with the ship? More often than not, the Engineer goes, too.

To me that made it clear that either we are the first technological civilization to arise in the entire galaxy, or that interstellar travel is impossible. The first seemed extremely unlikely, so I accepted the second as the likely truth. This still left the option for interplanetary travel within our own solar system, of course. As the years went on and I began to understand better the fundamental thermodynamic limits on civilization, however, that began to seem less likely as well. Couple this with what had become of manned space flight (short haul space-truckers never leaving low earth orbit), and the odds of other-world travel as anything but an extreme and rare accomplishment seemed to vanish.<br><br>I did have one brief resurgence in those hopes, though: cold fusion. When that was first announced, I thought if it panned out that really could be a fundamental game changer about everything in the near and distant future. But that all evaporated much too quickly, and the Fermi Paradox still looms large.<br><br>Recent discoveries about the likelihood of extraterrestrial life actually seem to make the prospects even bleaker. We now know that planets are everywhere, it seems just about every star has a whole herd of them. Just within our own solar system, measurements of the atmospheric chemistry of Titan show signs of some exotic processes taking place there, that might be consistent with biological activity of some new and exciting form. Two living worlds around one unremarkable star! Very recent studies on the jump from unicellular to multicellular life are suggesting that it too might be evolutionarily a fairly easy leap, not a huge chasm. Put all this together and it suggests we are likely living in a galaxy swarming with living beings. Yet, no sign of space travelers when we look to the heavens -- just our own aircraft and low-orbit satellites. The silence is deafening. <br><br>Unrelated note - I now actually have a bottle in the pantry labeled "Snake Oil." It is for oiling snake skins, of course (really mostly glycerine). Works great, too! I thought that would amuse you, JMG.<br><br><a href=#c8637045126104206384 title="comment permalink">8/26/11, 9:53 AM</a><br><br>

Mystery and earth bound adventure novels did it for me. Yet, when I read the third to last paragraph, I received a gut punch. The mental flash was as vivid, poignant and visceral as a real thump. I felt no loss, per say, when reflecting about my reaction but instead a realisation that the well trod path can no longer be followed.<br><br>Strangely, I keep thinking of Richard Nixon, and laterly Jimmy Carter. Nixon seems, given the light of time, to be like a tragic Greek hero; personally flawed but with redeeming features. Carter had the ability to tell the truth as he saw it, with a clarity and well supported data, but tragically held office when the world decided the truth was too hard to follow. Both people, imo, had some larger vision or sense of responsibility - a sense that their efforts in office were more than the sum of themselves. They expressed the energy of their era.<br><br>It is all too easy to contrast them with self serving politicians of today who have no agenda above what they can personally benefit from holding office, or so it seems. Across the world politicians and other types of leaders fail to inspire. Cynicism manifests itself with every word our so-called leaders utter. <br><br>I suppose the "thump" was a realisation that real and profound change has occurred, coming into focus with a bit more clarity. The human world is not only facing a physical shortage of energy but also a corresponding loss of directional energy. There is a tangible ebb.<br><br>And maybe this ebb might be a redeeming feature because us suped-up monkies have a whole heap of manners to learn before we go off visiting our celestial neighbors. The idea, as proposed by some people, that we need to populate the universe and take yet more resources from distant worlds is surreal beyond belief. How about we clean up our own back gardens first. Maybe the humility signpost is the first one we should be looking for as we begin our new directional trek on earth.<br><br>slán agus síocháin, make do and mend<br><br><a href=#c6773210395332752743 title="comment permalink">8/26/11, 2:54 PM</a><br><br>

Not a bad metaphor for our current situation, either. <br><br>Guilherme, I don't doubt that any future human civilization that has the technical chops and the spare resources to try the thing will at least look into getting a few satellites into orbit, and it's always possible that things will go a bit past there. Beyond that, well, I've posted here at length about how the supposed economies of space miss the fact that three-quarters of all economic value used by human beings on Earth come free of charge from the biosphere, and you don't have that advantage in orbit; the additional costs make any good or service that can be produced onworld much more economical. <br><br>Freelander, I read O'Neill when his stuff first came out. You'll notice that he paid zero attention to the economics of the thing. Sure, if you have a few quadrillion dollars to spare, not to mention equivalent stocks of energy and resources that don't have any other use, you might be able to attempt the thing; care to suggest where you're going to get those? (And don't tell me you're going to get the resources from space, either; that happens only after a huge, and hugely expensive, infrastructure is built down here and hauled into orbit.) <br><br>Ozark, well, maybe it was just a generational thing, then. <br><br>Matt, it's hardly a secret. Ditch both the conventional wisdom purveyed in the media and the equal and opposite version heavily marketed to the fringe; track what happens to pressure groups and power centers as they move in and out of coalitions, and gain and lose power; notice how often the conspiratorial fringe has to change its nominees for Secret Masters of Everything because the previous candidates are pretty obviously on the outside looking in this year; study historical equivalents that have been dead long enough that historians have had the chance to spread out everybody's dirty laundry for all to see, and you'll soon get a working grasp of how the branch of primate dominance behavior we call political power actually works in the real world. I highly recommend it; over and above its practical uses, it's highly entertaining to watch. <br><br>Dragonfly, excellent! Glad to hear it. <br><br>Cherokee, I've noticed the pattern too, and find it irritating. Mind you, I'm nearly out of practical suggestions -- the toolkit I know well enough to propose to others, the Green Wizardry of the Seventies appropriate-tech era, has pretty much been covered over the last year and a bit -- so I'm probably going to have to focus on ideas and perspectives for a while. Getting your hands dirty building or digging or doing something is still probably more useful. <br><br>Thijs, fascism in the strict sense -- that is, populist authoritarianism with a taste for flashy uniforms -- was very nearly the default option in American SF from the 30s through the coming of the New Wave in the 60s; there were notable exceptions, such as Asimov, but the genre was chockfull of square-jawed heroes brushing aside such feckless bourgeois nitpicking as the rule of law to blow up the baddies, save the world and become Grand Gorgonzola of Everything. <i>Dune</i> is par for the course; it's more blatant about it because Herbert was a more systematic thinker. I can still read <i>Dune</i> with enjoyment, just as I enjoy Tolkien despite the ghastly racial ideology of Numenorean <i>herrenvolk</i> and Orcish <i>untermenschen</i> that pervades the whole mythos; it's a matter of making allowances for an author's time and culture.<br><br><a href=#c3991906496767941529 title="comment permalink">8/26/11, 3:20 PM</a><br><br>

Straining at gnats and swallowing camels was a habit John Campbell communicated to that whole end of the SF continuum. Still, pessimism? Not at all; I'm an optimist -- I think that humanity has enormous potentials ahead of it, once it gets past the childish notion that big fast noisy machines are what matters in life. <br><br>Bill, oh, granted -- and of course I've talked about groceries before, and will be talking about them again. <br><br>Rudi, that was indeed one of the things worth celebrating. As I've mentioned, I'm sure that people will do fascinating, daring, and epochal things far into the future -- just not the kind of thing that involves leaving the atmosphere. <br><br>Karim, true enough. The hurricane rolling its way up the Atlantic coast of the US right now, under close watch from satellites, is a reminder of the ecotechnic value of a good view from orbit. <br><br>Hal, all too true. <br><br>Tyler, well, let me ask you this: what are you personally doing to make that dream happen? If you're willing to commit your own money, time, and effort to it, more power to you; I think you're dead wrong, as wrong as the folks who think they can make an upgraded Farnsworth fusor (aka Bussard reactor) solve the energy crisis; but I have nothing but respect for the people who are building fusors in their basement, or helping to fund the ones who are. If you're not doing anything for the sake of the dream but arguing on the internet, though, you're wasting your breath and my time. <br><br>Bill, it took me longer to work through the logical implications of the Fermi paradox -- less of a math background, probably -- but yes, that's a pretty solid argument; it was interfacing that with <i>The Limits to Growth</i> and a good basic knowledge of thermodynamics that brought me to my own conviction that interstellar travel is unavailable to intelligent life forms due to energy limits. <br><br>Ric, I was frankly surprised not to face a mass invasion of techno-triumphalists insisting that we are, too, going to the stars! Yes, there have been a few, but I think the awareness that the dream is over is becoming more and more widespread. It's a good thing; once we accept that here we are, maybe we can get to work dealing with our problems, rather than trying to run away from them into space. <br><br>Adrian, one of these days I have to write a book on the occult and the Inklings. (Gareth Knight did one years ago, but I found it very unsatisfactory.) Tolkien borrowed extensively from the Theosophists, Lewis displays a great deal of familiarity with practical occultism in his space trilogy -- the summoning of the Oyarses in <i>That Hideous Strength</i> is for my money the best description of a planetary evocation in print -- and then there's Charles Williams and Owen Bsrfield, who were occultists plain and simple. It's only the fact that most contemporary Christians insist there's no such thing as a Christian occultist that keeps all that from being widely discussed.<br><br><a href=#c6476241225734761054 title="comment permalink">8/26/11, 3:42 PM</a><br><br>

It doesn't address our needs as social beings, and it certainly doesn't address our spiritual needs -- with a lot of sci-fi implicitly rejecting the idea that we even have the latter needs, all the while setting up the leap to space as a kind of secular soteriology.<br><br>When the last space shuttle mission was launched, I knew I would regret not paying more attention, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. It wasn't a lack of time so much as not wanting to have to face the fact that, between its failed promises and my own disillusionment, the space program had already lost all of its charm for me.<br><br>And that's definitely something to mourn, because once upon a time, it really was something grand.<br><br><a href=#c6842702202389898452 title="comment permalink">8/26/11, 6:12 PM</a><br><br>

I'll mention my response in a comment once I've finished it. <br><br>Tyler, if you're doing something practical about your vision I have no further complaints; get out there and prove me wrong. It's the people who think that arguing on the internet is an effective response to the crisis of our time that I can do without. <br><br>Thijs, well, of course there's that. To my taste, it's still a ripping good story, and the glimpses of an approach to human potential that doesn't involve just replacing it with machines are good as fodder for thinking. <br><br>Hector, that's funny, because my immediate response to your example was to suggest you look at the forest rather than the trees. Of course the ISS turned into a boondoggle -- it ended up serving to give the space shuttle somewhere to go, just as the shuttle ended up serving mostly as a way to get to the ISS. You get such boondoggles in a corrupt and decaying empire. Look at the broader picture. <br><br>To get a relatively small object into orbit with minimal infrastructure already in space, and a relatively simple industrial technology, a chemical rocket isn't a bad tool at all, and if you need people in space, neither are space capsules, whether we're talking Soyuz, Shenzhou, or Apollo. The more exotic means of getting into orbit that have been proposed from time to time are vaporware, and like all vaporware, look very good in theory; whether any of them will work in practice, or can even be tested without outlays on a scale we can no longer afford, is quite another question. <br><br>As for my comments about your attitude, I wasn't doubting your intellectual honesty, I was questioning your compassion. A willingness to see human lives casually sacrificed for the sake of space travel, or anything else, suggests a lack of concern for the lives of the people you say you want to help that I find less than comforting. <br><br>Cherokee, no apologies needed. Those who won't listen, won't listen; those who will listen but won't do anything, well, some might squeeze through by chance; the ones who listen and act are the ones for whom these posts are written. <br><br>Lance, we can certainly do some very important exploring, though I'm less than impressed by what I've seen so far of attempts to explore physical places by nonphysical means. More on this in a later post. <br><br>Whiffle, excellent. I'll be discussing the evaporation of meaning from popular SF in an upcoming post; for now, let's just say that I think you've got hold of one end of a very important clue.<br><br><a href=#c7058615712652497665 title="comment permalink">8/26/11, 7:46 PM</a><br><br>

I've read Richard Heinberg's (now why do I always make the mistake of thinking Heinlein) <i>The Party is Over</i>when it first came out a few years ago (it made me want to offer the man a place in my lifeboat), but having in quick succession read a few dozen more on the same subject , I can no longer claim to be familiar with its contents.

He now delves into economics and so forth, so one of his later books might fit the bill even better. I guess that what I am stumblingly trying to express is a wish for a book that makes everything clear <i>in retrospect</i>. All other books seem mainly to be about convincing their audience prior to the fact -- what happened, is happening and will happen. However, I'd like to see a book that explained what has happened to our civilization <i>after the fact</i> - one that assumes that its audience already knows that their way of life has crumbled, but has no idea why,and who are the verge of pointing fingers.<br><br>I note what you had to say to Matt in a previous comment, and I personally look forward to gaining "a working grasp of how the branch of primate dominance behavior we call political power actually works in the real world".

I think you should get working on that book right away!<br><br>Hapibeli, even so, it's good to see the word getting out. <br><br>PhotonX, I'm not sure if you're aware that I wrote a book a few years ago on the UFO phenomenon, somewhat unoriginally titled <a href="http://www.llewellyn.com/product.php?ean=9780738713199" rel=nofollow>The UFO Phenomenon</a>.

That's a major factor these days, too -- there are quite a few branches of science in which further research simply costs too much to be an option. <br><br>Lewis, <i>Cascadia's Fault</i> by Jerry Thompson.

The fading out of that tradition is unfortunate. As for the hurricane, we're getting an ordinary wet and windy day, so not to worry!<br><br>Lewis, yes, I saw a review of that and was most disappointed.

Been reading for a while, but this is the first time I have posted. <br><br>I agree with you on the future of space – it was always a beautiful but expensive dream, and one that society can no longer afford. However I am curious as to why your future for the Internet is so similarly bleak. Estimates of energy usage for our worldwide IT infrastructure is about 1.5 -3%. So relative to say something as mundane as space heating, (I believe about 15-30%) it's a fairly trivial amount. Unlike heating the energy used for the internet saves energy else where - just think of that saved by the replacement of snail mail as a small example, also unlike say transport the form of energy it requires has many sources available several of which are renewable.<br><br>One of the first outcomes of the upcoming age of scarcity will be a keen focus on the value of any energy usage. Information technology has been always rated highly in this regard. I remember flying over the low rent section of a town in Indonesia years ago. The houses were basically hovels yet each was adorned with a satellite dish. A not inconsiderable expense for the people who lived there. That's a pattern seen again and again in impoverished economies. I would expect no less emphasis when it's time for our world to make the crunchy decisions peak oil will demand.<br><br>In summary the EROEI for the Internet is orders of magnitude higher than many other activities we use energy for today and I would expect it will be one of the last things cut as we slide down the depletion curve.<br><br>You obviously believe differently. I would appreciate hearing why.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Kevin<br><br><a href=#c3872883784122726481 title="comment permalink">8/27/11, 7:26 PM</a><br><br>

I've found that very consistently, when I present the reasons why I expect the internet to come gradually apart in the decades ahead of us, the e-faithful simply talk right past the points I make -- they don't address them at all, and try to change the subject to something for which they have an answer. I'm going to take the chance that you won't do that. <br><br>The electricity cost of the internet is a tiny fraction of the inputs needed to maintain it. Over the long run, the ability to repair and replace hardware is far more serious an issue, since much of what goes into computers and the net has to be manufactured to extraordinarily demanding specifications, using a dizzying range of specialized raw materials and processes; all that requires the maintenance of a highly expensive global infrastructure, and a global economic order capable of funding that infrastructure. <br><br>The internet also has to pay for itself -- a crucial point almost always ignored -- which requires, among other things, an equally complex and fragile economic structure in working order, capable of spending billions of dollars annually on what amounts to a fancy advertising medium. There's also the need for a global political order stable enough that cyberwarfare doesn't overwhelm the capacity of the net to adapt, and a range of other conditions of the same kind that are rarely considered. <br><br>Your Indonesian example is a very good comparison here, because those satellite dishes were not being made by hand in those slums, nor were the satellites, nor were the programs they were watching. All of that was outside infrastructure into which, with a modest investment, the Indonesian poor were able to tap. If poor people in Indonesia had to build and deploy their own TVs, antennas, satellites, video cameras, etc., etc., from scratch, using resources on hand, they would not be watching satellite TV. One of the central points I've been trying to make all along is that the world of the future is going to resemble that Indonesian slum in a great many ways -- massive shortages of resources and energy among them.<br><br>This won't happen overnight, of course. My take has always been that the internet will sunset out gradually, as rising costs, parts shortages, and the impact of cybercrime, -warfare and -terrorism reduce its efficiency, while economic contraction and fragmentation narrow the circle of people who still have access. There will doubtless still be some kind of internet fifty years from now, but it may well be roughly what DARPANET was originally intended to be, a secure communications net linking government, military, and big business. Outside that narrowing circle, nets using packet radio -- a good transitional technology you might want to investigate -- will morph, as computer parts and peripherals become less and less available, into a less technically complex form of multicentric radio net which will probably retain some of the core functions of the internet -- for example, sending messages -- for a very long time to come. <br><br>There's your answer. I'll be interested to see if you address it, or evade it.<br><br><a href=#c3123377152610912094 title="comment permalink">8/27/11, 8:15 PM</a><br><br>

As we just saw in Virginia, thanks to our good resonant bedrock and lower engineering standards in this half of the continent, a 7-8 shaking here will yield about as much destructive potential over as large an area as an 8-9 on the west coast. And last time it was a series of three 7-8s over several months. No tsunamis, but huge seiches running up and down the Mississippi with similar results.

But a reasonably coherent worldview seems to be gradually taking shape, and at some point it will become mainstream thinking, and with a political vengeance.<br><br>I personally witnessed this in the 1960’s when the public’s view of the War in (on) Vietnam changed radically in a very short period of time. In the first half of the 1960’s, opposition to the war was regarded as being on the extreme, traitorous fringe; and then in the political equivalent of a split-second (from roughly 1967 to 1969) opposition to the war went mainstream. The political impact was enormous: one President (Johnson) declined to seek the second full term that he coveted, and the new President (Nixon) was soon under so much stress that he impulsively overreacted, did some politically foolhardy things, and was forced to resign.<br> <br>So public thinking can change, and sometimes quickly.

I can't remember but I suppose it was on a "lay over" on it's way to or from FL or AZ. The Space Shuttle and the other wonders from NASA, from the Moon landings to the incredible images of Jupiter and her moons brought to us from the Pioneer spacecraft, piqued my interest in science. So I too felt a bit of a body blow as I listened to the radio reports about the last Shuttle mission a few weeks ago. But for me it's more than a sense of loss of a dream. I couple this circumstance with another product of the decline of empire which JMG has written about: the coming collapse of Higher Education, and that makes me shudder. The Space Program was a great boon to education and so I fear its demise may only hasten the demise of science education in America. Things look even worse when one notices that an entire wing of the Republican party seems to be operating in an alternate reality where there is no global warming and the earth is only 6000 years old. I fear that if the Rick Perrys and Michele Bachmans of the world ever come to power the only schools we will have will be of the Sunday School variety.<br><br><a href=#c2443017314877630461 title="comment permalink">8/28/11, 10:06 AM</a><br><br>

But when I think of the Roman pottery analogy, and the incredible level of technology required to make semiconductors, I can't refute the logic. It is clearly a fancy advertising medium, and the economy has turned a corner recently, not the corner most folks wanted it to turn. No economy, no advertising. (although it's worth noting that Google is not the Internet) Blogger and Youtube and Facebook require electicity-hogging server farms and are likely to be phased out early. You could have connectivity, and simple things like email, so long as microprocessors exist. Personal computers have gotten quite small and energy-efficient. <br><br>I'm not sure packet radio will outlast the microprocessor -- one would still need the processors to form up the information into packets. Something like an AM radio gossip network could be achieved with one-tube low-powered ham rigs, but packets are a bit more tricky. <br><br>Solar cells are somewhat simpler semiconductors, and can conceivably be made with medium-tech metallurgy, but charge controllers and inverters again require advanced silicon designs. Not sure what will become of that. I keep thinking of the James McMurtry song "Can't Make it Here". <br><br>A lot depends on whether semiconductor (specifically VLSI: millions of transistors on a speck of silicon) technology can survive in essentially its present form. Will the knowledge be lost as plants are closed down due to declining markets and soaring material and energy costs? Will a few small "boutique" semiconductor shops survive, perhaps to serve military / government, and to support what remains of the general communication infrastructure? (with the caveat stated above, that the smallest microprocessor factory still requires advanced cryosystems, ultrahigh vacuum, exotic chemistry, and abundant ultra-reliable energy)<br><br><a href=#c6586165970227058866 title="comment permalink">8/28/11, 11:39 AM</a><br><br>

Still, we'll get at most a good strong shake here, and be left with plenty of viable transport routes from the east. When the next Cascadia subduction quake hits, if it follows past examples, everything along the west coast from the northern end of California to a good bit of the way up British Columbia, reaching a good 200 miles inland, is going to get flattened, and then the tsunami comes in. The last one of them, just over 300 years ago, split the entire fault zone from end to end. Not something I want to watch. <br><br>Don, you may well be right -- and I'll be going on at quite a bit of length about the theoretical issues over the weeks, months, and years to come. Still, I find the hands-on work fun and fulfilling, and can't help but wish that more people would get into it now, while we've still got ample resources. <br><br>Apple Jack, I got that info from researching occultism in colonial America -- it's been a long time and I don't have the sources handy, but some of the more conservative Meetings toward the end of the colonial period imposed a lot of disciplinary measures on Friends who were practicing various kinds of occultism, and (if I recall correctly) Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote about an elderly Quaker wizard his family knew, whose book of spells was the classic 17th century English translation of Cornelius Agrippa's <i>Three Books of Occult Philosophy</i> -- that was <i>the</i> manual of magic among English-language wizards, curers, and folk magicians of all kinds until the revival of occult philosophy in the late 19th century, so it was by no means unique to Friends. <br><br>DIYer, thank you. I wanted to communicate something of what the failed dream of space meant to me; good to hear that I succeeded, at least in part. <br><br>David, good. Now comes the hard question: what are you personally going to do about it? One of the things that's given the Bachmans of the world their current position of relative influence is precisely that they've been willing to put their money (time, etc.) where their mouths are, even when it wasn't popular to do so. I'd like to see more people who care about, say, science education set out to do something in their own lives and communities to further their cause -- there are plenty of ways to do it. (One example: a lot of amateur astronomers go out of their way to host "star parties" at which people who've never had the chance to peer through a telescope get to see the rings of Saturn and the mountains of the Moon up close and personal' professional astronomers and science writers have traced their careers back to such an event in childhood.) You've defined a real need; how will you fill it? <br><br>Adrian, you won't find it there. The Quakers, like the other surviving groups to come out of the 17th century English radical scene, had everything to gain by cleaning up their history, and much to lose by not doing so. Histories of popular religion and occultism that focus on the 17th century in Britain and America will give you a glimpse at the occult wing of the Quaker faith in those days, along with much else.

Just one clarification, though. I expect packet radio to survive only so long as personal computers can either be bought or pieced together from scraps. VLSIs are one of the major bottlenecks, precisely because they demand so many subsidiary technologies and inputs. Still, when those run out, message handling used to be a major part of ham radio activity, and a lot of hams still remember how it's done; given a few handbuilt tubes or a sturdy old transceiver here and there, you've got a communications net that can keep continents in contact with each other, and move a lot of information at what (in pre-computer days) was considered quite a respectable speed.

The question isn't going to be settled by arguing online; over the next two decades or so, we'll see who's right -- and in the meantime, it's in everyone's best interest to see to it that somebody, somewhere, is thinking about what to do when the internet shuts down, so that there's at least the first sketch of a fallback in place.<br><br><a href=#c8737278482577661366 title="comment permalink">8/28/11, 12:02 PM</a><br><br>

The poem itself gives just four verses to the wizard and his book:<br><br>"We stole with her a frightened look / At the gray wizard's conjuring-book, / The fame whereof went far and wide / Through all the simple country side,"<br><br>In Whittier's "Introduction" to that poem, he tells how his mother had described the strange people of her childhood between Dover and Portsmouth, NH, including "Bantam the wizard." <br><br>Earlier, in _The Supernaturalism on New England,_, he says a little more about this "plain, sedate member of the Society of Friends, named Bantum. He passed, throughout a circle of several miles, as a conjuror, and skillful adept in the art of magic. To him resorted farmers who had lost their cattle, matrons whose household gear, silver spooks and table linen had been stolen, or young maidens whose lovers were absent; and the quiet, meek-spirited old man received them all kindly, put on his huge iron-rimmed spectacles, opened his "conjuring book," which my mother describes as a large clasped volume in strange language and black letter type, and after due reflection and consideration gave the required answers without money and without price. The curious old volume is still in the possession of the conjuror's family. Apparently inconsistent as was this practice of the Black Art with the simplicity and truthfulness of his religious profession, I have not been able to learn that he was ever subjected to censure on account of it."<br><br>This man can be identified as Ambrose Bantam or Bampton, of Dover, NH.

If there was an early edition in German, that would very likely have been in black-letter.<br><br>Or, as you say, it may have been some other title. A very large number of esoteric or magical books were printed in England between about 1640 and 1680, since there was no censorship of the English press at all during most of those forty years.<br><br>The geography of early New England occult science is fascinating. There are, of course, the three Puritan colonies of Massachusetts, Neew Haven, and Connecticut; but even there a considerable number of alchemists and hermeticists flourished. And they made up less than half of the settled land of New England, and less than half of the pre-Revolutionary Colonies.<br><br>Plymouth Colony was Separatist, not Puritan, during the 1600s, and it was much less doctrinaire in theology. (There is even a little evidence that the Separatists encouraged or permitted women to speak in church as well as men.) Rhode Island, like Pennsylvania, was famously tolerant of all religious opinions, and even witchcraft was legal there, so long as it did not harm people or summon demons or employ familiar spirits. Saybrook Colony, short-lived though it may have been, was almost as tolerant as Rhode Island. <br><br>And the vast Northern Fringe of New England (New Hampshire and what later became Maine and Vermont) had neither the political machinery nor very much inclination to exert any control over a person's studies or thoughts at all. <br><br>One old story, possibly apocryphal, from the Northern Fringe tells how a minister from Massachusetts was brought in to fill a vacant pulpit in Portsmouth, NH, in the very late 1600s. He preached an inaugural sermon in the Puritan vein, and claimed that the ancestors who had founded New England came there to create a Puritan Commonwealth. Up rose an old fisherman from his pew in the church and interrupted the minister: "I don't know about your ancestors, sir, but up here our ancestors came to fish and to trade, and not for religion at all."<br><br>There are early rich networks of communication between Rhode Island and Pennsylvania that go as far back as Johannes Kelpius, some of whose letters to Rhode Islanders are sre still extant. Very likely something similar once existed between Pennsylvania and the "Northern Fringe." So your suggestion that Bantum's black-letter book may have been in German strikes me as right on target.<br><br>Robert Mathiesen (Mageprof)<br><br><a href=#c7180100303991641348 title="comment permalink">8/28/11, 12:48 PM</a><br><br>

That pattern seems to suggest the immediate risk is not that great. A smaller but still significant earthquake is more likely.

The most detailed one I've seen (which I tried to find again through google just now but with no luck) showed because of underlying geology some areas much further from the fault would see worse damage than other closer areas. For example where I am in the central ozarks would see similar shaking as Chicago and Indianapolis, even though those places are significantly further from the fault. The Mississippi valley would have it especially bad for hundreds of miles north and south of New Madrid, but supposedly the geology of the Ozarks absorbs seismic waves better than in any other direction from the fault so only the Eastern Ozarks would see severe damage from even a mega-quake, although I'm sure we'd get a good shake where I'm at.<br><br><a href=#c1406877554253386305 title="comment permalink">8/28/11, 1:44 PM</a><br><br>

Did you mean mercalli VIII rather than XIII, because I just haven't found anything that supports that kind of intensity, XIII is literally off the charts. The Missouri DNR has put together a map of the expected Mercalli intensities in Missouri for a 7.6 New Madrid quake at http://www.dnr.mo.gov/geology/geosrv/geores/techbulletin1.htm<br><br>I'm solidly in the VI intensity area, and even the epicenter is at X intensity, very damaging but far shy of XIII. The map doesn't include Tennessee but I don;t imagine the intensity would get worse anywhere there than in the Missouri bootheel. An earthquake stronger than 7.6 is possible but I still don't see any scenario like you propose, I haven't yet seen evidence to convince me that any structure at least moderately well-built in the central ozarks is in much danger from the New Madrid zone, but if you have a source that indicates otherwise I'd love that information.<br><br><a href=#c2087037640608812211 title="comment permalink">8/28/11, 8:14 PM</a><br><br>

But that is not a whole lot of samples to calculate an average interval and provides a really poor estimate of the variability. The estimated intervals range 350-600 years (up to 800-900 if you include some of the even earlier estimated dates). Sample size = 3. That is not at all strong evidence that a 200 year interval is unlikely. Plus I have always been troubled by the fact that the more recent the interval, the shorter the interval. This suggests either (a) coincidence, (b) increasing activity, or (c) some dates are missing earlier in the series hence the estimated average interval is likely substantially too high. Two of those three options would suggest that something big in the coming decades is quite possible. The most important fact is that the nature of New Madrid is very poorly understood, hence its future behavior is extremely hard to forecast. <br><br>As for estimated shake maps, there are so few contemporary accounts it is all guesswork. By the way, of course I meant Mercalli VIII not XIII for my place; XIII is off the top of the scale! Just remember that the recent 5.8 in Virginia was felt in southern Canada and central Georgia, around 500-600 miles away. New Madrid was roughly 100-fold stronger, and happened three times. If I were anywhere in the Ozarks I would take precautions for a major temblor. Even if most of the energy is absorbed or deflected, the fraction left over would still be substantial. <br><br>The geology of the Ozarks is similar to that of the Highland Rim which lies between New Madrid and Nashville; still Nashville experienced quite a jolt. The surprisingly active East Tennessee Seismic Zone is about the same distance from us in the other direction, also across geology similar to the Ozarks. It throws a 4 every few years; these rattle our windows, wake sleepers, and freak the dogs out. Multiply that by 1000...<br><br>The eastern U.S. is actually full of these small, poorly-known seismic zones. Long-term trends would suggest that any one of these can whip up an occasional 6-point-something even if it has never produced more than 3s and 4s historically. This may not seem great on a continental scale but if it happens in your neighborhood it could be a pretty major incident. It only takes one fallen chimney or collapsed foundation pillar to ruin your whole day...<br><br><a href=#c7995347569171480302 title="comment permalink">8/28/11, 8:22 PM</a><br><br>

It's haunting and worth a few posts on its own. Every re-read brings out more meaning and substance to the story. Thanks for mentioning it Sophie!<br><br>Hey Don,<br><br>I'd like to agree with you, however, the problems that we are all facing is that it requires a fundamental shift downwards in the standard of living. This differs from the late 60's - early 70's because those protest movements were aimed at very specific issues as distinct from the present where there needs to be an acknowledgement that the race has been run and lost.<br><br>PS: As to our electrical infrastructure, one of the strange things that I have noticed in comments elsewhere is that people have this level of disconnect (excuse the pun). The disconnect arises because if their electricity is sourced from somewhere else they seem to think that they are invulnerable and that supply is guaranteed. This thinking seems to ignore the fact that large scale power stations have finite lives just as photovoltaic panels do. In a strange coincedence too, the life span tends to be around 50 years each between a gas/coal plant and a PV panel.<br><br>I wouldn't bother wasting the energy in my off grid PV system trying to send packets via a ham radio when you could either talk or use morse code. Most people around here use UHF CB's - although a ham radio will punch an enormous distance.

What Clarke was trying to say, I think, was that if humans could see Earth as merely one planet among many, many celestial bodies (which the space program, for all its faults, allowed us to actually SEE by showing us how vast space really was), we could get OVER ourselves to some extent. Differences of religion and race would cease to matter, and all these wars would stop once we realized how insignificant our differences were compared to the vast, vast, VAST size of the universe.<br><br>But if we lose our astronomical knowledge (specifically the knowledge that the universe is much, much, much more vast in scope and the Earth is just a small part of it), and the earth gets "huge" again, then once again our racial and religious and ethnic and what-have-you differences will again assume cosmic importance, since there won't be an outside "bigger perspective" to reign them in.<br><br>I am probably alone on this one, but I don't even remotely consider that a good thing.<br><br>Am I making sense, John Michael Greer, or have I not expressed myself properly?<br><br><a href=#c1033948285025969527 title="comment permalink">8/29/11, 5:44 AM</a><br><br>

Same for all historical major quakes, including 1906 in SF. It's inferred from spotty and sketchy reports of the effects. Some of the New Madrid tales (like huge seiches traveling up the Mississippi carrying boats with them and leaving them wrecked on shore) sound bigger to me than the high-7-point-something magnitude that is currently thrown around. <br><br>Also, one of the biggest mistakes in seismic planning has been to just plan for a repeat of what has already been historically documented. Many nukes in east TN and N AL were only engineered for a 6.0, even though they are in eastern North America's second most active seismic zone after New Madrid. A very poorly known and mostly inactive zone in central Virginia just threw a 5.8 out of the blue, with no prior history of anything close to that. So plan for the worst historical scenario plus 1 (at least) if you really want to ensure that whatever you build has a lifetime of centuries not just decades. People are not accustomed to thinking in those time scales in the U.S., but I am spending the 21st century in a house built in the 19th, and am working on ensuring it has a shot at still being here in the 22nd and 23rd.<br><br><a href=#c5277275970873396996 title="comment permalink">8/29/11, 7:07 AM</a><br><br>

As for Lewis and archdruids, one of the things very few of Lewis' Christian fans grasp is that he was a significant figure in the history of Christian Platonism, and a very close student of the medieval Platonists -- you may well know that most of the setting of the space trilogy was lifted straight out of the 12th-century Platonist philosopher Bernard Sylvester. Platonism was also a major influence on the Druid Revival of the 18th and 19th centuries, which is the movement to which the order I head traces its lineage, and it's a direct influence on my thought as well -- I've yet to find a thinker who makes more sense of spirituality than Plotinus, for example. If Lewis and I could ever have had the chance to sit down over a couple of beers and talk, after a few pro forma harrumphs over the different religious symbolisms we use, we'd very quickly be talking the same language and saying many of the same things.<br><br><a href=#c3724504565647757672 title="comment permalink">8/29/11, 12:41 PM</a><br><br>

She is right to refer to "what John Michael Greer correctly calls the whole systems cost of maintaining that infrastructure".<br>I worked off and on in Macedonia until 2006: a poor country not yet integrated in to the European Union: per capita GDP 4,500 usd, perhaps 20% of the average for OECD countries. But now more than double what it was on my first visit in 1999. It illustrates perhaps both Sharon's concern over what can be achieved, and perhaps at the same time surprises us that life can be worthwhile and reasonably secure on less than we might think. Yes the new sewage system for Skopje where most people now live was heavily subsidized for political reasons by the EU. I remember though that the pharmacy system seemed to function reasonably adequately: we are talking drugs for hypertension, heart arterial disease, diabetes, as well as antibiotics and painkillers. Maybe for reasons of low cost, generic out-of-patent drugs were available? I am guessing. Hospital just about worked. Public health controls and veterinary controls (rabies for example; also control for epidemics in farm animals) worked surprisingly well, (again though with support from EU). Education produced some well-informed very smart skilled people. They had 30% unemployment but a very large gray economy. Self-build housing and maintenance and improvement was a pretty obvious vernacular activity. Electricity worked. They had a world-class soccer team. Music was great.

This is a nearly lost attitude; it will have to make a comeback in future generations.”<br><br>I think I know how you feel: if I’m not doing something, then I feel like I’m just a bump on a log. Who wants to passively watch when you can actively do something constructive?<br><br>Installing fiberglass insulation is just about the only construction job I don’t look forward to doing.

But I wish that someone would come up with batts as cheap as fiberglass that don’t itch. For blown-in insulation, I use cellulose. Dusty, but not itchy.<br> <br>I agree that the DIY attitude has largely disappeared. A lot of people in my parent’s (First) Great Depression generation had it, but somewhere along the line, it got lost - probably as a result of too much affluence. Why go to all the time and trouble of doing it yourself when you can buy it cheaply because it’s made by slave labor in Asia?<br><br>Maybe the kids coming up will start to enjoy building things themselves. At least I hope that they enjoy it. Because whether they enjoy it or not, they aren’t going to have much choice: as abundance disappears, it’s going to be “Do it yourself or do without.” <br><br>Re: Retrofitting an Old House for Energy Efficiency, and Earthquake/Tornado Survival<br><br>These old houses around here in Northern Illinois are on 18” wide limestone foundations, but the sill plates aren’t bolted down – and that’s the way old houses are in most of the country. So the houses can be shaken or blown off their foundations. Plus the sills leak air like crazy, and solid rock is a poor insulator.<br> <br>To remedy it, I’ve been removing the bottom siding board and digging down another 8” to 12” into the soil, and then adding 2” extruded polystyrene foam sheets to the outside of the foundation wall. I add a layer of galvanized expanded metal lath to the outside of the polystyrene, and nail it to the sill plate and studs. <br><br>Then I plaster on a couple of layers of stucco to the metal lath, with the last layer stained to match the siding. I cap it with painted galvanized steel flashing angled down 45 degrees to shed water, and then put the building wrap and siding back on (both lapped over the upper edge of the flashing to shed water, with the building wrap taped to the flashing).<br><br>The technique 1) adds about R-10 of insulation and a tight air barrier to an area that is a major source of heat loss through convection and conduction, 2) helps keep water away from the sill plates (which, in these old houses, are often starting to decay), 3) keeps insects from burrowing into the insulation, and 4) adds a strong ferrocement “skirt” around the perimeter of the house to keep it from shifting laterally from either wind or earth movement.<br><br>Materials run about $3 a lineal foot, and it’s very time consuming to install. But it’ll last a long, long time. (You can buy pre-made polystyrene panels covered with a thin stucco coating, but they don’t really add any structural strength.)<br><br><a href=#c7279589079465945854 title="comment permalink">8/29/11, 9:51 PM</a><br><br>

This differs from the late 60's - early 70's because those protest movements were aimed at very specific issues as distinct from the present where there needs to be an acknowledgement that the race has been run and lost.”<br><br>I agree that a lot of the late 60’s – early 70’s protests were aimed at very specific issues. And the fact that those protests achieved their goals has made things worse in many cases rather than better.<br><br>Example: The women’s movement wanted to get women out of the household economy and into the money economy. They succeeded. Now there’s a couple of women who are making obscene amounts of money, a small group of relatively overpaid functionaries, and millions of female wage-slaves who are earning less money than they are spending on transportation, day care, and additional taxes. These women are literally paying money to be employed. This is called “female empowerment”.<br><br>Example: People who were concerned about energy were able to get a U. S. Department of Energy established to help us deal with the energy crisis – and it became a department that has never, ever allowed the word “oil” to be preceded by the word “peak”. This is called “energy planning”.<br><br>One of the movements from that time that had a lot of long-term potential was the back-to-the-land, homesteading movement. It largely fizzled out, however, and the main reason (as you’re noted in some of your posts) is that homesteading requires a large amount of hard, physical labor. Most people who tried it gave up because it was easier to just get a regular job (and good jobs were abundant in those days).<br><br>Some of us were trying to point out that the whole system was headed to a bad end, but we were overruled. The public adamantly refused to reduce consumption.<br><br>One of the problems with the ‘60’s was the lack of a coherent political agenda that appealed to a majority of the American public because it could help them in their daily lives. The political agenda was sort of a mish-mash of Timothy Leary’s LSD-based “Turn on, tune in, drop out” and Stewart Brand’s tie-dyed techno-cornucopianism and Abbie Hoffman’s tongue-in-cheek attempts to levitate the Pentagon. The mainstream of America simply could not relate. Just too far out, man.<br> <br>It was enough to get us out of Vietnam, but not enough to institute a whole new system.<br><br>But as abundance disappears, we could see a shift. I’m not sure how people felt over there in Oz, but until Vietnam, Americans believed strongly that “By definition, American is the country that has never lost a war.” So for people to accept that we were bogged down in an unwinnable war was a wrenching transformation in their thinking. And the transformation started slowly and painfully, but eventually the change spread rapidly.<br><br>Likewise, the perspective has been that “By definition, American is the country where the standard of living improves for every generation.” As more and more American families are getting wiped out – disappearing jobs, evaporating home equity, unpayable college loans - that belief in perpetually increasing prosperity is gradually starting to change. Once a critical mass of impoverization is reached, the public’s attitude could change rapidly.<br><br>It’s important to have some sort of reasonable agenda hammered out so that when the public is ready for a different direction, a direction that has some hope of helping is available.<br><br>Otherwise, a vacuum of constructive ideas could develop. We could descend into political craziness. Extremists are already starting to emerge.<br> <br>America is inevitably going to go in one direction or another, and it would definitely be better if America doesn’t spin off into dark political extremism that tries to sustain the unsustainable through increasingly self- (and other-) destructive methods.<br><br><a href=#c1171253074288020305 title="comment permalink">8/29/11, 9:55 PM</a><br><br>

(I hope I didn't read more into your post than you intended.) However, I don't know if the anti-war movement of the 60s and 70s provides a workable model for what you propose. The protests against the war were really asking for a whole new way for a hegemonic superpower to interact with weaker nations. That it arguably succeeded in getting us out of the war is no small feat, but how much did it really make a deep change the likes of which is needed now? Recent warlike behavior would suggest not much.<br><br>Likewise, I don't recall anyone standing in the streets demanding the creation of a government bureaucracy to oversee energy in those days. What was being demanded at the time was a complete rethinking of how humans, and especially residents of first-world nations, managed their relationship with the material world. (That might be over-stating the point, but let's just say, how we were going to use energy to make the type of life we wanted.) Naturally the political system was capable of giving what it could give, and asking the people to live more simply on less wasn't part of it. St. Jimmy the Peanut Farmer is remembered as a great reformer for taking a few symbolic steps such as the establishment of the DOE, and certainly looked good compared to what followed, but really he was only able to do what a government dependent on the franchise of the people can do.<br><br>As far as the women's movement is concerned, I believe it was about just a little more than moving women into the workforce. I'm not saying that wasn't one of the effects, nor that that particular outcome didn't have some serious negative consequent effects of it's own, but again, the problem isn't that the movement was successful in it's demands, which had a lot to do with reworking the way women and men share power in the world. What it succeeded in getting was the sort of superficial reforms that you described.<br><br>Bottom line: If we're going to try to build a political movement as you seem to be suggesting, we're not going to have the luxury this time of settling for a few half-measures. Having the discussion seems like a good idea, but I'm not sure it's feasible, given the resources available, not to mention human nature.<br><br><a href=#c2439310148927812705 title="comment permalink">8/30/11, 6:43 PM</a><br><br>

It seems there was a 4 or 5 year hiatus in the middle there. There have also been some new Lunar missions IIRC.<br><br>There does seem to be renewed/continued national interest in Space not to mention the 2 or 3 private enterprises and the apparently planned manned mission to Mars.<br><br>China's recent announcement about the testing of that <b>EM Drive</b> in space that doesn't have an accepted explanation yet is interesting as well.<br><br>Last year I saw a <b>BBC Horizon</b> documentary called "Project Greenglow - The Quest for Gravity Control". That was quite interesting and suggestive. ( <a rel=nofollow>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0752f85</a> ). The most interesting segment of it for me related to some (eventually) classified work done for one of the Defence companies.<br><br>Reading this entry today reminded me of that documentary last year and it lead me to wonder about all those Patents that end up getting shrouded in secrecy for "national security" purposes and whether any of them could be useful for solving one or more of the resource related problems underlying the thrust of this blog.<br><br>Hard to know for sure of course until any such invention made an appearance. Oddly enough, my own country classifies 3 times more patent applications than the USA according to an article I read recently. <a rel=nofollow>https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18691-uk-keeps-three-times-as-many-patents-secret-as-the-us/</a>). Perhaps the UK is just really insecure. ;)<br><br>There are plenty of unsolved problems in physics awaiting solutions: <a rel=nofollow>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics</a> -- Perhaps answers to one of those will provide useful solutions some day.<br><br>Given the inherent weakness in the Scientific Method ( i.e. it is performed by flawed &amp; fallible Humans with egos and so is readily corruptible and requires available resources for peer reviews - resources that are at the mercy of economic forces it would not surprise me if one or more of those rock solid *cough* assumptions/theories turned out to be not so rock solid some day and maybe lead to alternative solutions as yet unthinkable.<br><br>Then again maybe not. We shall see.<br><br><a href=#c7918453390837363572 title="comment permalink">1/15/17, 10:22 AM</a><br><br>
