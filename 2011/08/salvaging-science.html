Last week’s post on the collapse of American education strayed a certain distance from the core theme of the present series of posts, the reinvention of a “green wizardry” based on methods and technologies tried and proven during the energy crises of the Seventies. There’s a purpose to the divagation, since what’s being discussed here is an educational project in the broad sense of the term, and one that has no real chance of being embraced by the established educational institutions of American society. <br><br>Mind you, it’s quite possible that a university here or a community college there might make itself useful in one way or another. Once it becomes impossible to ignore the mismatch between the energy resources available to Americans and the habits of extravagant energy use that have grown up in this country over the last three decades, new college programs to train alternative energy professionals will no doubt pop up like mushrooms after a hard spring rain, competing with the handful of such programs that already exist fto attract an expected torrent of students. Some of these future programs may even be worth the time, though with the current trajectory of college expenses, it would amaze me if any turn out to be worth the cost. <br><br>They’ll probably get the students, though. It’s hardwired into the American psyche these days that a problem for one person is a business opportunity for someone else, and preferably someone else with the right degree. Books with titles such as <i>Profit from the Peak</i> are already festooning bookstore and library shelves, and there will doubtless be much more of the same thinking on display as peak oil continues its journey from a fringe concern to an inescapable reality. That’s the American mindset as the 21st century moves deeper into its first great period of crisis; if scientists were to announce tomorrow that America was about to sink beneath the waves like Atlantis, I don’t doubt for a moment that tens of thousands of Americans would rush out and try to launch new careers manufacturing and selling water wings. <br><br>The green wizardry I’ve been discussing in these posts doesn’t lend itself to that sort of thinking, because it’s not intended for specialists. Now of course it will help a few careers along—unless you’re a dab hand with plumbing, for example, you’re better off getting a professional to install your solar water heating system—and it may get some started—I’ve spoken several times already about the range of small businesses that will be needed as the global economy winds down and maintaining, rebuilding, and repurposing old technologies becomes a significant economic sector. Still, most of the techniques and strategies I’ve been discussing aren’t well suited to make money for some new wave of specialists; their value is in making life more livable for ordinary people who hope to get by in the difficult times that are gathering around us right now. <br><br>It’s worth noting, in fact, that the twilight of the contemporary cult of specialization is one of the implications of peak oil. A couple of decades ago, the mathematician Ilya Prigogine showed by way of dizzyingly complex equations that the flow of energy through a system tends to increase the complexity of the system over time. It’s a principle that’s seen plenty of application in biology, among other fields, but I don’t think it’s been applied to history as often as it should have. There does seem to be a broad positive correlation between the energy per capita available, on average, to the members of a human society, and the number of different occupational roles available to members of that society. <br><br>As energy per capita soared to its peak in the industrial world of the late twentieth century, hyperspecialization was the order of the day; as energy per capita declines—and it’s been declining for some time now—the range of specializations that can be supported by the economy will also decline, and individuals and families will have to take up the slack, taking over tasks that for some decades now have been done by professionals. During the transitional period, at least, this will doubtless generate a great deal of commotion, as professional specialists whose jobs are going away try to defend their jobs by making life as difficult as possible for those people who, trying to get by in difficult times, choose the do-it-yourself route. That process is already well under way in a variety of professions, and we’ll be discussing a particularly visible example of it in next week’s post, but this week I want to use this lens to examine the future of one of the industrial world’s distinctive creations, the grab bag of investigative methods, ideas about the universe, and social institutions we call “science.” <br><br>It’s rarely remembered these days that until quite recently, scientific research was mostly carried on by amateurs. The word “scientist” wasn’t even coined until 1833; before then, and for some time after, the research programs that set modern science on its way were carried out by university professors in other disciplines, middle class individuals with spare time on their hands, and wealthy dilletantes for whom science was a more interesting hobby than horse racing or politics. Isaac Newton, for example, taught mathematics at Cambridge; Gilbert White founded the science of ecology with his <i>Natural History of Selborne</i> in his spare time as a clergyman; Charles Darwin came from a family with a share of the Wedgwood pottery fortune, had a clergyman’s education, and paid his own way around the world on the H.M.S. Beagle.<br><br>It took a long time for scence as a profession to catch on, because—<i>pace</i> a myth very widespread these days—science contributed next to nothing to the technological revolutions that swept the western world in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Until late in the nineteenth century, in fact, things generally worked the other way around: engineers and basement tinkerers discovered some exotic new effect, and then scientists scrambled to figure out what made it happen. James Clerk Maxwell, whose 1873 book <i>Electricity and Magnetism</i> finally got out ahead of the engineers to postulate the effects that would become the basis for radio, began the process by which science took the lead in technological innovation, but it wasn’t until the Second World War that science had matured enough to become the engine of discovery it then became. It was then that government and business investment in basic research took off, creating the institutionalized science of the present day. <br><br>Throughout the twentieth century, investment in scientific research proved to be a winning bet on the grand scale; it won wars, made fortunes, and laid the groundwork for today’s high-tech world. It’s a common belief these days that more of the same will yield more of the same—that more scentific research will make it possible to fix the world’s energy problems and, just maybe, its other problems as well. Popular as that view is, there’s good reason to doubt it. <br><br>The core problem is that scientific research was necessary, but not sufficient, to create today’s industrial societies. Cheap abundant energy was also necessary, and was arguably the key factor. In a very real sense, the role of science from the middle years of the nineteenth century on was basically figuring out new ways to use the torrents of energy that came surging out of wells and mines to power history’s most extravagant boom. Lacking all that energy, the technological revolutions of the last few centuries very likely wouldn’t have happened at all; the steam turbine, remember, was known to the Romans, who did nothing with it because all the fuel they knew about was committed to other uses. Since the sources of fuel we’ll have after fossil fuels finish depleting are pretty much the same as the ones the Romans had, and we can also expect plenty of pressing needs for the energy sources that remain, it takes an essentially religious faith in the inevitability of progress to believe that another wave of technological innovation is right around the corner. <br><br>The end of the age of cheap abundant energy is thus also likely to be the end of the age in which science functions as a force for economic expansion. There are at least two other factors pointing in the same direction, though, and they need to be grasped to make sense of the predicament we’re in. <br><br>First, science itself is well into the territory of diminishing returns, and most of the way through the normal life cycle of a human method of investigation. What last week’s post described as abstraction, the form of intellectual activity that seeks to reduce the complexity of experience into a set of precisely formulated generalizations, always depends on such a method. Classical logic is another example, and it’s particularly useful here because it completed its life cycle long ago and so can be studied along its whole trajectory through time. <br><br>Logic, like the scientific method, was originally the creation of a movement of urban intellectuals in a society emerging from a long and troubled medieval period. Around the eighth century BCE, ancient Greece had finally worked out a stable human ecology that enabled it to finish recovering from the collapse of Mycenean society some six centuries before; olive and grapevine cultivation stabilized what was left of the fragile Greek soil and produced cash crops eagerly sought by markets around the eastern Mediterranean, bringing in a flood of wealth; the parallel with rapidly expanding European economies during the years when modern science first took shape is probably not coincidental. Initial ventures in the direction of what would become Greek logic explored various options, some more successful than others; by the fifth century BCE, what we may as well call the logical revolution was under way, and the supreme triumphs of logical method occupied the century that followed. Arithmetic, geometry, music theory, and astronomy underwent revolutionary developments. <br><br>That’s roughly where the logical revolution ground to a halt, too, and the next dozen centuries or so saw little further progress. There were social factors at work, to be sure, but the most important factor was inherent in the method: using the principles of logic as the Greeks understood them, there’s only so far you can go. Logical methods that had proved overwhelmingly successful against longstanding problems in mathematics worked far less well on questions about the natural world, and efforts to solve the problems of human life as though they were logical syllogisms tended to flop messily. Once the belief in the omnipotence of logic was punctured, on the other hand, it became possible to sort out what it could and couldn’t do, and—not coincidentally—to assign it a core place in the educational curriculum, a place it kept right up until the dawn of the modern world. <br><br>I know it’s utter heresy even to hint at this, but I’d like to suggest that science, like logic before it, has gotten pretty close to its natural limits as a method of knowledge. In Darwin’s time, a century and a half ago, it was still possible to make worldshaking scientific discoveries with equipment that would be considered hopelessly inadequate for a middle school classroom nowadays; there was still a lot of low hanging fruit to be picked off the tree of knowledge. At this point, by contrast, the next round of experimental advances in particle physics depends on the Large Hadron Collider, a European project with an estimated total price tag around $5.5 billion. Many other branches of science have reached the point at which very small advances in knowledge are being made with very large investments of money, labor, and computing power. Doubtless there will still be surprises in store, but revolutionary discoveries are very few and far between these days<br><br>Yet there’s another factor pressing against the potential advancement of science, and it’s one that very few scientists like to talk about. When science was drawn up into the heady realms of politics and business, it became vulnerable to the standard vices of those realms, and one of the consequences has been a great deal of overt scientific fraud. <br><br><a href=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101115210944.htm>A study last year</a> published in the <i>Journal of Medical Ethics</i> surveyed papers formally retracted between 2000 and 2010 in the health sciences. About a quarter of them were retracted for scientific fraud, and half of these had a first author who had had another paper previously retracted for scientific fraud. Coauthors of these repeat offenders had, on average, three other papers <i>each</i> that had been retracted. Americans, it may be worth noting, far more often had papers retracted for fraud, and were repeat offenders, than their overseas colleagues. <br><br>I don’t know how many of my readers were taught, as I was, that science is inherently self-policing and that any researcher who stooped to faking data would inevitably doom his career. Claims like these are difficult to defend in the face of numbers of the sort just cited. Logic went through the same sort of moral collapse in its time; the English word "sophistry" commemorates the expert debaters of fourth-century Greece who could and did argue with sparkling logic for anyone who would pay them. <br><br>To be fair, scientists as a class would have needed superhuman virtue to overcome the temptations of wealth, status, and influence proffered them in the post-Second World War environment, and it’s also arguably true that the average morality of scientists well exceeds that of businesspeople or politicians. That still leaves room for a good deal of duplicity, and it’s worth noting that this has not escaped the attention of the general public. It’s an item of common knowledge these days that the court testimony or the political endorsement of a qualified scientist, supporting any view you care to name, can be had for the cost of a research grant or two. I’m convinced that this is the hidden subtext in the spreading popular distrust of science that is such a significant feature in our public life: a great many Americans, in particular, have come to see scientific claims as simply one more rhetorical weapon brandished by competing factions in the social and political struggles of our day. <br><br>This is unfortunate, because—like logic—the scientific method is a powerful resource; like logic, again, there are things it can do better than any other creation of the human mind, and some of those things will be needed badly in the years ahead of us. Between the dumping of excess specializations in a contracting economy, the diminishing returns of scientific research itself, and the spreading popular distrust of science as currently practiced, the likelihood that any significant fraction of today’s institutional science will squeeze through the hard times ahead is minimal at best. What that leaves, it seems to me, is a return to the original roots of science as an amateur pursuit. <br><br>There are still some corners of the sciences—typically those where there isn’t much money in play—that are open to participation by amateurs. There are also quite a few branches of scientific work that are scarcely being done at all these days—again, because there isn’t much money in play—and their number is likely to increase as funding cuts continue. To my mind, one of the places where these trends intersect with the needs of the future is in local natural history and ecology, the kind of close study of nature’s patterns that launched the environmental sciences, back in the day. To cite an example very nearly at random, it would take little more than a microscope, a notebook, and a camera to do some very precise studies of the effect of organic gardening methods on soil microorganisms, beneficial and harmful insects, and crop yields, or to settle once and for all the much-debated question of whether adding biochar to garden soil has any benefits in temperate climates. <br><br>These are things the green wizards of the future are going to need to be able to figure out. With much scientific research in America moving in what looks uncomfortably like a death spiral, the only way those skills are likely to make it across the crisis ahead of us is if individuals and local groups pick them up and pass them on to others. Now is probably not too soon to get started, either.

I only need 5mg a day, so I buy cheap, monster 80mg generic tablets of simivastatin and chop each one up into 16 pieces (crumbs, really). It costs about $2 a month - and I’m still alive, although I’m not helping the drug company’s bottom line much.<br> <br>But attempts to develop new patented statins to generate continued drug company profits seem to be resulting in much more powerful drugs with – unavoidably - much more powerful side effects.

Few patients seem to be able to tolerate them in high dosages; and at lower dosages, we have the older statins that are just as effective, better studied, and much, much cheaper.<br> <br>So the development of these newer statins really cannot be justified on public health grounds; they primarily serve the purpose of maintaining the profitability of the medical/industrial complex.<br><br><a href=#c6623162949939965642 title="comment permalink">8/3/11, 8:22 PM</a><br><br>

When I get into discussions about science, I always use the metaphor of it being a tool. Science is a very useful tool, but it is still used by humans for human purposes, sometimes it's misused as in the faked papers, sometimes used incompetently, and sometimes used for worthy ideals.<br><br>If more people thought of science as a tool, I think the discussions surrounding it would be much more reasonable. The problem lies not in science itself but in scientism, the religious belief in science as the only way to understand anything. After all, it's impossible to prove scientifically that there isn't anything that's outside the scope of scientific inquiry. It's like if eyesight was the only of their physical senses that someone had, and they tried to claim that sounds and smells either didn't exist or didn't matter because you couldn't perceive them with eyesight. The belief in science as the one and only tool of inquiry strikes me as in the same realm as the monotheistic belief in one and only god.<br><br>Even among things that are suited to scientific investigation, it doesn't mean that other methods applied to learning about it couldn't yield additional valuable information as well. Using the eyesight metaphor again, once you've looked something over to the smallest detail, touching or smelling it often gives you more information.<br><br>If science is to be preserved, which I hope it will be because it's a very useful tool, it needs to be divorced from scientism. I doubt scientism will make it through the decline of industrial civilization, as it's contributed much to placing us in this predicament. Emphasizing science as a tool may keep the baby from being thrown out with the bathwater, as I fear many people will turn against all science based on the failures of scientism.<br><br><a href=#c2134625823365615040 title="comment permalink">8/3/11, 9:01 PM</a><br><br>

Maybe in the way of stores/shops that sell commodities... Scientific research that supports gadgets and technologies for other commodities would be included in that.<br><br>But I don't think that we will see a reversal in specialization when it comes to things like medicine and health, nor in the science based research that backs them. If we will, we aren't seeing it yet. Don Mason's comment seems to highlight the fact that pharmaceuticals are a type of Service-Commodity hybrid that seats itself in the Health/Medical industry. For all I am concerned, that probably will (and probably should in my opinion) fade away into generalization. However, when it comes to research and specialization for medical understanding, procedures, and development of "experts," everything is splintering right now.<br><br>I do understand that you are saying this WILL happen, not it IS happening now. However, I don't see that claim supported by evidence except in the realm of energy and resource theory and only if you take that theory and play it out way ahead in time in a vacuum, supposing that the theory will meet reality exactly as theorized, which doesn't happen all the time, or even a lot of the time.<br><br>I do think its very interesting that not many of us remember that "science" has a longer history as an amateur "hobby" than as a profession. It does shed some perspective on the fallibility of the often deemed "infallible."<br><br>However, the fact that those research papers were tossed out, even after the same scientist tried to fudge his/her research for a second time, does chalk up a point for the idea that science weeds out what doesn't work over time (which is what I was taught, not that scientists don't try to lie sometimes).<br><br>Thanks for the piece.

You may recall last week that I was considering whether to continue what are soon to become bargain Degree courses with the Open University, (a very fine distance learning institution currently available to all at low cost) as its ‘Open’ doors close behind me. Well, I’ve since looked through the long lists of courses relevant to either an Arts or Science degree, and found there’s a considerable overlap, with many courses deemed equally applicable. <br><br>Now, as bravely and openly discussed here of late, we all have our strengths and weaknesses, and coping strategies. One area where I definitely lack aptitude is Maths. In my teenage days, at two different schools, I had to force the teachers to put me in the intermediate level maths class – challenging their routine assumption that by being advanced in written work, which came naturally, I’d also be highly numerate, which I’m assuredly not. (Incidentally, we did have an abacus lesson one day as a fun diversion, but it sadly passed me by. And in a late 70’s classroom, one of those enduring resilient slide rule things would have been another bygone curiosity.) Despite my lack of aptitude, I’ve since got by professionally, being competent to work a spreadsheet for a budget or such, while always silently praising the wondrous electronic calculator. <br><br>In my current assignments on the Sustainable Energy course, there’s a fair amount of maths. Some being straightforward conversions, percentage efficiencies and the like. But other questions involve algebra (eg, thermal efficiency) or equations (eg, function of turbines). So, working on the 80/20 rule, I skip those entirely, and recover the points in my essays on energy policy and history. <br><br>Nearly all the courses I’ve completed or noted for the future are officially equally applicable to either the BSc or MA qualification. But while I’ve consistently avoided the numbers – I could still opt for the BSc – becoming a barely numerate ‘Scientist’ – and becoming a walking talking scientific fraud! No harm would result, as it’s just hobby studies for me... <br><br>And to top it all, there’s only one short course I’d like to do, that, incredibly, doesn’t read across to the Science qualification – ‘Ethics In Real Life’! It closes down soon too, so it will be my next choice, putting me, by the narrowest of margins, on the true and righteous path of an Arts degree.<br><br>Synchronicity, or what?<br><br><a href=#c7874221786401617252 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 1:57 AM</a><br><br>

How science is a defined is a notoriously contentious subject, but I see two useful ways to think of it and neither of those has much to do with technology. First, the goal of science is to understand how the world around us works. Which has been in a way the goal of all intellectual activity from antiquity until now but what separated what we call science now from the kind of intellectual activity medieval monks were engaged in is the methodology; and we can talk all we want about the scientific method, it is very important but it did not come prepackaged in its current form, it gradually evolved (it is not even universally applied in practice) so the second useful definition is that science is that set of epistemological rules that has proven to work and be useful for understanding the world around us. Note that this leaves it open to change and further evolution - there is nothing more anti-scientific than religious faith, yet if faith and revelation turned out to be useful ways for deriving objective knowledge about the world, scientists would immediately incorporate them into their methodology; it just happens that they don't work, that's why they were abandoned. <br><br>As you correctly point out, technology development was a separate activity for a very long time, but this only serves to illustrate the point that it is not the same thing as science. Technology development is getting things to work the way you want them. The reason it is so closely tied to science these days is that at some point in the process of technology development, you hit the limit of what you can do without and understanding of the principles which govern the behavior of the system you are trying to get under control, and then you need to achieve that, by definition scientific, understanding before you can get things to work. <br><br>Of course, at some point, we hit the point of diminishing returns in the process of understanding the world around us. Scientists are perfectly aware of this phenomenon and are often discussing it in private. There isn't anything you can about it, that's how it is. What it does not mean though is that science is useless for further understanding of the world, because remember, science is that methodology that has been shown to work, while everything else has been conclusively demonstrated not to work, so in a way there isn't anything else other than science that we can reliably use. Once it gets very complicated and difficult to make progress at the same pace as before, scientific progress will slow down, but this does not mean that no further progress is possible, it is just going to be slower, and when it comes to particle physics and cosmology, increasingly theoretical (this unfortunately isn't going to happen because most of the knowledge accumulated so far will be lost in the near future). Which is unfortunate but it is only a really serious problem from the perspective of the expectation for eternal ever accelerating technological progress, and that itself comes from the kind of mindset that postulates that infinite growth is possible on a finite planet while not really understanding the difference between science and technology. But that's a mindset that ignores both the definition of science as that set of human activities directed at understanding the world around us unified by a set of useful epistemological rules, and the understanding of the world that is has achieved so far, for which science is not to be blamed.<br><br><a href=#c4582267936188763506 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 3:42 AM</a><br><br>

But in light of the green wizardry projects I think it's relevant in at least two distinct ways. First as a practical problem solver. Every gardener who works with careful observation and tries out different things (or repeats the same things) to see how they work follows the ancient tradition that led to and through the best of science. <br>But Second, science (like logic) owes much of its power to its potential to cut through the cloud of misapprehension, obfuscation, and willful self-delusion that characterizes normal human thought and social interaction. People who adopt either logic or science sincerely as a discipline gain a powerful tool for seeing the world as it really is rather than as we imagine it. This is sometimes handy, especially when the human fog is thick.<br>You rightly note that sophistry and normal (hyperspecialized) science demonstrate how this can fail spectacularly.

I think Georgi’s comment that it’s worthwhile distinguishing between science and technology is a good one, and an aspect that is way too often ignored. <br>The history of the development of technology really is one of finding more and better ways to burn fossil fuels, and it’s this that most people think of as "science".<br>As a once-was-physicist-turned-IT-geek-turned-permie-ecologist, I figured there must be a whole heap of counter-examples to your argument that pure science has done little for so-called “progress”. <br>You mentioned one, Maxwell et al and the subsequent development of an electricity industry. I came up with the quantum crew, who spawned electronics and a whole new understanding of chemistry, not to mention the nuclear industry. Newton, who defined classical mechanics and helped the machine builders along. Darwin, who redefined the way we look at why we are the way we are. Then there’s Crick &amp; Watson who spawned a whole host of developments in medicine, biology and agriculture.<br>And after a few hours thinking on the topic, that seems to be about it; everything else pretty well boils down to engineers coming up with those new ways to burn fossil fuels.<br>So, I don’t think it’s drawing too long a bow to look at the whole modern edifice as being based on the insights of about a dozen people.<br>Even if I believed that “someone will think of something” to get us out of the hole we’ve dug, the above demonstrates just how vanishingly small a chance there is of that. The LHC may show us some new and interesting things about dark energy (for example), but the chances of turning that into practical applications for powering space ships?

The first is the increasing difficulty of making major advances in many fields, the second is dishonesty and out-and-out fraud. Especially on the second point, I think you should be EXTREMELY careful about extrapolating from the medical and (especially) pharmaceutical industries to the entirety of the scientific endeavor. The linked article about rampant fraud refers ONLY to the medical literature, not the entirely of the scientific literature. In my time in Academia I don't recall a single case of fraud being exposed in my field. Even plagiarism only turned up in one case, and this was where a grad student had plagiarized from my own dissertation when writing her dissertation proposal. That was many levels below the published literature. <br><br>I also think it is also a bit slanderous to contrast "those whose souls contained the passion for it" versus "those that were driven by the almighty dollar," as Tully did in his comment above. Given the first matter, about the increasing difficulty of advancing the frontier, if you are driven by a passion for it then you will of necessity need to hunt for more dollars (euros, whatever) to pursue it. This does not in ANY WAY mean that your primary reason for being involved in the endeavor is to make money. Once again, don't tar particle physicists or ecologists with the Big Pharma brush. This is also a facorite tactic of the "climate change is a fraud!" lobby. It doesn't change the fact that these big projects will become increasingly impractical (and then impossible), but makes a lot of difference in ones perception of the ethical integrity of scientists. <br><br>JMG, you actual point does not even need the fraud stuff to be made. The fact that Big Science will necessarily go the way of all other Big Endeavors (even if those pursuing it have hearts of gold, every one), and that its pursuit is necessarily subjugated to political and commercial interests purely because of the quantity of resources it requires, is really the crux of the matter here.<br><br><a href=#c6237439932476367992 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 6:33 AM</a><br><br>

Devices like the <a href=http://www.solarpathfinder.com/ rel=nofollow>The Solar Pathfinder</a> are great at providing information as to the best location and orientation of solar stuff. I chose to use a straight pole, level, good watch, a timetable of solar noon for our exact longitude, and spent a couple of seasons simply observing the site, getting a feel for the place. One can learn alot by just sitting and observing things. Using my method, I discovered that true (solar) south deviates from the magnetic deviation as stated on the quad maps by almost four degrees, in our specific location. Using a good compass, magnetic south is almost nine degrees east of true south. Moving less than a mile from here, the deviation drops to less than five degrees. Using a simple pole at high noon, especially on the winter solstice, gives one a nice shadow pointing due north.<br><br>Using this observation method I also determined that the passive solar design would benefit from orienting the house about ten degrees west of true south due to the ridge to our east. I also calculated the roof overhangs this way. Using a science based device may have given the same results, but likely would have robbed me of understanding the nuances and 'feelings' of the site.

It is a very important part of the myth of progress that scientific knowledge grows continuously. As a result, far too many people today, who may disregard many of the important recent findings of science such as global climate change and peak oil, still maintain a general belief that science will solve all and any problems that may arise in the future and allow us to go on our merry way as we always have unimpeded by any limitations of energy or resources.<br><br>This faith is reinforced by the way science is taught today as an ever increasing collection of facts rather than as a way, like logic, philosophy or religion, of understanding our world.<br><br>In my brief career as a high school science teacher, I tried to stress that knowing the method and basic principles was more important than knowing all the tidbits of knowledge. You don’t have to be a scientist to use the scientific method. Following Kuhn, I tried to stress that science has its limits. And taking a page from, Stephen Jay Gould and his idea of “non-overlapping magisterial,” I stressed too that science, contrary to popular belief, could not solve all of our problems or answer all of our questions. Something can only become science if it can be communicated to someone else. This puts a natural limit on what questions science can answer.<br> <br>The kids hated my tests because I asked them to explain what they’d learned in their own words and avoided the usual multiple choice, true/false framework. Unfortunately, in our country’s growing obsession with high stakes testing, it’s easier to write and score tests based on the facts than ones based on understanding and demonstrating one’s ability to use a method. And since funding is based on test performance, I guess I should not have been surprised when my position was eliminated in the next school board budget.<br><br><a href=#c6332892621243465214 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 7:25 AM</a><br><br>

They are all we have for great important efforts. They are a gift to mankind to use to some supreme end or to waste in trivialities. Coal is the key to metallurgy and oil to transit. When they are done we shall either have built up such a fabric of apparatus, knowledge and social organization that we shall be able to manage without them—or we shall have traveled a long way down the slopes of waste toward extinction." – H.G.

They are, admittedly, fairly high.<br><br>But as for fraud going unpunished (the "repeat offender" point from the first paper you've cited); I have read the paper, and their definition of a repeat offender is somebody who had multiple papers retracted for fraud. If I read correctly, you have concluded that this means they were caught for fraud at least once, but let off with a slap on the wrist, then committed it again. To me it seems more likely that, after one case was found out, the rest of the fraudster's work immediately came under greater scrutiny, and the others were found as well. I'm not sure what the best way would be to measure if scientists have been caught for fraud yet not had their careers destroyed, but I've never heard of such a case myself.<br><br>And as for the survival of science as a whole in spite of fraud and/or misconduct, there is a principle in science of awaiting independent confirmation of any new results before they are very widely accepted. Where a study is a little shaky on methodological grounds, or even blatantly fabricated, other researchers trying to repeat the study will fail to obtain the same results, and the original study will be discredited at the very least, and most likely ultimately retracted.<br><br><a href=#c1492795599160148183 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 10:00 AM</a><br><br>

Science is a tool; it's a very good tool for the things it's good at, and very poor at almost anything else. That doesn't make it a less valuable tool, any more than a saw's any less of a saw because it's a very poor screwdriver.

Crafts like farming, glassmaking and cooking, and other kinds of technology, look at what is available and how it can be used. When science findings, other craftsman results (like county fairs promoted), or serendipity happen along, they use what seems useful.<br><br>As for using science, not just the tools like microscopes and journaling your progress (like Jenny Craig does for dieting -- is that science?), that looks more like craftsmanship when the purpose is to understand how to get the most from my garden or field, this year, for this crop, with this particular mix of pests and desirable flora and fauna. What I learned from my garden, is that the mix of factors varies from time to time, and there is precious little expectation that underlying 'science' will be applicable time after time.<br><br>It is possible that what you are saying with "salvaging science" is that we need to incorporate as much of the tools and results of the science we know as possible into enduring crafts, to preserve the knowledge as well as the skills in an enduring context.<br><br>We don't after all, want to return to a concept of illness based solely on demons in the body.

This can be anything from <a href=http://nature.ca/explore/di-ef/hpwe_cs_e.cfm rel=nofollow>going out and observing ecosystems</a> to <a href=http://www.zooniverse.org/projects rel=nofollow>identifying astronomical objects or translating Ancient Greek papyri</a>. <br><br>Of course, "citizen science" generally means just helping out in a non-expert capacity. To be a true amateur scientist who designs and interprets their own experiments requires a bit more time and prior knowledge. Sadly, much of the knowledge needed is kept locked up by large scientific publishers, available to the general public only at exorbitant prices (although possibly still attainable at a university library). Open access journals are starting to change that, but not quickly enough in my opinion. <br><br>Getting your research published as an amateur scientist might be difficult too. While in theory it should be possible, I don't think I've ever seen a published paper from somebody not affiliated with a university or research institute. There's also the problem that journal editors tend to only pick articles that they think will be interesting, or more commonly today, will get citations that will improve their journal's impact factor. So articles about, say, the effectiveness of backyard vegetable gardening methods in a particular region might be difficult to get published. One possibility, however, is <a href=http://www.plosone.org/static/information.action rel=nofollow>PLoS One</a>, a journal which reviews submissions solely on technical soundness, with no regard to perceived importance of the research. It's open access too, so could be a good foundation for amateur science (in the near future at least).<br><br><a href=#c5892100685271210841 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 10:20 AM</a><br><br>

The attitude that says "If I can't measure it quantitatively, it doesn't exist" is as much a barrier to full understanding as the attitude that says "quantitative measurements don't matter at all." The point of balance between the two, where quantitative factors receive their due but so do the things that can't be measured, is fiendishly difficult to find and maintain -- but who said that the important things would be easy? <br><br>Larry, thank you! I'm not sure it's the salary that matters so much as the interface between ordinary primate dominance behavior and the world of ideas; when people begin to defend intellectual turf the way baboons defend their home ranges, clarity of thought goes out the window pretty fast. <br><br>GHung, worth having, but I'd be even happier if people were to get the microscope and the notebook and start learning directly from nature!<br><br>Les, er, if you'll take a moment to reread my post you'll find that my comments about science doing little to drive technology were specifically about the period before the late 19th century. That said, it adds up to the same thing -- as the oil runs short, so does the possibility of progress. <br><br>Bill, of course there are multiple points here. Still, I'm less sanguine about the fraud issue than you are. Both my stints at college brought me into direct contact with serious, ongoing scientific fraud, which was treated as a matter of course by everyone involved. Mind you, ecology is the poster child for the kind of scientific field where there's no money worth speaking of, and therefore very little incentive to fraud; I saw none of it in the botany and environmental studies programs with which I was involved. Still, the fraud issue's important for another reason, which is that it's helping to drive the spreading rejection of science on the part of the general public -- an issue that has to be confronted and understood if science is going to survive the next century or so. <br><br>Scodoha, it's not a straw man at all. Breeder reactors are vaporware -- they look great in theory, but not even the richest and most technologically advanced nations on Earth have been able to make the technology work as advertised. It's the same kind of rhetoric that's been used to market nuclear power since day one -- you're probably too young to remember when nukes were going to make electricity too cheap to meter, but I'm not. <br><br>Kirk, bingo. Part of the problem, as I see it, is that the toolkit of science has become conflated with a particular set of attitudes and ideologies that are proving increasingly unhelpful as we run into the limits to growth. Extracting the toolkit from the ideology is thus one of the major challenges of our time. <br><br>Bruce, the only reason I didn't mention Kuhn is that I try to keep my posts below 3000 words! A booklength study would have to revolve around him; the logic he applied to individual sciences, and theories within science, also applies to the entire scientific endeavor as a whole -- and we're well into his crisis phase at this point.<br><br><a href=#c8080062395925624552 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 10:23 AM</a><br><br>

That's one of the least noticed and most crucial signs of contraction, and it's among the main forces pushing the US toward a social explosion. As the sign says, "Watch this space." <br><br>Adrian, it's not easy if you try to ask big questions with global answers. It's a good deal easier if you're trying to ask and answer specific questions about what happens in your own back yard, which is where ecological study needs to start anyway. The biochar study I suggested is an example; two garden beds, a dozen packets of seeds, some biochar, and decent record keeping will do the trick. Rinse and repeat over several years in a dozen gardens and you have a solid answer. <br><br>Raven, funny you should mention Druidry in that context. We're in the process of weaving in that sort of study and practice into the Druid order I head. <br><br>Pete, thank you! Wells was no fool, and that's a stunningly good quote. <br><br>Kieran, as I mentioned to Bill above, my two passes through the US academic industry both exposed me to systematic scientific fraud as an ordinary part of doing business in two relatively large departments. I've heard the same thing from quite a few other people, especially but not only in psychology and health sciences fields. By the nature of the thing, current statistics almost certainly underestimate the prevalence of scientific fraud -- these are only the ones who were clumsy enough to get caught, remember -- and it's also crucial not to underrate the importance of fraud, studies-for-hire, and the like, in driving the spreading backlash against science. <br><br>Brad, it's a bit more complex than that. To some extent, science emerged from craft traditions, as people looking for answers generalized their questions, and there's much to be gained by taking that further step and seeing what you can find out that's applicable outside the boundaries of your own practical needs. Just as logic emerged from the need to prove a point in debate, evolved into a study in its own right, but continued to be used to clarify disputes and figure out who was engaging in empty handwaving, science is worth pursuing in its own right, as well as for the benefits it brings to craft pursuits and the like.<br><br><a href=#c1561377084185794616 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 10:40 AM</a><br><br>

I finally left because they had transformed from places where at least some students, with experiential or academic credentials, were actually trying to learn something, to cash factories that would put McDonald's to shame. All entrance standards were dropped, and the main focus became enrolling the highest number of students, paid for by loans and Pell grants. I taught night classes, and it got to the point that half the class left after the first break. As soon as the expense checks were issued to the students about 8 weeks into the semester, half of them disappeared. The institution, which had served some valuable functions in the educational system, became nothing more than a way to make money. Sadly, most first year students never completed their first year, which was largely comprised of remedial classes to bring their skills up to those of an "old fashioned" high school graduate.<br><br><a href=#c6378552984252208317 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 12:38 PM</a><br><br>

I have several problems here. First, the health sciences versus most of the rest of the sciences are VERY different animals. Medical science is big business, and is dominated by huge corporate interests. Some other fields have a similar situation, like petroleum geology (and Economics if you are silly enough to count this as a science), but in most sciences this is just not the case. It makes for profoundly different ethical and funding environments. It is really misleading to present the PubMed database as though it represents the environment in Science As A Whole.<br><br>Also, there are many reasons why people commit fraud. Sometimes it is for money. But often it is for glory, personal advancement, or purely emotional reasons (e.g. an inability to concede that your convictions are incorrect). I have made the mistake in the past of assuming that people would only commit fraud for rational reasons, and have been proven extremely wrong! For an individual scientists in an underfunded field, tenure is at least as much of a temptation as big corporate kickbacks (probably bigger). Yet still it remains quite rare. <br><br>Finally, sure I agree that a perception of rampant fraud is one of the challenges facing those who would try to find a path for science in the future. Accusations of fraud in, say, climate science or environmental data, are accepted quite eagerly by the mass mind in that beloved conspiracy theory fashion. But (A) is that relevant to your main thesis here, which is explaining why Science As We Have Known It is fundamentally not sustainable, and (B) by presenting possibly the worst case as representative, aren't you actually contributing to the problem you say we will have to overcome?<br><br><a href=#c7419119993559194443 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 1:18 PM</a><br><br>

As I mentioned last week, multiple studies have shown that with college costs as high as they are today, most seniors who enroll in college will never recover financially from the cost of paying off the loans. I agree that there's still a place for valid specialization, but these days college is only a good idea if you're aiming for a narrow range of technical careers, or have money to burn. <br><br>Scodoha, avoiding the issue I've raised while repeating the same claims with more insults and more attitude is not a useful way of carrying on a discussion.

The one point I'd make here, though, is that the dubious morality of some branches of science that get a lot of publicity -- and, yes, health sciences are high on that list -- are indeed an important part of the reason why science as now practiced is unsustainable. The approval, or at least passivity, of the general population is crucial for the survival of science, and that's slipping away -- and the unwillingness of a great many scientists to deal with the role of scientific fraud in helping to cause that loss of approval is not helping matters any. Thus my insistence on bringing it up. <br><br>Uncle Doug, yes, when I wrote about the corners of science that still welcome amateurs I was thinking of half a dozen branches of astronomy, as well as a fair number of the environmental sciences, and also near space studies -- that's one that fascinates me; I could get seriously into ionosphere studies, with or without high altitude balloons, if time and resources permitted. <br><br>Lewis, I'm sorry to hear that!<br><br><a href=#c1158147795102355078 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 3:19 PM</a><br><br>

It practically isn't even science any more.<br><br>One point that I don't recall having been made in this thread is that in many branches of inquiry (e.g., physiological ecology and population genetics, my specialties back in the day), there are competitive teams of researchers at different institutions, who will be all over your sh*t if you try to pull a fast one.

If we will, we aren't seeing it yet. Don Mason's comment seems to highlight the fact that pharmaceuticals are a type of Service-Commodity hybrid that seats itself in the Health/Medical industry. For all I am concerned, that probably will (and probably should in my opinion) fade away into generalization. However, when it comes to research and specialization for medical understanding, procedures, and development of "experts," everything is splintering right now.”<br><br><br>I agree that increased specialization within the medical field is definitely proceeding apace at the moment, but my hunch is that it’s just running on the momentum of massive amounts of borrowed money that can never be paid back.<br> <br>Medical professionals are able to specialize because money is available to pay them; for example, a huge factor in the increase of medical specialties has been insurance reimbursement, particularly from Medicare and Medicaid. <br><br>If you look only at the dollars alone (and ignore the obvious energy and other implications) then these programs are financially unsustainable. Huge (and hugely unpopular) cutbacks in services are inevitable. <br><br>Today’s highly-paid, highly- specialized physicians are largely the top-of-the-pyramid technicians who administer the high-priced, highly-specialized medical technology. As less cash sloshes through the medical/industrial complex, some of these technologies will probably become unaffordable, and the specialties associated with them may dwindle away with the funding.<br> <br>For example, how can an ophthalmologist treat a patient for diabetic retinopathy without Medicare reimbursement that is adequate to pay for his extremely effective but extremely expensive laser? <br><br>Without the money for modern technology, he’s helpless to slow down the inevitable deterioration; he’s reduced to being an old General Practitioner from 1950 who can only grimly advise, “Try to lose some weight, and try to keep your blood sugar under control,” while he watches his patient gradually lose her eyesight.<br> <br>For a while, the technologies will still be available for the wealthy; I imagine that a few rich people will still be able to get their expensive kidney/liver/lung transplants while thousands of formerly middle-class Americans are dying from easily-preventable outbreaks of cholera.<br> <br>But eventually, the supply chains will probably become so disrupted that even the wealthy won’t have those technologies available (although they’ll still get better care then the rest of us.)<br><br>In a more rational world, we would shift the funding towards measures that can help more people for less money (e.g., from high-tech medicine towards public health measures like maintaining potable drinking water supplies).<br> <br>But then, if we were living in a more rational world, we wouldn’t be in the mess that we’re in.<br><br><a href=#c1775981487016080800 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 4:47 PM</a><br><br>

Something with fewer hidden costs is generally better. <br><br>Sealander, I saw that! If I remember correctly, around a dozen people have achieved nuclear fusion with variants of the old Farnsworth fusor they've built in their basements -- that's the "Bussard reactor" that gets so much airtime on cornucopian websites. It's not a viable energy source by any stretch of the imagination, despite Bussard's claims, but I have no objection to people who want to make the experiment; it's relatively safe, and who knows, somebody might pull off a miracle. (Not that I'd recommend holding your breath.) <br><br>Wall, agreed, there's a crucial difference between science as practiced in contemporary America and science as a method -- that's why I'd like to see the method preserved. Still, I think you're overestimating the territory still open to science on the large scale. Have you read David Lindley's <i>The End of Physics</i>, by any chance? Worth a look. <br><br>Bill, that's a useful point. My take, for what it's worth, is that in many cases you need a great deal of observation before experimentation has any real meaning; lacking a good sense of what nature does when left to herself, you risk running experiments that echo your own presuppositions back to you -- this is, for example, the downfall of contemporary economics, which didn't pay enough attention to what actually happens in the real world before it started spinning theories and running very abstract experiments. Still, the experimental method also needs preserving. I took two quarters of experimental design and statistics back in the day, and aced 'em; I've used the concepts ever since, with good results, in some surprising settings.<br><br><a href=#c3905975846472720499 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 5:25 PM</a><br><br>

Feynman summed it up nicely: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science rel=nofollow>Richard Feynman: Cargo Cult Science</a> See here for the <a href=http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html rel=nofollow>full speech</a>.<br><br> How exactly integrity is lacking in each field can vary from fraud in medical research to willfully ignoring more accurate methods in economics to simply not having the funding to do the research properly in ecology. The problem, when you get right down to it, is that the incentives aren't lined up the way they aught to be.<br><br> At its most basic science is about finding the truth. Granted we are talking about abstract technical truths but it is still a pursuit of truth. That requires integrity, in Feynman's words, "a kind of utter honesty--a kind of leaning over backwards" The problem is that we don't value science for the purity of truth. We value it because it has gotten results in the past, we value the results.<br><br> The problem with result driven science is that we want the right results. The conclusion to Limits to Growth, for example, was more or less accurate but unwelcome. Peak oil and climate change are unwelcome because they have the wrong results and that just won't fly in our science produces results culture.<br><br><a href=#c2853566717743958887 title="comment permalink">8/4/11, 10:34 PM</a><br><br>

This underlying assumption is hard to shake off in certain segments of our society. The possibility that scientific research may be producing increasingly marginal returns, or in some cases, making problems even worse, is hard for many people to admit.<br><br>One of many examples: There has been enough research done on diet and lifestyle for people to at least know generally what is a healthy diet and lifestyle, even if many details are still being sorted out. Eat a wide variety of fresh vegetables and fruits, whole grains, and other whole foods; drink lots of water. Avoid added sugar, white flour, highly processed foods, artifical foods with lots of ingredients, fast food. Maintain a lifestyle where you regularly do physical exercise. Don’t sit on a couch watching TV all day. Don’t smoke. And don’t drink excessively. Avoid stress. Get adequate sleep. Have friends who you can talk to and who listen to you. Pursue your creative passions. Basically: Basic common sense. (And you don’t have to have an advanced scientific degree to understand these things.)<br><br>Every day in the news, there are new studies coming out about diet and health. Sometimes conclusions of these studies contradict conclusions of previous studies in the details (enough so that it makes further scientific research yet seem necessary), and sometimes they make new and interesting conclusions in small details. But basically these studies don’t drastically alter the picture about what is good for you and what is not. Eating more broccoli and less McDonald’s meals is still a wise decision.<br><br>More and more research about food and health continues to be done, while people’s actions regarding food and lifestyle are not significantly altered, and the majority of the people haven’t even achieved the rudimentary elements of a healthy lifestyle. The reason why people continue to have unhealthful diets is generally not because a lack of scientific knowledge or lack of further research, but because of psychological, cultural, economic, and political reasons. I often wonder if much more of the money and resources spent on scientific research around health were to be spent on practical work actually making a difference in people’s actions in regard to health, whether it would be better spent.<br><br>Beyond the area of food and health, this is a similar feeling I have towards the orthodoxy of belief that more scientific research is automatically the primary answer to whatever problem we’re looking at—whether it’s current energy issues, global poverty, the crisis of education, or the high incidence of depression. Certainly, scientific research can be a valuable tool, I’m certainly not discounting it altogether. (I’m the daughter of two scientists, and partly because of my family background, I actually have a lot of appreciation for the scientific method and scientific research of certain kinds, while at the same time I’m highly critical of the larger culture in which science operates). But is it where the majority of money, time, and resources should be put to address to the many problems of contemporary society?<br><br>Because of utter complexity, it would probably be impossible to actually design and carry out an adequate scientific study to exactly determine to what extent scientific research has helped address major societal problems (and with historical comparisons), but I think asking the larger questions underlying this fantasy research study is important.<br><br><a href=#c5444072209848048499 title="comment permalink">8/5/11, 1:36 PM</a><br><br>

Since the sources of fuel we’ll have after fossil fuels finish depleting are pretty much the same as the ones the Romans had"<br><br>However, I've yet to hear of a old Roman water turbine, windmill, or nuclear reactor. Perhaps we don't read the same history books?<br><br>Yes, making those turbines and windmills and reactors does take energy, but even as oil gets priced out of sight, our abundant coal reserves can still provide the smelting needed for a century or so. Then, of course, we had better have moved to longer term energy sources, whether fission, fusion, or solar cropping(a form of fusion).<br><br>As for logic being exhausted by the 4th century BCE, hah! Einstein's relativity breakthru, and indeed, most of quantum theory, came not from experiment, but from logic. Digital computers are based totally on Boolean logic, developed in the 19th century.<br><br>Since when is 1833 "recent"? By my count, that's 8 generations ago, and society has been tranformed - as you have complained about.<br><br>Have we reached Peak Science? As Niels Bohr said, "Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future." An analogy often used is that the island of knowledge has an ever expanding shoreline of discovery. We are seeing an exponential growth in scientific papers and inventions. What is more, the shoreline of discovery is more and more under scrutiny by more people. The internet is making the increasing knowledge available to an increasing number of people. More people are also becoming skilled in the procedures of science" postulating, observing, measuring, thinking.<br><br>The telephone was discovered almost simultaneously by Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray. Calculus was invented nearly simultaneously by Newton and Leibnitz. When the soil is ready and conditions ripe, many plants will grow!<br><br>With information ever more available to more individuals, I expect there to be growing numbers of inventions and discoveries, and of these, a proportion will be significant breakthroughs. The telephone, when invented, was not seen as a breakthrough. Who would you call? And the telephone was very limited in range. Western Union had a chance to buy the invention but passed it by to concentrate on its telegraphy because telegraphy "had a brighter future."<br><br>Still, your advice to your readers to start postulating, observing, measuring, thinking (and repeat) - is wise. We didn't know the theories of genetics when we bred plants and animals to continually improve their productivity. The theories just enabled later leaps rather than plodding. As Georgi Marinov delineates, science is understanding, technology is the application of science and experience.<br><br>Still, it does pay inventors/scientists to collaborate - see <a href="http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=38533" rel=nofollow>http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=38533</a><br><br>We are doing more with less. The CPUs of today are many, many orders of magnitude more efficient than when first built. Cars are more efficient, at least to run. We have electric bicycles. Fibre optics carries signals much further with less power than copper wires. As well as conservation reducing power demands, t\science can reduce power demands too.<br><br>Will science solve <strong>all</strong> problems? Who knows? Given enough time... But better to depend on <em>past</em> science than <em>hope</em> in future science. It's clear that JMG's thesis that our fossil fuels are running out and our political masters have their head in the sand and that a severe crisis is inevitable has a significant chance of becoming true.<br><br><a href=#c1169025953026259266 title="comment permalink">8/5/11, 3:36 PM</a><br><br>

Science actually tries to make things less scary thru knowledge and control. (Alas, doesn't always work,e,g, nuclear weapons...)

Scientific fraud is among the things that feeds that perception, though of course it's not the only one. <br><br>Tim, that's another part of the issue, of course. Scientists like Ray Kurzweil have insisted for so long that science can ultimately do anything that most people outside the scientific community don't want to hear it when what scientific research actually says is "no." <br><br>Cherokee, I have no idea how many Americans know about it. I do, but then I get most of my news from overseas sources. <br><br>Les, no argument there.

The Romans didn't have nuclear reactors, of course, but they did have water turbines -- we'd call them water wheels -- and used wind extensively for seagoing transport and a variety of industrial processes. <br><br>You also need to read my posts a little more carefully before trying to slag them. If you had, you might have noticed that I said that the development of logic stopped in the 4th century BCE and remained stopped, ahem, "for the next dozen centuries or so." That might have suggested to you that I was leaving room for Boolean and other non-Aristotelian logic -- though of course that would have interfered with the cheap shot you were trying to make. <br><br>Finally, with regard to nuclear waste, I'll make you a deal. I'll put ten pounds of coal ash in my basement, and you put ten pounds of used nuclear fuel rods in your basement. I think you'd notice the difference -- and so would everyone who had the misfortune of living nearby for the next quarter of a million years. All the rhetorical gamesmanship in the world doesn't change the fact that nuclear power is a Faustian bargain that gets electricity now at the cost of poisoning the environment for longer than our species has been around -- and that, as I hope we learn one of these days, is very nearly the definition of ecological stupidity.<br><br><a href=#c8204357766920272527 title="comment permalink">8/5/11, 4:42 PM</a><br><br>

As several commenters have pointed out, fraud remains far from general in many branches of science, and it's by no means pervasive even in some of those areas that involve plenty of profit -- just common enough to feed popular distrust of science. <br><br>Sgage, I think you're seriously underestimating the social impact of the broader context of scientific dishonesty I mentioned -- the fact that the opinion of a qualified scientist can be had for the price of a grant or two, and the role that some scientists play in public as shills for various interests. That combines with high profile media stories on scientific fraud -- which are far from uncommon -- to create the distrust I've mentioned. <br><br>Sofistek, did you read the article itself or just the Science Daily squib? It cited quite a few numbers -- and the crucial one was the number of repeat offenders, which suggests strongly that at least in the health sciences, scientific fakery is not being punished the way the broader scientific community insists it's supposed to be. The broad distrust of science? See Susan's comment for one of many measurements. The media coverage of scientific fraud? I have no idea what media you watch; here in the US, there's about one much-discussed case a year. <br><br>Hair, yes, I figured somebody would wade in to insist that I have no business discussing the future of science since I'm not a scientist. Quite the contrary; as an educated layperson with an extensive background in intellectual history, I can stand back far enough from the grindstone to see a perspective that active researchers often can't, or at least don't. I don't claim to be able to tell you how close your specific subfield is to the point of diminishing returns, much less where research dollars ought to be spent; but I look at science as a whole -- as a human phenomenon not unlike certain other phenomena in history -- and see certain patterns repeating themselves. <br><br>If you disagree with that assessment, then by all means make a case for a different view. This notion that only scientists have the right to assess the progress of science, though, and that the rest of us simply ought to shut up and sign the checks that pay your salaries, is as arrogant as it is unwise; that sort of attitude is another of the factors that's driving the collapse in the social prestige of science I've been discussing here. <br><br>Ventriloquist, I hadn't heard that yet!

You do not need any real evidence at all to get the public to believe a juicy conspiracy story, especially when it tells them that It Is Not Their Fault. Skipping over the point of whether or not "climate gate" and other actions constitute bona fide malfeasance and data fabrication, to the second point about the belief that there is no scientific consensus on the issue. Again, not to debate the climate facts but instead the presence of absence of consensus, whichever way it may or may not lie, as a means to examine where public perceptions of science come from (I reiterate, ON-topic)... There is extremely strong consensus (near unanimity) among professional climate scientists on the point. Even the Association of Petroleum Geologists has backed away from their skeptical position and adopted a neutral stand -- one of the very few professional societies to even go that far towards the skeptical side. This mass public perception that there is widespread and serious skepticism within the scientific community is purely, absolutely, 100% manufactured propaganda, with no factual basis whatsoever (please don't anyone bother trotting out individual high-profile media-savvy skeptics; those exist for every issue, especially where there is industry money or religious faith involved. Smoking doesn't cause cancer and dinosaurs coexisted with humans, too). Yet it is believed by a majority of Americans because it feeds their emotional needs. I expect a similar number of people believe that the Mayans predicted the end of the world in December 2012. No facts needed there either, but it sure sells books and movies and helps people believe that The End Of The World Will Not Be Our Fault. <br><br>To repeat and summarize -- this survey reveals more about the conspiracy-loving American mind than it does about American science. It is of course true that public opinion surveys do not tell you what science is, but they do help tell you quite a bit about mass psychology.<br><br><a href=#c2606235059358863815 title="comment permalink">8/6/11, 6:24 AM</a><br><br>

You've taken two data points -- first, the fact that I used one example to make a particular point in a blog post that covered a lot of ground, and second, the fact that I don't work as a research scientist -- and made a whole series of sweeping assumptions on that basis, winding up with the claim that I "haven't taken the time to understand it" -- "it" here presumably being science.<br><br>I expressed my view in terms of a personal assessment, and I've already explained to you the basis of that assessment -- a comparison of modern science to similar phenomena in human intellectual history. If you're going to caricature that by claiming that I think I know better than anyone else, or what have you, I don't thik you're paying attention to what I'm actually saying. <br><br>Cherokee, yes, I've read up on the news at this point -- and it's not as though this comes as a surprise.

I don't argue for a moment that what's driving the results Susan's cited is the same spiralling distrust in authority figures that also expresses itself in the conspiracy theories I critiqued a week or so ago. <br><br>Still, that distrust didn't come out of nowhere, and I don't think it's fair to insist that it's purely a function of people refusing to hear the answers they don't want. There's also the fact that a great many once-respected sources of authority in the US have shown themselves to be all too willing to sell out for wealth and influence. The public face of science has seen enough of that in recent years that a great many people trust scientists no more than they trust, say, reporters, clergypersons, or physicians -- to name just a few examples. <br><br>Ghung, well, yes. My concern is that a fair number of readers of this blog may have been putting off crisis preparations on the assumption that crunch time is still a few years off -- and there's at least some reason to think that it's here, right now. <br><br>Mustard, I've already got the pens, and know how to use them.

There are things it does very well -- repairing injuries, for instance. But even its own triumphs it can tend to destroy, such as the overuse of antibiotics rendering these miracle drugs steadily less useful. But with things more subtle than a broken bone or abscessed tooth, my own experiences have not wowed me. When I used to go to doctors more often, my experience was that they would first misdiagnose the problem, give me some pills for the wrong thing, then eventually arrive at the same diagnosis I had suspected myself before the first visit, and give me some more pills. My wife watched the mainstream establishment spend 2 years and probably $10,000+ of her insurance company's money coming up with absolutely no diagnosis at all for a chronic problem (after stuffing her full of many medications that did not help). Basically they said "you don't have cancer; other than that we have nothing to offer." About hundred dollars worth of visits to an acupuncturist and body worker gave her two independent nearly-identical diagnoses within the eastern school, and after a month of very modest (and extremely inexpensive) ayurvedic modifications to her diet the problem went away. Another problem she had, which her mainstream doctors misdiagnosed and offered nothing put pain killers for, was largely resolved by a chiropracter and massage therapist. <br><br>Again, it's not really mistrust, just feeling that they are much less omnipotent than they believe.<br><br><a href=#c2234603974215696268 title="comment permalink">8/6/11, 1:53 PM</a><br><br>

They're not too far from yours, though there's a body count involved. <br><br>Cherokee, that's exactly the point I'd hope to make. When a specialization is healthy, there's always a dialogue between people in the specialization and people outside it, and the differing perspectives help keep both sides on track. When that breaks down, very often the specialization runs off the rails in one way or another. <br><br>MCP, there's a health care crisis, and then there's an economic crisis that's impacting health care. I'll be talking about both of those. We have the most expensive health care in the world here in the US, and we also have very poor public health -- are you aware, for example, that our rates of infant mortality are on a par with Indonesia's? -- and a stunningly high level of morbidity and mortality directly caused by health care procedures. The money crisis and the health crisis weave together in complex ways, and the impact of peak oil on both is going to be a massive challenge. More on this shortly. <br><br>Hector, I'll be interested to hear your response to the upcoming post. I've had some good experiences with physicians, as well as some ghastly ones, but the core issues in the US health care crisis have much more to do with the institutional framework of health care than with individual doctors and other professionals. I'll be addressing that. For what it's worth, by the way, I do have some experience of power, and of course you're quite right; the question that needs to be asked is whether you use your power to empower others, or to reinforce the barriers that set you apart from them. It's the old question: do you serve the love of power or the power of love? <br><br>Sophie, sounds like a plan!

It's a source of wry amusement to me that autism so often seems to spark the sort of quarrel where everybody seems to lose any capacity to empathize with or understand everyone else!<br><br>Ozark, it's partly that, I think, and partly the catastrophic impact of wholly profit-centered management, which has produced a medical system that produces high profits and poor health.

It means that laws need tune-ups at least as often as bicycles. If the rule of law gives way -- and that's likely enough sooner or later; it's a common event in the decline and fall of civilizations -- what's left is violence and chaos, and the closing off of an entire galaxy of human possibility until the survivors remember why laws and customs that limit the human propensity for brutality are a good idea.<br><br><a href=#c240569493935402541 title="comment permalink">8/7/11, 12:57 PM</a><br><br>

You got an x-ray. They said no fracture, take aspirin, go home. You feel dismissed and go somewhere else, fair enough. Well, here's the other side of the story...<br><br>Your patient comes in, limping. First thing you think of is I need to rule out a fracture. Sprains/strains heal themselves just fine without intervention, fractures don't, therefore what's important is to make sure there's no fracture. X-ray comes back, boom, no fracture. Take some anti-inflammatory (aspirin) to ease the pain. If I give the patient opiates, there's the possibility of addiction, diversion of medications, etc., best to just say take aspirin since this is an <br>ED and I can't really follow-up with the patient. Nor is the ED really the setting to make outpatient referrals for longer-term, non-emergent things, hence the name Emergency Department. I've determined you'll heal fine on your own, my job is done.<br><br>Had you gone to a primary care doctor afterwards, you very likely would have been referred to physical therapy and given a brace to help with your mobility, maybe maybe not opiates, depends on the doc. Anyway...<br><br>You went to the TCM guy, he made you feel welcome and validated, and you got better in two months. Guess how long it would have taken you to get better on your own without any intervention? That's right, about two months. That's what the ED doc thought all along when he nudged you out of the door. There really wasn't any need from his perspective to drag it out any longer. Not very touchy-feely, but then again, that's what an ED doc's job is, figure out quickly what needs his direct intervention and what doesn't, treat appropriately, and then move on to the next patient. That's just how it is. Had you had a life-threatening condition or even something like a dislocation or laceration requiring his intervention, you probably would have left with a somewhat different impression about how much he cares about your well-being, but what can I say, you didn't. Should you ever find yourself with crushing chest pain, the worst headache of your life, a gunshot wound, etc., don't let that stop you from going back to the ED first as opposed to the TCM guy, though.<br><br><a href=#c5553949938425186647 title="comment permalink">8/7/11, 5:05 PM</a><br><br>

But it's not obvious to anyone that this option is available. It's certainly not publicized by the practice to which he belongs.<br><br>In fact, once you connect with that practice's front desk, the very first words you hear, before the phone tree starts, are along the lines of "if this is an urgent problem, don't tell us about it.

Agreed? <br><br>Larson, next year put the fish under a different row. Rinse and repeat, record your results, and yes, it's science. <br><br>Sean, from my perspective nihilism is simply self-indulgent. The universe may be vast, but I don't live in "the universe" or any other abstraction; I live right here, right now, in the flurry of challenges and possibilities that we might as well simply call "life." I can run away from that reality into nihilism or some other escapist ideology, but that's an evasion that doesn't interest me -- as you say, life is short, and when it's winding down I'd much rather look back on a life of passionate participation than on one spent sitting on my hands and brooding about how meaningless it all is. <br><br>The words Stan Lee put into the mouth of The Mighty Thor come to mind: "‘Tis not by dropping out – but by plunging in – into the maelstrom of life itself – that thou shalt find thy wisdom! There be causes to espouse! There be battles to be won! There be glory and grandeur all about thee – if thou wilt but see!"

Thanks for backing me up. Just to give a little bit of extra information, I wasn't in my own country at the time, although the doctors who dealt with me were British-trained. <br><br>Still, your comment precisely demonstrates the point I was making. As you said, from those doctors' POV, all boxes had been checked. "I've determined you'll heal fine on your own, my job is done." As @Robert/mageprof has already pointed out, from the patient's perspective things looked different. How hard would it have been for those doctors to explain that I needed to see a general practitioner, get physiotherapy etc? Bear in mind that I was still in great pain, still very stressed and confused after a sudden accident. Just that little bit of support and guidance would have made a big difference. <br><br>That perhaps helps to clarify the distinction I was trying to make towards the end of my original comment.<br><br>Let's put it this way: my parents' GP for many, many years was the General Practitioner of legend, a genial, whisky-drinking Scotsman who knew all of his patients personally, and gave advice according to what the individual needed. <br><br>By the time I reached adulthood, things had changed. My experience is of doctors who don't really know their patients and frankly don't take much interest. The incident with my ankle was only an extreme example.<br><br>Note that we still haven't reached any discussion of Western medical science vs other systems yet. My point is that the Western medical system, which these days seems more about box-checking and budgets than about patient well-being. (I'll also note that my entire family, and friends, would do almost anything to avoid going into a Western hospital, after a family member who was admitted for something minor came back in a far, far worse condition).<br><br>TCM doctors, in my experience, actually do take an interest in the wellbeing of their patients. <br><br>I'm not going to get into an argument about this. Of course, we could throw example and counter-example about, and it will get us nowhere. This is my personal experience, and that's what I make my decisions on.<br><br>To briefly add more on other points I made previously:<br><br>- during my MBA, I studied the pharma industry. We looked at how reps from pharma companies will visit doctors on a regular basis is champion new drugs, often with incentives. I am unconvinced that greater patient wellbeing is the outcome or purpose of these relationships.<br><br>- on a separate occasion, I broke my wrist when I was knocked off my bicycle. It was put into a cast for months. When the bones had knitted, the cast was taken off and I was left to my own devices; I still couldn't use the hand, because of damage to the soft tissues. Once again, I was given no guidance as to who I should see next, or what I needed to follow up. A friend, who is a TCM doctor, told me that had I come to see him after I was injured, he would have splinted the arm, wrapped it in herbs to help the soft tissue mend, and given regular massage. I would have healed much more quickly. Here we see a difference in approach between the two systems very clearly: the compartmentalized Western system which looks at the patient as 'parts-based' (eg "I'm an osteopath; soft tissue is nothing to do with me") vs a TCM approach based on the whole person...<br><br>There's much more to be discussed on this topic. Let's wait and see what JMG has to say later this week. <br><br>And now I'm going into the garden to practice my qigong....<br><br><a href=#c5331197939182188317 title="comment permalink">8/8/11, 1:23 AM</a><br><br>

It resonated and reminded me of all the lessons my grandfather used to give us on the perils of becoming "educated fools." He believed understanding human nature was often more valuable than "book learning." <br><br>His approach to teaching was to take a young person with him when he went out into the world. After an interaction he considered valuable, he would ask "What just happened? Tell me what you learned from this."<br><br>I remember, as a child, wanting to respond as I would in the classroom; with a desire to please, to be correct and to be viewed as smart.<br><br>At that point, he would usually bemoan the loss of a common understanding of human nature. <br><br>For instance, he often pointed out that most people are more motivated by a desire to be thought of as a good person rather than purely for personal advantage. He also warned us to steer clear in our dealings of those who didn't fit into that category because they tended to be con artists no matter what position they held in society.<br><br>While these ideas didn't always make a whole lot of sense at the time, they did have staying power.

It's particularly good to see somebody in the scientific community recognizing that science is simply a method of generating mental models of experience -- that's an awareness not often found in recent publications. (On the other hand, your comment rehashing the usual round of pro-nuclear talking points was off topic and went where off topic comments go.) <br><br>Sean, ah, I see the problem. Science hasn't done anything of the kind; science -- as the link in tOm's comment points out -- is simply a good way of generating mental models of certain parts of human experience. For reasons rooted in history, that method has become tangled up in a set of very powerful and dysfunctional myths. The most important of those latter is the one you've termed nihilism -- the notion that the only things that exist are bits of dead matter bobbing about in infinite empty space. <br><br>That's not something that can be proved or disproved by the scientific method; all the scientific method can show is that a model of the universe consisting of bits of dead matter bobbing about in infinite empty space isn't contradicted by the phenomena we can easily quantify, but that's it -- and since a great deal of human experience can't be quantified, it's by definition a partial explanation at best. <br><br>What gives the myths of science their power is that they feed the human ego with daydreams of omnipotence and irresponsibility -- read Ray Kurzweil's books for the latest iteration of those daydreams, or simply think about the delusional hubris woven into the usual-until-recently scientific rhetoric about "the conquest of nature." It's all very intoxicating, but when you come right down to it, it's every bit as mythical as any Norse tale about the gods, and arguably has less of value to teach us. <br><br>Hector, excellent! No argument there -- and you'll find that most alternative health practitioners are very quick to refer people to MDs when there's evidence of one of the conditions MDs can treat well, as they tend to get crucified in the media and the courts if they don't. If MDs were quicker to refer patients to alternative health practitioners when the health condition in question is something that MDs don't handle well, I suspect we'd have a much saner allocation of health care in this country. <br><br>Grrl, true enough -- and yes, the main issue is systemic. <br><br>Jason, Matt Wood's a wizard -- and I use that term advisedly, and with great respect. He's one of the herbalists I read most carefully. Thanks for the links!

It's another thing entirely to watch it play out firsthand.<br><br>One of the things I'm noticing is that people across the board are projecting their belief systems onto the question as to where it's all going. Their belief systems also tend to follow their age and how desperately they need a return to business as usual. Over here, most people are exposed to the share market through compulsory retirement savings (superannuation) whereby 9% of your gross salary is regularly contributed on behalf of your employer (it also applies to the self employed - if they pay themselves a wage).<br><br>If you want another website that provides a fairly indpendent economic analysis have a look at:<br><br>www.macrobusiness.com.au<br><br>It's quite good and fairly honest.<br><br>Hey Ventriloquist,<br><br>Yeah, it seems to me that it may well be framed as a political issue over your way. Beware of this analysis though because it's a structural shift which is something else again. The downgrade actually sends a signal that the ratings agencies have strong doubts that the debt in question can be repaid. It's a statement on the toxic political environment - they have no answers for the current predicament except whats been tried in the past and failed miserably.<br><br>The reason that this has come to a head is because Greece has defaulted in all but name. The other PIIGS (note the extra I for Italy) countries are expected to follow at some stage in the future. Who'd have thought that sovereign debt could be a problem (said facecitously)?<br><br>It seems as if we are fated to repeat history.<br><br>Regards.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c7301127471001590681 title="comment permalink">8/8/11, 3:36 PM</a><br><br>

Only rarely do I see high school and college age "others" who want to disengage from the mainstream. As someone who grew up in the 60s, I find this difficult to understand, but perhaps this article explains a bit of what happened."<br><br>From my own years of teaching at Brown University from 1967 to 2005, I think something else is going on than what the article conjectures. There has indeed been a noticeable change, even at a very free-form and liberal university like Brown. <br><br>I noticed the change from about 1995 onward. Many students began to "run scared," to act as though there was no room whatsoever in their lives for intellectual experimentation. And there were more of them every year. <br><br>It wasn't the college debt hanging over their heads. A large fraction of the students at Brown come from very rich families, and they were running just as scared as the others. <br><br>Rather, it seemed to be a huge lack of confidence in their own ability to cope with the incomprehensible world of grown-ups, a real terror of having to function as a grown-up on one's own. <br><br>There was also a sense that the world their parents had made was like a castle built on sand and was about to be washed away by the waves -- but if you asked them, they couldn't say just what those waves might consist of. So they just hunkered down and gritted their teeth against the impending blows. <br><br>Of course there were exceptions, many brave and wonderful exceptions eager to get on with the challenges of life. But they had bcome the exceptions, not the rule, among students.<br><br>It seems to me to be some sort of generational shift, perhaps vaguely along the lines mapped out by theorists like, e.g., Strauss and Howe. I have lived through one of these generational shifts before, since I was born in the middle of WW II and am therefore not a "Baby Boomer," but a card-carrying member of the Silent Generation. The '60s -- the free speech movement, the Beatles, etc. -- were not part of my world or my wife's, but very much a part of our younger siblings' worlds. That generational shift happened rapidly, and caught us old fogies (in our mid twenties) quite by surprise!<br><br>But of course smaller changes and new inventions can feed into a generational shift. I think one of the things that fed into the current shift was the increasing fear of any risk-taking in general, so well pilloried by Lenore Skenazy on her blog "Free Range Kids." <br><br>Another was the growing presence of TV in younger children's lives, and the decline of conversation within many families as everyone had his or her own TV set to watch. The rhythms of light and sound that a TV makes, quite apart from the content of any show, induce a light trance in which suggestibility and passivity are increased. This has to be a factor in the growing sense of fear and helpless isolation. <br><br>No doubt there are other factors as well, but some of it is -- I think -- a result of the simple, natural processes that produce generational shifts at regular intervals in the history of any country or culture.<br><br><a href=#c5813470150417551155 title="comment permalink">8/8/11, 8:01 PM</a><br><br>

Even if they end up disabled, the courts are now deducting a percentage of their Social Security Disability checks to make payments on their student loans – and with the interest compounding, the principal balance just keeps getting larger. <br><br>Talk about cruel and inhuman punishment.

There are a lot of social tensions there - high youth unemployment and the middle class with negative equity in their households... I suspect there is a sense that they have been sold out. It can't be a good recipe. It's a situation which breeds unpleasantness.<br><br>Now today, perhaps QE3? - this must be the greatest heist of public funds in history! It's selling off your kids so that you can enjoy another year of respite from reality. It can only end in hyperinflation, there can't possibly be another ending to it all? I'm hoping by some miracle that there is a less damaging end game though.<br><br>Hi all,<br><br>Some of the recent comments have touched upon the lack of political engagement of gen x and gen y. Well as a member of gen x, I can state that the baby boomer generation had it comparitively pretty easy. <br><br>Whilst they may have enjoyed secure employment for many years with loyal employers, my experience was that I was made redundant during the first few years of employment during the recession in the very early 90's. It is always at the back of my mind that employers lack loyalty and will stick it to you without a moments hesitation if it suits their needs, regardless of past performance.<br><br>Higher education began to be a debt laden proposition just as I entered it. It can't be argued around, it was a societal decision to charge students once the majority (ie. tax payers) no longer wished to burden themselves with the cost of providing it. This was despite baby boomers enjoying the benefits of free education for about two decades.<br><br>Oh yeah, households could exist as a single income household during the baby boomer period too, because it was a lot cheaper to buy houses in the first place and building standards weren't so draconian. Now with double income households all that we've achieved is more expensive housing - well done everyone.<br><br>Baby boomers are a political force too as the taxation system here is geared towards them. Retirement savings (superannuation) is tax free for now. Imagine that. By the time I get to retire I can't imagine that there will be a health or welfare net at all, let alone superannuation funds to draw on. No wonder I spend time learning about medicinal herbs.<br><br>So what did the baby boomers achieve during the protests and uprisings of the late 60's and early 70's? I keep seeing reminiscences but very little else. The Vietnam war had run it's course by the time that US and it's allies (of which we were also part of) withdrew from? I watched the movie "The Big Chill" and all it did was annoy me - good soundtrack though.<br><br>What are we left with now: a divided, uncommunicative, isolated, consumerist society that worries about where it's next cheque is going to come from and what trinket they're going to buy with it.<br><br>For all of your talk people, I don't see you guys marching on the streets either and if you are what are you achieving?<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c2100085942998352415 title="comment permalink">8/9/11, 2:53 AM</a><br><br>

Reduce consumption. Try to live a more reasonable life.<br><br>What did we accomplish?<br><br>Not much. But look at the forces arrayed against us who wanted to keep the hyper-consumption economy going:<br><br>The labor unions hated us.<br>The farmers hated us.<br>The retirees hated us.<br>The police, firefighters, etc. hated us.<br>The small business owners hated us.<br>The corporate CEO’s hated us.<br><br>And then when Nixon invaded Cambodia in 1970, the National Guard troops started shooting us.<br> <br>At some point, you begin to get the feeling that “Hey, guys. I don’t think that they like the idea of reducing consumption.”<br><br>But now it’s a different story. Reducing consumption isn’t going to be an option. You can either do it now, with some grace. Or you can do it later, in a frantic rush for the exits as it crashes down on people’s heads.<br><br>Agreed: “The Big Chill” was annoying – particularly since I’m a member of that generation. Whining Boomers. Ugh.<br><br>But you can’t argue with the drum intro to “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg.” And maybe the Temptations were singing about the Consumer Society: “I know you want to leave me, but I refuse to let you go…”<br><br><a href=#c4825079198978962314 title="comment permalink">8/9/11, 9:17 AM</a><br><br>

In the case of birds, for example, the data being collected by programs such as the Breeding Bird Survey are being collected by some of the absolute top experts in the world on the identification of wild birds in the field on the fly (as it were). If you want a bird identified, don't ask the ornithologist at your local university. Ask your local amateur bird nut. Amateur astronomers are likewise some of the best-trained and most experienced observers on the planet. Storm spotters and participants in weather monitoring programs (like CoCoRaHAS) receive official training and many are keen and detailed observers. I'm sure it really depends on the field, but programs that engage amateurs to collect basic essential monitoring data about the ever-changing natural world are generally engaging highly skilled and extremely dedicated experts.

I would first distinguish between hard and soft sciences. Some things just lend themselves more easily to a hard science approach especially those that are consistently measurable like in physics and biology. <br><br>Then there are the "soft" sciences like psychology. Statistics are often used in lieu of consistent measurement. Here is where we start to run into trouble. As we all know statistics are usually "massaged" to make it more "manageable". Naturally we need to be careful to not make assumptions about what causes what, like poor eating habits causing lung cancer when the underlying cause is smoking that promotes both cancer and poor eating habits.<br><br>One important field often dresses itself up as a science - Economics. Now we all know that science with its hypotheses etc. is used in predicting results in an experiment. <br><br>But.... do we want to or can we "experiment" with economics? All we can really do with economics is come up with hypotheses (note: not theories which are proven hypothesis). <br><br>JMG said: "Bill, that's a useful point. My take, for what it's worth, is that in many cases you need a great deal of observation before experimentation has any real meaning; lacking a good sense of what nature does when left to herself, you risk running experiments that echo your own presuppositions back to you -- this is, for example, the downfall of contemporary economics, which didn't pay enough attention to what actually happens in the real world before it started spinning theories and running very abstract experiments. Still, the experimental method also needs preserving;"<br><br>JMG in "The Wealth of Nature", p. 187 - "Like any other science, economics is a set of hypothetical models that reflect, with more or less exactness, the observed behavior of the world. Too often, though, the models get confused with the reality, and understanding suffers."<br><br>I can't see economics as a science. Maybe a Social Science, but it really doesn't lend itself to experimentation.

Three are in the peaceful woodsy rural hills-n-hollers near here, the 4th skirts the shores of Reelfoot Lake in far NW Tennessee, as close as we get to being "coastal" around here -- herons, egrets, eagles, ospreys. The southeast has lots of square miles and not so many observers as New England, many of us have to double (triple, quadruple.. septuple... etc.) up. Makes for a busy but exciting early summer! <br><br>Re: Yoga... I just turned 50, and as I enter the core of middle age I can see how differentially the men in my cohort are aging. I've noticed a bunch of consistent trends among the ones who are faring better -- for the most part obvious things like not smoking, staying active, eating well, not being obese. And another consistent trend is yoga or some other spiritual-physical-mind-body practice. So I have added it to my daily routine. I have been astounded at some of the effects in just about 5-6 weeks. My blood pressure was already fine (about 120/75); still it has dropped substantially! Today sitting in the middle of the Mall*Wart doing a simple breathing practice, it tested out at 87/70!!! Readings of about 98/65 are common for me now (on the same machine that routinely registered 120/75 in June). My sleeping has improved, and I get the sense that my prostate is happier as well. And so far it has cost me not one single penny.<br><br><a href=#c5681677455517810069 title="comment permalink">8/10/11, 4:25 PM</a><br><br>

It gets very little consideration because those competent to discuss it often have a vested interest in ignoring it. In my 17 years work as a professional scientist I have concluded that a part of science is not only in a period of diminishing returns, but is essentially irrelevant to practical concerns. The search for ever more fundamental principles of how nature works is over as a practical matter. There is simply nothing useful that anyone is going to do with dark matter or the Higgs particle or super-strings in the next few centuries. Or stated another way, we already have fundamental theories that are good enough approximations that improving on them will not be technologically useful in the next few centuries. These subjects should continue to be studied for the same reason we should continue to create great art...because it is part of what is good about humanity. But we should not expect practical benefits, and the resources devoted to these subjects will have to decrease.<br><br>However, fundamental physics is a pretty small part of science (despite what the pop-sci programs might imply). Most scientists work on understanding materials or cells or planet earth... all things with much more useful potential. Now JMG is arguing that these also are luxuries that will not be affordable with declining energy available. Maybe. There has been some diminishing returns when the simple parts of some systems are worked out revealing that the entire system is very much more complicated than our current tools can deal with. Think of a cell...some have thought that once we knew the sequence of the protein coding sections of DNA, we would have it mostly figured out, but there are vast networks controlling protein expression and now we find a vast range of microRNA that also contribute. But discovering something is more complex than you hoped is not the same as diminishing returns. It more reflects overly-optimistic hopes, which as JMG points out seems to be a widespread human failing.<br><br>As other commenters have posted, I think the original post overestimates the importance of explicit fraud. There are more cases of borderline fraud...things like presenting data without mentioning problems with the measurements in hope that it will slip through the reviewers. The real problem is pursuit of personal advancement over substantial progress. If one just churns out papers and grant proposals you will often get more recognition and money than if you systematically advance the field.<br><br>I think you are wrong in thinking that science will return to primarily an amateur pursuit. The world is too complicated for serious progress to be made without dedicated focus on understanding it. It will take experts in experimental studies of crop yields or experts in organic soil biology and chemistry to address your biochar issue, not amateur gardeners. The benefits of understanding are too valuable for communities not to figure out ways to pay some of their best minds to pursue science. I expect a major change in the kinds of problems that scientists work on. And there will likely be a decrease in the fraction of society that can be employed as pure scientists. But the end of cheap energy will increase the emphasis that humans place on applied science and engineering, and societies that find ways to maintain specialization in these areas will out-compete societies that return to a system without specialized scientists.<br><br><a href=#c170661419300939137 title="comment permalink">8/30/11, 6:34 PM</a><br><br>
