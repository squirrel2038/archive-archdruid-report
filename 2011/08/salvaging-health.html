The old chestnut about living in interesting times may not actually be a Chinese curse, as today’s urban folklore claims, but it certainly comes to mind when glancing back over the smoldering wreckage of the past week. In the wake of a political crisis here in America that left both sides looking more than ever like cranky six-year-olds, a long-overdue downgrade of America’s unpayable debt, and yet another round of fiscal crisis in the Eurozone, stock and commodity markets around the globe roared into a power dive from which, as I write this, they show no sign of recovering any time soon.
<br> <br>In England, meanwhile, one of those incidents Americans learned to dread in the long hot summers of the Sixties—a traffic stop in a poor minority neighborhood, a black man shot dead by police under dubious circumstances—has triggered four nights of looting and rioting, as mobs in London and elsewhere organized via text messages and social media, brushed aside an ineffectual police presence, plundered shops and torched police stations, and ripped gaping holes in their nation’s already shredding social fabric. It seems that “Tottenham” is how the English pronounce “Watts,” except that the fire this time is being spread rather more efficiently with the aid of Blackberries and flashmobs.
<br> <br>Government officials denounced the riots as “mindless thuggery,” but it’s considerably more than that. As one looter cited in the media said, “this is my banker’s bonus”—the response of the bottom of the social pyramid, that is, to a culture of nearly limitless corruption further up. It bears remembering that the risings earlier this year in Tunisia, Egypt, and elsewhere began with exactly this sort of inchoate explosion of rage against governments that responded to economic crisis by tightening the screws on the poor; it was only when the riots showed the weakness of the existing order that more organized and ambitious movements took shape amid the chaos. It’s thus not outside the bounds of possibility, if the British government keeps on managing the situation as hamhandedly as it’s done so far, that the much-ballyhooed Arab Spring may be followed by an English Summer—and just possibly thereafter by a European Autumn.
<br> <br>One way or another, this is what history looks like as it’s happening. Those of my readers who have been following along for a year or two, and have made at least a decent fraction of the preparations I’ve suggested, are probably as well prepared for the unfolding mess as anyone is likely to be. Those who have just joined the conversation, or were putting aside preparations for some later date—well, once the rubble stops bouncing and the smoke clears, you’ll have the chance to assess what possibilities are still open and what you have the resources to accomplish. In the meantime, I want to continue the sequence of posts already under way, and discuss another of the things that’s going to have to be salvaged as the current system grinds awkwardly to a halt.
<br> <br>The theme of this week’s discussion, I’m sorry to say, is another issue split down the middle by the nearly Gnostic dualisms that bedevil contemporary American society. Just as Democrats and Republicans denounce each other in incandescent fury, and fundamentalist atheists compete with fundamentalist Christians in some sort of Olympics of ideological intolerance, the issues surrounding health care in America these days have morphed unhelpfully into a bitter opposition between the partisans of mainstream medicine and the proponents of alternative healing. The radicals on both sides dismiss the other side as a bunch of murderous quacks, while even those with more moderate views tend to regard the other end of the spectrum through a haze of suspicion tinged with bad experiences and limited knowledge.
<br> <br>I stay out of such debates as often as I can, but this one hasn’t given me that choice. Ironically, that’s because I’ve experienced both sides of the issue. On the one hand, I’m alive today because of modern medicine. At the age of seven, I came down with a serious case of scarlet fever. That’s a disease that used to kill children quite regularly, and in a premodern setting, it almost certainly would have killed me. As it was, I spent two weeks flat on my back, and pulled through mostly because of horse doctor’s doses of penicillin, administered first with syringes that to my seven-year-old eyes looked better suited for young elephants, and thereafter in oral form, made palatable with an imitation banana flavoring I can still call instantly to mind.
<br> <br>Then there’s the other side of the balance. My wife has lifelong birth defects in her legs and feet, because her mother’s obstetrician prescribed a drug that was contraindicated for pregnant women because it causes abnormalities in fetal limb development. My only child died at birth because my wife’s obstetrician did exactly the same thing, this time with a drug that was well known to cause fatal lung abnormalities. Several years later we found out by way of a media exposé that the latter doctor had done the same thing to quite a few other women, leaving a string of dead babies in his wake. The response of the medical board, once the media exposure forced them to do something, was quite standard; they administered a mild reprimand. If this reminds you of the Vatican’s handling of pedophile priests, well, let’s just say the comparison has occurred to me as well.
<br> <br>Deaths directly caused by American health care are appallingly common. A <a href=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/284/4/483>widely cited 2000 study</a> by public health specialist Dr. Barbara Starwood presented evidence that bad medical care kills more Americans every year than anything but heart disease and cancer, with adverse drug effects and nosocomial (hospital- and clinic-spread) infections the most common culprits. <a href=http://www.whale.to/a/null9.html#ABSTRACT>A more comprehensive study</a> prepared outside the medical mainstream, but based entirely on data from peer-reviewed medical journals, argued that the actual rate was much higher—higher, in fact, than any other single cause. That’s part of what makes the controversies over American health care so challenging; mainstream medical care saves a lot of lives in America, but because of the pressures of the profit motive, and the extent to which institutional barriers protect incompetent practitioners and dangerous and ineffective remedies, it also costs a lot of lives as well.
<br> <br>Even so, if I could find a competent, affordable general practitioner to give me annual checkups and help me deal with the ordinary health issues middle-aged men tend to encounter, I’d be happy to do so. The catch here is that little word "affordable." Along with those birth defects, my wife has celiac disease, a couple of food allergies, and a family history with some chronic health problems in it; for that matter, my family history is by no means squeaky clean; we’re both self-employed, and so health insurance would cost us substantially more than our mortgage. That’s money we simply don’t have. Like a large and growing fraction of Americans, therefore, we’ve turned to alternative medicine for our health care.
<br> <br>The more dogmatic end of the mainstream medical industry tends to dismiss all alternative healing methods as ineffective by definition. That’s self-serving nonsense; the core alternative healing modalities, after all, are precisely the methods of health care that were known and practiced in the late 19th century, before today’s chemical and surgical medicine came on the scene, and they embody decades or centuries of careful study of health and illness. There are things that alternative health methods can’t treat as effectively as the current mainstream, of course, but the reverse is also true.
<br> <br>Still, behind the rhetoric of the medical industry lies a fact worth noting: alternative medical methods are almost all much less intensive than today’s chemical and surgical medicine. The best way to grasp the difference is to compare it to other differences between life in the late 19th century and life today—say, the difference between walking and driving a car. Like alternative medicine, walking is much slower, it requires more personal effort, and there are destinations that, realistically speaking, are out of its reach; on the other hand, it has fewer negative side effects, costs a lot less, and dramatically cuts your risk of ending up buttered across the grill of a semi because somebody else made a mistake.
<br> <br>Those differences mean that you can’t use alternative medicine the way you use the mainstream kind. If I neglect a winter cold, for example, I tend to end up with bacterial bronchitis. A physician nowadays can treat that with a simple prescription of antibiotics, and unless the bacterium happens to be resistant—an issue I’ll be discussing in more detail in a bit—that’s all there is to it. If you’re using herbs, on the other hand, handling bacterial bronchitis is a more complex matter. There are very effective herbal treatments, and if you know them, you know exactly what you’re getting and what the effects will be. On the other hand, you can’t simply pop a pill and go on with your day; you have to combine the herbal infusions with rest and steam inhalation, and pay attention to your symptoms so you can treat for fever or other complications if they arise. You very quickly learn, also, that if you don’t want the bronchitis at all, you can’t simply ignore the first signs of an oncoming cold; you have to notice it and treat it.
<br> <br>Here’s another example. I practice t’ai chi, and one of the reasons is that it’s been documented <a href=http://www.instituteofintegralqigongandtaichi.org/qigong_tai_chi_research/ >via controlled studies</a> to be effective preventive medicine for many of the chronic health problems Americans tend to get as they get old. You can treat those same problems with drugs, to be sure, if you’re willing to risk the side effects, but again, you can’t just pop a t’ai chi pill and plop yourself back down on the sofa. You’ve got to put in at least fifteen minutes of practice a day, every day, to get any serious health benefits out of it. (I do more like forty-five minutes a day, but then I’m not just practicing it for health.) It takes time and effort, and if you’ve spent a lifetime damaging your health and turn to t’ai chi when you’re already seriously ill, it’s unlikely to do the trick.
<br> <br>All these points are relevant to the core project of this blog, in turn, because there’s another difference between alternative health care and the medical mainstream. All the core alternative modalities were all developed before the age of cheap abundant fossil fuel energy, and require very little in the way of energy and raw material inputs. Conventional chemical and surgical medicine is another thing entirely. It’s wholly a creation of the age of petroleum; without modern transport and communications networks, gargantuan supply chains for everything from bandages through exotic pharmaceuticals to spare parts for lab equipment, a robust electrical supply, and many other products derived from or powered by cheap fossil fuels, the modern American medical system would grind to a halt.
<br> <br>In the age of peak oil, that level of dependency is not a survival trait, and it’s made worse by two other trends. The first, mentioned earlier in this post, is the accelerating spread of antibiotic resistance in microbes. The penicillin that saved my life in 1969 almost certainly wouldn’t cure a case of scarlet fever today; decades of antibiotic overuse created a textbook case of evolution in action, putting ferocious selection pressure on microbes in the direction of resistance. The resulting chemical arms race is one that the microbes are winning, as efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to find new antibiotics faster than microbes can adapt to them fall further and further behind. Epidemiologists are seriously discussing the possibility that within a few decades, mortality rates from bacterial diseases may return to19th-century levels, when they were the leading cause of death.
<br> <br>The second trend is economic. The United States has built an extraordinarily costly and elaborate health care system, far and away the most expensive in the world, on the twin pillars of government subsidies and employer-paid health benefits. As we lurch further into what Paul Kennedy called "imperial overstretch"—the terminal phase of hegemony, when the costs of empire outweigh the benefits but the hegemonic power can’t or won’t draw back from its foreign entanglements—the government subsidies are going away, while health benefits on the job are being gutted by rising unemployment rates and the frantic efforts of the nation’s rentier class to maintain its standards of living at the expense of the middle classes and the poor.
<br> <br>Requiring people who can’t afford health insurance at today’s exorbitant rates to pay for it anyway under penalty of law—the centerpiece of Obama’s health care "reform"—was a desperation move in this latter struggle, and one that risks a prodigious political backlash. If Obama’s legislation takes effect as written in 2014, and millions of struggling American families find themselves facing a Hobson’s choice between paying a couple of thousand a month or more for health insurance they can’t afford, or paying heavy fines they can’t afford either, it’s probably a safe bet that the US will elect a Tea Party president in 2016 and repeal that—along with much else. Whether that happens or not, it’s clear at this point that the United States can no longer afford the extraordinarily costly health care system it’s got, and the question at this point is simply what will replace it.
<br> <br>In the best of all possible worlds, the existing medical system would come to terms with the bleak limits closing in around it, and begin building a framework that could provide basic health care at a reasonable price to the poor and working classes. It actually wouldn’t be that difficult, but it would require the medical industry to remove at least some of the barriers that restrict medical practice to a small number of very highly paid professionals, and to accept significant declines in quarterly profits, doctors’ salaries, and the like. Maybe that could happen, but so far there doesn’t seem to be any sign of a movement in that direction. Instead, health care costs continue to rise as the economy stalls, moving us deeper into a situation where elaborate and expensive health care is available to a steadily narrowing circle of the well-to-do, while everyone outside the circle has to make do with what they can afford—which, more and more often, amounts to the 19th-century medicine provided by alternative health care.
<br> <br>Thus I’m not especially worried about the survival of alternative healing. Despite the fulminations of authority figures and the occasional FDA witch hunt, the alternative healing scene is alive and well, and its reliance on medicines and techniques that were viable before the age of cheap abundant fossil fuels means that it will be well equipped to deal with conditions after cheap energy of any kind is a thing of the past. No, what concerns me is the legacy of today’s mainstream medicine—the medicine that saved my life at age seven, and continues, despite its difficulties and dysfunctions, to heal cases that the best doctors in the world a century and a quarter ago had to give up as hopeless.
<br> <br>Even if a movement of the sort I’ve suggested above were to take place, a great deal of that would be lost or, at best, filed away for better times. The most advanced medical procedures at present require inputs that a deindustrial society simply isn’t going to be able to provide. Still, there’s quite a bit that could be saved, if those who have access to the techniques in question were to grasp the necessity of saving them. As it stands, the only people who can salvage those things are the physicians who are legally authorized to use them; the rest of us can at best get a working grasp of sanitation and sterile procedure, the sort of wilderness-centered first aid training that assumes that a paramedic won’t be there in ten minutes, and the sort of home nursing skills that the Red Cross used to teach in the 1950s and 1960s—you can still find the Red Cross Home Nursing Manual in the used book market, and it’s well worth getting a copy and studying it.
<br> <br>Other than that, it’s up to the physicians and the various institutions they staff and advise. If they step up to the plate, the deindustrial future will have the raw materials from which to evolve ways of healing that combine the best of mainstream and alternative methods. If they don’t, well, maybe enough written material will survive to enable the healers of the future to laboriously rediscover and reinvent some of today’s medical knowledge a few centuries down the road. While the decision is being made, those of us who don’t have a voice in it have our own decisions to make: if we have the money and are willing to accept one set of risks, to make use of today’s chemical and surgical medicine while it’s still around; if we have the interest and are willing to accept another set of risks, to make use of one or more methods of alternative medicine; or if neither option seems workable or desirable, to come to terms with a reality that all of us are eventually going to have to accept anyway, which is that life and health are fragile transitory things, and that despite drugs and surgeries on the one hand, or herbs and healing practices on the other, the guy with the scythe is going to settle the matter sooner or later with the one answer every human being gets at last.

The disorder has died down already, and it will be many years, if not decades, in my opinion, before that sort of disorder is the daily order of things in countries like the US and Britain. I enjoy Kunstler as much as anyone, but your usually reasoned arguments and pleasing reluctance to predict a timetable contast nicely with his "next month it all falls apart... ok, next month" themes. I guess that why I found the first paragraphs of your post this week a bit jarring.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c204792557195667444 title="comment permalink">8/10/11, 8:09 PM</a><br><br>

He was my Vet in the 90's when I lived in Cincinnati and had border collies. He was the best Vet I have ever encountered. At the time he was something like 85 years old and worked crazy office hours with NO appointments. The hours were something like this: Tues 10-11:30 and 5-7 pm. Everyday was different - Thursday could have been: 7am - 10 then 1 - 3:30 pm. His office was a desk that was piled super high with pharma samples and other vet correspondence. If your dog got sick he would usually end up looking for some medicine or another that he had read about and give you the sample for free so you wouldn't have to buy it. He couldn't believe that people would spend thousands of dollars on their dogs and felt that we had gone crazy. While you could tell he loved animals, he had been around them before penicillin, etc. and still had that kind of an attitude. I'm not trying to be callous here or portray him that way. He loved animals, as I said. And he knew how to keep them healthy and how to get them healthy when they had issues. But, at the same time, he is the only doctor I have encountered that DIRECTLY would talk about how much things cost and would give his personal recommendation about if he thought it was worth the money or not. That is what you are getting at in your final line. We are all going to die someday. The question is how? and How much will it cost?<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c2933851385151931994 title="comment permalink">8/10/11, 8:29 PM</a><br><br>

Our system is far from perfect - we have serious gaps in home care, elder care, native health, and so on - but I am overwhelmingly grateful that my tax dollars are spent ensuring that everyone has access to at least basic care. The thought of having to assess whether or not my symptoms are “worth” spending $50 to see the doctor is frightening and I hope I never see the day when that is a question people here need to ask themselves before getting help. I realize it’s a question routinely asked south of the border, and I have nothing to say about that that except that I am sorry it is so.<br>I am not sure if it is universal here in Canada, but I suspect it is nearly so:. most of the physicians I have dealt with were quite comfortable with patients pursuing 'alternative' methods of health management in conjunction with the ‘official’ services they offered. My old GP recommended I try reiki when I was diagnosed with a mild form of arthritis; my current doctor is quite pleased that I go for acupuncture treatments; and I have never had a health care professional scoff at my use of ‘alternative’ treatments. For most of us, I think, it is not an either/or question … we are able to use the ‘big guns’ for the things they are well suited for, and seek alternative therapy where it is appropriate (although alternative therapy is usually not funded as generously, I admit). I think it is important that people don't have to wait until it's a crisis before they are seen. We have hotlines we can call 24 hours a day for advice on what to do on our own and when we need to go in, and I am immensely grateful for it. I’m sure it saves on a lot of unnecessary ER visits, and it gives a lot of people information about self-care that they may not otherwise have had ready access to.<br>I do realize, of course, that in a low energy future, this infrastructure will not be in place, certainly not like it is now. I hope that the Canadian cultural belief in the universal right to basic health care will continue, even after the world looks much different, and that communities will band together to pay the doctor/nurse/acupuncturist/herbalist's salary so that everyone - regardless of ability to pay - will be cared for. I cannot say for sure that this will happen, but I suspect that most of us Canadians would feel that it’s how “things ought to be”. I realize not everybody feels the same way, especially in other parts of the world … but it is part of our Canadian cultural identity, I think. <br>As for taking care of oneself in the absence of a ‘structured system’ (either because you can’t afford it or because it is not there), I wholeheartedly agree that everyone needs to learn the basics of germ theory, wound care, herbal and other remedies for common ailments, and the signs and symptoms of problems that warrant professional intervention (while it exists). And, knowing that the “guy with the scythe” comes for us all in the end is essential. People die. What is awful is when people die in unnecessary pain, when we refuse to see that there are things worse than dying, when we insist that pretending we are immortal if only we try hard enough/use the right drugs/see the right specialist/whatever. I requested the DNR order for my own infant daughter who would have suffered terribly if anyone had tried to interfere with Nature’s path for her - I know there are things worse than dying, and I did not want them for her. I also know that losing a child is heartbreaking, and I offer my sympathy, JMG, even now, these many years later, on the loss of your child. How sad that it was due to the interference of ‘medicine’.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c9157673163265393909 title="comment permalink">8/10/11, 9:01 PM</a><br><br>

It's one of the most derided of alternative medicines in the mainstream world, even by many who don;t have a problem with herbalism and acupuncture, mainly because of disbelief that the method of potentizing remedies by dilution could actually accomplish anything. However, just because we don't know the exact mechanism of something doesn't mean it doesn't work.<br><br>It is also commonly said that homeopathy has been proven ineffective, however looking at the evidence that is not what I interpret. I have read a few of the studies that these people use to "debunk" homeopathy, and the ones I've seen don't follow good homeopathic practices, generally giving a single remedy to a group of people with the same allopathic diagnosis, and then saying it's no better than a placebo. In actuality, homeopathic diagnosis is not based on the same criteria, and to try to prove whether a method effective you should at least follow it the correct way. Some scientific studies have in fact shown effectiveness of homeopathic remedies, some are listed at http://johnbenneth.wordpress.com/about/<br><br>However what really convinced me was my own personal experience, and I can feel the remedy's effect in my body, sometimes quite dramatically as in going from chilly to hot in minutes with no change in activity or outside temperature, and other distinct changes. Most people won't feel them so intensely because I'm exceptionally hypersensitive. Each different remedy has a different effect, and some help and some actually make things worse.<br><br>Like doctors any other skilled profession, some homeopaths do a much better job than others, and there are many different methods within homeopathy.<br><br>A couple of other things I want to mention about medicine in general. A society in which allopathic medicine predominates seems destined to fail, even if there's a lot of success for a while. The reason being that if no attention is paid to the vitality of people and all the emphasis is placed on removing disease (such as our mainstream system), basically allowing people to survive in weaker and weaker states, the end result would bring people to something like blobs of blubber plugged into machines that they couldn't live without. That, of course, could only happen with cheap energy, but put that trajectory up against the decline of the industrial age and you have even more of a disaster since so many people have become dependent on the system for their survival.<br><br>I'm not saying that allopathic intervention is never appropriate, it is in emergencies, but some sort of healing method(s) that works to support the person rather than just fight the disease seems pretty important to me. Of course the way nature uses to keep populations from weakening a Darwinian environment that kills everyone who's not fit. I'm sure we will be seeing that again, and that's all the more reason to focus efforts on a holistic approach to health that may keep you fit enough to make the difference in your survival.<br><br>In my mind, having a diversity of healing systems makes sense. Although I clearly have my biases, I don't try to force everyone else into one system. Just as biodiversity increases resilience in ecosystems, so does a diversity of healing systems in human society. The fervor of some to condemn all other healing systems in favor of their preferred one (usually mainstream medicine but sometimes a particular alternative system too) strikes me as very similar to the attitude of a religious fundamentalist trying to "save" people, which isn't surprising since the modern medical system has taken on religious qualities in many people's minds.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c7155960731957102842 title="comment permalink">8/10/11, 9:12 PM</a><br><br>

Thirty years ago, I was trained in podiatric medicine, did foot surgery for a while, invented a pediatric orthopedic bracing system, taught myself how to manufacture it, and then eventually shut the whole operation down when I realized that I wouldn’t be able to comply with updated FDA regulations, which are heavily influenced by the major medical manufacturers to prevent competition. (When there are companies that are “too big to fail” there will inevitably be companies that are “too small to succeed”.) If I were still in medicine, I would probably be dead from the stress; fortunately, I’ve been out of the industry for two decades, and now I re-roof and re-side and rewire our dilapidated $30,000 inner-city houses. We have little money, but I’m a happy boy.<br><br>This week’s article got me to thinking about some of the things I learned during my time in medicine. <br><br>One of the most important lessons is: “All medicines have side effects; and the more powerful the medicine, the more powerful the side effects.”<br> <br>I learned to pay no attention to attempts to differentiate between “artificial drug” or “natural substance”, or “legal” vs. “illegal”, or “medication” vs. “food”. To me, everything fell into one big category: “substances” that people put into their bodies. “Substances” that they swallow, inhale, inject, smear on their skin, or cram into other bodily orifices which will not be mentioned on a family-rated site like this.<br> <br>The only relevant question was whether the substance was helping them, hurting them, or having no discernable effect at all on them.<br> <br>I learned to be very, very careful about putting any substance into the human body: you need to know exactly what the substance is intended to do (its desired pharmacological effects), the dosage, any impurities that the preparation may contain, what the side effects might be; and know how to manage any side effects that may arise.<br> <br>The more substances that you have floating around in you, and the more powerful those substances are, then the more likely you will end up like kids who are left alone in a chemistry lab who start randomly throwing things into a flask and then heating it over a Bunsen burner to see what happens. The potential for catastrophic interactions goes up exponentially.<br> <br>My general rule was: try a physical modality first; then a medication; and if all else fails, then try surgery. That doesn’t always hold true (elevated WBC and lower right-quadrant tenderness and you’re immediately going to surgery to have your appendix removed); but in general, always try a conservative modality first – since most conditions will resolve themselves without treatment anyway.<br><br>“First, do no harm.”<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c9062689850087167629 title="comment permalink">8/10/11, 9:14 PM</a><br><br>

Many treatments that apply to livestock and pets translate well to humans, and many don't. While it's important to know the difference, much can be learned from vetting one's own animals. I've learned to give injections, diagnose certain conditions, sucher wounds (recently learned how to glue wounds), and that some medications, such as antibiotics, available only with a prescription for humans, are essentially the same as those available at the feed store for swine, as are the doses. While I'm not going to the feed store for my meds any time soon, these are good things to know, and the medical kit that I maintain for my animals is essentially the same as our own medical kit. While I haven't had much practice on humans, I'm sure I could handle setting a simple bone fracture, sucher or glue a wound, and give an injection properly, as these are all things I've done in the past, albeit on animals. I'm not suggesting that folks start to experiment on their dogs, just some thoughts. <br><br>This discussion can be divided into several categories such as maintaining health, restoring health, first aid, etc. In our current system, all of these have become specialties to a fault.

Makes sense to me, but then a lot of people tend to think I'm weird! <br><br>I've got a story to tell you JMG about a blond g,grandfather and a Cherokee healer/doctor. You can decide for yourself if hubris caused the loss of an invaluable cure for skin cancer.<br><br>The doctor was the kind you're talking about in your post, he served an apprenticeship with a horse and buggy doctor riding with him when he went out on calls. But at the same time he was also studying with a traditional Cherokee healer. <br><br>My g'grandfather was a fair skinned man, blond, blue eyed and very prone to skin cancer. He went to the doctor when he had a growth on his neck and the Doctor looked at it and commented he knew what that was. He told the g'grandfather to come back in three days, he would have everything ready to treat the cancer.<br><br>When the g'grandfather returned the Cherokee put a poultice on his neck and shoulder and taped the edges down. Then he told g'grandfather to leave it on for five days and come back. He emphasized he NOT disturb the poultice in any way.<br><br>G'grandfather waited the week and returned, the doctor lifted a corner of the poultice and shook his head saying it wasn't ready yet and to come back in three more days.<br><br>G'grandfather was a farmer and the day before he was to return to the doctor he was out plowing his fields behind his team. He felt like something was crawling on his neck and reflexively<br>he reached up to brush it off. When he did his rough farmer's hand caught the cloth of the poultice and pulled the whole poultice off. He said it hurt, a lot but when he looked at the poultice in his hand the entire cancer had come out, sticking to the poultice. He said it looked like a tree root. <br><br>When my mother was a teenager she saw the large deeply indented scar on my g'grand father's neck and shoulder. She had a chance to ask the Cherokee Dr. did he ever tell the white doctors what was in the poultice. He said "I did. They laughed at me, they can go to H***!"<br><br>BTW, I have 'conjectured' what might have been in that poultice, medicinal clay, crushed horseradish, crushed garlic and/or possibly powdered silver sage.

Regarding the herbal medicine, one should be careful where to purchase or pick the medicinal herbs; extensively grown herbs tend to have much less active substances (not to mention the "energy" that every creature posseses!) than the ones that grow in wilderness. Also it is becoming increasingly difficult to find herbs even in the wild which do not contain poisonous byproducts of our civilisation, which can turn normally useful plant even into poisonous!

Food as medicine is an ancient concept, and to me, it seems the absolute best place to start. Even the most casual inspection of Americans in groups (try comparing photos of the crowd at a Fourth of July parade from today with one from the 1950s or 1960s; I won't even talk about the People of Walmart website) shows that we have serious problems with food in this country. You would expect our culture of convenience to produce out-of-shape adults, but the number of obese **children** in the U.S. is truly shocking.<br><br>I use a number of supplements (vitamins, fish oil, etc.) to combat various ailments or as preventive measures. I use a lot of sources now, but the book that started me on the nutrition path was Let's Get Well, by Adelle Davis, copyright 1965. Concentrated supplements will become rarer as we descend, but we can work to make our food more nutritious as we abandon harmful industrial agricultural practices and begin to build up the soil again.<br><br>Being a bit on the hypochondriac side, I've had quite a few medical books over the years. But one I keep coming back to, in spite of its hippie-dippyness by today's standards, is The Well Body Book by Mike Samuels, M.D. and Hal Bennett. "The authors describe how to do a complete physical exam, how to diagnose common diseases, how to practice preventive medicine and how to get the most from your doctor." It follows a basic commonsense approach to taking care of yourself that I find very reassuring. JMG, you won't be surprised to discover that this book was published in 1973.<br><br>I've had a lot of success in removing muscular pain using a book called Pain Erasure by Bonnie Prudden, copyright 1980. By pressing on a painful muscle at various points, you make it relax. It's a great "physical modality" you can do yourself that obviates the need for a lot of painkillers. It really relieves pain.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c5498059256261483167 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 12:47 AM</a><br><br>

Fortunately, I'm also British. This means that for now, I get free medical treatment, including the insulin which keeps me alive. Most other places in the industrial world, I'd be paying heavily, and outside that area, I'd have been a goner ten years ago.

Though that course cost the taxpayer £500, it's a bargain compared to the costs of an avoidable hospital admission. Preventative treatment is always best. <br><br>As we currently have mostly free medical treatment at the point of use, that does free us Brits from one casue of indentured servitude, in needing to work for a Dickensian employer simply to maintain medical coverage. Though many must work to pay the taxes to keep the National Health Service running. Where your taxes maintain a huge military and limited medicare, ours fund the impressive NHS and an emasculated military. Though where there's money (for now) it seems the multi-national corporates are not far behind. As they own our politicians, they are looking to exploit profit opportunities within the NHS. <br><br>I've built up a stockpile of meds - a precaution against most sudden discontinuities, but not long term decline.

You could play different variants, including evolution-tinkering. One of the variants focused on human civilization. You had a limited amount of "energy" that you could allocate to different areas, such as health technology, energy (conventional, nuclear, etc.), manufacturing, technology, war, communication, environment, philosophy, agriculture/food, etc. The goal was continually balancing and allocating resources to see how long you could get civilization to survive. <br><br>The thing was, no matter what you did, or how careful you were, almost any route you went eventually led either to nuclear war, or overpopulation which led to starvation and disease (and sometimes war). Whether it took decades or a couple of hundred years, the result was a devastated planet and crumbled civilization. <br><br>Then one day, I did a radical rethinking and allocated most of the energy to "philosophy" (which in this game represented acceptance of death, enjoyment of life, ethical behavior), and very little or nothing to any of the others, including health technology. After all, improvements in health tech meant more people survived, so more food was needed, which eventually meant more energy was taken from other areas, which resulted in environmental destruction and war over remnant resources. <br><br>Low health tech meant a natural balance of steady depopulation to a sustainable level of low population. That meant less competition over limited resources. High "philosophy" meant people accepted life for what it was and treated each other ethically, both within a civilization as well as neighboring states. The result?

I used to have a good fulltime job with health insurance 5 years ago. But it was a high stress job.

I moved and for the first couple of years on my savings I was able to afford to go to a doctor for bronchitis, pneumonia, get my blood pressure meds etc. I applied for jobs, but either I was "overqualified"/overeducated or didn't have the connections ...or, I suspect, too old to compete for the few jobs available.<br><br>I weaned myself slowly off the betablockers I could no longer afford ($50 a month), used natural stress relief and walking to drop some pounds, and got more into Marcus Aurelius, tribal religion, art and nature to deal, as well as part time teaching to pay rent and food (which is pretty much all I could afford, and even that was hard). <br><br>Since then I have survived several bouts of pneumonia and bronchitis, the shingles, liver problems, fevers, kidney stone passage, etc. entirely through self-care (hot baths, herbs, sleep, avoiding or eating certain foods, etc.).

So why didn't they see anything wrong when she was in the hospital a year ago? Biomedicine has overspecialized from what I see, everyone a specialist who only knows how to look for, and ONLY looks for, their own specialty. The focus is on billing for various procedures. My brother is a pharmacist and he took time to be my mom's primary advocate while she was dying, and he stopped them several times for improper drug interactions, etc.<br><br>She had a good job with insurance.

A good chunk of US job growth from 2000 – 2008 came from the health sector, and the system’s business model is completely dependent on economic growth and government spending of various sorts. Also, it is of course focused on treating diseases that are caused directly or indirectly by our society’s various dysfunctions (dietary-driven diseases, problems of emotional stress, some cancers, etc), which have been a growth business for a few decades now. So as the economy and society continue to shift and contract, and the money flows dry up, I would expect the medical system to come unglued and crash at some point, rather than to evolve. <br><br>Alternative care providers seem to be better positioned to evolve. They are generally less interested in and dependent on making a lot of money and haven’t yet figured out how to combine themselves into great networks of providers with complicated payment models and supply chains. So I think they are going to be better positioned for the long-term. It’s possible that local general practitioners could evolve to combine some mainstream and alternative therapies into a viable local health practice, which would be a good thing. There’s tremendous opportunity, for example, to include therapies such as meditation, yoga, tai chi, etc in preventive care. My current GP doesn’t have a lot of interest in those things, but she might when the pharma-stress pills just aren’t there to pop. But overall, I see the alternative sector picking up the pieces while the mainstream clinicians, administrators, researchers, technologists and suppliers wonder what hit them.

Blogs have been something I chose to avoid, for reasons that only start with the ugly word itself. However, yours is a breath of fresh air. The consistently high level of writing is as unexpected as it is appreciated. But the content, of course, is the thing that matters most. I liken your thought to that of John Taylor Gatto, who writes so uncompromisingly about our education system, its origin, and its miserable failures. The primary thing that you and Gatto have in common is what I would call simple sanity in the face of immense problems and looming, inevitable collapse. I have often wondered why I never hear Gatto's name or his thought referred to in the mass media. And now I wonder the same about you. I watch a fair amount of TV, and I watch it every day, and I rationalize this ultimately time-wasting practice by taking note of what is offered to me through that medium and, more to the point, what is not offered. I have heard that Gatto has been described as a Libertarian, which may account for the lack of references to him and what he has to say about our society. (The powers that be prefer to squelch dissenting voices and viewpoints, especially when they are sane and well documented, for any convenient reason, and being a Libertarian is the same as being a member of the lunatic fringe for them. So, Gatto doesn't exist for most of our fellow citizens.) My theory is that the same thing may be true about you, given that you are not just a Druid, but an Arch one. Ergo, his thoughts don't count. My point is that I would love to see open and thorough debate of the issues that people like you and Gatto raise so urgently and convincingly. But such widespread knowledge extending to the lulled masses who seem to care about nothing much as long as they have the latest technological gadgets and still have fuel to operate their vehicles. So, I offer my thanks to you for your continuing efforts, even though it makes me think of myself as a member of some sort of reverse "elite".<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c9062603763266470283 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 5:54 AM</a><br><br>

Systems such as t'ai chi or yoga are not treatments, nor are they just the exercise regimens they often get treated like in the U.S. They are practices that involve a synthesis of the physical, mental, and metaphysical. I wonder if anyone has ever compared the health benefits of yoga or t'ai chi when taught just as a physical activity versus when taught along with the meditative-contemplative-energy parts? For people who are already comfortable with meditation and ideas similar to chi or prana, it is easy to take up. But for those of a more strictly materialist view, all that stuff is often viewed as woohoo hoohah lalala nonsense ("What do they mean send your breath down in to your pelvis?? That is just ridiculous!") and be a barrier. Anyway, back to my point, these practices are more akin to beneficial lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking and adopting a better diet, than to medical treatments. And unfortunately, people prove EXTREMELY resistant to lifestyle changes no matter how many times their doctor or spouse or whoever pushes it, usually until a medical crisis forces the issue (if it does not kill or debilitate them first). <br><br>As for the English Summer... I suspect we may have just seen a preview of the potential for the future, not the beginning of anything big and sustained yet. Let's see what happens when the "austerity" cuts really begin to hit, and how many of those presently tut-tutting about "mindless criminality" wind up shouting in the streets themselves. <br><br>Ozark -- I am in no position to judge whether or not homeopathy works. But I feel reasonably comfortable saying that if indeed it does work, it almost surely works by magic more than by biochemistry. And if it does work by magic, there might be other routes to the same ends that do not require concoctions or the spending of any money. But on the other hand, if you can afford it, and you like it, and it works for you, no need to fix what is not broken.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c1792227567429356754 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 6:30 AM</a><br><br>

After the current reforms have obviously failed and <i>real</i> financial turmoil sets in, the street battles will involve more political causes than appeared this time -- then, yes, anything is certainly possible. Meanwhile, indeed, the government makes noises rather like those of the Gadaffi regime but hardly seems to notice the irony!<br><br>On medicine I think it's important to point out that maintaining wellness with alt med methods is as important and effective as dealing with illness. By contrast with its unwieldy 'power' when it comes to fixing things when they are obvious problems, mainstream medicine is absolutely terrible at fixing them before that point. A deeper practitioner of these things (such as you are, JMG, I'm sure), will be on the watch all the time for subtle signs that can be checked with extra work on a few acupoints, etc. etc. Stitches in time.<br><br>Learning to sense the inner is part of the deeper application of those methods. That's not something materialist medicine has even admitted is possible most of the time. The spiritual element of alt healing has a strong evidential base -- see the multitude of papers summarised in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spiritual-Healing-Professional-Supplement-Research/dp/1886785120/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313070003&amp;sr=1-1" rel=nofollow>here</a>, for example, which show that there have been more controlled trials for spiritual healing than almost any other alt med modality. Placebo is completely ruled out, and two thirds of the studies whose design holds water show statistically significant results.<br><br>Under these conditions a Norton-style medical/priestly class certainly is a doable thing, and one of my projects may be to put together a network of practitioners -- on a multi-disciplinary basis, but centred around a code perhaps. In the UK of today there may be a lot of takers for this.<br><br>A small point which I think is unquestionably true: misuse of fossil fuels to pump raw wattage around has caused a lot of illness in nervous systems by interfering with bioelectrical systems such as t'ai chi and ch'i kung work with. (See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Body-Electric-Electromagnetism-Foundation-Life/dp/0688069711/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313070710&amp;sr=1-2" rel=nofollow>Becker</a> for proof.)

Not long ago they were the treatment of choice (applied topically ONLY!!!) for HPV warts. <br><br>Just to make sure that a widespread confusion isn't coming up here -- homeopathy is a very specific field that involves herbal extracts that have been EXTREMELY diluted and hence are taken in miniscule quantities. The term is often used casually as though it were synonymous with all herbal treatments, which is most definitely is not.<br><br>Two things I would nominate from the mainstream as worth saving are vaccines and antibiotics. I know some people have very strong feelings about vaccines; it' your choice but I would still like to have access to them. Polio, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, etc. are still out there, and smallpox can be reintroduced with the opening of one small vial. Don't approve of them? Don't get them. I want them around to the extent possible. <br><br>As for antibiotics... one thing about evolution. These bugs all have to spend energy to maintain their antibiotic resistance. In the absence of continuing selective pressure, the antibiotic resistance fades away gradually over the generations -- and a generation in bacteria is often measured in hours, not years. If they were just used appropriately, cautiously, and correctly, they would regain and maintain their usefulness. Every doctor who has given someone an antibiotic prescription for a cold in the absence of any signs of bacterial infection should have his or her license stripped. Which would be nearly every doctor in Tennessee.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c6260194083922003256 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 7:12 AM</a><br><br>

I feel very sure that any medical system, exposed to equivalent political and financial power, would find it's way into becoming a similar industrialized and bureaucratized mess.<br><br>The core of western medicine is not the funding, or the industry, or it's position as the dominant paradigm. The core is an understanding that illness is caused by perturbations in the body's homeostasis caused by various processes - nutritional, infectious, traumatic, psychological and so on - and a drive to further this understanding through observation and measurement. This is in no way incompatible with what are considered alternative treatments - acupuncture, St John's wort, psychotherapy, radiotherapy and even surgery were all considered "alternative" in their day.<br><br>I would encourage those intent on salvaging health through alternative means to first read your essay on salvaging science; it is exactly the sorts of small-scale measurements and experiments that you describe that can be extraordinarily useful in moving alternative medicine forward. There has been a persistent resistance to adopting scientific method in the alternative medicine communities, with most published information coming from interested western-trained medical students or physicians. There are well-established means for looking for even small differences in outcomes over many years; the only barriers are the willingness to put the time, training and resources into doing the necessary studies. This move has to come from alternative practitioners themselves, or they will remain stuck where Western medicine was in the mid-1800s.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c2862965025789223583 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 7:24 AM</a><br><br>

The system has cut itself a deep channel that gets deeper with the passage of time: diverting the flow is increasingly unlikely.<br><br>And the diminishing returns from increasing complexity are beginning to show, both in the resources used in technology and in increasing compartmentalization with specialization. Advances in care and therapy are based on controlled studies. These studies may show an advantage of a few percentage points for a new drug (that cost millions of dollars to develop), it then becomes the preferred drug.<br><br>A patient with a strained chest muscle (left pectoralis minor) underwent a radionuclide cardiac scan and then a cardiac catheterization both negative, for chest pain: I got to see him in the emergency department because of his concern when the pain had been present for two without an explanation.<br><br>In emergency departments, a patient with right lower quadrant abdominal pain and the appropriate associated additional findings will get a CT scan to check for appendicits: the scan may be read by a radiologist in another town, state or country. Whether the emergency physician calls the surgeon or not depends to a large extent on the radiologist's reading.<br><br>Trying to change course of the system is like taking a train off the rails. There is no room for the concept of transitioning to a low-tech mode.<br><br>Although the mortar and pestle is a widely recognized symbol of pharmacy, most pharmacists these days have not used it. They have an extensive and detailed knowledge of pharmacology, which includes intessive study of chemistry and physiology. But they would be at a loss to go out into the woods and collect plants and process them to extract useful preparations: even the counting of pills is done by machines.<br><br>Yet today's high-tech medicine retains items that were gleaned from the wisdom of yore. <br><br>William Withering's observation of the treatment of dropsy by rural womenfolk with purple foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) tea led to the extract of the plant, digitalis, and the active ingredient digoxin that is still used today. The bark of the white willow, Salix alba, used in a tea to treat fevers, led to acetylsalicylic acid, sold under the proprietary name Aspirin by Bayer until Bayer lost the trademark during the second world war.<br><br>The arrow poison from Strychnos toxifera used by South American natives led to curare and a host of related compounds used as muscle relaxers in today's medicine. They can also be credited wih the medicinal use of the bark of Cinchona, of which the active ingredient quinine is used treatment of malaria.<br><br>Chinese medicine had been using the herb Artemisia annua for two thousand years in the treatment of malaria, from which we have artemisinin now used in the treatment of drug-resistant malaria.<br><br>A lot more useful information may have been lost with the vanishing of indigenous cultures.

I am truly sorry for your loss. after my first son, I had a second son who was born via cesarean, and more than likely saved by that surgery. This past Monday he was diagnosed with scarlet fever. He is four and became sick on the thursday prior. He has always been a strong healthy child, who has been in daycare since he was 4 months old, and has only taken an antibiotic once prior. It was scary to get the diagnoses based on the histoey of this illness and the recent deaths in China. I am very grateful to say he had a very minor case, and was back in school by wednesday and will be on antibiotics for the next 10 days. I have been very diligent in his life to nuture and strengthen his immune system...I left him play in the dirt, only use vinegar, tea tree oil and baking soda to clean, and give him doses of homemade elderberry syrup every flu season to help prevent illness. What shocked me about the scarlet fever was how quickly it came over him. The night prior he was his normal self and by morning he was in a sad state. I think it is extremely important that we embrace homeopathic and allopathic medine,when vailable. i worry for the future, but I channel that energy in educating myself. I live in S florida... The tropics, and all the issues that come with that in a deindustrial society. I am collecting medicinal seeds and planting them, learning how to use them, and finding alternatives when the traditional herb will not grow in my climate. i am collecting as much information concerning ayurvedic medicine as I can, as their climate is similar. Having said this, I take full advantage of modern medicine when needed, but do not take it for granted or abuse it. I don't understand the vitriol of some of the posts. Why do the two have to be mutually exclusive?? why can they not be complementary? The only logical reason I can see for the reason people fight over this has to do with making money.

One of the big issues that I don’t think you touched on is our gradual assumption that we are owed healthcare. Even though I consider myself pretty liberal, I am dismayed at the growing number of things that people claim as “basic rights” – when did we ever get the right to have others provide for us without some concomitant responsibility to provide for them? Which is what it comes down to. I do strongly believe that healthcare (and other social services) are essential for a functioning society, especially a democracy – so they <b>are</b> a “social good” (but not a right). <br><br>And even more, most people I talk to have lost sight of the fact that 99.9% of us can not afford healthcare in its present form! Last night at a picnic I listened to story after story of surgery, batteries of lab tests (this was a middle-aged and older crowd) and not one of them seemed aware that someone else had paid for all of that! One reason this is important is that as medical techniques improved AND got much more expensive, we didn’t have the discussion about whether these new techniques were affordable; whether the improvement or risk reduction they provided was worth the cost… and now we have to have that discussion on a huge level! And that is causing many people to have a kind of “brain lock” (<i>“It’s unthinkable I couldn’t afford a hip replacement!”… “I need a lung transplant!”</i> or more tragically, <i>“my child needs a lung transplant”</i>). The simple fact is that only the wealthiest 1% can afford healthcare as it’s being offered, and most of us act as if we can do anything to our bodies because someone will patch them up later.<br><br>And as you say, our super-expensive healthcare isn’t even very good. When I worked as a therapist in a psych ward, I remember the head of the hospital had gone off to some third-world country to “show them modern medicine”. The doctors told us that what he’d said when he got back was, “they have a better system of medicine than we do!” This was in the ‘90’s. Of course, no one official would say that for publication.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c213115919805437643 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 8:57 AM</a><br><br>

Just like do-it-yourself health requires individual awareness and discipline, so good health care (alternative or allopathic) really requires a well-trained and aware practitioner. But I have had incredible results with acupuncture, chiropractic, naturopathy, homeopathic and reiki… and as you say, they are less resource-intensive and less expensive than allopathic medicine. I have had family members who have been saved by surgery and antibiotics, and I did recover from a severe bout of pneumonia thanks to antibiotics (but first had to go through a week of hell with one I was unknowingly allergic to!) but it was my acupuncturist who made the housecall and did cupping and needling to help the antibiotics along. (I have also had some family members suffer from bad doctoring, and I'm sorry, JMG, about your loss of your child).<br><br>Now that I’m uninsured, I’m working very hard to prevent illness and accidents, under the assumption that it’s totally my responsibility. (At this point, I’d be hard pressed to afford alternative healthcare, so I’m learning herbs and increasing my awareness of symptoms to catch things before they really start.) Just in case, I’ve downloaded and printed “Where there is No Doctor” and added it to my green wizard binders. (which are getting big). As you say – it’s a different discipline from “run to the fix-it clinic”, but it’s in line with all the other green wizard disciplines (ie: if I want food I have to start in the spring, or winter wood, I start in the summer). It’s part of getting used to a different rhythm of life, and all in all, I like this rhythm much better.<br><br>And I’m really pleased that a few of us green wizards who are within an hour of each other (more or less) have been gathering monthly to talk green wizardry and see each other’s “homesteads”. So, thanks JMG, for bringing us together!!<br><br>@Apple Jack Creek: <i>The thought of having to assess whether or not my symptoms are “worth” spending $50 to see the doctor is frightening</i><br><br>$50?? Try $200! An appointment with my nurse practitioner costs at least $160 for 15 minutes…<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c123005926297390273 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 9:09 AM</a><br><br>

I don't think the phrase "rank profiteering" is out of line in a system that routinely bills $100 for a bandaid. <br><br>Ozark, I've also had good results with homeopathy, and noted the same dishonesties in studies claiming to debunk it. The fact that its causal mechanism isn't understood, and appears to challenge widely accepted principles, ought to be an incentive to research; instead, it's gotten the "this can't happen, therefore it doesn't happen" treatment. <br><br>Sophie, thank you for the links!<br><br>Don, that seems quite reasonable as a rule of thumb.

I haven't read anything by Norton in years; I wonder if her books are still available. (A lot of my favorite children's and young adult books have been discarded by libraries and aren't in print any more.) <br><br>As for the Cherokee remedy, most of the traditional medical systems had very good treatments for a lot of today's chronic illnesses. What they couldn't handle, and what drove the development of today's medicine, was the explosive spread of epidemic diseases in the age of European colonization. Vaccines, antibiotics, and sterile technique all evolved in response to that global health crisis -- but those aren't the only health issues that need attention today, and the traditional systems have options that modern medicine doesn't.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c4153341561253614336 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 9:15 AM</a><br><br>

I've been an Emergency Department RN for over 22 years, which makes me an angel or the devil depending on your perspective. <br><br>This experience has made me realize several things. The first realization is that more "health care" is not necessarily better for a variety of reasons, the lion's share of which you've already covered in your post. I would like to add my own "Law of Unintended Consequences" which is that the potential unintended consequences of a given therapy are proportionate to the proported benefits.<br><br>The second realization is that the profit motive, er ahem, business model that has made health care an industry proves the law of unintended consequences. <br><br>The third realization is that, in an industry dependent on profit and growth, health care depends on ever increasing numbers of ill and injured people. Health executives fret at the thought of fewer people coming through the door; at least fewer people with good insurance.

As for the purity and strength of herbs, where wild herbs are scarce or threatened -- which is all too common over here -- I find it works well to grow them yourself using organic methods. <br><br>Greatblue, I didn't get into that because most Americans are stark staring loony about dietary issues. I figure it's an offshoot of our Puritan heritage; every other person you meet has identified some food or type of food as the dietary equivalent of Satan incarnate, and is convinced that by banishing it into the outer darkness with wailing and gnashing of teeth, he or she will get right with good health.

No more chainsaw work (though I still split firewood against doctor's orders), no more working with the horse (she died the same day I got my diagnosis - no kidding - you can't make this stuff up), nothing more than very light gardening, absolutely no more shoveling snow, no going on ladders, and on and on. It took me a full year's cycle on the farm to realize how completely OVER my way of life was, and I grieved for a while.<br><br>I don't tell you this to make you feel sorry for me - I'm just saying everything can change in an instant, and you ought to think about it. This is why we need community, family and friends. Nobody is an island. To whit...<br><br>I will never forget how, a day after word got out of my situation, a small army showed up with chainsaws and splitting mauls to work up the logs I'd dragged in with my horse just the day before...<br><br>So tend to your neighborhood and your neighbors. Especially in rural situations, it can be a very fine line between helping and butting in, showing concern and being nosy. But be aware if someone needs help - it can be done in a fashion that leaves everyone's dignity intact. I was amazed at the subtle skill of folks around here at just that, and I am giving back as best I can in the ways that I can.<br><br>One final note regarding the hubris or not of "conventional" medicine. After many (many) thousands of dollars' worth of MRI's and CAT's and an amazing amount bloodwork (for a while I thought I had stumbled into a ring of vampires)(but at least I learned for a fact that I didn't have syphilis :-) it turned out that, indeed, there was absolutely nothing to be done - what was going to happen happened. <br><br>My final interaction with the medical establishment was odd. After being told what my situation was, and what I could and couldn't do, and what to expect in the future, I asked my neurologist (who by then was familiar with my way of life) "what am I going to do?"<br><br>She looked me right in the eye and said, "you're going to get used to it". Maybe someday.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c4480133662022385195 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 9:59 AM</a><br><br>

If you've got the opportunity, balancing the systems against one another is probably a good choice. <br><br>Nate, thanks for posting something less belligerent. Would you like to provide some evidence to support your blanket dismissal of the papers I cited, though? Between them, they reference well over a hundred studies published in peer-reviewed medical journals, documenting high rates of morbidity and mortality from medical errors and bad practice; if all those studies were fatally flawed, as you've suggested, that argues for catastrophic problems in current medical research. <br><br>As for the issue of what is and isn't a human right, that's one of those subjects about which Americans in particular seem unable to think clearly. We'll be discussing that down the road a bit. <br><br>Andy, true enough. <br><br>Yupped, that's basically my guess as well. My hope is that alternative practitioners are able to pick up as much knowledge as possible about sanitation, sterile technique, wound care, and the other things conventional medicine is (at least in theory -- not always in practice) good at, so that those don't get lost when the industry implodes financially. <br><br>Rocco, I don't think Gatto's being ignored because he's a libertarian; he's being ignored because what he has to say contradicts both the conventional wisdom in this country and a large, vocal, and influential set of bureaucratic institutions. No doubt the fact that I belong to a minority faith has something to do with the fact that the media has zero interest in my ideas, but I think much more of it is that if I'm right, the future most Americans believe they're owed is an empty fantasy, and nearly all the significant institutions of American life -- including the medie itself -- have been busily if unintentionally fostering their own destruction and that of the United States for decades now. That's not something most people are able to hear. <br><br>Siani, thank you! As I mentioned, I'd mix the two if I could afford to. <br><br>Don, I've seen people with quite a variety of conditions get dramatic and lasting relief from acupuncture. It's a very thoroughly tested modality, especially when combined with the rest of traditional Chinese medicine. <br><br>Bill, that's a fascinating question. The t'ai chi studies I know of weren't controlled for involvement in the philosophical and mystical dimension of the art; most of them, from the research protocols, don't seem to have taken the time to teach anything but the form, and yet they got excellent results on a range of health conditions extending from arthritis to high blood pressure. So, yes, it's partly lifestyle change, but it's also a technique in its own right with measurable physical effects.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c8832456546459114356 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 10:05 AM</a><br><br>

The bits dealing with British politics are certainly very partisan and inflammatory.<br><br>I'll avoid responding to those parts, other than to observe that the tendency on the right to call the London rioters "feral", or "vermin" is a disturbing indicator of how little it might take in terms of further destabilisation to reach 1944 Germany or 1994 Rwanda. It's not a long way from talking about human beings as though they were beasts to talking about and rationalising "extermination".<br><br>As for cancer and alternative vs mainstream medicine ("allopathic medicine" seems to be a pejorative, as far as I can tell?), maintaining a good state of health in general is likely to play a part in avoiding getting cancer in the first place; alternative medicine as well as extra-medicinal "good health" measures are pretty good at that. However, once you have cancer, alternative medicine isn't going to come close to matching the right combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and, for some cancers, more targeted drugs (e.g. imatinib for CML). Mainstream medicine isn't perfect, either, though it is a lot better than anything mainstream or alternative from 100, 50 or even 20 years ago. This is all pretty well documented in cancer survival rates as they relate to choices of therapy. <br><br>Of course, cancer is also a very complex disease, and the scientific models of it, although constantly improving, will likely never be able to describe it fully. And no therapy for cancer is 100% effective. So there is definitely a role for alternative therapies in giving you the extra edge.<br><br>As for your question, <i>"Why does taking foreign substances into the body produce healing at all?"</i>, I would refer you to an introductory pharmacology textbook, with maybe a biochemistry text to supplement it. It's a rather large question, when you get into the details, to which we don't have all the answers (especially at the systems level for the human body).

The system of acupressure with which I have the most experience puts a lot of emphasis on checking important points daily, and using them to gauge the body's state of health, so that illness can be headed off in advance. It seems to work fairly well, too. <br><br>Cave, I certainly agree that there's a lot worth saving in mainstream Western medicine, and that the core difficulties are with the institutional and economic context rather than the system itself. Still, it's just a little disingenuous to criticize alternative practitioners for not doing enough experimental trials.<br><br>Have you ever tried to get funding for a study of alternative health care that wasn't explicitly framed as an attempt to disprove and debunk? For that matter, have you ever seen what happens when a favorable study, however well run, gets submitted to a standard medical journal? There's actually been some first-rate research done, especially on homeopathy and some branches of traditional Chinese medicine, but those same institutional and economic barriers have been used repeatedly to exclude anything outside the current paradigm. <br><br>Zach, E.M. Forster was there a century ago. Have you ever read "The Machine Stops"? <br><br>Wendy, thank you. It's not an uncommon place to be in; mainstream medicine does still save quite a few lives. <br><br>Robin, exactly. It's the transition that concerns me, and the isolation of valuable knowledge behind the steep walls of professional privilege is not going to be easy to get through. <br><br>Raven, that's an interesting philosophical question; nonetheless it's quite true that taking foreign substances into the body can very definitely cause healing, and that practical fact needs to be kept in mind here. <br><br>Kjmclark, under Obama's health care legislation, the poor are supposed to get their health insurance paid out of Federal revenue -- there is no such thing as "free." Even if those subsidies don't get cut in a future round of budget wars, most of the working class won't benefit from them. For the great majority of working Americans, Obamacare amounts to a huge new Federal tax on their income -- and I don't think I'm unreasonable to expect that to cause a political explosion of quite some magnitude.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c5901544745561837754 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 10:29 AM</a><br><br>

You're quite right, of course; the culture of privilege and entitlement that pervades modern America is not helpful, and when it collides with hard reality in the decades ahead, the result is going to be a very loud splat. The notion of taking personal responsibility for health, unpopular as it is, is a good deal more useful. <br><br>Your Name, thank you for the inside glimpse. I've had my worries for some time that profit-based health care was fostering illness to improve its bottom line. It's very worrisome, though not surprising, that nobody in the industry seems to be thinking about the medical implications of peak oil; that increases the likelihood that the whole kit and caboodle may crash -- perhaps for financial reasons -- and leave only the herbalists and acupuncturists to pick up the pieces. <br><br>Jonathan, <i>caveat emptor</i> is good advice when dealing with any service provider, in or out of the health care field. <br><br>Sgage, sometimes the world taps you on the shoulder and says, "No, you're not going to have the future you planned."

I learned a long time back that it was much better to keep up good health than to fix it once it was broken. In addition to using herbs and such, I have found that the greatest way to good health is good nutrition. I chose a raw food path for a while and experience a massive detox and excellent health. I have since incorporated some cooked food back into my diet, but still eat plenty of raw food and superfoods (i.e. foods that are very high in nutrition...blue green algae, maca, goji berries etc). Things that I have taken completely (or almost) out of my diet include cooked oil, wheat, white sugar and cooked (including pasteurized) dairy. My health is outstanding and I look and feel far younger than most people my age (47). I'd strongly recommend people interested in maintaining good health to seriously look at their diet.

I really enjoyed the flow and the bright analogies. I have been practicing various traditional forms, as well as forms I've developed geared towards me personally, of Yoga for many years. I understand first hand what you mean by the difference of popping a pill and flopping back down on the sofa, and the attention and effort required for taking a more active roll in health and happiness.<br>I also own my own landscaping company. Landscaping is a very interesting profession for various reasons. Specifically as it relates to this post, is my costumer base. At least 60% of my customers are over sixty. I am 35. This over sixty generation is an odd bunch to me. In the sense that they are a generation that seems to have completely swallowed this idea of better living through science. That it is foolish, if not dangerous, to take responsibility for your own health. That whatever a doctor says (any doctor) is basically indisputable, especially say by their landscaper. I have pretty much given up on trying to give advice to them. Even something as simple as a posture that could alleviate certain back problems. Usually their eyes glaze over before I finish the first sentience, let alone that I can feel that they are now a bit scared of me for fear that I am a witch, and will probably put a Taliban Voodoo spell on them. <br>The last thought I'd like to share is about, not only their unnecessarily unhealthiness, due to lack of self knowledge, but their seemingly stubborn denial that they are edging ever closer to death. That a lot of their ailments that they are taking loads of medication for each day in the hopes of "getting over this" is actually their bodies breaking down and that there will in fact be no getting over it. Contrast this with someone like you or me, who do things such as T'ai chi or Yoga that very much set us into the reality, and mortality of these human bodies. So I think these fundamentally different approaches to health, spotlight not only a changing perception in the collective conscious, but also the disenchantment of those who are living in the dust of the better living through science generation, and those in that generation who have put all their eggs in that basket and are now too old to even consider to consider a different way for the world to operate.<br>Thanks.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c2447182483959926616 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 11:00 AM</a><br><br>

What happened in the Americas was that a large number of people were transplanted into an environment they did not know with with different local plants, separated from the knowledge of their own people, unable to learn or adopt the practices on the local natives, and exposed to a mixture of new illnesses from around the globe. From that was born a whole new approach to medicine which evolved intertwined with industrial society. But that does not mean that older knowledge was not effective. By necessity we end up with a mixture of approaches – for an ironic example, we have not found an effective remedy for lyme disease in either area.<br><br>@Sgage - your story has not been lost on me, I think of it often while busting my butt around here, and understand quite well what it would mean if I or my wife got seriously injured.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c125268135151349764 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 12:58 PM</a><br><br>

The issue of fees is a big one; I hope you're also exploring the need for doctors to relearn how to do their own lab work, compound their own medicines, and train the next generation of physicians via apprenticeship rather than medical schools. Even so, it's good to see that somebody in the medical profession is asking the hard questions. <br><br>Sgage, actually, I was agreeing with you! <br><br>Shiva, I noted a while back that different people thrive on different diets -- it's emphatically not a one size fits all thing -- and if you've found the diet that works for you, that's great. <br><br>Ekkar, that's a perspective worth noting. I've had plenty of encounters with people who have the same attitudes as your customers; in some cases, it's quite literally killing them -- most of their health problems are side effects from medications, and they know as much, but the doctor is not to be questioned. It's the younger and savvier people who are asking the hard questions and making their own choices. <br><br>Twilight, well, that's part of it, but remember that most of the basics of modern medicine were invented in western Europe in the 19th century. There's a tangle of cultural pressures behind both the strengths and the weaknesses of today's medical mainstream.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c7034652871168415266 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 1:19 PM</a><br><br>

That being said I wish to leave my second of the day. After I read your post I went into my garden for my usual routine of watering the chickens, and tomatoes, etc. While I was watching my honey bees I started to think about varroa mites. They are are a bee mite that has been really causing problems (especially in commercial bee keeping). Certain strains of bees have over time developed resistances to the mites. This sometimes requires the loss of billions of bees over a time period, but resulting in a new bee, better equipped, and resistant to the disease which brought its species to the brink. Now I am not insinuating that we sit back and let diseases kill millions of people so that we may build up resistance in our species. It is a very interesting thing to think about. Are we actually keeping through the use of antibiotics, non resistant genes from dying out? Are we not only hindering our own collective immune systems evolution, but in the process making potential super germs that will wipe out huge parts of the population regardless? I know it's an almost crass question, but in the search for truth one must look at the dark as well as the light.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c788335379871414783 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 2:36 PM</a><br><br>

Scarlet fever is a sequelae to an untreated Strep Type A infection. Strep is still susceptible to penicillin and, for those allergic to the beta lactam family, to erythromycin. That's not to quibble: just don't let strep go untreated folks. It is a very easy to diagnose and still very treatable infection which, left untreated, can lead to scarlet fever, rheumatic fever (and permanent heart damage, and glomerulonephritis (kidney damage).<br><br>That said, antibiotic resistance will continue to spread due both to bacterial evolution in realtime and the ability of bacteria to share resistance genes in multiple ways. Also due to people *not* taking all their medicine (particularly true, unfortunately, with "high maintenance" diseases like tb), thus allowing the more resistant bacteria to survive and reproduce. Also due in a large way to factory farming animals that are fed antibiotics to "control" disease in their high-stress, closed environments. Also the disposal of antibiotics, which then end up in water and soil. It's a serious mess and may also lead, ultimately, to less resistant plants.<br><br>I work in a hospital surrounded by nursing homes, which is where we see the nosocomial infections. We glove up, gown up, wash hands before and after each patient (thus twice between patients), but patients and their families still sneeze, cough, wipe their noses with their hands, don't wash their hands, etc.<br><br>Funny how the pharmas and FDA keep trying to go after plant medicine, since most pharmaceuticals start out as extracts from plants. They just take the phytochemicals that are the most obvious in their action, but leave out the dozens or hundreds of "lesser" compounds that work in concert with the obvious one, either negating side effects or boosting efficacy of the compound of choice.<br><br>Western medicine is very good at some things. "Alternative" medicine is very good at other things. Personally, I go for the best of both worlds. The *best* treatment I ever got was for cash at the Ayurvedic Center that used to be located in Lancaster, Mass. After Deepak Chopra left, the physician was another "double degree," both a western MD and an Indian Ayuvedic medical degree. The cost for a 2 hour exam (including 30 minutes to take your pulse) was the same as a brusque 15 minutes with an Md. <br><br>Luckily I live in an area rich with alternative practioners...<br><br>And the best thing, of course, is to take good care of yourself in mind and body.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c3923622951183382334 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 3:03 PM</a><br><br>

However, the Archdruid is right in that it is very difficult to get these kind of modest studies published in respected magazines where they will have an impact. Nevertheless, research <i>is</i> available with the click of a mousebutton. <a href=http://www.acupuncture.org.uk/research-fact-sheets.html rel=nofollow>1</a>, <a href=http://www.jcm.co.uk/research-archive/ rel=nofollow>2</a>, <a href=javascript:void(0); rel=nofollow>4</a>, <a href=http://www.worldscinet.com/ajcm/ rel=nofollow>5</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAsdP3NGO7s" rel=nofollow>6</a>, <a href=http://www.acupunctureivf.com.au/pages/research_and_reviews.php rel=nofollow>7</a>.<br><br>For the question as what to salvage from modern Western medicine, my wish is not a specific remedy or therapy, but rather the detailed knowledge we have now gathered about human anatomy and the way it maintains homeostasis. This knowledge truly will be immensely valuable for all physicians of the future, regardless of what and how they practice and is not easily reproduced in a post-peak world.<br><br>JMG, I feel you have not addressed one important aspect of modern Western medicine, namely logistics. The fact that an ambulance can be dispatched on short notice to an emergency, that in a serious case quickly several doctors can be consulted all with their specific experience, that there can be 24/7 observations, with a full team on standby... these things depend on a lot of resources and cannot really be replaced by individuals, however hard they may try and whatever therapies they use. When these logistics eventually cannot be maintained any longer, there will be a lot of suffering, little to do with modern medicine itself, but rather with society's (in)ability to administer it. Eventually, in an Ecotech future, it may be possible to replace this with teams of healers of course, much like monks and nuns used to take care of the sick in the Middle Ages.<br><br>As a bonus, for the readers who have to do without healthcare: there are many <a href=http://www.communityacupuncturenetwork.org/ rel=nofollow>Community Acupuncture Clinics</a> now in the US, who use sliding scales within $15 - $ 40 p/ treatment and may be worth checking out.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c5083852819277475354 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 3:11 PM</a><br><br>

I am not a biochemist either so can't confirm or refute the technical terminology, it's my personal experience that matters the most to me.<br><br>I agree with you that there might be some other methodology that could be just as effective, however I have tried several and homeopathy has been by far the most effective for me, that doesn't mean there aren't others out there that would be more effective. As for the expense, that's one of the reasons that it took me so long to actually try seeing a homeopath. However it's still cheaper for me than health insurance would be. Homeopathy has gotten itself dependent on the industrial system too, although it's not nearly as energy intensive as mainstream medicine and could adapt itself to a deindustrial world, as it began before fossil fuels were used on a major scale.

However, as a pharmacist I can attest that we are already dealing with the first tremors of limited resources. A significant aspect of a profit-driven industry is the lack of incentive to continue producing unprofitable products. Thus pharmaceutical companies often stop making unprofitable medicines that are fundamental to care but are cheap to make and thus purchase, or have their production stopped by the FDA when they try to ramp up inventory and commit blatant safety violations. There are already crippling medication shortages for inpatient practice. It is only a matter of time before they are routine in outpatient settings. I dread the day my husband and I are routinely rationing basics to desperate dying patients. <br><br>In the same vein, a significant reason there are fewer antibiotics being developed is that after 14 days of taking the drug you're cured, i.e. there's no long term income for the drug company like there would be for lifestyle disease drugs. Industry folks will freely admit in professional settings that antibiotics and vaccines are unprofitable, which just proves how kindhearted they are to continue to make these money pits.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c1559780314989025870 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 4:18 PM</a><br><br>

You definitely get a different take on life and death when a lot of your job consists of being the last human face a dying person is going to see -- trust me, there was rarely a family member around -- and another part consists of cleaning up the corpses for the undertakers. I won't say the guy with the scythe is a friend of mine, but we certainly used to hang out together a lot.<br><br>Justin, not a gross oversight, just a lack of knowing what to say. I know the mental health situation is sixteen different kinds of mess, and that it's only going to get worse; right now a sixth of the US population is on antidepressants, and I bet most of my readers aren't aware that several of the most popular antidepressants cause the body to put on lots of extra weight -- have you ever heard anybody reference <i>that</i> in the discussions of American obesity? -- but beyond that, I'll leave it to those who have the knowledge that, fortunately, I don't. <br><br>Ekkar, it's a horrific question, but a valid one. I don't know the answer. <br><br>Mary, the obsession of the FDA with banning herbs at the drop of a hat is really fascinating, in a sick sort of way. Ephedra got banned after two deaths, caused by egregious overuse -- but how many people had to die before Fen-Phen got pulled from the market? It's hard to think of a good reason for the double standard, though all too easy to think of bad ones. <br><br>Andrew, the issue of logistics is a good one, and you're right that I hadn't brought it up. A great deal of modern medical practice isn't even possible unless, say, you can rush somebody to a hospital at highway speeds. Thanks for the acupuncture links, also!<br><br>Robert, many thanks. <br><br>Wullow, good heavens -- I thought I was the only one around who still knew about that! (I learned about it as a lodge member of a couple of orders that used to have such programs.) Your link doesn't seem to work, though -- could you try reposting? <br><br>Wall0159, er, it seems to me that you're confusing evidence with relationship to current theory. There's quite a bit of evidence, including repeated controlled double-blind studies, that homeopathy works -- but it's been my consistent experience that atheists of the scientific-materialist kind won't consider that evidence, because it impinges too closely on what they tend to label "mysticism." (Misuse of a good word, by the way.) Still, if that's an issue for you, it's an issue; you can certainly get very good at herbal medicine from a strictly materialist, biochemical point of view, and it seems generally to be a good idea to make your preferred healing modality consistent with your religious (or, in your case, nonreligious) worldview.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c3989358120927463041 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 4:38 PM</a><br><br>

When did you first notice it? What makes it feel better? What makes it feel worse?”<br> <br>Surgery: Surgery would still be the treatment of choice for appendicitis; and sterile technique is not something that we would necessarily lose in a deindustrialized world. We should be able to cobble together simple autoclaves to sterilize simple hand instruments; and we will certainly be able to boil water. And hopefully we will remember to wash our hands between surgeries; and for irrigation, to use sterile water instead of spitting copious amounts of saliva into the surgical site.<br><br>Anesthesia: I was taught that the Chinese could achieve anesthesia adequate for performing surgery using acupuncture; the only problem was that acupuncture did not achieve sufficient anesthesia as reliably as using Western anesthetic agents: sometimes acupuncture achieved good anesthesia, and sometimes it didn’t. <br><br>In an industrial society, the tendency is to go with the most reliable method, even though it is more resource-intensive. In a deindustrialized future, that resource-intensive method wouldn’t be an option, so time- and people-intensive acupuncture might be used instead.<br><br>Sutures: Dissolving and non-dissolving synthetic sutures would probably disappear.

They aren’t as convenient, and they have their drawbacks (e.g., a higher incidence of inflammation), but they are still reasonably functional.<br><br>So in a deindustrialized world, we might still be able to do a reasonably effective job of diagnosing and treating appendicitis, at least in urbanized areas.

I've always assumed that the two are essentially linked, since rights without a society in which to exercise them are meaningless in any practical sense. Are you looking at these basic rights from some Constitutional (legalistic) standpoint, or from more of a religious or Natural Law perspective? It seems to me that the perceived origin of our rights is important here, whether it's from God, nature, a Leviathan -- whatever. How does any right to healthcare (assuming it exists) compare to, say, the right to free speech, to a speedy trial, or to keep and bear arms? I'd posit that, in any civilized society, the health of its populace would be very basic indeed. <br><br> As to "some concomitant responsibility:" we do in fact provide for our healthcare providers -- I don't know of any practitioner who provides it for free; their compensation comes from somewhere -- insurance, the patient, taxes, etc. After all, it's their job and chosen method of livlihood. <br><br> One could argue that no others need to "provide" me with freedom of religion, or of the press, or of the right to petition my government for redress of grievances. But in fact, they most certainly do provide for me -- by paying for our judicial system, and the law enforcement agencies who carry out their judgements. (Rights without enforcement mean nothing -- just look at the ante-Civil Rights Movement south).<br><br> Thus, there is no clear reason to me why healthcare cannot be just as important a right as the (alleged) right to own a firearm, or to protest a war.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c4837965625638378526 title="comment permalink">8/11/11, 10:32 PM</a><br><br>

You largely avoided the topic of Mental Illness, and I consider that a sign of your wisdom and intelligence, but I will offer up my thoughts here, as someone involved in that system in America. One reason to avoid this segment of the health care system is that, even more than physical health, mental health is poorly defined. Moreover, the vast majority of resources being used in this endeavor are completely unnecessary (as you briefly alluded to when mentioning antidepressants). As a side note, I will quickly mention that all health remedies of any kind do not have "side effects;" they have effects, some you want, and some you don't. The difference between a weight-loss drug that makes you tired and an insomnia remedy that causes you to lose weight is purely semantics. Anyway, while we could spend weeks wasting time about the legitimacy of diagnoses such as depression, anxiety, and dozens of others, AND we can all acknowledge the understated environmental links to mental illnesses even as severe as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, many people suffer from serious mental illness through no fault of their own, and they have already been essentially neglected by the mainstream medical system (going back at least to Reagan). I work with abused and neglected kids, many of whom will grow up to be violent criminals. The time, methods, and resources at my disposal cannot prevent that. In some ways, I think the way a society defines and treats its mentally ill is as good an indicator as any as to its overall health. Prescribing millions of people anti-depressants isn't just hugely profitable (in a way that addressing more debilitating, less common "ailments" is not); it increases the likelihood that those people will go to work and not question the system which is contributing to their suffering. Take those little pills away, and for every person who refuses to get out of bed, I bet you will have 2 or 3 who manage to channel their pain into political or economic outrage, and the creation of more rebellion. I realize that you would probably have to delete 80% of the comments if you tackled this subject, and I certainly see the huge potential of lifestyle changes and societal shift (upheaval, anyone?) in reducing what we call mental illness (though the current debate around the DSM-V would suggest that, in the near-term, the definition of mental health is being quickly and severely narrowed), but just as the British media is portraying the rioters as mindless thugs (I am sure some are, but many have a variety of legitimate (though different) reasons), our mainstream medical establishment calls people who hate their lives -- filled with dull, meaningless work, consumerism, isolation, and television -- sick and in need of chemical treatment. When this power fades, the backlash will be very ugly for all involved.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c5133434826551067467 title="comment permalink">8/12/11, 6:22 AM</a><br><br>

Private companies engage in rampant rent-seeking while the entire alphabet soup of government agencies befuddle any attempts at fiscal transparency that might keep the rent-seekers at bay. The 12 years I spent working in hospitals felt like I was riding on a bus with all the passengers so busy fiddling with the seat-backs and AC that no one noticed the driver was deceased and the bus was hurtling full-throttle towards a cliff.<br><br>So I jumped off.<br><br>Medical errors: One hospital I worked at made an effort to address the root cause of medical errors. I was immediately struck by how often the narratives from those involved in incidences of "negative patient outcomes" started off with phrases like, "I was at the end of my third double shift in three days when..." or, "I hadn't had any sleep in 28 hours when..." Whenever I pointed this out, the response was usually, "You don't become a nurse/doctor and expect to work 9 to 5!", usually said with a great deal of bravado. <a href=http://www.absolutelyrics.com/lyrics/view/r.e.m./superman rel=nofollow>I am Superman, and I can do anything</a> is an actively enforced attitude in many hospitals I've dealt with. Granted, when you consider the enormity of their daily work and the disastrous consequences of making the slightest mistake, that attitude is understandable and almost certainly all that keeps most healthcare workers sane. That doesn't make it any less dangerous to the patient, especially when you factor in the hyper-specialization already discussed.<br><br>If you are ever in the hospital or at the bedside of an incapacitated loved one, <b>you</b> are the best defense against "medical misadventure". Constantly (politely, of course, but firmly) question everything and everyone. Most of the people you encounter will indulge your "curiosity" to varying degrees. Some will ignore you. Some will react negatively. The worst will threaten you, especially if you are acting on behalf of an incapacitated loved one. Stand firm.

If the latter, I should remind you that dismissing an effect because you cannot envision a mechanism to explain it is unscientific. Weather glasses worked for weather forecasting long before the movements of synoptic high and low pressure systems were understood. Gravity worked just the same before Newton as it has since then. <br><br>And what if these treatments just make you "feel better?" Given the ambiguous, often idiopathic nature of many health complaints (headache, joint pain, weakness, general malaise, depression, etc.), often "feeling better" IS "getting better." If your headache is not caused by some serious underlying phenomenon (as in the vast majority of cases it is not), then if you feel like it has gone away, it HAS gone away. If your arthritis troubles you less and you feel that you can go about your daily activities more easily, then you ARE better. Why is that any less "real" than a dose of painkillers to accomplish he exact same ends? Neither actually stops the degenerative joint disease (although in the case of reiki I am not sure that has actually been tested yay or nay), but it helps you live in spite of it.<br><br>An interesting story I saw a mass-media summary of a few years ago on placebo effects in antidepressant studies. As most people should already know, often placebos prove to be almost as effective as prescription antidepressants in double-blind trials. But in this study they actually looked at the fMRI of the brains of those whose depression had been alleviated by placebo versus by medication. They found that those who responded to placebo showed changes in brain function that restored it to being closer to that of a normal, not depressed person. In contrast, for those that responded to the "real" medication, their brain function had shifted even farther from "normal" into an altered, artificial, medication-induced, but no longer clinically depressed state. In short, the placebo restored normal brain function. The drug distorted brain function even further.<br><br>YOU tell ME which one of these effects represents "getting better!"<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c4620887857270083143 title="comment permalink">8/12/11, 8:49 AM</a><br><br>

My take is that they're social constructs, and need to take the realities of our ecological situation into account -- but more on this later.<br><br>Tony, you're making a false dichotomy -- a standard one in the materialist ("skeptic") community, by the way, and I do wish people would leave their canned talking points at home! We've already discussed some of the hard scientific evidence that some of the modalities you've dismissed out of hand do have proven medical effects; there's a lot more, if you take off your ideological goggles and go look. Those effects, as I discussed at some length, tend to be a good deal less drastic than those of pharmaceutical medicine, and so your second point, amended to cope with the real biochemical effects of such practices as herbal medicine and acupuncture, still stands; it's good to know what's best treated in a relatively gentle way, and what's best treated with more intensive means. <br><br>By the way, insisting that there's no such thing as "alternative" medicine, only medicine that works and medicine that doesn't, is another false dichotomy; on the there's quite a bit of mainstream medicine that doesn't work, or actively harms the patient; on the other, it's a way of ignoring the powerful role of social forces in determining which medical modalities are acceptable and which aren't. This is another of those canned talking points from the materialist community that badly needs to be put out to pasture -- and a little background in the sociology of science wouldn't hurt, either. <br><br>Lazarette, it's precisely because you do have a democracy that things like this are a threat.

You're quite right about the homemaker issue, of course; the family member who works in the household economy can certainly learn an assortment of health modalities and use them. <br><br>Jeffrey, that's true enough. In the late 19th century, cancer in children was so rare that individual cases got written up in the medical journals, and in general it was an uncommon disease. Nowadays, well, the one thing the American Cancer Society won't discuss at all is the role of the vast amount of artificial chemicals in our environment in making cancer the second leading cause of death in America. (The fact that the ACS gets a chunk of its funding from the chemical industry has nothing to do with that refusal, of course.) The one problem is that a fair number of the chemicals we've dumped into the biosphere are fairly persistent, and so there will be a lot of cancer deaths for a long time to come as the legacies of industrialism finally break down. <br><br>Cherokee, that's almost certainly an important factor; I'd like to see some good experimental studies, but getting funding for them -- well, let's just say it would be interesting. In the meantime, it's one more reason to grow at least some of your own food. <br><br>Peacegarden, that was pretty much what I experienced in my stint in the nursing home industry, too. <br><br>Pot, er, when's the last time you saw what was going on inside a hospital? Almost everything these days depends on vast amounts of fossil fuels -- the skills of the surgeon are a small element in a vast machine. To cite just one example out of very many, how many petroleum-based supply chains feed into providing the IV bag that hangs beside every patient who comes out of surgery? <br><br>Now of course it would be possible to rebuild a medicine that uses a lot less fossil fuel energy, and makes the most of human skill, but that's not the kind we have -- and unless physicians get to work creating such a medicine, it's not going to be there as the energy-intensive system we have runs down. <br><br>Grrl, that's a challenge. Condoms made from sheep gut were in common use in the eighteenth century -- they were washed and reused after each use, in fact -- but that doesn't fit the criteria you've outlined, of course. As for IUDs, I don't know enough about the subject to have an educated opinion. Anyone else? <br><br>Bob, thanks for the info. There are a lot of factors feeding into the way that Americans these days are basically cowering under their beds, hoping that things don't get too bad until after they're dead; spectacular overmedication with psychiatric drugs is certainly part of the picture. <br><br>Hawlkeye, I don't see that as conspiratorial, simply as old-fashioned corruption and graft, of the sort that's pervaded American society since about a week after those guys hopped out of the boat at Jamestown. Of course it's an issue; I've learned to take a philosophical attitude toward it, and work toward changing the things I can change -- which in this case involves motivating people to make changes in their own lives that move them away from participation in corrupt institutions. <br><br>As for mushrooms and bees, no argument there; I hadn't heard of the Russian bees, and that's very good to hear.

If you can find a link to the brain study involving placebos, could you post it? I've long thought that in a sane medical system, the attitude toward the placebo effect wouldn't be "drat, the placebo effect keeps messing up our research," but something more like "that much healing happened with <i>sugar pills</i>? How can we make this effect work more powerfully?" Of course that would lead to paying attention to emotionally powerful symbols and ritual psychodrama -- that is to say, magic -- and there are potent institutional biases in the way of that, but it would still make more sense. <br><br>Phil, thanks for the link and the reference!

Speaking as a student of what is inaccurately termed "western medicine" I think I can bring a few other points into the conversation. First, the gap between western and alternative medicine is sited almost exclusively over the question of practitioner certification, not practice. Many people who would sneer at penicillin would happily drink reishi tea for an infection, substituting one fungal antibacterial allelochemical for another. Physicians are rarely taught that Peter Safar developed CPR from an oral tradition practiced by midwives. The difference is, I have to sit through years of lectures and abuse to pass out aspirin, an herbalist (or self-medicating consumer) can get willow bark for a few dollars. Or, a lucky encounter with a downed tree and a knife.<br><br>More relevant to my current anxieties, though, and I write this after reading that the insurance mandate has been struck down nationwide, is that medical students like myself are caught in a fascinatingly fertile contradiction. On the one hand, we are paying outrageous costs, mostly in the form of student loans, which seem to be little more than a quick-and-dirty way to liquefy the assets of future generations, just as aggressive mortgaging liquefied the assets of previous generations. On the other hand, we are likely to graduate into a job market where too few consumers will be in a position to hire us, and at some point that will mean fewer practicing doctors, at lower wages.<br><br>I expect, by the time I finish a residency, that public health will be the only health sector still expanding, and public health physicians have traditionally been paid something in the area of upper schoolteacher. Given that non-payment of student loans already can cost you your professional (i.e. medical) license, and in some states even your drivers license, many of today's medical students are looking at an outlaw future comparable to midwives, herbalists, and medicine men.<br><br>I do have one pet peeve with your post. I am not particularly brilliant, and plenty of physicians are stupider than I. Why won't blogs like yours, or "preparedness" manuals, take seriously the idea that learning and studying western medicine, for home care, is on the same order of magnitude, in terms of difficulty, as herbalism or acupuncture? The message seems to be "you will never be able to make productive use of those leftover antibiotics in your bathroom; become an undertrained and inexperienced herbalist instead." I would say: "Learning to practice *any* kind of medicine effectively is damned hard, but an old copy of Harrison's Internal Medicine on the bookshelf would do you good."<br><br>Keep up the good work,<br>A<br><br>hunt gather study medicine<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c6764071676839298604 title="comment permalink">8/12/11, 12:15 PM</a><br><br>

As for your broader question, er, you do know that people do jail time in this country for attempting to practice mainstream medicine without a licence, don't you? Since we're not talking about the kind of overnight collapse in which the FDA and AMA both disappear in a puff of glowing smoke, anybody making plans for their own healthcare in the US for the foreseeable future needs to stay well away from trying to use mainstream medicine themselves, because the medical industry defends its turf with every legal trick it has available. I don't think that mainstream medicine requires more brains than, say, acupuncture -- I have a fairly good idea of what it takes to become a capable acupuncturist, and it's pretty demanding -- but the legal status of self-care with the two systems is completely different, and I'm not going to advise people to do anything that could end up with them doing time.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c2721137000943085780 title="comment permalink">8/12/11, 12:55 PM</a><br><br>

Even then in 1967 the health care in the UK meant that they made every effort to save my leg.<br><br>You know, I am now 64 and I really wish that they hadn't. Fourty four years and I have lived with pain every single day. I am quite sure that had they cut it off and given me a wooden leg I would have endured so much less pain.<br><br>Maybe in the coming days of oil depletion they will make different decisions in a case like mine.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c2880623655319269673 title="comment permalink">8/12/11, 1:46 PM</a><br><br>

Consider gingivitis aka swollen gums. Most consider it just a nuisance, this slight swelling and reddening of the gums.This is inflammation caused by the body’s host response to bacterial biofilms that are allowed to establish and flourish. This response causes destruction of the gingival tissue-the soft tissues that are attached to the tooth and form the seal around them. Ever notice when your gums are in this state that they sometimes bleed when even slight pressure or a disturbance is present-brushing for example? That comes from the tissue destruction. How about an unpleasant odor? The results of the accumulation of bacterial emissions and putrefaction in an anaerobic environment.<br><br>Gingivitis can progress to periodontal disease. Periodontal disease is the destruction of the soft tissue and the bone supporting the tooth. Perio (for short) is comprised of lesions. If these accumulated Perio lesions were where we could see them and joined all together, it could comprise an open oozing wound about the size of your palm. The most frightening part is it is only inches from your brain and we are constantly swallowing the ooze. The toxins and organisms pass freely into the blood stream to be carried all around the body.Ever notice that if you have to have dental procedures when you have had a history of artificial replacements or heart diseases that you have to be covered by an antibiotic course before the dental professional will even work on you? Some of these organisms, that form the plaque on your teeth, can also form plaques elsewhere in the body. They particularly are attracted to heart tissue. <br><br>Root canals? RUN AWAY! Your teeth are actually living tissue on the inside beneath and behind the enamel. Consider the connections of the brain to the oral cavity. Each tooth is full of blood vessels and nerves. When a tooth dies it is, most often, not immediately apparent. The body tries to isolate it and get rid of it. Pockets of dead tissue surround it. An abscess can form. In a root canal procedure the tooth is left in place. The nerve chamber is somewhat cleaned out to kill and remove the nerve and the blood vessels. The underlying and surrounding pocket of dead tissue and bacteria can not be completely drained and cleaned out. The dental professional then puts some antibiotic in and stuffs and caps the remaining void with a slight amount of a substance, comprised of chemical compounds that are foreign to the body and its processes.This substance is then in direct contact with what remains of the nerve. Now consider-what remains of the nerve is connected to the brain via a chemical/liquid pathway. The pocket of dead tissue and bacteria is also connected via this same pathway. The now dead tooth also remains and the body still tries to rid itself of the same and to try and fill in the voids.This remaining pocket of death, formed by processes that have dissolved and modified bone, is many times within millimeters of a sinus where additional destruction of bone occurs until it can penetrate the sinus cavity and voila! the recurring sinus infection. The second prong of this assault is the chemicals introduced and in contact with nerve tissue that now have an easy path to the brain. It may be totally anecdotal but have you ever noticed that some folks with lots of root canals seem to be plagued by oddball syndromes and auto-immune problems?<br>End of part 1<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c1416915768986814359 title="comment permalink">8/12/11, 3:19 PM</a><br><br>

Amalgam is NOT an alloy. It is a slurry, a mixture of metals given workability when bound together by elemental liquid mercury. The folks in a dental setting are required to treat it as the toxic substance it is-even what is left after the procedure-but somehow it miraculously is OK once it is in your mouth surrounded by liquids and acids? Ever heard of schools being evacuated and treated as toxic sites for a couple of days when a student breaks a mercury filled thermometer? Yet the mainstream dental business puts it in your mouth? After a few years the mercury is almost undetectable in the filling. It is gone. It has been taken into your body with every swallow and inhalation.<br><br>With the divergence of the dental and medical fields, most physicians are oblivious to the roll of dental health in the whole health of the being. <br><br>You must take responsibility for your oral health to insure your continued general health. Disrupt the bacterial biofilm daily-this is also known as brush and floss. Flossing disrupts the biofilm between the teeth where brushing does not have much of an effect.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c8584853563764817517 title="comment permalink">8/12/11, 3:21 PM</a><br><br>

I’ll have to try to recreate the post, since I wrote directly into Blogger.<br>My first point was about homeopathy, which I have been using for almost 30 years, starting mainly to work on chronic depression, and other problems as they have come up. For those who may regard depression as a “soft diagnosis” I will add that it has remedied a hiatal hernia which was causing me to randomly be unable to swallow any food for up to ½ hour at a time. One thing about homeopathy is that it is not a quick fix. It may take some time to find the correct remedy or to work through layers of repressed symptoms. Like many alternative healing methods I think homeopathy suffers from being a last resort. So, not only does it have to fight the original problem, it also has to combat the side effects of whatever else the patient has tried. In terms of the future of homeopathy, I wonder how many practitioners would be able to compound their own remedies. The remedies for sale seem to be mostly made in France, so availability might become a problem. <br>I encountered a prime example of the disconnect in many people’s minds in a book blurb on the Science Fiction Book Club site. The book is _Ready Player One_ by Ernest Cline and is described as being set in 2044 when the oil is gone and most of humanity escapes the wars, famine, etc. , by logging into a gigantic online game. Does no one reading that wonder where the power to run the internet game is coming from?<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c1378367230838385903 title="comment permalink">8/12/11, 3:29 PM</a><br><br>

The Gauls, and the Celts all over Europe, had the Druids who specialized in different fields such as law and medicine. None of their knowledge being written down we rely on the winners of the wars, such as the Romans, to tell us about them. They wrote nothing down, it was all memorized. I suspect that their skill in Medicine came from keen observation as anything else - my late mother's doctor read you like a book as you walked into his examination room(his surname was Scottish).

This can reference two VERY different things. One is simple lifestyle, diet, activity, and physical therapy type things (tai chi, chiropraction, etc) that are effective in MAINTAINING health by reducing stress (both psychological and patently physical) on a person or heading off chronic problems or dealing with a problem in a direct and simple way, combined with things like many herbs which do indeed have active substances with biological effects. NO ONE in their right mind contends that these are bad/ineffective, if used wisely.<br><br>The second kind are treatments like homeopathy or acupuncture or reiki. As I am heavily involved in the biologial sciences and find the general scientific/skeptical consensus about these things extremely convincing I do not know how well my ideas will go over in this forum, but after extensive research on my part it APPEARS that what most of these treatments do is not have any sort of causal effect on health, but rather let you perform an action that FEELS like you are doing something, and has no real biological effects positive or negative, and thus lets your body's (more formidable than many realize) natural healing powers go to work unmolested while producing a better mental attitude, which is in itself conducive to general health. Thus its effects on health are most likely more like the people who demand they get antibiotics for the sniffles, and insist that when they got better it was due to the drugs, except without the negative effects of overuse of antibiotics. It made them feel like they had some direct control over the situation.<br><br>This second sphere of 'alternative' medicine is also more closely allied in most peoples minds with quacks, clinics in mexico that try to cure cancer with coffee enemas, etc, which I think is why it gets violent reactions from skeptics rather than simple annoyance. <br><br>Two - This is NOT to say that I particularly like the way that modern medicine is practiced – my family does plenty of research about EVERYTHING that is proposed to be done with us before we proceed, and have made connections that the doctors do not and thus taken a simple step that clears up the problem completely. The system as it exists is too concerned with symptom management and quick fixes and one-size-fits-all-by-the-checklist treatment. But it seems to me that a lot of what certain forms of 'alternative' medicine does could be better accomplished with a thorough knowledge of when it is worth taking some interventional measure, and when it is better to just trust in your own biological restorative powers and work on your attitude and thought patterns to keep them conducive to health. This, like all good medicine, requires careful thought and familiarity with the human systems involved, and isn't exactly favored by the current medical system either. But even so it can be practiced at the individual level.<br><br>(note: the quotes around 'alternative' are there to indicate my annoyance at the fact that the term exists: there is medicine that can be shown to work and medicine that doesn't seem to work, and I dislike making distinctions other than that.)<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c7898747486027253432 title="comment permalink">8/12/11, 6:13 PM</a><br><br>

I certainly did not mean to dismiss the sociological category of alternative medicine as nonexistant or to imply that mainstream medicine was free of treatments that do nothing or more harm than good, this is certainly not the case; I meant that I wish it were simpler for people to simply use therapies that work reliably and not use unproductive ones regardless of their origins, but I suppose you are right that given human psychology and social dynamics that is easier said than done. <br><br>I am slightly confused by the use/definition of the term 'materialist' in the context of your response, but something tells me my confusion is due to semantics that would not be particularly productive or useful to explore in this forum.<br><br>I'm glad there is an agreement about the need to know when and when not to make intense interventions - this I think is one of the fundamental failings of standard medical practice. As for a mode of action of some of the mentioned gentle modes... no intent to troll, but I have to add my thoughts to the dissensus on this particular issue, which interestingly enough puts me in the position of wanting to explore the likely effectiveness of symbols and psychodrama on healing that you mentioned in response to Bill (a thought that I've had many times myself and am glad that someone else has had).<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c5968710966073569258 title="comment permalink">8/12/11, 6:37 PM</a><br><br>

One of the reasons amputation was a common surgery in the days before modern antiseptics is that the amputation wound was a lot easier to keep clean and uninfected, and of course the capacity to rebuild bones, blood vessels, etc. didn't exist; a lot of lives were saved by taking off crushed or mangled limbs. <br><br>Jonathan, er, the first paragraph of your comment contradicts the second paragraph. Of course homeopaths may be wrong about the mechanism that makes homeopathy work; that doesn't mean that it doesn't work -- and indeed it does. The bizarre modern habit of insisting that something can't happen unless its causal mechanism is understood is not helpful here; nor is the assumption that whatever you haven't researched must be equivalent to a placebo. <br><br>As for how the placebo effect works, it amazes me how many people forget that the nervous system -- which is evidently involved in things like perception and belief -- is part of the body, and does things that have biological effects. It would be stunning if mental states acting through the nervous system <i>didn't</i> have dramatic effects on health!<br><br>Greatblue, not at all. There's a wide range of compounds that kill microbes, and some of them -- carbolic acid, the first commonly used surgical antiseptic, comes to mind -- are quite easy to make with 19th century chemical technology. For that matter, a concentrated solution of St. Johns' wort flowers in olive oil was standard wound care in the Middle Ages -- knights going on crusade would stuff wineskins full of the flowers, fill them with oil, and hang 'em from the saddlebows of their horses before leaving on the trip; by the time they got to where the fighting was, the oil was blood red and had significant antibacterial properties. <br><br>Ric M., a lot of people are going to die in the future of things that can be treated today. That's baked into the cake at this point. The question is simply just how bad it's going to get. <br><br>Whitewater, thanks for the info! My experience with root canals leads me to think you may be on to something. <br><br>Rita, there are half a dozen homeopathic manufacturers in the US that I know of, so that's taken care of -- Boiron, the big French firm, has a large share of the upscale market but they're far from the only option. I've had good results ordering from <a href=http://www.1-800homeopathy.com rel=nofollow>Luyties</a>, which is in St. Louis. As for the disconnect -- that's a whopper, yes. Thanks for bringing it to my attention!<br><br>Bbrown, true enough -- the Gauls used the Greek alphabet generally, and archeologists have turned up quite a few inscriptions in Gaulish written in Greek letters.

Symbols and ritual are core elements of the toolkit of occultism, of course -- which is not at all supernatural, though we would probably have a few disagreements about what is and isn't natural. Magic was perhaps best defined by Dion Fortune, among the premier occult theorists and pracitioners of the 20th century, as the art and science of causing change in consciousness in accordance with will; Harry Potter fantasies need not apply.<br><br>At the core of ritual magic is a recognition of the fact that most of the individual's perception of him- or herself and the universe is structured by nonconscious and irrational patterns that can't be accessed by the thinking mind, but can be changed by other means -- and that these changes can very nearly redefine reality for the individual. It's far from omnipotent, but it has some remarkable potentials, and of course one thing about it that makes it particularly relevant here and now is that it can be done entirely without fossil fuels. <br><br>Shark, these discussions are half the fun of doing the blog, and there's almost always something useful to learn, too. As for the doctors, I hope more of them start to act on that weariness.

His pioneering work includes ongoing studies of laboratory rats and wild baboons in the African wilderness...<br><br>"It turns out that unhealthy baboons, like unhealthy people, often have elevated resting levels of stress hormones. 'Their reproductive system doesn't work as well, their wounds heal more slowly, they have elevated blood pressure and the anti-anxiety chemicals in their brain, which have a structural similarity to Valium, work differently,' Sapolsky said. "So they're not in great shape.'"<br><br>http://news.stanford.edu/news/2007/march7/sapolskysr-030707.html<br><br>The National Geographic Special, "Killer Stress" goes into more detail about Sapolsky's work. <br><br>http://www.pbs.org/stress/<br><br>The program discusses research on British civil servants. Much the same physical environment, same health care access, but in a highly stratified bureaucracy, the low men and women on the totem pole had significantly more health problems than the Alphas at the top. <br><br>Even more startling is the work of Arline Geronimus who began her research career in 1976 studying teenage pregnancy. Common wisdom said that "teen pregnancy was a crucial cause of ghetto poverty and ill health among America’s urban blacks." After examining infant mortality rates, she came to the conclusion that "Black teenage mothers had lower infant death rates than black mothers in their 20s. Because infant health is a decent predictor of maternal health, Geronimus’ data meant the average black woman might be less healthy at 25 than she was at 15."<br><br>Geronimus came up with a theory of "weathering". That is, "American minorities face a bevy of chronic obstacles that whites and the socioeconomically advantaged cope with far less often: environmental pollution, high crime, poor health care, overt racism, concentrated poverty.

It doesn't help that it is a legal concept and as such it can be taken away.<br><br>Another way to look at it would be as a benefit of empire to it's citizens and this has historically been the case too.<br><br>However, you may be interested to note that over here there is no bill of rights for citizens. <br><br>This situation came about probably because the country started as an offshore prison and farm for England. This raison d'entre didn't really change from 1788 through to about 1850 when the gold rush kicked off and it stopped making sense transporting prisoners to somewhere they wanted to go. It lacked the fear factor plus the locals also started getting a bit upset about all of the malcontents being foisted upon them! Oh well.<br><br>Anyway, history aside, we don't have a bill of rights in place. Does it make any difference - I'd say not. All the people arguing about human rights need to consider that what can be given can also be taken away.<br><br>In addition to this, the term human rights is a misnomer because I often wonder how people quickly apply it to their own situation for their own benefit and forget about others rights. A good example is that some have commented this week that good health care is basic human right when the evidence suggests otherwise. Anyone who has travelled to a third world country quickly understands that the health care that we take for granted is not universally applied across the human population.<br><br>Perhaps I can suggest the term "Empires Bounty"?<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c862866064867575077 title="comment permalink">8/13/11, 12:42 AM</a><br><br>

As a former philosophy major, I was looking at it from a social contract perspective, trying to keep Divine edicts out, such that any reasonable person could see that it was an essential part of a good social contract. The difference between a basic right and a social good is that the latter has some reciprocal responsibilities – and right now, that is important to keep in mind. As far as I can see, there are many who act and talk as if someone owed them a lot just for being alive! And those people don’t seem to talk about what they owe society in return. That’s a dangerous place to get to. As to reciprocal responsibility, I’m referring to the people who are receiving the healthcare – do they have any responsibility for keeping themselves healthy to the best of their ability, or to “pay” for the services by providing other services even if they can’t pay in money? The insurance system has spread the cost to the extent that too many people don’t even think about how much someone else has picked up their tab. In a single-payer system, taxes would cover some of the tab; taxes also cover so much of what people call “rights” – so I call taxes one way that an individual pays for his/her “rights”. That said, I don’t think our current system of regulations, insurance and taxes is a fair way to ensure that the individual pays for his/her healthcare. Much work would need to be done.<br><br><i>I'd posit that, in any civilized society, the health of its populace would be very basic indeed. </i><br>I absolutely agree, which is why I support single payer system in the US. I don’t quite get why so many otherwise intelligent people can’t see that basic health care (and unfortunately I don’t include organ replacement or extraordinary life support in that category) is one of the core blocks of a functioning society.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c1421278908073723399 title="comment permalink">8/13/11, 7:24 AM</a><br><br>

Controlled, double-blind conducted by homeopaths -- as already cited here -- have repeatedly found anomalous effects, which the scientific mainstream won't look at because nobody's been able to come up with a causal mechanism that fits within the bounds of current thought. Yes, the placebo effect is also an important tool, but there's something else going on with homeopathy. <br><br>As for keeping the patient in the dark, you're stuck, because the placebo effect works best when both the patient and (because of the Pygmalion effect) the practitioner both believe uncritically and enthusiastically in the effectiveness of what they're doing. A critical, detached, objective attitude interferes with the placebo effect. That's the trouble you get into, once you start dealing with the impact of mental states...<br><br>Sophie, that's fascinating. It would be interesting to see if participation in some kind of alternate or underground social network that isn't so hierarchical helps counter that effect. <br><br>Cherokee, I think the concept of human rights is a useful one, but only if it's remembered that human rights are a social construct -- something that certain societies choose collectively to offer to their members, and other societies don't. Once you get into "natural rights" territory, the concept very quickly descends into gibberish. <br><br>Mark, of course there are non-fundamentalist atheists. Most of the atheists I know are courteous, reasonable people who don't think their opinion about the existence or nonexistence of gods gives them the right to ram that belief down everybody else's throat. Unfortunately there are some atheists who are intolerant, dogmatic, and convinced that nobody on Earth has the right to disagree with them, and I don't think it's out of line to call them fundamentalist atheists -- just as most Christians are courteous and reasonable about their faith, and those who aren't can be called fundamentalists.<br><br>Hawlkeye, you can italicize by using simple HTML tags -- put the letter i in angle brackets before the word you want to italicize, and /i after it, and you're there. As for blue highlighting, you need the following code: <br><br>a href="PUT URL HERE"<br><br>between angle brackets before the link, and /a between angle brackets after it. (Angle brackets? On an ordinary keyboard, they're the upper case equivalent of the comma and the period.) <br><br>Bert, you really need to do some basic research before making claims like that. A bottle of 500 tablets of homeopathic Kali Phos. in 6x, 12x, or 30x potency from Luyties, one of the standard US brands, is $8.95 plus shipping and handling. Most prescription drugs cost multiples of that for a single dose. <br><br>Cathy, thanks for the link!<br><br>Jess, that's fascinating. I read Eddings' first series years ago, and enjoyed it, but his style of fantasy isn't really my cup of tea these days. <br><br>Kieran, okay, it's time to bring up the hard question: what do you personally propose to do to make this happen? One of the core realizations I hope to get across in these posts is that wishing that something will make it to the future isn't that useful; talk, as the Zen masters say, does not cook the rice.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c7785816592813040871 title="comment permalink">8/13/11, 1:03 PM</a><br><br>

Nothing -- or so I thought.<br><br>I teach an advanced course in graphic design. It's an evening continuing education course. Last semester I discovered that one of my students was an emergency room doctor at one of the busy local hospitals. He was a very bright young man in his early thirties, and he'd rush from my class to work the night shift at the hospital. <br><br>He displayed some real talent and skill with design and when I discovered that he was a medical doctor, I asked him what brought him to my course. Surely, he wasn't contemplating changing careers?! <br><br>His reason for taking my course stunned me. The hospital where he works made headlines a few times recently for very serious medical mistakes; operating on the wrong limb, wrong eye, wrong person . . . unbelievable stories! <br><br>He attributed at least some of the cause of these mistakes to antiquated internal forms and checklists. The quality and design of the paper forms were very poor; many were copies of copies of copies. He told me that sometimes one form has to go through many many hands before it's completed. And many of the forms are filled in by hand - - adding another level of complexity to the communication.<br><br>So he took it on his own to become the in-house champion for reforming the dysfunctional internal paper communications system. No surprise that his proposal was challenged by the hospital administration who resisted any changes. I'm not sure if his project ever saw the light of day, but I have great respect and admiration for this young man for thinking outside the "check" box.<br><br>So, moral of the story . . . paperwork isn't going to go away with the collapse. Even mundane forms, if poorly designed, can become a deadly medical instrument.

However, I would like to comment on some of the above comments which essentially said that unless the mechanism of action of a therapy can be explained in a scientific manner, then the treatment should be regarded as unscientific.<br><br>Allopathic medicine is replete with standard procedures and medications whose mechanism of action is either poorly understood; not even remotely understood; or firmly believed to be understood, only to be proven later to be completely misunderstood – and then that new understanding is in turn overturned, and then overturned again, seemingly ad infinitum.<br> <br>And yet some of these procedures and medications have helped vast numbers of patients. We just can’t explain why.<br><br>Below is an example from a paper in a medical journal concerning the mechanism of action of statins. As you read it, keep the following phrase in mind: “The author of this medical paper is desperately trying to come up with an explanation for why statins are effective at reducing the incidence of cardiac events.” (Note: The formal definition of “pleiotropic” is “multiple”, but in this paper you could almost substitute the word “mysterious”.)<br> <br>Here’s the abstract:<br><br>“Pleiotropic effects of a drug are actions other than those for which the agent was specifically developed. These effects may be related or unrelated to the primary mechanism of action of the drug, and they are usually unanticipated. Pleiotropic effects may be undesirable (such as side effects or toxicity), neutral, or, as is especially the case with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), beneficial. Pleiotropic effects of statins include improvement of endothelial dysfunction, increased nitric oxide bioavailability, antioxidant properties, inhibition of inflammatory responses, and stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. These and several other emergent properties could act in concert with the potent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering effects of statins to exert early as well as lasting cardiovascular protective effects. Understanding the pleiotropic effects of statins is important to optimize their use in treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease.”<br> <br>circ.ahajournals.org/content/109/23_suppl_1/III-39.full<br><br>Now consider that other researchers adamantly deny that the benefits of statins are due to any pleiotropic effects. Then consider that other researchers deny that lowering LDL’s – the primary reason for prescribing statins – has anything to do with their benefit, and that their benefit is entirely due to these pleiotropic effects.<br> <br>Then consider that statins are the most commonly prescribed class of medications in America. Over 20% of American adults 45 years or older are taking statins (my wife and I among them).<br> <br>And if you want to see an example of throw-your-hands-in-the-air scientific befuddlement, ask a neurologist to explain the mechanism of action that creates this everyday thing we call “consciousness.”<br> <br>Determining the mechanism of action can be extremely difficult; and if we limited our therapies to only those with a scientifically-proven mechanism of action, then we wouldn’t have much to work with, because it is so difficult to achieve that level of confidence in any scientific study performed with living human beings.<br><br>The bottom line in medicine is always: does this particular therapy appear to be helping this particular patient?<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c3856368417600619616 title="comment permalink">8/13/11, 6:02 PM</a><br><br>

I didn't post in order to change anyone's mind about homeopathy. Some here were characterizing materialism/naturalism/whatever in ways that made me want to represent my own views in a way that showed that they aren't unconsidered. So I'm not really interested in a extended debate about homeopathy, but I'll address your points.<br><br>I agree at low dilution levels like 6X, we have everyday examples of substances having an effect. This makes sense because they are statistically likely to have more than water molecules.<br><br>Please correct me if I've misunderstood, but I believe that homeopathy posits that the strength of the treatment increases with increasing dilution, so a 30C dilution should be even stronger than 6X (i.e 3C). That's where my doubts about homeopath's proposed explanations for why <i>homeopathy works</i> begin because statistics tells us that it is astronomically unlikely that any molecules of the original substance remain in a 30C dilution.<br><br>I also believe that there are homeopathic remedies readily available that involve even higher dilutions than 30C. Oscillococcinum at 200C (!) gets a lot of attention.<br><br>Don Mason, to your point, I think the reason that homeopathy gets so much attention from skeptics is more than just that the mechanism is unknown. It's that, in principle, the mechanism should have nothing to do with the physical characteristics of the remedy itself. Of course this doesn't necessarily apply to other alternative treatments.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c3592592898216182027 title="comment permalink">8/14/11, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

I naturally react to injections or blood draws with plummeting blood pressure to the point that I very nearly pass out and my lips go white (I've needed blood drawn several times for my job, and I get flu shots). Several years ago, I realized that there was no physical reason for this from the needles themselves and it had to be induced by my mind, and went into an injection confident that I would not let it happen - and since I knew it was my mind that was causing it in the first place, I kept it from happening and have kept it from happening ever since.

The primary question is that of efficacy, which can be tested directly enough (re: last week's post about salvaging science). Personally, homeopathy is not a path I have investigated in detail, but others here who know more say that some of these tests have been done and have demonstrated efficacy in at least some circumstances. So, sure, the *mechanism* of how it works becomes an interesting question, but the more critical question is how it works in a *practical* sense -- preparations, dilutions, dosages can all be tested, they don't need to be based entirely on intuition and anecdotes. This is what really matters when you are deciding whether you want to include it in your medical toolkit for the resource-scarce future. <br><br>As for super high dilutions, my understanding is that some of the ingredients in those ultra dilutions are really toxic things, and if you can get a beneficial effect from them without actually introducing a single molecule into your body, so much the better! If that effect arises from some mysterious, inexplicable, unknown mechanism, that is fascinating.

Most if not all human cultures have their typical neuroses and psychoses; ours arguably has more than most, and as the gap between what our culture promises and what it can provide grows wider, the result is a psychological pressure cooker with no relief valve worth mentioning -- so a lot of psyches get splattered all over the ceiling. Getting back to the natural world is certainly one important part of a return to sanity, though there's more involved, I think. I may post on this down the road a bit. Thanks also for the story about graphic design -- a good example of how thinking about whole systems can help unclog a very tangled situation. <br><br>Don, I remember well the definition given to me by a nurse in a nursing home where I worked for a while, when she was discussing a patient with an "idiosyncratic" condition: "idiosyndratic means that we're idiots and have no idea what causes it." In the real world, a great deal of health and illness falls under that label. <br><br>Spottedwolf, thank you, but the only blackberries I have any use for are the kind I can bake in a pie. <br><br>Kieran, you might try tea made from the freshly sprouted tips of conifers -- high in vitamin C, and the resins also have strong antibacterial and antiviral effects. <br><br>Ken, thank you -- that's good to hear. I think we're already feeling the tremors of the collision, for what it's worth -- the fact that nearly half of Americans can't afford to participate in the medical industry as currently constituted is a sign of no small importance. <br><br>Jared, those predictions of solar flares are handwaving -- nobody knows enough about the sun to be able to predict flares two years in advance. As for nuclear plants, it's hard to find a corner of the US that doesn't have something handy to kill you, whether it's something exotic like a nuclear meltdown or something more pedestrian like earthquakes, hurricanes, or a high prospect of civil war. Given the prevailing wind patterns, we're well out of range of the nearby nukes, as well as most of the other potential threats, and if something untoward happens -- well, something's going to kill each and every one of us sooner or later, you know.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c5131468552684599720 title="comment permalink">8/14/11, 9:01 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, you can do a certain amount by using the power of conscious thinking. Of course the New Age ended up becoming wildly uncritical about what conscious thinking can do, with very mixed results. In effect, they got so uncritically enthusiastic about the power of positive thinking that they lost the ability to notice when it didn't work!<br><br>The older occult approach is based on the suggestion that working with the conscious mind isn't enough; you have to go into the irrational, to use symbol and ritual, if you want to get serious results. The use of the symbolic also allows a certain amount of distance from the process, since the conscious mind isn't quite so important; it's easier to pay attention to what works and what doesn't, because uncritical belief on the conscious level isn't quite so important, as the unconscious listens to its own nonverbal language first. <br><br>Bill, no argument there. That's one of the reasons I push for dissensus; what works will be clear soon enough; the crucial point is to get as many options into circulation as possible, so nothing useful will get lost because nobody thought to try it. <br><br>Luna, it'll probably come to what it was for centuries before amalgam fillings -- extraction, followed by dentures. <br><br>Jess, thanks for the link!<br><br>Rocco, oh, granted. I've come to think that at some level, most Americans are aware that they're living a lie, one that's going to come crashing down around their heads in due time, but they're basically squeezing their eyes shut and plugging their ears and hoping that nothing happens until after they're dead. Thus the last thing they want to do is to listen to a discussion of what's wrong and what can be done about it. <br><br>Jose, thank you!

Several schools of homeopathy don't use any of the C dilutions (in fact some don't use anything above 6x), and of those who do, several only use C potency dilutions for psychosomatic or otherwise psychologically-based ailments. The use of C potencies is highly ballyhooed among some schools of homeopathy, yes, but by no means everyone who practices or uses homeopathy considers the C potencies worthwhile. (Yes, it's true --- homeopathy isn't a monolithic cult, it's a diverse and highly divergent modality.)<br><br>I personally don't use anything above a 6x potency because after 25 years of experience using homeopathic OTC remedies I've found that for me, at least, the potencies above 6x don't work. 6x nd 3x?

At least not at my school. And remember- nutrition is not stable ground on which to stand either; plenty of nutrition textbooks are much more concerned with gross deficiencies in a few vitamins than in anything folks here would be concerned with. Kwashiorkor is bad, so is pellagra, but avoiding them won't avoid cancer or diabetes.

It is indeed a delicate question, but not as absolute as all that. Some practices are unregulated, others are effectively regulated only if you pursue them for profit, others you can freely use to care for yourself but not for people outside your family, etc. Making things more complex, many doctors are willing to prescribe, say, antibiotics "for use as directed" to international or backcountry travelers, whom they believe are capable and responsible enough to understand when and how to use them.

Your reflections on the possibility of an English Summer did seem somewhat hasty. This immediately struck me as a case of Rampaging Underprivileged Youth, and though I would agree this sort of event has been occurring disturbingly often in Europe over the last two decades (and it may well be picking up speed), it's very far removed from the sort of goings-on in the Arabian world.

Like this is some gaping hole in our knowledge base and is a field we've ceded to alternative medicine. We don't commit X amount of hours in medical school specifically to "nutrition", therefore it's not important to us. That's not really how it works, not at all. You can't understand metabolism without understanding nutrition. You can't understand renal or hepatic function without understanding nutrition. Diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol, pregnancy, alcoholism, burns, poisons, forget about it. We have to pick the right diet for every hospitalized patient, consider vitamin deficiencies for large constellations of symptoms, diagnose and correct any manner of metabolic derangements, the list goes on.<br><br>Asking doctors if they know about nutrition is sort of like asking truck drivers if they understand physics. Of course they do, they couldn't do their jobs for 30 seconds otherwise, even though if you asked them how many hours they've dedicated to studying it you might get a blank look. If doctors don't seem to spend a lot of time talking about it, maybe it's because it's mostly a settled subject and therefore not terribly interesting.<br><br>We do ideally try our best to educate patients, but there's a certain amount of jaded triage that likely takes place. Habits are devilishly difficult to change, even more so some outside authority figure admonishes you to, so you start to keep an unconscious tally. How many diabetics did I cure with 10 minute lectures on cutting down on the sodas, versus how many did I cure with 10 second prescriptions for metformin? Hmm, I've got other patients lined up out the door to see me, what do I do? The truth is, when someone comes to you looking for nutrition advice, the battle has already been won. The fact that we quite often don't start with a patient base already motivated to make positive lifestyle changes doesn't diminish us or make us mindless pill pushers, there is a certain method behind the madness.<br><br>Ok, off the soapbox, just something I felt like mentioning.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c7047203079475010698 title="comment permalink">8/15/11, 6:17 PM</a><br><br>

In your place, I'd be more concerned about the rampaging youth than you seem to be; yes, it's becoming fairly common, and there are good reasons for that; also, as I pointed out in my post, it's not the youth who are the ones to worry about, it's the ambitious people who organize something more serious amid the chaos. European history has some very unwelcome examples of the ways this can lead to trouble. <br><br>As far as understanding the reasons behind medicine, there are good points to be made on both sides. You're right that it would be good to preserve as much of that knowledge as would be useful in a less energy-intensive setting; Bill's right that in the crisis years ahead of us, there's going to be a lot of ruthless winnowing, and whether a medicine is understood will take a back seat to whether it works. The question -- a central issue in the project of this blog -- is how to find a point of balance between those two factors. <br><br>Hector, thanks for the perspective from the other side of the stethoscope.

Selection bias. That's like asking why personal trainers have better luck at convincing people to exercise than their doctor. Few people get a personal trainer who haven't already made up their mind to exercise, the only question at that point is how. When the general public shows up at their doctor wondering why they're overweight and feel terrible and the suggestion is invariably made to try exercise, they've got to make up their own mind on the matter and overcome their bad habits and inertia, which no doctor however knowledgeable or charismatic is going to be able to do for them. As you said in the original post, alternative medicine generally takes effort on the part of the patient, as the general providers of first and last resort, we are still expected to treat those unwilling to care for themselves, and given those rather unfavorable circumstances it's a small miracle we have as much success as we do.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c4867291400500093837 title="comment permalink">8/15/11, 10:51 PM</a><br><br>

Simple, concise, non-technical language with a good glossary, and plenty of illustrations. <br><br>* Good, non-condescending discussion of psychosomatic illness, the placebo effect, 'bedside manner', and the psychological effects of taboos and superstitions. <br><br>* Rules of thumb for how to judge if folk remedies or traditional practices are helpful or harmful, and how to test remedies for effectiveness. Recipes for simple home remedies such as honey-lemon cough syrup.<br><br>* Focus on prevention and non-invasive methods. A whole chapter is devoted to 'healing without medicine' using oral rehydration, compresses, etc., and another chapter to 'nutrition on a budget'.<br><br>* Diagnostic section recognizes the confusion that can result when laypeople and professionals use the same words to mean very different things (e.g. 'the flu' meaning 'minor stomach bug' vs 'the flu' meaning 'deadly epidemic respiratory disease'.)<br><br>* A recognition that many health problems - malnutrition, poor sanitation, STDs - are partly social/economic problems, and suggestions for collective action towards solutions.<br><br>Its weaknesses:<br><br>* Many errors, dubious recommendations, and out of date information. In particular, dosages for children are calculated incorrectly and may cause overdose. In many cases, safer and/or more effective treatments exist than those given. This was the biggest concern mentioned by medical reviewers. <br><br>* Last updated almost twenty years ago. For comparison, most public libraries won't keep a medical text that's more than five years out of date. <br><br>* Intended for the 'Global South.' Some of its content, e.g. on tropical diseases, may not be relevant to more northern audiences.<br><br>* The actual instructions vary widely in the level of expertise they presume/require from the user. A book that begins a chapter on calculating medication dosages with a brief lesson on what '+' and '=' symbols stand for seems uncertain of its audience. That the same book presumes readers have enough mathematical skill to use the calendar method of birth control does not fill me with confidence. <br><br>In summary:<br><br>This book is massively popular in the developing world, and many health professionals who wince at the errors it contains still consider it a good stop-gap. While specific diagnoses and remedies should be taken with a grain of salt, it gives the reader a good 'common sense' grounding in sanitation, nutrition, and treatment of simple illnesses.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c8969755211153331524 title="comment permalink">8/16/11, 12:26 AM</a><br><br>

All the techniques can be used for other, non-medical forms if altered states as well, and combining the protocols with simple qigong, (say <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Way-Energy-Mastering-Internal-Strength/dp/0671736450/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313511395&amp;sr=1-1" rel=nofollow>zhan zhuang as taught by Lam Kam Chuen</a>) gives something very powerful that's also very easy to use.<br><br><b>JMG</b>: <i>in a sane medical system, the attitude toward the placebo effect [... would be...] "How can we make this effect work more powerfully?" Of course that would lead to paying attention to emotionally powerful symbols and ritual psychodrama -- that is to say, magic -- and there are potent institutional biases in the way of that...</i><br><br>That can certainly be done with hypnosis, and there would be far less resistance to it. The moves in the UK towards getting a national qualification system together will completely legitimise entry of trance states here, for a heap of applications, many of which are of course not completely explicable in terms of theory... Notably, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Self-Mastery-Through-Conscious-Autosuggestion/dp/1463590628/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313511788&amp;sr=1-1" rel=nofollow>Emile Coue</a> (he of 'every day in every way I am getting better and better' fame) began as an apothecary who noticed how much better medicines worked if suggestion was used -- and graduated to the use of suggestion alone (plus qi if you read between the lines of contemporary reports).

I sincerely doubt that health care that I currently provide will be available for me when I am 80. For the problems I deal with such as brain tumors, alternative medicine does not have much to offer. My patients with meningiomas, who currently have a great chance to live a full life with surgery, will no doubt die an earlier death when it is no longer an option. Radiosurgery, which is very useful for some lesions will be one of the first treatments to go, as it requires a very stable set of parameters to function. Low tech, but high value treatments, such as carpal tunnel releases may persist for some time. People may start to rethink their high risk behavior, such as riding motorcycles without helmets, etc. when emergency rooms are no longer available to patch up all comers.<br><br><a href=salvaging-health.html#c7370126443350044924 title="comment permalink">8/17/11, 7:10 AM</a><br><br>

In the town of Woodstock, Dr. Wayne Longmore is a former ER doctor who now has a walk-in clinic on the main drag of Tinker Street. <br><br>His prices are reasonable, from $30-$60 a visit, and he does not take insurance. You can go there for not only routine office visits, flu shots and immunizations but things like x-rays, EKGs and other procedures people with no health insurance usually have little access too.<br><br>He is open 7 days a week, and I can't tell you how just having access to a doctor again has really made the difference in terms of peace of mind. I do yoga, exercise, eat well, take herbs and all those great things but sometimes a regular old MD can be very helpful as well. <br><br>So if you live in this area, and need a doctor, try this guy.

Not all research is created equal. It can be very hard to design a good trial of treatments like Reiki and acupuncture, so it's important to pay close attention to the details.<br><br>In the case of Reiki, there's a widely cited <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-1241.2008.01729.x/abstract;jsessionid=8D600348CBD4AF396CBB52B5AF3F2D88.d01t02" rel=nofollow>meta-study of 205 potential studies</a>.

I've experienced two bouts of labyrinthitus - in my case a severe loss of balance and sickness. I couldn't ride a bike for 6 weeks.

Even sending my home saying I must be well. I had to demand a wheelchair.<br><br>But, my GP, a mature chap diagnosed me correctly before I'd even walked in his office! due to the fact I was hanging on to the walls - its a common problem in older people. Good GPs have much better allround knowledge.<br><br>If you're interested, the final theory is that as I'm quite fit my pulse is fairly slow and feeling dizzy slowed it down further and caused it to go erratic.<br><br>And to nicely round it off the high-tech med solution was drugs for my heart, a pacemaker and drugs for dizzyness.
