This is not going to be an easy post to write, and I’m not at all sure it will be any easier to understand; I trust my readers will bear with me. I could begin it in any number of places, but the one that seems most important just now is the vestibule of the little public library six blocks away from my house. It’s a solid if unimaginative brick rectangle of Eighties vintage, one room not quite so full of books as it ought to be, another room in back for the librarians to work, a meeting space, restrooms, and a vestibule where books that are being discarded from the collection are shelved for sale.
<br> <br>That’s standard practice in most public libraries these days. If a book hasn’t been checked out for three years, or if it needs repairs and there isn’t a huge demand for it, it goes onto the sale shelf. Prices range from cheap to absurdly cheap; the sale doesn’t bring in a huge amount, but at a time of sparse and faltering budgets, every bit helps. The exception is children’s books, which aren’t for sale at all. They’re in a cart marked FREE, and if they don’t get taken in a month or so, they go into the trash, because there simply isn’t any demand for them. That was where, a few months ago, I spotted a copy of Kate Seredy’s 1938 Newberry Award winner <i>The White Stag</i>.
<br> <br>The vast majority of my readers will no doubt find the reference opaque. Still, back when I was a child—no, dinosaurs didn’t quite walk the earth back then, though it sometimes feels that way—winners of the Newberry Award, one of the two most prestigious US awards for children’s literature, still counted for quite a bit. Most libraries with a children’s collection of any size had the whole set, and most children’s librarians were enthusiastic about getting them into the hands of young readers. That’s not how I found <i>The White Stag</i>—I needed nobody’s encouragement to read, and Seredy’s compelling illustrations of galloping horsemen and magical beasts were well aimed to catch my eye—but find it I did, and that’s how medieval Hungarian legends about the coming of Attila the Hun wove their way permanently into the crawlspaces of my imagination.
<br> <br>So that was the book, one among dozens, that was awaiting its fate in the free cart at the South Cumberland Public Library. I already have a copy, and I decided to take the risk that somebody would find the one in the cart before it got tossed in the trash. As it happens, it was the right choice; the next week it was gone. I’ll never know whether some grandparent recognized it from his or her own childhood and took it as a gift, or whether some child caught sight of the cover, pulled it from the cart, and was caught by the magic of a tale that makes today’s canned children’s fantasies look like the pasty commercial product they are, but at least I can hope that it was something like that.
<br> <br><i>The White Stag</i> was written the year my father was born. In my youth you could find books that old and much older, plenty of them, in small town public libraries all over the country. Nowadays, increasingly, you can’t. What you get instead are shelf upon shelf of whatever’s new, glossy, popular and uncontroversial, massaged into innocuousness by marketing specialists and oozing a fetid layer of movie, toy, and video game tie-ins from all orifices, all part of the feedback loop that endlessly recycles the clichés of current popular culture into minds that, in many cases, have never encountered anything else. In the process, the threads of our collective memory are coming silently apart.
<br> <br>I don’t think it’s going too far to describe the result as a kind of cultural senility. That concept certainly goes a long way to explain the blank and babbling incoherence with which America in particular stares vacantly at its onrushing fate. Without a sense of the past and its meaning, without narratives that weave the events of our daily lives into patterns that touch the principles that matter, we lack the essential raw materials of thought, and so our collective reasoning processes, such as they are, spit out the same rehashed nonsolutions over and over again.
<br> <br>It will doubtless be objected that we have the internet, and thus all the information we could possibly need. We do indeed have the internet, where sites discussing the current color of Lady Gaga’s pubic hair probably outnumber sites discussing Newberry Award books by a thousand to one. We have an effectively limitless supply of information, but then it’s not information that I got from reading <i>The White Stag</i> at age eight, and it’s not a lack of information that’s dragging us down to a sorry end.
<br> <br>The problem—for it is a problem, and thus at least in theory capable of solution, rather than a predicament, which simply has to be put up with—is the collapse of the framework of collective meanings that gives individual facts their relevance. That framework of meanings consists, in our culture and every other, of shared narratives inherited from the past that form the armature on which our minds place data as it comes in.
<br> <br>A couple of years ago, in a discussion on this blog that touched on this same point, I made the mistake of referring to those narratives by their proper name, which is myth. Those of you who know how Americans think know exactly what happened next: plenty of readers flatly insisted on taking the word in its debased modern sense of “a story that isn’t true,” and insisted in tones ranging from bafflement to injured pride that they didn’t believe in any myths, and what was I talking about?
<br> <br>The myths you really believe in, of course, are the ones you don’t notice that you believe. The myth of progress is still like that for most people. Even those who insist that they no longer believe in progress very often claim that we can have a better world for everybody if we do whatever they think we ought to do. In the same way, quite a few of the people who claim that they’ve renounced religion and all its works still believe, as devoutly as any other fundamentalist, that it’s essential to save everybody else in the world from false beliefs; the central myth of evangelical religion, which centers on salvation through having the right opinions, remains welded into place even among those who most angrily reject the original religious context of that myth.
<br> <br>But there’s a further dimension to the dynamics of—well, let’s just call them cultural narratives, shall we?—unfolding in America today. When the shared narratives from the past break apart, and all you’ve got is popular culture spinning feedback loops in the void, what happens then?
<br> <br>What happens is the incoherence that’s become a massive political fact in America today. That incoherence takes at least three forms. The first is the rise of subcultures that can’t communicate with one another at all. We had a display of that not long ago in the clash over raising the deficit limit. To judge by the more thoughtful comments in the blogosphere, I was far from the only person who noticed that the two sides were talking straight past each other. It wasn’t simply that the two sides had differing ideas about government finance, though of course that’s also true; it’s that there’s no longer any shared narrative about government that’s held in common between the two sides. The common context is gone; it’s hard to think of a single political concept that has the same connotations and meanings to a New England liberal that it has to an Oklahoma conservative.
<br> <br>It’s crucial to recognize, though, that these subcultures are themselves riddled with the same sort of incoherence that pervades society as a whole; this is the second form of incoherence I want to address. I wonder how many of the devout Christians who back the Republican Party, for example, realize that the current GOP approach to social welfare issues is identical to the one presented by Anton Szandor LaVey in <i>The Satanic Bible</i>. (Check it out sometime; the parallels are remarkable.) It may seem odd that believers in a faith whose founder told his followers to give all they had to the poor now by and large support a party that’s telling America to give all it has to the rich, but that’s what you get when a culture’s central narratives dissolve; of course it’s also been my experience that most people who claim they believe in the Bible have never actually read more than a verse here and there.
<br> <br>Mind you, the Democratic Party is no more coherent than the GOP. Since the ascendancy of Reagan, the basic Democrat strategy has been to mouth whatever slogans you think will get you elected and then, if you do land in the White House, chuck the slogans, copy the policies of the last successful Republican president, and hope for the best. Clinton did that with some success, copying to the letter Reagan’s borrow-and-spend policies at home and mostly toothless bluster abroad; of course he had the luck to ride a monstrous speculative bubble through his two terms, and then hand it over to the GOP right as it started to pop. Obama, in turn, has copied the younger Bush’s foreign and domestic policies with equal assiduity but less success; partly that’s because the two Middle Eastern wars he’s pursued with such enthusiasm were a bad idea from the start, and partly because his attempts to repeat Bush’s trick of countering the collapse of one speculative bubble by inflating another haven’t worked so far.
<br> <br>I’ve discussed more than once before in these posts the multiple ironies of living at a time when the liberals have forgotten how to liberate and the conservatives have never learned how to conserve. Still, there’s a third dimension to the incoherence of contemporary America, and it appears most clearly in the behavior of people whose actions are quite literally cutting their own throats. The kleptocratic frenzy under way at the top of the economic pyramid is the best example I can think of.
<br> <br>Back in the 1930s, a substantial majority of the American rich realized that the only way to stop the rising spiral of depressions that threatened to end here, as in much of Europe, in fascist takeovers was to allow a much larger share of the national wealth to go to the working classes. They were quite correct, because it’s wages rather than investments that are the real drivers of economic prosperity. The logic here is as simple as it is irrefutable. When people below the rentier class have money, by and large, they spend it, and those expenditures provide income for businesses. Rising wages thus drive rising business income, increased employment, and all the other factors that make for prosperity.
<br> <br>On the other hand, when more money shifts to the rentier class – the people who live on investments – a smaller fraction goes to consumer expenditures, and the higher up the ladder you go, the smaller the fraction becomes. Close to the summit, nearly all income gets turned into investments of a more or less speculative nature, which take it out of the productive economy altogether. (How many people are employed to manufacture a derivative?) This recognition was the basis for the American compromise of the 1930s, a compromise brokered by the very rich Franklin Roosevelt and backed by a solid majority of financiers and industrialists at the time, who recognized that pursuing their own short-term profit at the expense of economic prosperity and national survival was not exactly a bright idea.
<br> <br>Yet this not very bright idea is now standard practice across the board on the upper end of the American economy. The absurd bonuses “earned” by bankers in recent years are only the most visible end of a pervasive culture of executive profiteering, aided and abetted by both parties and shrugged off by boards of directors who have by and large misplaced their fiduciary duty to the stockholders. This and other equally bad habits have drawn a pre-1930s share of the national wealth to the upper end of the economic spectrum, and accordingly produced a classic pre-1930s sequence of bubbles and crashes.
<br> <br>None of this takes rocket science to understand; nor does it demand exceptional thinking capacity to realize that pushed too far, a set of habits that prioritizes short-term personal profits over the survival of the system that makes those profits possible could very well leave top executives dangling from lampposts—or, as was the case in the very late 19th and early 20th centuries, so common a target for homegrown terrorists that people throwing bombs through the windows of magnates’ cars was a theme for music-hall ditties. What it takes, rather, is the sense of context that comes from shared narratives deriving from the past—in this case, the recognition that today’s economic problems derive from the policies that caused the same problems most of a century ago would probably be enough.
<br> <br>Still, that recognition—more broadly, the awareness that the lessons of the past have something to teach the present—requires a kind of awareness that’s become very uncommon in America these days, and I’ve come to think that the main culprit at all levels of society is precisely the feedback loop mentioned earlier, the transformation of culture into marketing that exists for no other purpose than to sell more copies of itself. The replacement of <i>The White Stag</i> and its peers with the Care Bears and theirs is only one small part of that transformation, though it’s a telling one. There’s no tragedy in the Care Bears universe, no history, and no change, just a series of interchangeable episodes in which one-dimensional figures lurch mechanically through their routines and end exactly where they started, just in time for the closing flurry of ads.
<br> <br>The popular culture on offer to adults is by and large more complex, but no less subject to the pressures of manufactured popular culture. (The public library in Seattle, to my horror, once put up splashy ads asking, “What if everyone in Seattle read the same book?” Why, then we’d have even more of a mental monoculture than we’ve got already.) There the interchangeable unit is less often the episode than the movie, the novel, or the series. Whether the protagonist finds true love, catches the murderer, gets bitten by the vampire, saves the world from destruction, or whatever other generic gimmick drives the plot, you know perfectly well that when you finish this one there are hundreds more just like it ready to go through the same mechanical motions. Their sole originality is the effort to ring as many changes on a standard formula as possible—hey, let’s do another pirate zombie romantic mystery, but this time with Jane Austen! The result is like taking a loaf of Wonder Bread and spreading something different on every slice, starting with Marmite and ending with motor oil; there are plenty of surface variations, but underneath it’s always the same bland paste.
<br> <br>Business executives, you may be interested to know, read very little other than mystery novels and pop business books. I don’t know that anybody’s done a survey on what politicians read, but I doubt it’s anything more edifying. It’s really a closed loop; from the top to the bottom of the social pyramid, one or another form of mass-market popular culture makes up most of the mental input of Americans, and I trust most of my readers know the meaning of the acronym GIGO. Then we look baffled when things don’t work out, because we don’t know how to deal with tragedy or history or change, and trying to impose some form of Care Bear logic on the real world simply doesn’t work.
<br> <br>I mentioned earlier that this is a problem, not a predicament, and that it therefore has a solution. As it happens, I have no reason to think that more than a handful of people will be willing to embrace the solution, but it’s still worth mentioning for their sake, and for another reason I’ll get to in a bit. The solution? It’s got two steps, which are as follows.
<br> <br>1. Pull the plug on current popular culture in your own life. Cutting back a little doesn’t count, and no, you don’t get any points for feeling guilty about wallowing in the muck. Face it, your television will do you more good at the bottom of a dumpster than it will sitting in your living room, and the latest pirate zombie romantic mystery, with or without Jane Austen, is better off gathering cobwebs in a warehouse; you don’t need any of it, and it may well be wrecking your capacity to think clearly.
<br> <br>2. Replace it with something worth reading, watching, hearing, or doing. You may well have your own ideas about what goes in this category, but in case you don’t, I have a suggetion: go looking among things that are older than you are.
<br> <br>Yes, I’m quite serious, and for more than one reason. First, one of the advantages of time is that the most forgettable things get forgotten; there was a huge amount of vapid popular culture in the 19th century, for example, but only the most erudite specialists know much about it now. Your chances of finding something worth reading or watching or hearing or doing goes up as time has more of a chance to run its filter on the results. Second, even if what you find is pablum, it’s the pablum of a different time, and will clash with mental habits tuned to the pablum of this time, with useful results. When the visual conventions of a Humphrey Bogart movie strike you as staged and hokey, stop and ask yourself how current popular culture will look fifty years from now—if anybody’s looking at them at all, that is.
<br> <br>That, of course, is the third reason, the one I hinted at a few paragraphs back: current popular culture, like so much else of contemporary American society, is almost uniquely vulnerable to the multiple impacts of an industrial civilization in decline. Fifty years from now, the way things are going just now, the chances that anybody will be able to watch a Care Bears video are pretty close to nil; most of today’s media don’t age well, and all of them depend directly and indirectly on energy inputs that our society can scarcely maintain now and almost certainly won’t be able to maintain for most Americans for more than a decade or two longer. Beyond that, you’re going to need something more durable, and a great deal of what was in circulation before the era of mass culture will still be viable after that era is over once and for all.
<br> <br>There’s more to it, too, but to get there we’re going to have to take a detour through a conversation that almost nobody in America wants to have just now. We’ll get into that next week.

My family did have a TV, but it was an small old black-and-white TV that didn't work too well, and at most, I occasionally would watch public television shows about topics such ants several times a year. We didn't have a VCR either, so I grew up watching way less movies than my peers.<br><br>To grow up this way in contemporary society definitely makes one feel different and not "a part of things," according to peers. When I was overhearing classmates gossip about people I didn't know, sometimes it would take me a while to realize they were talking about television characters, not real people. I was sometimes embarrassed when I revealed I never had even heard of certain Hollywood actors and actresses. ("You don't know who Brad Pitt is? What planet are you from?" they might say.)<br><br>But, growing up this way has tremendous rewards. I may not know anything about popular TV shows and movies, but I can reference many books I've read. I do not know the names of every popular band or singer, but I can sing more folk songs by heart. More importantly, not being around manufactured images regularly in my childhood aided me in being able to visualize my own images. I think that is why that even today, I enjoy reading books way more than movies. I get really frustrated when I can't visualize things the way I want.<br><br>I'm amazed how few people are bothered by TV in public spaces the way I am. During my freshman year of college a gigantic television was put in the dining hall, and I was very upset about it. When I eat I like to be able to focus on the conversation of those with me, or if I'm eating alone, to be able to think my own thoughts without being bombarded by TV. I expressed my frustration by writing and putting a comment in the comment box. The person in charge of these decisions, the head of the dining hall, read it and invited me in for a meeting to hear more from me. I explained my frustrations more to him. What struck me, was that he couldn't even understand why a television being on while I ate would bother me. He then mentioned he and his wife loved television and that they had five TVs at home, one in almost every room, even the kitchen! They were even planning on putting an additional TV in another room. I try not to be unnecessarily cynical, but I remember in that moment I felt a surge of cynicism about the state of the world...<br><br><a href=#c8230455017676090304 title="comment permalink">8/17/11, 9:43 PM</a><br><br>

Without it culture has no foundation. Coherence. Minds made sieves instead of vessels capture nothing of the torrent. There's bitter irony in the dominant myth that meaning is entirely subjective and therefore nonexistent. Self-referential nihilism is not a cultural framework; it is an intellectual black hole. The vacuous shared experience derived from the aptly labeled boob-tube is largely and purposefully meaningless. The resulting pseudo-culture is worse than senility (which is essentially forgetfulness or dementia, an acknowledged cognitive disability) because it masquerades as robustly beneficial. Chucking the TV may help to address our collective amnesia, but it is short of solution to the problem of denial so rampant and pervasive in our modern social construct.

The prospect of being without something to read is alarming, so I’m building up my own library. I buy books at yard sales and at the twice-yearly library book sales - adult and juvenile fiction, poetry, plays, nature guides, do-it-yourself reference books and history. Not only will I have something to read, but I will have many sturdy hardbound books to lend out to others when the libraries close down. <br>We are also losing access to our classic movies. Netflix is moving from renting DVDs to selling online digitized films. Most of the old films won’t be digitized, which means younger people won’t be exposed to those movies. This will worsen the endless loop of mindless popular culture. In the olden days of the 1950s and 60s, there was at least one old movie on TV every night of the week. That meant our generation was able to share our parents’ cultural context. In Seattle, we have Scarecrow Video, which is a national treasure. Those in smaller cities and towns may be cut off from a century of American film. <br>Imagine the loss – no Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, Frank Capra, John Ford, Stanley Kubrick, or John Sayles movies.

It's a pity no one thought to engrave it in granite on the face of the Stock Exchange. <br><br>I have no TV of my own but my family members watch a lot of it. Its hypnogogic effect upon them is disturbing to witness. Unfortunately I am certain that trying to talk them out of it would be counterproductive, like trying to wheedle his fix from a junkie, and I haven't yet found a way to sabotage the sinister device undetected. <br><br>Every time I look for work the irony is borne upon me that with a dose of bogus enthusiasm and a couple of software packages I could readily get hired to work on video games, especially "social" games of the sort you often see people noodling around with on their cell phones. These games are of course the opposite of social, causing players to interact with no one and nothing but their iPhones. <br><br>After much consideration since I began reading this blog several years ago, I've concluded that the most reliable way for an artist or author such as myself to conserve his work is to produce it in hand-printed limited editions for collectorship. Only fanatical monomaniac collectors can be counted on to preserve such materials.

In doing so, of course, they increase the rate of collapse, but at least they’ll go out on top! <br><br><i>it’s hard to think of a single political concept that has the same connotations and meanings to a New England liberal that it has to an Oklahoma conservative.</i><br><br>And that wouldn’t be as big of an issue if the United States still had a vigorous federal system, i.e., the States not being totally subservient to the Federal Government. One of the great mistakes of twentieth century American politics was giving too much power to the Federal Government and distant corporations, largely at the expense of State Governments and local businesses, as the country’s population and geographic extent expanded. What we have today is an extremely powerful Federal Government that’s difficult to control because we lack the mechanisms to really do so in light of its expanded role in our day-to-day lives.<br><br>The number of representatives in the House, for example, hasn’t increased since the early twentieth century, and we now have an enormous class of career bureaucrats and military officers that outlast our elected officials. In other words, each representative is answering to more people, diluting your voice (unless you’re rich); this trend will continue as long as the population continues growing and Congress doesn’t increase the size of the House.<br><br>Folks rightly complain about the acrimonious political atmosphere in Washington, but what do you expect when you’ve got 535 men and women in Congress working on behalf of 300+ million people spread across a continent? The system hasn’t scaled very well, and we’re starting to see it break down.<br><br>Asimov, among others, believed that democracy could not survive in the face of overpopulation.

I must have been very young when I started reading the myths of the Greeks, Romans, and Vikings (and let's face it, reading about Ragnarok at age 6 or so is mindblowing. Yes, kids, *everybody* dies!). Heh. <br><br>Then, on to two particular series of books that I still remember with great fondness - Rosemary Sutcliff's 'Dolphin' series, and Henry Treece's Viking trilogy. Both deal strongly with collapse and decline; in Sutcliff's series only the first (The Eagle of the Ninth) deals with an expanding and hopeful society; after that, it's all about managing decline, and trying to hold on to the best of what your ancestors achieved... Wait, that sounds familiar.... Treece's books have a very different code, but certainly encourage the young reader to be ready for the ravages of unkind fate...<br><br>And then, yes, Asimov's Foundation series; loved it in my teens, but I'm not sure I could re-read them now. <br><br>Gene Wolfe's 'Torturer' (?) series is great too; I should see if I can find my copies of that, and read them again...

I didn't attend, but read many reviews and opinion pieces. They had the fervour of true believers. A true atheist wouldn't bother at all with such nonsense, although I have noticed that ex-smokers tend to be of the soap box variety (FYI I've never smoked)! hehe! <br><br>I found the whole concept to be rather amusing, as it's kind of like the organised Anarchists rally that I read about in Germany a few years ago. Makes as much sense anyway. I'm still left wondering to this day how you could be an anarchist and attend an organised rally?<br><br>Well, you've also explained to me why films from the US tend to have happy endings. I've noticed that culture from over the other side of the pond from you doesn't seem to be as upbeat and I kind of like that - not everything in life works out well - we shouldn't try to insulate ourselves from it. Our films aren't even as upbeat as yours. I did like the film American Beauty though - thoroughly enjoyed it and no happy ending there.<br><br>Thanks for the term kleptocracy too!<br><br>As a species without a strong culture and tradition don't we end up having a short term perspective? I would say that this is a major contributor to current problems. Wisdom can only be learnt firsthand as it is very hard to transfer it to other people. The difficulty in transferring wisdom means that it can be lost very quickly between one generation and the next.<br><br>I still can't fathom how working class people have been conned into supporting political parties that espouse cutting services and welfare over taxing the wealthy? Surely they'll wake up one day, realise they've been had and then they'll be really angry. Must read The Satanic Bible for interest. <br><br>Years ago I read an article in the Australian Financial Review paper discussing a large well known surf brand and its marketing strategies. I must say they were both upfront and at the same time not particularly complementary about their customers. The point is though, that it's amazing how much information is out there right in front of people’s faces and yet they still believe differently.<br><br>By the way, I read that after the recent round of borrowings, the US debt is working its way up to around 100% of GDP. Well done people, disaster avoided - for now.<br><br>The derivative market is twice the size of the share market and yet you hear very little about it. My take on it is that it's a form of gambling for the wealthy. The bind that we are all in is that it feeds into the numbers that make up the GDP data. How can you realistically grow an economy and have a contraction of employment. One day the debt servicing will exceed the capacity of your government to pay or the currency will be devalued to the point in which the debt disappears. There are serious consequences to both courses and no easy answers.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c116714260065657779 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 1:58 AM</a><br><br>

[cuts for example in youth services and small educational grants for mid-late teens]. These particular leaders are from the very wealthiest segment of our society ... some of them were even known to have trashed restaurants for fun when at Oxford University (and pay for repairs later, of course). Similarly, very recently, some of our Members of Parliament were allowed to return many thousands of GBP they had wrongly claimed on MPs' expenses. Not an option for the "simply criminal" who loot shops. For example, some woman, who actually slept through the riots, is just given 6 months in prison for accepting a gift of a pair of looted pants. No excuses of course for people who petrol-bomb shops &amp; houses, but I must point out that this is a fairly traditional top-down response to social disorder in Britain. (Round the Empire I think we used to just shoot looters.) No idea what these leading wealthy read as children, but our prisons have been overflowing for years (doubled over two decades) while 'senior management' takes home (or sends abroad to tax havens) the wealth-increase bacon.

Three comments:<br><br>1) My wife and I grew up in England in the post-war years. In that society we were all defined by the narratives or "myths" that grew out of that war (which is why there is no need for me to define which war I am talking about). Even though the society was heavily class divided and had many very serious problems, "the war" provided a context for virtually everything we did; it unified our society.<br><br>It is noteworthy that the society of that time was very civil and courteous (in spite of its severe class divisions). I wonder if the recent riots, which are extreme examples of lack of civility, relate to the lack of a common narrative. (Whenever I return to England I find a high level of general anger that I don't recall from the past.)<br><br>2) In the year 1966 I purchased a copy of "The Lifetime Reading Plan". In it the world's "100 best books" are listed and a brief summary of each provided. The idea is that, however old you may be, you have a lifetime ahead of you, and you should spend serious time each day reading these classics. (A classic is a work of literature that survives over time, preferably a few centuries or more, c.f., your comment, "First, one of the advantages of time is that the most forgettable things get forgotten".)<br><br>I have just purchased a copy of the same book for my two year old granddaughter. The new edition contains works from a broader range of cultures, which is great. And the first work is no longer "The Iliad" but "The Epic of Gilgamesh". But, essentially, list has changed but little. Which is the way it should be.<br><br><br>3) Regarding your comments about politics, it seems to me that that a core loss is a sense of irony. Going back to those early post-war years, I recall visiting the Houses of Parliament for Prime Minister's Question Time. (There was no security in those days, if you have a ticket you just walked in.) What struck me was the use of humor in the political discussions; the M.P.s were talking about serious issues, but they were also having fun. I don't see any of that in modern politics.<br><br>As I review my comments I worry that I am falling into the "The Good Old Days" trap. In fact, our modern culture is superior in so many ways. For example, I work in industry and we do a much better job with regard to worker safety than we did thirty years ago. And we have made so much progress in civil and religious rights. But there does seem to be less unity and less irony than there was.<br><br><a href=#c7501743375396735535 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 5:10 AM</a><br><br>

You've never read <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i>? Maybe what we really need is for civilization to collapse so we can get back to reading the classics by candle light...<br><br>I have a small nit to pick about some of your comments: Yes, Jesus told us to give to the poor, but He did not tell Ceasar to TAKE our wealth and give it to favored groups of disadvantaged people who just happen to vote Democratic (after taking a hefty cut for Ceasar's bureaucrats). It doesn't really help your soul get into Heaven if Big Brother forces you to subsidize the less fortunate; it only really counts if it's voluntary on your part.<br><br>I noticed as early as the 2004 election that the list of states that had the highest percentage of votes for the Democrat csndidate was almost completely the inverse of the list of states with the highest levels of voluntary per capita charitable contributions. Blue states like Connecticutt and Massachusetts (that voted heavily for Kerry, for example) had the lowest levels of charitable giving (even though they have lots of wealthy people who should be able to afford more charity), while less affluent red states in the South generally had the highest levels of giving.<br><br>My big beef with holier-than-thou liberals is that it's real easy for them to be generous with other people's money. Obviously it makes them feel good about themselves to be seen as being so generous to the poor, unlike those selfish, greedy, unfeeling Republicans who just want Grandma to eat catfood. However, it is generally Christians and conservatives who are more generous with their OWN money. <br><br>Simply giving to the poor without at least asking them to help themselves leads inevitably to the situation we've seen recently in England. I think a very strong case can be made that a more tough-love, conservative approach to the poor is better for them, and for us, than simply enabling them to continue existing (not really living) on our charity. All those liberal good intentions are currently paving the road to you-know-where...<br><br>So please be careful with the stereotypes about conservative Christians, okay?<br><br><a href=#c4949112876635079270 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 5:35 AM</a><br><br>

And failure to understand all those things is a recipe for trouble. I see many would-be "world changers" who dismiss all mass culture as beneath them; it makes me wonder how they expect to change a world that they don't even pay attention to. The cultural narratives that dominate pop culture are the same ones that come to dominate religion, politics, law enforcement, economics, and everything else about the societies we are inextricably embedded within. <br><br>You don't have to participate in or become immersed in pop culture to keep in tune with what is going on around you. A couple of hours channel-surfing through cable TV will tell you an enormous amount about the American Zeitgeist. But I would strongly advise against completely tuning it out, just as I would advise against paying no attention to politics or the weather.

"Who are these people and why do they do..." has been an endlessly running background bafflement for me.<br><br>So pulling the plug on the Clueless Machine was fairly easy for me because there are so many more interesting things elsewhere. But watch out if you've let your kids drink too much Murican Kool-Aid...<br><br>This month of August, we instituted a media-fast: no movies (already no cable) no videos, no computer screens atall, just books and music, playing or listening. For the first few days there was the expected whining and grumbling and "boredom". But then, it must be their brains, started kicking into gear, and that restlessness became grounded in more than a few explorations and creative outings (and "innings", hours with good books, not baseball).<br><br>In many ways it was easier for them; it was the grownups who had to come up with the missing pieces of...what, culture itself, it appears. When the parents find a rare window for "alone time" (with each other, of course) it's so much easier to activate the "video-sitter" as the cushion of privacy. <br><br>My favorite result, after only these few weeks, is a loss of reluctance to pitch-in with the household chores. It's no longer work (what-a-drag) or not-work (zombie-happy-zone) but more of a contributing spirit of "this is just what we do".<br><br>I anticipate a wild west climax where I convince my teenage boy to place the television about 50 yards out for target practice. As much as I would enjoy pulling that trigger, I suspect it will be more cathartic for him, and certainly more fun.<br><br>But I'll watch with my share of delight...and show him how to re-load.<br><br><a href=#c4574635243649978840 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 5:47 AM</a><br><br>

You keep outdoing yourself. Almost every week I go away from your column thinking this was your best essay ever, and then the next week's column tops it!<br><br>Second, while reading this week's essay, I was reminded of poet Muriel Rukeyser's famous comment: "The world is made, not of atoms, but of stories." Indeed, we have forgotten our stories, whatever we wish to call them (myths, cultural narratives, whatever).<br><br>Finally, your comment about right-wing Christians and their attitude toward the poor paralleling what's found in <i>The Satanic Bible</i>: I don't understand the infatuation some Christians have with the writings of Ayn Rand. She was an atheist, she hated the teachings of Jesus, and her attitude toward the poor, that they are a burden and drag on productivity, echoes the attitude of the unregenerate Ebeneezer Scrooge ("If they would rather die," said Scrooge, "they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.") much closer than the teachings of the man from Nazareth. You're right, also, that there's no reasoning with such individuals. Their political views have taken the form of an absolutist religion--a religion that, if Christian and biblical teaching be taken seriously--is actually idolatry.<br><br><a href=#c6669362444705029534 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 5:55 AM</a><br><br>

There are some bright spots, even Harry Potter has something positive to say, but it’s floating on an ocean of pap. <br><br>But putting my Dad hat on for a moment, it’s pretty much impossible to really cut ties to it, unless your take your family into seclusion somewhere. We’ve done the things we can control – no TV, introduced lots of different cultural angles, made sure they listen to a wide variety of music, etc. And we’ve had some success with that, to a degree. But if you send your kids to public schools you’re going to be fighting a losing battle, because the endless stimulation/marketing/consumption-training wagon will catch up with your kids pretty quickly in the schools. We’re home schooling our youngest now, although it’s too early to see if there will be a difference, but the “popular culture” is pretty pervasive and difficult to completely turn-off.<br><br>Where I’m more optimistic, in a weird sort of way, is that I’ve seen with my kids and their friends how unsatisfying it all is to them, how they embrace the culture on one level but know that it really isn’t going to work, that something’s really wrong with it. You would think that this cultural machine is supposed to churn out happy-shiny-people, germ-free-adolescents, shopping-machines, or whatever. But many teenage products of this culture are anything but – there’s plenty of teenage of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, meanness, hyper-competitiveness and other unpleasantness to go around. As unwelcome as that is, it indicates a lack of satisfaction with their environment that I’m starting to see go to some good, healthy places now that my elder kids are getting themselves established. They’re waking-up, and the culture doesn’t seem to have snuffed-out their BS-detectors. <br><br>So as awful as it has been to raise kids in this culture, it’s good to see them realize that it doesn’t work, that a life of stuff isn’t going to do it for them. I see them doing the usual thing of rejecting their parent’s generation’s culture, although I’m not sure yet that I have any sense of what they will replace it with.<br><br><a href=#c5595012519833355878 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 6:10 AM</a><br><br>

I've rescued a fair amount of discards from the waste bin. One of the most unsettling things to happen at this library was the establishment of the "Popular" library. Most of the great classical and jazz music collection we have was moved to the stacks. Not that it doesn't circulate, but people can't just browse through it as easily.<br>And there is great value in discovering something at a library through browsing.<br><br>Most of our old books are in the stacks, and I know this is partly for their preservation. At the same time though, people may not stumble across something of value to them because it is sequestered in the stacks. And since the card catalog is gone, you don't as often see titles of interest in a computer search. <br><br>It also amazes me what the library does buy, which means less money spent on books that would have lasting value to our culture. I'm astonished when people check out and watch a whole season of "Third Rock from the Sun" or "The Jeffersons". The administration has also instituted a policy of buying hundreds of books by the most popular writers, like Janet Evanovich or James Patterson. This means there is less room in the stacks for the midlist writers of fiction who generally have a lot more of value to say. <br><br>Among our two million plus items there is still a lot of value (including a fair number of your books), and I always make suggestions to the library as to what we should add to our collection (I'll ask that they stock up on some more of your newer titles).<br><br>Recently I started reading this blog from the very beginning, to get the full picture up to where I started reading about two years ago. This post ties in with so much of the ground work you layed down in your first few posts, especially the dangers of knowing only one story, worth quoting again:<br><br>"Knowing many stories is wisdom.<br>Knowing no stories is ignorance.<br>Knowing one story is death."<br><br>Thanks for your blog.

Some have been chaffing against it ever since. At that time there were other organized and powerful social institutions that had been built up over time and that amplified the power of the working masses and the threat to the powerful. This does not exist now, as it was long since destroyed by the comforts derived of the fruits of empire and oil. This opposing force was actually a stabilizing one, as people shared at least some of the broader cultural narratives across the classes - it did not seek to tear apart the system, but to modify it. <br><br>I don't see that there is time now to rebuild such an opposing force. As there is less and less to go around, the rich will try to gather more and more of it. Without the pre-existing organizations there is no force to oppose them, so they will reach too far, until enough people are desperate enough to fight back. Then ad-hoc organizations will for, many at cross purposes and ripe for exploitation. <br><br>Maybe it's just me fitting everything into the same mold, but I see the energy of fossil fuels behind this too. Our fossil fuel energy slaves allowed us to live in isolation, without having to interact and depend on each other for labor. TV allowed us to be entertained without interacting. Without these the nuclear family has no other inputs but what corporations find profitable to provide them. You cannot fix this quickly as people need time to adopt new ideas.<br><br>Great post by the way.<br><br><a href=#c971748425397020711 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 6:27 AM</a><br><br>

A great many found the ideas espoused to be likely derived from Communist propaganda, and were offended. The quotes were all from the Bill of Rights. While there may be many factual errors in this story, it is a myth I have no problem embracing. Just as the GOP are unwitting Satanists, Jesus' ideas about the redistribution of wealth sure do sound like the "dread" Socialism feared by the right. Of course, even if a person managed to get on a top news show AND managed to convincingly make that point without being shouted down, it would be distorted and forgotten within a couple weeks at most. While I agree with everything you say in this post, do not forget that there still does exist (for the time being) a genuine independent culture in all forms of media, and that New Society Publishers has its equivalent in the worlds of music, film, etc. I tend to be mainly a book and music nut, and there are plenty of both coming from people less interested in profit or promoting the status quo than genuine emotional and philosophical expression. Michael Pollan recently advocated that people should never eat any food that is advertised; I try as much as possible to extend this idea to what I feed my brain as well.<br><br><a href=#c6083050790839300205 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 6:44 AM</a><br><br>

I make a point not to pay attention to it, I don't have tv, I don't have any guilty pleasures, yet I still know individual cast members of shows like Jersey Shore. I know plot lines and characters from shows like Friends. I know that there have been approximately 8 Harry Potter movies.

However, as a self-proclaimed music snob, I am impressed every now and again with the quality of so-called 'indie' music being created nowadays. You certainly won't hear it on the radio, and sadly, that itself could be the litmus test - if it's 'popular', it's probably garbage. In other words, good stuff is still being produced, it's just much harder to find! <br><br>Additionally, theoretically I admire the boldness of your suggestion to forsake popular culture completely. However, pragmatically I'm concerned that breaking away from popular culture will alienate and ostracize many friends and family. <br><br>I've mentioned this before, but I think it bears repeating: I question the wisdom of what I call 'living tomorrow today' - the idea that living today as if it were 50 years from now will adequately prepare you for that future, or improve the quality of your life today. For instance, of those Americans who subscribe to your outlook (I am one), many are not in a position to quit their jobs, sell their home and move to a farm in the hinterlands (regrettably). Similarly, for better or worse many Americans cannot cleanly severe their connections with the outside world without sacrificing their relationships with others. The attempt to 'live tomorrow today' seems to me to parallel how Karl Jaspers interpreted Jesus' behavior. During his life, Jesus denied the reality of every mundane thing in front of him and lived his life 'as if the Kingdom had already come'. I see parallels between this approach and the recommendations you give sometimes to renounce all aspects of the bumpy, messy energy plateau that represents modern American life. The fact is, for many Americans they must live in the world of today as they find it - at least until it no longer makes sense to do so.<br><br>Please don't get me wrong - I see the value in preparing today for the challenges of energy descent that are already manifest. Our family is taking measures to establish a household economy and break free of the spell of popular culture - we just can't do it overnight unfortunately.<br><br><a href=#c2605627133694472359 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 7:34 AM</a><br><br>

I haunt the town’s used book store (yes, they have a whole store for library discards and local donations – I also donate there). The prices are from .25 to 2.00, and the books… well, like you say: <i>What you get instead are shelf upon shelf of whatever’s new, glossy, popular and uncontroversial, massaged into innocuousness by marketing specialists and oozing a fetid layer of movie, toy, and video game tie-ins from all orifices, all part of the feedback loop that endlessly recycles the clichés of current popular culture into minds that, in many cases, have never encountered anything else. </i><br>I have noticed and grieved over this time and time again! Your “cultural senility” is right on! I’ve been horrified to learn how little historical background most people can bring to a discussion. It’s like they all think we sprung full-blown from the gods in this past century. However, it’s like digging in muck – every now and then a book comes in that is worth the others – an old carpentry book, or basic electricity, or some old set of essays.<br><br>You have too many topics this time to comment on all of them! :-} <i> In the process, the threads of our collective memory are coming silently apart. </i>Wendell Berry touches on the lack of collective meaning in his essays on community, and how a small town enables continued conversations over years, such that a topic can be fully explored and some real consensus (or disensus) arrived at. <br><br><i>The myths you really believe in, of course, are the ones you don’t notice that you believe.</i> As someone who never goes to movies, all I have to do is review the narratives of the current ones to see what kinds of myths are being shoved at the public (and apparently the public is lapping them up). The recent plague of disaster movies is disturbing, in that the myth is that a group of deserving heroes (none of whom was aware or prepared for the disaster) survives – thus leading the audience into the belief that they will of course survive… without doing anything until crunch time!<br><br><i>it’s that there’s no longer any shared narrative about government that’s held in common between the two sides.</i> And they have no desire to create one, apparently – that’s just as scary! Your critique of the Dems leaves out their disconnect between the rhetoric of “equal rights” and “equal opportunity” and what they actually promote with their actions – which is “let me get mine”. I do wonder if this is part of the dynamic of decline of empire – those generations who have lived with nothing but empire (whether Roman, British or US) can’t conceive of the loss of it, can’t conceive of the compromises that earlier generations made to achieve it – and thus they lose it altogether.<br><br><i>1. Pull the plug on current popular culture in your own life.</i> I agree -- it has to be all tv, all movies, 90% popular printed stuff – otherwise you are still caught in the illusion. When I pulled out, I could see the insanity that I was reacting to. <br><br><i>2. Replace it with something worth reading, watching, hearing, or doing.</i> Agree again – history is amazing, and reading the stuff written at the time of the events is both absorbing and eye-opening. The pioneer interviews; the descriptions of NYC during the Civil War – it’s <b>not</b> the way the history books tell it!! It becomes clear how similar are human responses through time, and yet how different the external environment can be.<br><br>Read the old newspapers!! You can get them on microfilm at the library – they are soooo much fun to read! And you get a real taste of the time. For example, the NY papers during the Depression sound a lot like today’s paper – full of daily optimism and not much discussion of the grinding poverty of the majority.<br><br>Thank you again for such an important topic – if more people could put this time period in context and be able to step back and view it objectively, we might be able to have some more substantial discussions.<br><br><a href=#c6795422114938996259 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 7:55 AM</a><br><br>

You have had some good posts and even a few great ones which I bookmark in a folder called great essays. This one certainly goes there and I really wonder if this should not be submitted to one of the few thoughtful magazines or newspapers still alive like Nation, Harpers, even Sunday NYT? I think it deserves a wider audience than this coterie of loyal readers. The concept of endlessly repeating cultural feedback loops was particularly poignant and instructive. I have an observation as well that the Balkanization of the US is well under way aided by many factors you have listed and others such as economic inequality the coming collapse of globalization. This is of course not limited to just our continent. Eventually there will be no coherent union , no sharing of common purpose. Our future will be a localized future whether we embrace it or not. Longtime readers of JMG will be better equipped to deal with this end of empire and economic and social disintegration than the clueless multitudes. It is important to try to get the word out to the clueless but that task is notoriously difficult because of the mental boxes that we construct and live within. The sad part is that almost no one is talking about the barren landscape of our culture except you. The only discussions are economic ones. A slow or fast or stairstep collapse is upon us and it will drag down the popular culture. It is hard to wonder about Lady Gaga and her curlies when your stomach is growling and the room is cold and dark.<br><br><a href=#c4976650873865549785 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 9:00 AM</a><br><br>

We have no television or magazines, and only rarely listen to public radio (can`t stand the ads on private radio), so we are about as disconnected as it gets from pop culture. I find if I pick up a Cosmo or similar ladies` magazine, I instantly start to feel fat and ugly, despite being an intelligent, decent-looking, and generally self-confident person. It is amazing how `the machine` markets stuff by creating feelings of inadequacy in pop culture consumers. And that is just an hour with one magazine. I can`t imagine how anyone could feel good about themselves or satisfied with their lifestyle if they watched hours of TV every day. I think my withdrawal from pop culture is what has allowed me the mental space to do `untrendy` things like move to a homestead, follow creative pursuits, and be constantly learning and exploring new things. My husband and I read a ton, play board games, and actually talk to each other frequently. I think I am a happier person for it, as well as being more skilled and productive on all levels. I believe it is critically important to monitor what is going into your brain, as it affects not only what you think about, but how you think overall. <br><br>I enjoy reading your blog precisely because it offers a new way of thinking about some thorny problems (peak oil, societal decline) that I had already been grappling with, and a different framework (as opposed to the catastrophic sudden collapse crew) for understanding the problems and potential solutions.

The book was The Worst Hard Time, which was roughly a collection of oral histories about the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. The library hosted a talk by the author and displayed photographs of dust storms and the hard life of those who stayed on the Plains during the period. I thought that was a great program based on the selection, but the previous book was Rocket Boys, and I sat that one out.<br><br>Second, the dumping of pop culture is excellent and well under way for us. My last library trips and used bookstore purchases have all yielded finds older than I am, except for the homebrew book that goes into depth on malting. Taking the "read something older than you" concept a bit further, we're practicing the experience of older technologies. Reading old books by lamplight, cooking a homegrown meal over the woodstove and hosting "19th century nights" where friends join us for dinner, games, and singing with the electricity shut off. With any luck, the pleasure of such experiences will help communicate some aspects of the long descent to folks who aren't interested in having the conversation about peak oil, etc.<br><br>Great post, by the way.

A bunch of us were sitting around in a hotel room, having a lively conversation about the prospects for space colonization and nanotechnology and whatnot, when somebody turned on the TV set with the sound turned all the way down and the channel tuned to a null station. So, there was only silent "snow" on the screen. <br><br>Within a few minutes, the conversation had mostly died out, and several of us were simply staring at the screen.

I don't find much concern about the cultural impact (as in a nuclear explosion) of these tiny bits of glass which execute billions of operations per second with essentially total accuracy. It is ironic in the extreme that at the same time our thinkers have declared "formal logic" a dead end in the pursuit of truth we have collectively rigged our society to run on machines driven by this very method. It is no wonder we are being starved of "meaning." Our machines have no use for it. It doesn't drive sales and it doesn't capture eyeballs.<br><br>We live in a man-machine chimera. Our machines are not independently "alive." But the combination of humans and machines in the corporate chimera is very much alive and functions with all the fierce intensity of a predatory amoeba - and on about the same timeline. "What have you done for me this quarter?" is the question on every stock holder's lips. And we wonder why corporations trash the future for short term profits?<br><br>This will come to a bad end but on the way the genie of computation will grant us our wishes just so long as they can be expressed in a language of syntax devoid of semantics. It is precisely this substitution that marks the death of "meaning."<br><br>Steven Talbot wrote a very provocative book called, "The Future does not Compute." It was largely overlooked since it criticized the role of computers in modern society. But I found his arguments quite convincing and I highly recommend it to the readers of this blog. The full version can be found at www.netfuture.org/fdnc/ .<br><br>Talbot, an editor at Oreilly books, at the time he wrote this in 1995, eventually quit his position of editing high tech books and now lives in upstate New York pretty much off the grid. He ate his own cooking and I applaud him for it.<br><br>Autonomous Technology, a book written way back in 1977 by a then young Langdon Winner is a well written prophetic analysis of the political implications of our every expanding technologies.<br><br>All the forces I see around me are intent on destroying our humanity, such as it is. I'm not a teary eyed sentimentalist when it comes to the past. I think we're pretty bad animals overall - chimps on steroids. But the deadly life form of machine and human that we call the corporation makes us look like angels.<br><br>Unlike JMG, however, I see this as a predicament or pickle and not a problem.

From the 'less is more' dept. An example: I commute to work and have for a long time listened to audiobooks. I've also for some time resisted joining one of the audiobook sites like audible.com--with a very wide range of choices--instead limiting myself to my local library's small but admirable collection. There have been many occasions where I've not found anything I'd thought I'd "wanted." Since I MUST have an audiobook, though, on such occasions I just "settle" for something I wouldn't have thought to get were I not forced to it by the relative scarcity. To my delight what I've found is that this scarcity occasioned serendipity has turned me on to some wonderful reads that I never would have experienced had I been able always to get my way, to have my consumer choice honored. Now I've come to expect it, and in a way opened myself to a perpetually rewarding audiobook serendipity. <br><br>I offer this as an example of how a salvage context and mentality--premised upon material scarcity--can occasion fecundity. So scarcity is not simply a lack, a negative, but it also can be generative. I think of all our consumer choices, all our tv channels, websites, etc., in short, all this 'getting what we want', and how the range of choice actually debilitates. That South Cumberland Library, as limited as it is, BECAUSE of that limitedness, has perhaps more generative power than a day surfing the web. (So depressing to think that libraries are themselves complicit in degrading their own singular capacity by so ruthlessly "weeding" the older, non-shiny items.) I wonder if post-collapse our mentality might be jolted out of its accustomed shape in part by repeated experiences of serendipity of this kind. Salvage as salvation!

(Just to be clear, I do not mean this as touting an oppressive, authoritarian, Orwell-speak "family values" meme; and I do understand that some dysfunctional families must be escaped.) Maintaining a vital family culture, as my extended family does, seems almost subversive to me. It's something we all value and work to keep going. <br><br>To reference more old sf--<i>Farenheit 451</i>. Reading serious books on your own--whether literature, history, philosophy, or whatever else--is nearly always a subversive activity.

Trying to articulate the "mythos" then and now I come up with ideas like "civics" versus "consumerism" (a favorite Nader paradox since he really invented the latter term but was a proponent of the former). Our "family values" have been dissected by Lakoff into "strict father" or "nurturing mother" motifs, both coming from long Judeo-Christian traditions, but now being selectively appropriated by political interests for there own ends. There are also the myths of the "rugged individual" and the "renaissance man" competing for our brains and brawn. I'm sure other broadly shared mythos dichotomies could be listed as well. Where we collectively lie on these extremes of position sets the tone for the society we live in. The country seem to be lurching toward an anti-intellectual rugged-individual strict-father consumerism, with clarity you would expect from such a perspective.<br><br><a href=#c514184321196832787 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 10:41 AM</a><br><br>

Your post inspired me to drop by my local library while in town on errands and I picked up both Asimov's Foundation Trilogy and Norton's Brother to Shadows. I met Asimov a couple of times in NYC in '75 - a really nice old gentleman, no matter how hard he tried to act like a dirty old man. LOL. His business card read "Isaac Asimov, Natural Resource" - seriously! <br><br>@Night Tripper: <i>We live in an age with more writers and writing than has probably ever existed, and yet we still are unable to learn from or appreciate the myriad of voices.</i><br>Yes – it’s discouraging and appalling how many writers I come across (once I mention I’m a professional writer) who don’t read!

I know it does take you out of the mainstream (even in middle age, I feel some of that sting, as the gals sit around chatting about the latest “House”) but like you, having grown up with my own internal “movies”, I prefer reading (and heck, writing my own!) to the now transparently consumer-enticing commercial media.<br><br><i>I'm amazed how few people are bothered by TV in public spaces the way I am.</i> Amen!! I can’t believe there are tvs in restaurants (I won’t go there) and just about every public space – do people not see the propaganda, or see how that makes them dependent on non-neutral sources to handle their moments of boredom?

Thank you. <br><br>Rev. Brad, of course you're quite right -- the internet is by its nature a better medium for blather than for serious thought. Thirty years ago I'd have published these essays as articles in a magazine, and they'd have been better for the attentions of an editor. Still, it's the medium I have available to me right now, and so I do my best. <br><br>Ghung, thank you. That's an old fave. <br><br>Andrew, that's a great story! I have a lot of penguins on the spines of books in my collection. <br><br>Craig, fortunately most of the human race can't afford cyborgization, and the number who can afford it is going to decline precipitously. At this point it's simply a matter of saving as much as possible while the wave crests and recedes. <br><br>Goedeck, who on earth is AKR? As far as Tolkien, though, no arguments there; I read the trilogy for the first time at age ten, and used to sign junior high school yearbooks in fluent Elvish. <br><br>LasTablas, thanks for the reminder! It's been way too long since I've read Pascal. <br><br>Wall, I'd say commercialization rather than professionalization -- the transformation of writing from an art, or even a craft, to the mass production of popular product. <br><br>Clarence, I was born in '62, thus had to wait a few years before reading L'Engle, but that was a major fave of mine -- also the novels of Joan North, who wrote a very similar kind of thing from an English viewpoint. You're quite right about heading into the twilight; it's a very challenging thing to face, but it's the hand we've been dealt and we might as well play it as best we can. <br><br>Paula, one of the things that's occurred to me more than once is that those of us who are collecting personal libraries now have some say about what will happen to those libraries when we're gone. The return of the old private lending library is by no means a bad idea. <br><br>Beneath, agreed!

The thing I'd stress here is that denial is self-limiting; sooner or later, the thing you're denying rises up and eats you. <br><br>SunsetSu, the challenge there is that movies simply aren't to be had on a sturdy medium. DVDs and video tapes have a limited shelf life, and digital storage -- well, it lasts until the statistically inevitable accident. If the old movies are to be saved -- and I agree, it's worth doing -- somebody's going to have to put some serious work into devising a medium that's stable over the long term and can be used in the absence of high tech. A tall order; I hope somebody's up for it. <br><br>tOm, you're entitled to your opinion, but I hardly think you've made much of a case. By the way, without looking it up on the internet, do you know the source of the phrase "O tempora, o mores"? Because it fits what I'm saying a good deal more than it does your comment...<br><br>Les, I've never read Brillat-Savarin, and obviously need to remedy that! As for Darwin, though, no argument there at all. <i>The Voyage of the Beagle</i> is a classic -- and I wish that everyone who wants to say something about evolution, from the atheists through the New Agers to the creationists, could be made to sit down and read <i>The Origin of Species</i> first so they have some idea what the word means. <br><br>Spartiate, no, they don't -- they keep books as computer files. By all means print out a single copy of the books you care about on archival paper -- it's exactly steps like that that will make it possible for those books to survive. <br><br>Kevin, limited editions on archival paper are one good option. Stone is no doubt another, though it's slow. Me, I've basically come to terms with the fact that odds are not one word I write in my lifetime will make it through the dark age ahead of us, and am focusing on making my writings do what good they can before they recycle themselves into humus. <br><br>Rich, good. We'll be talking about that at some length in a future post. <br><br>Avery, very nicely put. We'll be talking about the gospel according to Carl Sagan quite soon, too. <br><br>Jbucks, good question. It strikes close to home, too, because I write for a living; it's not just a hobby for me, it's how I pay my bills, and that means that to some extent I end up feeding the beast. The challenge is always one of figuring out what I can get paid for that doesn't amount to whoring my pen. <br><br>Carp, you didn't see me sweating blood while writing it. The Wolfe series is <i>The Book of the New Sun</i>, and yes, it's a very elegant, thoughtful series!<br><br>Dode, the fascinating thing about Klein's "disaster capitalism" is that it's another good example of how the rich are cutting their own throats -- by the pursuit of maximum profit in the short term, they've produced conditions that wreck the system that guarantees those profits.

I've mentioned the shortlived TV series <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom_(TV_series) rel=nofollow>Max Headroom, @1987,</a> a couple of times. I'm sure that it was cancelled because it hit much too close to reality for the mainstream:<br><br><i>"Max Headroom was the first cyberpunk series to run in the United States on one of the main broadcast networks in prime time, although it was not tagged with that label until some time after its cancellation. Like other science fiction, the series introduced the general public to new ideas in the form of cyberpunk themes and social issues. The series portrayed the Blanks, a counter-culture group of people who lived without any official numbers or documentation for the sake of privacy. Various episodes delved into issues like literacy and the lack thereof in a TV-dominated culture (for example, in the episode "Body Banks", Blank Reg says: "It's a book. It's a non-volatile storage medium. It's very rare. You should 'ave one."

The immense heap of debt is only part of it. More on this in an upcoming series of posts. <br><br>Thijs, well, I didn't mean the rule of thumb as a universal principle, just as a way to get people thinking about something most people nowadays never think about at all -- namely, that someone might have done something interesting in the past. The politician you mention...oog. In the Netherlands, of all places, "when I hear the word 'culture,' I reach for my gun" ought to have a certain uncomfortable resonance!<br><br>Galeandra, good question. The people in Hoovervilles, most of them, came out of a society that had a strong respect for learning and relatively good schools. The inhabitants of tomorrow's Obamavilles, or Perryvilles, or whatever they get called won't have those advantages. It's an open question what they'll be able to do. <br><br>Russell, well, "paradigm" is one highly misused word these days. I'm less interested in "paradigm shifts" than in the ability to consciously consider the narratives one is thinking with, and recognize that narratives aren't true or false, just more or less useful. <br><br>Phil, yes, this is one of the things I had in mind when I wrote about the rich cutting their own throats. The more the upper class tries to maintain its own lifestyle on the backs of the poor, the more frequently explosions are going to happen, and the more likely they are to turn into violent uprisings that will shred what's left of the British economy. Really, it's just plain dumb. <br><br>Russ, in my experience the people who say they're just watching TV to get a laugh are staring at the screen for four to six hours a day like most other Americans, and have just as much popular culture in their heads. Try taking a break from TV and see what it does for your mind!<br><br>Caaleros, as I'm not a Christian I don't feel qualified to judge, but I certainly see a lot of people who call themselves Christians who are busily casting the first stone, praying loudly in public ("they have their reward"), and otherwise doing things Jesus criticized in no uncertain terms. <br><br>Flameskb, what's the book? I always wanted to find out more about the legends, and never found a source -- just Seredy's all-too-brief book. <br><br>Nisarga, the <a href=http://www.greenwizards.org rel=nofollow>Green Wizards forum</a> is probably the place to ask about that. <br><br>Jlg, if you've got something useful to do with a TV, by all means; just don't watch TV on it. A mandolin and a resonator guitar definitely count, too. <br><br>Jason, the situation does vary from country to country -- though I hear that "Care Bear" is spelled "Teletubby" on your side of the pond.

Books like "The Outsider" by Wright and some of the history around the Beats and much of Arthur Miller and the lesser read works of Steinbeck are all very entertaining and informative. I could easily see a McCarthy-type reaction coming even stronger to these shores in short-order...even worse than the Patriot Act and the anit-Muslim sentiment. <br><br>2) I might recommend that people check out some of the newer translations of classic works: whether its Dostoevsky or the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali, new translations are often much more accurate that the first attempts made earlier in the 20th century at bringing these masterpieces into English.<br><br><a href=#c8471187990246545359 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 12:09 PM</a><br><br>

There's probably 1 in 3 words they don't understand (their first language is not English) but I think they appreciate the ambiguities and relative complexity, as well as the slower pace of the narrative. By contrast, all of the other mush they are exposed to on TV seems like candy floss on a plastic stick.<br><br>To carry forward a theme of one of your recent posts, older books are less 'efficient' with their narrative. And that's a good thing, I think.<br><br>Our next book is Beowulf.*<br><br>Like Craig, I too sometimes feel a bit like an antique at 39. I am, by nature, quite an ironic type, but I have found in recent years that younger people are quite incapable of understanding this kind of humour, so now I tend to only be myself with people older than me. If I use irony at all I have to make it explicit ... which kind of defeats the object.<br><br>Until fairly recently I worked in an office employing an assortment of youngish people in journalism. What I found was (and I hope nobody reading takes this the wrong way) generally speaking the Americans I ended up employing looked great on paper, were the most well presented, bright eyed and bushy tailed etc, but when it came down to the actual work they were like newborn babies, with quite shocking holes in basic, really basic, general knowledge. <br><br>These were basically intelligent and hard working people who somehow seemed to know all the right words to use to get them a job but beyond that seemed to have skipped education almost entirely. <br><br>That's not to say that the same forces that caused this effect are not at work here in Europe - where America leads we tend to follow.<br><br>Anyway, I'm having a hard time convincing people that the data storage media they now use won't be around forever. Most people seem to think that information will increasingly be 'on tap' and that books are outdated.

You've provided a good example of the breakdown of communication I discussed in my post; what to you looks like Caesar taking your money looks to me like the people of a still more or less democratic republic voting to put a fairly small fraction of their tax dollars to work helping the poor. Most people in the blue states donate less to private charities because most of their gifts to the poor go by way of the state government, and majorities in the blue states support that. <br><br>Still, my point wasn't really to rehash that cultural divide, which will probably be solved only by devolving such arrangements to the states (as the Constitution arguably mandates), and it certainly wasn't to stereotype anybody, Christian or otherwise. It's simply that the marriage of convenience between morally conservative Christians and a Republican party dominated by the atheist (and vocally anti-Christian) ideology of Ayn Rand seems profoundly incoherent to me. <br><br>Bill, I find that it's easier for me simply to be an active member of a couple of local community groups with a broadly based membership, and listen much more than I talk, to keep track of what people are thinking locally. <br><br>Tiago, excellent. Yes, it does come with a price, but then wizards are always outsiders.<br><br>Dowsergirl, I've heard from a number of librarians here, and I keep on wondering whether finding some way to start and run a small subscription library of the Ben Franklin sort, to provide books that matter to the people who want access to them, might be one way of dealing with the debasement of public libraries. It's something that specialized groups have managed successfully all along -- I used to belong to a Theosophical library in Seattle and a metaphysical library in Ashland OR. Professional librarians such as yourself would be the obvious people to start such a project. <br><br>Sgage, thank you. <br><br>Hawlkeye, excellent! I didn't own a gun the day I dropped my TV two stories into that dumpster, but it was a delightful experience. A sledgehammer, good face protection and sturdy gloves also have their proponents.

I, finally, convinced my girls to stop checking them out, figuring at some point, the library would do just what you've said, and the books would end up in the Book Shed out back, and then, we could buy them for a dollar per book.<br><br>I'm on the Board of Directors at the library, and recently, a gentleman in the community offered to donate his very valuable, very extensive collection of rare (old) books to the library, but the library had to decline the offer, because he didn't want them to sell the books, but the library had no place to store them. <br><br>Such a shame, as more and more the offerings on the shelves are too much of that "shiny, flashy" modern ... pablum covered white bread.<br><br><a href=#c9221674718746076183 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 12:38 PM</a><br><br>

My friend is a big fan of technology and uses pop culture to "keep people interested" in her sermons. I take a more traditional storyteller's approach, but both of us struggle with the question of one might best communicate ANY cultural narrative to ANY audience in such a way that that community may draw upon the myth's wisdom to build their "common sense" life together.<br><br>I used to get together regularly with a couple involved with the leadership of a Pagan congregation. While I admired (coveted?) their rich array of sense-awakening rituals, they longed for something resembling the sermons in my progressive Christian congregation! Why? Because, while many people were attracted to their congregation by the ritual acts of mythic re-embodiment, there was no regular "teaching time" in which leaders could link myths to the ethics of daily life. Thus, when ethical issues arose in their congregation, they found it very difficult to achieve any shared understanding of the most health- or life-giving ways to address those issues as a community.<br><br>Another angle on the problem of shared meaning: I belong to a denomination (United Church of Christ) that rejects creeds and other "tests of faith" due to their historical use/abuse as tools of control and exclusion. Without a unifying creed, our denomination struggles to figure out how we tell our own story in a way that doesn't exclude anyone. We constantly are challenged to re-evaluate, listen to others, and adjust our language/storytelling accordingly. <br><br>I understand why more conservative followers of various faiths tend to cling to the idea of one "true and unchanging" story, even (especially?) when that story doesn't mesh well with the zeitgeist. It is "conservative" in the sense of "requires less energy to operate." It's certainly less exhausting than the work of fielding all these competing narratives and those vicious feedback loops while we attempt to further our communities' mythic/ethical conversations!<br><br><a href=#c7658085334859878411 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 12:54 PM</a><br><br>

It took me awhile to tumble to the fact that it was an actual genre.<br><br>How does popular culture filter in? I haven't had "TV" in years.

I’ve lived through the proliferation of art and craft supplies and self-publishing options, such that every other person I meet seems to be trying to make a career out of creativity! There’s only so much art people will buy, folks – and that goes for writing, too. I am sure that as the economy slumps, there will be fewer who are able to be “professionals” in the creative fields, and only through catering to the ultra-wealthy who’ll be able to afford it. I’m trying to find a balance in my own life: not count on creativity to make me a living, but still enjoy doing it and sharing it and getting paid occasionally. :-} <br><br>@BillP: <i>…you still might need to know what that torch-wielding mob marching down the road past your retreat in the middle of the night have on their minds...</i> Probably nothing, if they’ve become part of a mob. ;-)<br>I understand the theory of staying in touch with pop culture, but the cost in ads ingested is too high – I’d rather talk with some of those neighbors and ask them what they’re thinking and seeing – that way I’m actually relating, not consuming.<br><br>@Yupped: <i>But if you send your kids to public schools you’re going to be fighting a losing battle, because the endless stimulation/marketing/consumption-training wagon will catch up with your kids pretty quickly in the schools.</i><br>Yes, we have begun a mass experiment (well – not experiment; <b>that</b> would have had parameters. This is a free-for-all) with children’s minds. (beginning with my generation, I might add). No longer just getting what their parents, teachers and churches want them to have, kids have basically uncontrolled access to anything, and a lot of it. There are plusses and minuses to this. It remains to be seen what such uncontrolled input has on an adult’s ability to form a functional society. <br><br><i>Where I’m more optimistic, in a weird sort of way, is that I’ve seen with my kids and their friends how unsatisfying it all is to them, how they embrace the culture on one level but know that it really isn’t going to work, that something’s really wrong with it.</i><br>Yeah!

Not Miss Wells, Miss Bauman- but same scenario – moved in 4th grade to a town with a library around the corner; it was my salvation til I got to high school, and I was one of very, very few kids who was allowed into the adult section (literally, you weren’t allow to go over there) because all the librarians knew me and knew that by 7th grade I had read pretty much the whole children’s section! :-) I discovered Rabinadrath Tagore in 8th grade and it blew my mind.

I think I've extracted myself from that but I still watch the odd TV programme, to keep my wife company - I just can't see her willingly giving up her evenings in front of the telly, despite the dross that passes for entertainment.<br><br>A couple of things earlier on in your post perhaps coloured my view of it. Your seeming impatience with those who use modern meanings of words, rather than the meanings you wanted those words to retain, is a bit pointless. If people generally think of myths in a different way to you, then go use different words to convey the meaning you want.<br><br>The other point was the veiled attack on non-believers. It is akin to those claiming to hold religious beliefs who rail at non-theists, trying to argue that no belief is the same as a belief in the lack of a deity or deities. Your position seems to be that one should never argue against the beliefs of others, regardless of what those beliefs may cause others to do (or not do).

My guess is that it's more important that kids encounter something other than pop culture than to keep them entirely out from its grip -- though if you can do the latter, good. <br><br>Justin, thank you. I thought it was all too typical when the Seattle Public Library built their new (and stunningly hideous) library downtown, and all the nonfiction stacks went into a middle section that's very difficult to reach from the main floor. It's as though all the facts had to be hidden. <br><br>Twilight, my take is a little different. I agree that the countervailing forces that made the Roosevelt compromise possible aren't there this time around, and it will take a long age of troubles -- like the one that extended from 1873 to the 1930s, which generated the last set -- to generate a new set. Factor in the end of US global hegemony and the end of cheap abundant energy, and you have a long harsh period of economic volatility and rank injustice. In all probability the US will not survive that period as a single nation, and large sections of it may enter the category of failed states. More on this -- much more -- in a series of posts to come. <br><br>Luke, er, you've just demonstrated one of my points, which is that a lack of knowledge of history makes many current assumptions nonsense. There's absolutely nothing new about the open source movement -- that sort of thing has been going on in avant-garde circles for generations; check out the way that organic gardening developed in the 1970s, for one example out of thousands -- and the internet and computers were not invented by geeks on their own nickel; both of them were massively funded by the US government and benefited from the massed technical expertise of huge corporations and government think tanks. Neither one became geekware until the emergence of the microcomputer and public internet access in the 1980s and 1990s respectively. <br><br>That being said, of course there are still some worthwhile things being created and invented today; I didn't say that there weren't. I simply suggested that those people who didn't already have a good idea of where to look for worthwhile reading material might want to check out things from before they were born; it's a simple and useful heuristic, but by no means the only one worth trying. <br><br>Bob, there again, I never said that there wasn't anything worth reading, watching, or listening to in current production; after all, I'd like people to read my books, too! <br><br>Justin, I must be more oblivious than most, then, as the most I know about <i>Jersey Shore</i> is that it's on TV -- I think. The faces and names I see on tabloids while checking out at the local grocery store are almost all a complete mystery to me. (What, for example, is a Kardashian, and why should I care?) <br><br>Mustard, thanks for the link! It's way too profound not to give to kids -- they're at an age where epigrammatic wisdom can sink deep. <br><br>Peacegarden, thank you. With me it was a whole series of librarians at the public libraries in the various south Seattle suburbs where I spent my childhood -- libraries, by the way, that were massively expanded when I was quite young, due to a major social-funding program pushed through by a liberal Republican governor. (Washington state had lots of liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats in those days; I wish there were some around now.) <br><br>Brad K., Jim Kjelgaard! Now there's a name that brings back memories. <i>Swamp Cat</i> was my favorite of his, back in the day; I first read it in the children's library of Eastern Washington State College (as it was then), where my parents were doing summer school, on a hot dry day with no shade anywhere.<br><br><a href=#c7833075811248779152 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 3:36 PM</a><br><br>

Still, you're quite right that America as it's imagined these days is not long for the world.

Maintaining so complex a society requires fantastic amounts of labor. As things wind down, there may be more spare time rather than less. <br><br>Villager, bailing out of popular culture isn't going to end popular culture; that's going to happen as the economic machine grinds to a halt due to fossil fuel depletion. What bailing out of popular culture will do is improve your capacity to respond to a very challenging future, so you can do something other than look mournfully at the camera and wave goodbye, a la Wile E. Coyote, when crunch time comes. <br><br>Mtheirauf, as the Declaration of Independence puts it, governments are instituted to preserve life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. None of that can be done for free, and so all societies require their members to chip in to cover the costs of maintaining public order and other public goods. The right to own private property is one of the major goods provided by the rule of law, and since the benefit that people receive from this corresponds to the amount that they own, it's both fair and generally accepted that how much you chip in depends on your ability to pay. <br><br>When a political system charges the rich a smaller portion of their imcome in taxes than it does the poor, accordingly, that system is conferring a free ride on the rich. Both US parties currently do this, which is why, for example, Warren Buffet pays a significantly smaller fraction of his income in taxes than I pay of mine. This is aside from the huge direct and indirect subsidies that the federal government pays for the benefit of big business, whether in the form of massively padded defense contracts or "mortgage insurance" that's basically a way of transferring tax dollars to very large banks, or any of the many other examples. <br><br>David, I've had the same experience with a small town library system -- I've ended up reading books I probably would never have picked up, and benefited from it. <br><br>Raven, well, I'm not going to get too deep into theology. ;-)<br><br>Nox, no, I hadn't heard of him.

Of course it's an important one, but there's only so much room in any single blog post. <br><br>Project Director, before you start making accusations about selective quoting from scripture, maybe you should reread the gospels and count how many times Jesus criticized the accumulation of wealth, as compared to the number of times he discussed such current preoccupations of the Right as, say, other people's sexual behavior.

Not that that's a good thing, just a necessary one. <br><br>Gary, one of the useful habits passed down in the modern Druid tradition is the idea that any binary is always in need of a third factor to bring it into balance. Those readers who have been following this blog for a while know already that that's a lot of what I'm trying to do. I'd encourage you (and anyone else interested) to take any of the binaries you've listed, find a third position, and try it out -- there's much to be gained by that. <br><br>Cathy, enjoy!<br><br>Dowsergirl, I think she's a Kardashian or something. <br><br>Ghung, oh, granted, there's still going to be the occasional gem. Again, going to the old stuff is a helpful heuristic, not a hard and fast rule. <br><br>DPW, two excellent points. Thank you. <br><br>Jason, most young Americans only know how to pass tests. That's literally all they're taught in school. So, no, you're not being biased. As for the Hobbit, it started out as stories told to children, and I've yet to hear of a child who didn't become entranced by it when it was read aloud. Have you ever heard a recording of Yolkien himself reading it? Stunningly good. <br><br>Greg, thank you for the link!<br><br>Carp, not a problem. Sometimes the Awen does flow, and sometimes it sits there and challenges me to reach for it. <br><br>Mtheirauf, given that it was a brief aside in a post on a different topic, no, I didn't pile up examples and footnotes. You can find those in detail in my book <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/W/The-Wealth-of-Nature rel=nofollow>The Wealth of Nature</a>, and the subject will also be covered from a different angle in a future book of mine that's tentatively titled <i>Empire's End: The Twilight of Global Hegemony and the Future of American Democracy</i>. <br><br>Wendy, that's another of the situations that just begs for somebody to set up a private lending library with a modest subscription fee. It used to be a very standard thing in this country and elsewhere, and it's free from many of the difficulties of dependence on public funding. <br><br>Mainecelt, I've often wondered why your end of Christianity doesn't avail itself of the huge wealth of sacramental ritual that's part of the Christian heritage. Frankly, it makes a great deal of Pagan ritualism look very pallid by comparison. I have friends in the independent Christian sacramental movement who have done all kinds of creative (and highly respectful) things with the ancient sacramenta and other traditional practices, but I don't know of anybody in the liberal denominations who's doing so. What gives? <br><br>Professor, as Toynbee points out, it's exactly in periods of chaos and disintegration that new myths and new religious forms take shape. Not only can we think in such terms, we pretty much have to, or nothing we do is going to go far. As for your final question, every decline and fall is different the way every childhood is different; the same broad transformations, but with infinite variation in detail.<br><br><a href=#c8845405456258399843 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 4:49 PM</a><br><br>

It was a children's book with the unfortunate title of "Grandpa Bunny-Bunny". I guess I got hold of it when I was about 5.<br><br>The illustrations were, as I remember, better than those in any other book in my collection. (I might have a different opinion if I saw them today, but the important thing was that they were compelling to a 5 year old kid.) But the story was what was remarkable.<br><br>Grandpa Bunny-Bunny was an artist. He got his start, as so many young rabbits did in children's books back then, painting Easter eggs. He was really good at it, and as he got older he started teaching other rabbits. He and his little students branched out when Easter eggs were no longer enough. They painted the colors on flowers, shadows on snowbanks, the dewdrops on grass in the morning, autumn colors on leaves. As he grew older, he became a better teacher and a better artist. He taught generations of artistic rabbits to be as good as their heart and talent would allow. They all had creative roles to play, creative responsibilities in throughout the year.<br><br>Eventually Grandpa Bunny-Bunny got very old. One day he told his students that he would teach no more, but that they were invited to watch him paint his masterwork. They assembled late in the day, and he painted the entire western sky with the most brilliant sunset that anyone had ever seen. Then he walked quietly into the heart of it and was gone.<br><br>Looking back, I'm gobsmacked that a story like that ever made it into a children's book. Art, life, responsibility, creative participation, transcendence and death... I'm sure that story, which I'd forgotten about for most of my life, had a big role in shaping my heart and soul and creating meaning in my life. If this isn't Myth in a very pure form I don't know what it might be. <br><br>I wonder if there's a single child in this world who has a copy of that book to read now.<br><br><a href=#c7495789080661149792 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 5:07 PM</a><br><br>

What astounds me is that if Alan Greenspan, as the front of the private bank cartel (Rothschilds, Warburgs, Rockefellers, Kissinger) say "health sciences," then to me there should be FREE health science courses at zero cost.

I myself have often bemoaned to my friends the destruction of meaning -- "liberal" and "conservative" mean nothing these days besides gang colors -- somebody can call himself an "environmentalist" these days explicitly because he's in favor of nuclear power instead of fossils, etc. ...but in all fairness, that's not my original observation, it's hardly new, after all it was George Orwell whose character Winston Smith was working in an office whose explicit mission was to destroy the meanings of words. <br><br>@Petro, and JMG: I believe the quotation Petro was looking for is the following:<br>"The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy: that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness." --John Kenneth Galbraith<br><br>Unfortunately this quote is politically partisan, so it probably doesn't serve Petro's goal of reining-in all philosophers neutrally. <br><br>Because JK Galbraith was a professional economist (sometimes people say he was the first "rock-star economist," a seat Paul Krugman currently holds), he didn't seem to truck much with real philosophy per-se.

Those who hold religious beliefs, on the other hand often claim to be guided by some invisible hand or mouth (or that their country is protected thereby), and that is qualitatively different, I think.

To be fair, I'm a good deal fonder of Plotinus and Proclus, who had the great good sense to ditch Plato's politics and refocus the tradition on the transformation of the individual, but please don't dismiss Platonism on the basis of a movement of clueless modern academics driven by a lust for unearned power and suffering from severe delusions of adequacy.

They in one family seem to sum up the epitome of the contemporary cult of non-personality. There's even a tie in to the O.J. Simpson trial -- sheesh. Seriously, I thought they were Star Trek characters for the longest time, too. <br><br>I approach all this from a sociological standpoint, I guess -- what is interesting is not the Kardashians <i>per se</i>, but the fact that they are what the American mind has decided is important right now. Sure we always distract ourselves with something vacuous or another; but the nature of that distraction/obsession changes quite a bit from one era to the next. It's usually a vivid reflection of our fears and our fantasies -- subconscious laid bare; naked id; shadows dragged into the daylight. Plus a heaping helping of the truth about our racial, class, gender, etc. stereotypes and deeply engrained "-isms." Just last night we were discussing the fact that when Tim McGraw unbuttoned his shirt 3/4 of the way or strutted around on stage in a tight tanktop, that made him a stud. Meanwhile when his wife Faith Hill similarly showed off her chest and wore a skirt that was just a hairs-breadth lower than her crotch, she got characterized with a different word that begins with "s" that is much less flattering (they are both superstar country singers, I should explain for this crowd!). <br><br>These are the reason I find it interesting to keep a small part of one ear turned towards pop culture. It sure as heck is not for entertainment purposes! <br><br>By the way, one thing I have noted in all this in recent years that may become very significant -- young men are feeling increasingly emasculated and at a loss to even identify what "masculine" is anymore.

So a thought for those 'conservative' commentators on this blog: much of the public health advances in the U.S., funded by taxpayer dollars, came about because the wealthy stood firmly behind them. They did so not out of altruism, but out of simple enlightened self interest. We do not live in this world alone. Cholera, for example, doesn't care if your neighbor is a lazy slob who doesn't maintain proper hygienic living - or if you are a hard-working, God-fearing person. It will multiply from the one, and pass itself on to the other.<br><br>If you don't believe in the rather radical liberalism preached by Jesus, and prefer, instead, the punitive Father approach of the Old Testament - you might want to give thought to the world you're willing to create for you and your children to live in, because there are consequences to choices. It's not really about what's right or wrong - sometimes, it's simply about what is.<br><br><a href=#c1871140659474888656 title="comment permalink">8/18/11, 10:49 PM</a><br><br>

Once I had my morning Pepsi it came to me that <i>American Beauty</i> was a riff on the Grail Legend.<br><br>Now, I got to sit in on a B&amp;N online chat with screen writer Alan Ball: he freely admitted that he had used the framework Joseph Campbell's <i>Hero With a Thousand Faces</i>, but he was as bemused as I was to find out it was a Grail story.

Perhaps it is pollution? I'm always surprised by how few people here mention the economic issues. It gets mainstream press here.<br><br>Unfortunately for me, since reading Basic Ecology per your earlier recommendation, I now see linkages with every action and I can't now pretend that I don't understand. Perhaps therein lies the power of the Green Wizard project? <br><br>Strong magic indeed! I finally understood your incantation a couple of weeks ago and have since been digesting upon it.<br><br>As an incidental too, although I'm an atheist I read the Bible out of interest about two decades ago and realised pretty quickly that most believers don't actually understand the messages in it. I always find it strange when people identify themselves as "krishtun" and think that it's enough just to go to Church once a year. People are simply tribal in nature - they need to identify with something. A survival instinct is to look for differences and I think that this is their motivation - the need to blend in.<br><br>By the way, Asimov foundation series has a place in my library here. Really enjoyed it, although if the place as burning down and I had to save a particular authors work I'd rescue my Jack Vance complete collection.

It reminds me greatly of a short book I just read called "The Abolition of Man" by CS Lewis. In this book Lewis similarly describes "the closed loop" referred to by JMG similarly as leaving the human Tao and having no reference points. The reason why I am referring to the CS Lewis book is in response to the sentence where you describe this as a "problem not a predicament" and therefore there is a solution. CS Lewis wrote "The Abolition of Man" in 1944 as he saw the use of language gradually change humankind's understanding of its own humanity. He postulated that if he was right than humankind would become extinct because it would have become something different by losing its anchor to the common Tao. I believe that JMG's post is describing this very thing, and that JMG only views it as a problem because he still personally understands what it is to be human (given his Druid tendencies). However I think CS Lewis is right and humankind is extinct, and that this post senses it somehow. It truly is a predicament of absolutely the first magnitude and there may not be a solution to it at all. In fact the idea that there can be a solution is probably just the myth of progress rearing its ugly head in this context.<br><br><a href=#c2095379833243840074 title="comment permalink">8/19/11, 5:25 AM</a><br><br>

(Although not well understood, these are actually two distinct things.)<br><br>If you read carefully, he actually stated that Democrats *copy* the Republican platform and thus are also Satanists. There are actually millions of self-described Christian Democrats in America, who are thus perpetrators of the same hypocrisy, but we don’t acknowledge Christian Democrats in polite society (i.e. the mainstream media).

During that time, I tried to quit numerous time, finally succeeding permanently after four years of constant effort. <br><br>I started watching television when I was around ten, but didn’t realize it was an addiction until my late twenties. I’ve been trying to quit that addiction ever since, but with only limited success. I’ve quit many times, once for a full six months, but have always gone back.<br><br>The similarities between the cigarette and television addictions are amazing. Whenever I managed to quit cigarettes for a month, I could feel my health returning - my strength, wind, and energy. Whenever I managed to quit television for more than two weeks, I could feel my mind’s health returning - my ability to focus and get things done. I always enjoyed noticing the white noise (jingles, Seinfeld jokes, etc) receding from my mind.<br><br>With cigarettes, it was “I’ll have just one today. That’s no problem, one won’t hurt me.” I’d be back to a pack a day within a week. With television, it was “I’ll watch just one PBS show. PBS is okay.” I’d be back to my 3-hour a day habit within a week.<br><br>I could give many more examples. It seems the only difference between the two addictions is that television is much harder to quit. <br><br>Thanks for your article. It reminded me that it’s been quite a while since I’ve tried to quit. Maybe I’ll succeed this time.<br><br><a href=#c6943406203211695633 title="comment permalink">8/19/11, 12:40 PM</a><br><br>

If you look at "The Meaning of Twilight" you can get a right-brain, archetypal view of how spot-on the popular culture is with the changing times, and how not-stupid it really is. A lot of it (including Twilight) isn't mindless, it's just less left-brain mind. Popular culture is speaking now more than ever through archetypes and symbolism, which is the important and vital role its playing. The appearance of zombies isn't just a reflection of lifeless brain-dead people... it's symbolic of the dead (the past you're talking about) being very much alive (to our detriment, even) and walking. <br><br>Your viewpoint to just turn the tv off and walk away is, to me, akin to a Democrat saying it's time to just turn the Republican view off and not pay attention to it anymore. Is that really going to work? A huge dilemma of our times, which nobody knows how to work through because we've never had to before (so it's nobody's fault right now), is how to live in a united world (literally!) where we can't just ignore the other side's opinion. Never before has the world been so united via consciousness. Trouble is, the left-brainers want everyone to follow what 'makes sense' which leaves right-brain awareness out of the picture. And the right-brain dominant popular culture really does need an appreciation for the left-brain at this point.<br><br>One of the important keys to the future is how to get important left-brain ideas into the popular culture, while also getting important right-brain sensibilties (which are arguably more important at this point) into the rigid left-brain consciousness.<br><br>I like reading your blog.

Typos beset us all. I'm reminded of a play I once saw at a SF convention of that fan classic, "The Enchanted Duplicator," in which the Typos were fierce monsters who had to be overcome by the hero in his quest to publish the perfect fanzine...<br><br>Bill, you and me both. <br><br>Tranquility, that was also the basis for the compromise of the 1930s. Henry Ford was hardly a nice person, but he had the brains to realize that if he didn't pay his workers enough to enable them to buy his cars, he was facing the same crisis of overproduction that was beggaring so many industrialists at that time. <br><br>Sophie, I never saw <i>American Beauty</i>, but I'm tolerably familiar with the <i>Roman de la Rose</i> and the Grail legends, so I'll take your word for it!<br><br>Sealander, there are whole warehouses full of copies of books that were supposed to be bestsellers and didn't make it. I sometimes wonder what future archeologists will make of those. <br><br>Cherokee, by all means save Vance! William Blake wasn't always so complimentary about Druids, either, but I'd save <i>Jerusalem</i> ahead of a lot of other things. <br><br>Chris, I'm familiar with that book, and indeed with most of Lewis -- he's far and away my favorite Christian author. Where I part company with him is simply that my take on history is cyclical; the phase of intellectual degeneration is a standard part of the cycle. As Vico pointed out a long time ago, the "barbarism of reflection" is a necessary part of how things wind down. <br><br>Rainbow, just wait a bit. Those same people will be whining at the top of their lungs about fairness when they're the ones getting the short end of the stick. <br><br>Blue Sun, thank you! The only answer I can give you is that I read quite a bit, in many different fields, and have cantankerous opinions in most of them. ;-) As for American Christianity, well, human beings are human beings, and I hope nobody's under the impression that I think everything would be different if 83% of us were Druids; the modern Druid movement's been around since the 18th century, which is long enough to get over the pleasant delusion that enthusiasm is the same thing as divine influence, and that people will stop acting like people when they change the set of metaphors they use to talk about religious experience. <br><br>Oh, and I'd suggest "running ourselves deeper into debt" for the subject of the recent fracas. Or perhaps "going broke." Something like "Obama and the GOP held another round of talks today on digging America deeper into the hole" just sounds better, somehow.<br><br>Gregorach, it was in 1984; nobody was recycling electronics at the time. These days I'd do something more responsible, I promise. <br><br>Mthierauf, I'm firmly opposed to central planning. It invariably benefits the rich and politically connected at the expense of everybody else. As for capitalists, the American variety these days aren't evil, just dumb as bricks -- as I pointed out in my post, pursuing short term profits at the expense of long term survival is not very bright, now is it? <br><br>Gregorach, I'll keep that in mind!<br><br>Zach, the Episcopal Church has massive problems of its own -- in some ways it's got all the drawbacks of being a liberal denomination and very few of the advantages. I'm simply thinking of the people I know in the independent sacramental movement, who have an extremely lively, flexible, and increasingly popular scene operating out of living rooms and rented spaces, having ditched the dogma, politics, and hierarchy and focused on the sacraments and personal spiritual experience. It's always seemed to me that that's a model liberal denominations could follow.<br><br><a href=#c2498832466466296785 title="comment permalink">8/19/11, 1:17 PM</a><br><br>

I've long thought that we were very close to the point at which people would be famous just because they were famous, and would-be celebrities would compete for being famous just by acting like celebrities rather than by doing anything worth celebrating. Apparently we're now there. <br><br>Ghung, well, when you don't have any other ideas, I suppose random symbolic gestures are better than sitting with your thumbs someplace uncomfortable. <br><br>Cvncvbn, well, that's something. On the other hand, 1.4 million sites reference the color of Lady Gaga's pubic hair. <br><br>Cathy, that's a classic. Jerry Mander's <i>Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television</i> may also be worth adding to the list. <br><br>Ben, thanks for the book recommendation -- and of course you're quite right; most of history doesn't make the kind of butt-viewing movies Americans like to watch. <br><br>Witter, Marie Winn years ago wrote a book called "The Plug-In Drug" about TV's narcotic and addictive effects. The best way to quit is not to have one in the house, by the way -- and make sure you have plenty of interesting things to do as an alternative. <br><br>Shawn, you know, it would really help if you would do some research into left brain/right brain issues instead of simply repeating a set of outdated popular cliches on the subject. Popular culture isn't noticeably "right brain" in any meaningful sense, and it's also -- as I pointed out in my post -- manufactured for the sole purpose of making money; that's the source of its mindless vacuity. As for <i>Twilight</i>, well, let's just say I'm not a fan and leave it at that. <br><br>Lewis, I have reams and reams and reams of good memories from the old Seattle downtown library, and the day they leveled it left a hole in my life. My wife and I left town for good not much more than a month after the new monstrosity opened; that wasn't the reason, but I was just as glad. <br><br>Stephen, it could indeed -- but I normally save suggestions so unspeakably radical for Druid email lists, where you can say such things out loud!<br><br><a href=#c3965013211303587796 title="comment permalink">8/19/11, 1:34 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, I cringe at some of the things Dawkins gets up to but at least he has detailed, in the rational way you do in this blog, the reasons why he would like to see an end to religious indoctrination. <br><br>In the end, militant anti-theists are only so because of theist beliefs, not, I think, because of their own non-beliefs. I don't think one can say that militant theists are only militant purely because of the beliefs of others, they have the word of their gods driving them on, instead, telling them that all people should live in one particular way. Of course, that way is different for each brand of theism.<br><br>I find it odd that you regard religion as an off-limits subject, when you are happy to plough into lots of controversial subjects and give your considered opinion on them. But religion you castigate and praise equally, but offer no real overall opinion on any of them. Is it part of our lives or not? Theistic religions generally place humans at the pinnacle of creation and as the dominator of all the rest of that creation. This narrative is, surely, partly the cause of the predicament we now face. To pre-empt a possible response, yes, there are certainly atheists who probably feel humans are the pinnacle of evolution, too, but that is not a core belief of atheists and is, in theory, subject to alteration by rational argument (i.e. if evolution is understood, it is clearly not true that humans are the ultimate evolved organism). Religious beliefs are not subject to rational argument.<br><br><a href=#c3181079530638713553 title="comment permalink">8/19/11, 2:45 PM</a><br><br>

The person reacts in one of two ways: he either makes a rash, impulsive decision; or he just shuts down and doesn’t act.<br> <br>When suffering from decision-fatigue, a person often takes whatever solution is offered – no matter how inappropriate - just to avoid forcing his exhausted brain to make another decision.

They have already decided that they are a liberal Democrat/conservative Republican, so any political message immediately fits into the proper left/right slot without further thought.<br> <br>So Americans can just sit on the couch and stare at the tube eating Ho-Ho’s and get on with the important work of getting really, really fat.<br><br>No further decisions necessary today.<br><br>Obviously, decision-fatigue isn’t the only political problem we’re facing.

That's been said for decades. Or, that people create popular culture to make money. Of course they do. Or reading a book older than you are. That's been said for as long as I've been alive. <br><br>I'm suggesting that there's a lot going on with popular culture that's important and shouldn't necessarily be dismissed just because you don't see it that way. <br><br>In the title of your post, the word "Twilight" is used, and it evokes a great deal of meaning on its own because of the meaning of twilight. You're addressing an important issue and you find the word "twilight" resonates with it, right? The popular culture series of the same name bears the same significance, just with a very different and very modern dialect. I'm not saying anyone has to be a fan, just that if people watch it from the perspective of what "twilight" means, it's very revealing -- but it's just spoken in a far more right-brain fashion. The symbolism of vampires is entirely apt, since in myth they come out at twilight, and I've read many of your blog posts in which I hear the same theme (the vampiric nature of the modern world) just expressed differently, expressed your way through your eyes. My point: it's the same theme. I can see the same points in the "Twilight" series that you address in your blog.<br><br>Popular culture is not as mindless as you make it out to be; it's just a different kind of mind and a different kind of voice. <br><br>Shawn<br><br><a href=#c4528702550190854548 title="comment permalink">8/19/11, 8:53 PM</a><br><br>

The cartoon was created to support a line of toys that Mattel, Incorporated was attempting to market in late 1985, which was pretty crass considering the toy-lines are usually created to support a media-based entertainment, for example the <i>Star Wars</i> toys every Gen-Xer can at least recall being advertised on television.<br><br>The creative people who were paid to make "JWW" into a cartoon-show actually did a halfway-decent job of turning it into something somewhat interesting and watchable. Back then, there were still some drops of real creativity remaining in the system. But however much the elementary-school kids of the Eighties might have appreciated "JWW", they didn't feel compelled to ask for the line of toys for which the series was created as Xmas presents. So when the sales figures for these toys proved to be disappointing, the cartoon-show was cancelled after just half a season of daily episodes. The whole crass thing, IMHO, really shows how the Eighties were the begining of the end with regard to the the unfortunate cultural trend about which you write here. Probably the only reason I find "JWW" even a little bit interesting is precisely the fact that it is such a relic of that misbegotten decade, and people in our culture do tend to be fascinated by the decade immediately prior to their age of majority.<br><br><a href=#c4440400480246483865 title="comment permalink">8/20/11, 6:51 AM</a><br><br>

Much to my delight, I have discovered a cluster of no fewer than three wonderful places within 4 miles of my new place. One of them, cash only, has the most extensive collection I've ever seen of old medical and electronics guidebooks from the first half of the twentieth century, and an extensive history and mythology section. Inspired by recent posts/comments here, I wound up purchasing a copy of Bulfinch's Mythology, and a book on Spanish expeditions/conquests in Mesoamerica and what is now the American southwest in the 16th and 17th centuries. They've entered my reading list, as soon as I get through its current pre-existing pile (another one of those people always carrying a book around here).<br><br>As for trying to publish things that large publishers won't go for... someone previously mentioned self-publishing e-books, but I think there's a similar option for actual print books. A company, Lulu.com, exists which will take an electronic manuscript and make it available to buy on their website. Upon someone purchasing a copy, they will print said copy on demand, bind it, and mail it out, the company and author each getting a cut. As near as I can tell there are some upfront overhead costs - the time to prepare the manuscript of course, and money for extras like cover design and formatting if you want it (but I think you don't have to use them). I've bought niche-market books from there which couldn't get traditional publishers (and one that was outright rejected by about 6 publishers as unpublishable). Might be worth looking into – not exactly stable in the longer run, but it exists now and could get print versions of some of your ideas out into the hands of those that want them and know they are to be had. Might be able to make a little money off those shelved science fiction manuscripts too - I know I would buy one, having read The Fires of Shalsha.<br><br><a href=#c6689738104072422488 title="comment permalink">8/20/11, 11:55 AM</a><br><br>

This is even true for some of the supposedly "most dangerous, instantly addictive" drugs like nicotine and cocaine. Based on what I saw in college in the 1980s, the large majority of people who used cocaine (i.e. the large majority of people) never even got close to becoming addicted to it. Similarly, there are likely far more perfectly healthy occasional drinkers than there are alcoholics. <br><br>I think you need to allow for individuality in relationship to pop culture and TV as well.

Please look more closely. <br><br>Donkey, I have to say that I find them about equally palatable! <br><br>Shawn, I didn't just say that you were repeating cliches; I said that you were repeating cliches based on shoddy popularizations of outdated brain research. As for the value of popular culture, well, obviously I disagree with you; your claim that consuming shoddy commercial product manufactured and marketed for the sole purpose of emptying your wallet is somehow good for you, to my mind, is like claiming that a regular Friday night hookup with a streetwalker is the same thing as a successful marriage. Still, by all means do as you wish; just don't expect me to follow, or to refrain from rolling my eyes. <br><br>Hadashi, I try to be entertaining!<br><br>Justin, I'd thought of it, but none of my old SF novels are in electronic format; all of them were written in the 80s and very early 90s, when publishers still wanted a typed copy, and that's the form they're in. They would also take a great deal of revising before I'd be willing to have them seen in public -- a quarter century of hard work as a nonfiction author has taught me more than a little about prose style!<br><br>Still, if I ever manage to get something close enough to a bestseller to clear what's left of my debts and take it easy for a while, I'd like to revisit some of them, and I also have several new novels I'd like to have the time to write: an anti-Tolkienesque epic fantasy, a rather philosophical piece full of sex and violence set in ancient Egypt, and the one I'd really like the time to do, a five volume science fiction epic sprawling over three centuries or so in Dark Age America. We'll see if I get the chance to do one or more of those. <br><br>Jason, oh, granted, Plato still has plenty to offer. I simply find the Pagan Neoplatonists more thoroughly rounded; they and their predecessors had the time to work through Plato and get the bugs out.

There are people here who still get together to play dominoes, pick guitars, paint, dance, sing, and write just in one little town.

We started just such a library only 2 months ago. It is called The Adocentyn Research Library, a Pagan library &amp; research center located in San Francisco’s East Bay. Six pagan elders are conjoining their books to form it. While we plan to grow into the premier Pagan research center in the Western US, we are starting small, with only about 13,000 books. Eventually we plan to have a non-profit organization to manage the Library. As a private subscription library, it will not lend out books though that could change in the future. We're still placing the bookcases and organizing the books. So it won't officially 'open' for several months.<br><br>Here is an explanation of how it got its name.<br> 'In the Hermetic dialogue called the Asclepius, Hermes Trismegistus prophesied that a time would come when the people would no longer worship Nature as a manifestation of the Divine and that the Gods would withdraw from Egypt to dwell in a city "to the furthest west from Egypt", leaving mankind to "the tyranny of the angels". Eventually, the Gods would venture out into the world again from this city, restoring the worship of Nature and the old wisdom.<br> The Picatrix identifies this city as "the City of Hermes" and names it "Adocentyn", based on the Latin ad occidentem or "to the West".'<br> <br> Similar libraries are forming in Delaware and Minnesota. Interestingly they both seem to be called the New Alexandrian Library. Our name was chosen to distinguish us from them. Regional specialty libraries seem to be already appearing. As you see some of us don't believe that books should all be digitized, although there are projects to do just that.<br><br>~ Glenn in Berkeley<br>(I'll figure out this comment section at some point.)<br><br><a href=#c8709285263342703046 title="comment permalink">8/20/11, 6:12 PM</a><br><br>

Not on the current topic, but related to earlier posts about old tools, I ran across a blog called retrotechnologist.blogspot.com. Deals with old typewriters, hand tool, radio gear, etc. Lists some sources and related blogs, photos of projects, etc. <br>Don Mason—your comment on decision fatigue reminded me of a Robin Williams film from 1984 called _Moscow on the Hudson_. Williams plays a Soviet circus performer who defects in NYC. The scene I have in mind finds him shopping for coffee in an American supermarket. He becomes so over whelmed by the choices available: regular, instant, French roast, decaf, whole bean, ground, etc., that he passes out. <br>On libraries ridding themselves of books—a few years ago I was completing my collection of Jane Duncan, a Scot who published from 1958-1978. Her books used to be in almost every library I visited. I could always rely on finding them for a reread. But I had noticed that they seemed to be in fewer libraries. And when I went shopping online almost every copy I purchased had library stamps. One of her short series was in the local library when I first moved here, but disappeared the following year. Since I had noticed the disappearance of her other books from the system I kicked myself for not “liberating” the ones that had still been available. I could have donated a reasonable amount for each one and the library would have come out ahead. The absence of classics is becoming more and more notable. Anthony Trollope is rarely seen; his space taken by his great, great grand niece Joanna Trollope, who is a good novelist, but not yet a classic. <br>It’s not just that TV is addictive, it is also so much part of our culture that to forego it brands one as an eccentric.

I'm curious to see how it all plays out too. <br><br>People are more adaptable to adversity than most give them credit for. In my mind, the young are more adaptable than the old, if the sample of ageing mates is anything to go by anyway! (hope they didn't read that) <br><br>If you took media away from people, there'd obviously be a short period of adjustment and then, they'd just, well, sort of deal - like the rest of the world has to. <br><br>Which gets me to a previous comment you made:<br><br>"I think you need to allow for individuality in relationship to pop culture and TV as well. "<br><br>I agree with you. I've noticed some people can be recreational users, whilst others are addicts and this applies to media. Everyone I visit now has the TV on in the background as if they're scared that there might be a moments silence or they'll be shown up as boring conversationalists. What a waste of energy and I find it to be distracting.<br><br>Over here, when disaster strikes, usually the majority of people are pretty good. There is always a minority of people that are just bad and they'll take advantage of all sorts of situations - but they are the exception rather than the rule. After the Black Saturday bushfires here there was a small amount of looting, but again it was exceptional and in the absolute minority.<br><br>I'm curious about a comment that you made and was wondering whether it is a cultural difference, because I see the core of it raised quite often in peoples comments:<br><br>"Even if you intend to live a monastic life, you still might need to know what that torch-wielding mob marching down the road past your retreat in the middle of the night have on their minds..."<br><br>I agree that you have to understand peoples motivations and circumstances, but what's with the mobs and pitchforks picture? I would have thought that in an energy constrained future, mobs would also be subject to the same energy constraints. I'm not having a go, it's just that I appreciate your insights/comments and I see this picture being raised quite often here so there must be some basis in peoples minds for it.<br><br>I've been reflecting on my own situation from this perspective after seeing numerous mentions of this matter. My thinking about the subject is this: After many years learning I'm only about 30% to 40% self sufficient in food. It would be almost impossible for someone or some group to turn up at the gates, toss me out and make a go of living here. They would certainly fail (ie. die) through error or over consumption of the resources. The other thing that occurs to me is that most people are so removed from food production, they wouldn't even recognise the place for what it is. Most people wouldn't even know what an apricot tree looks like, let alone how to go about preserving the excess summer produce and that's only a minor part of the picture. <br><br>Also historically people have tended to move towards the cities during times of crisis. They stick to what is familar rather than taking a risk on a new and unknown environment with uncertain outcomes.<br><br>So why does the image of mob mentality keep raising it's head?<br><br>I'd appreciate your thoughts about this too JMG.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c8086843561039786942 title="comment permalink">8/21/11, 1:35 AM</a><br><br>

In both cases it creates an ideal gender definition based on standards that inherently cannot be achieved by any but a small minority. For women this has been the beauty queen, June Cleaver, the supermodel, and now the supermom. For men the game is played out as power -- a real man is the one who is on top of the hierarchy, be he the gangster, the CEO, or the pro athlete. When you define masculinity essentially as the number of other men you have below you in the pyramid, then you of course leave most men out. Hence they redirect their need for power in other areas -- cars, vicarious athletics (i.e. "sports"), and within the family, in power-defined and, too often, abusive family relationships. <br><br>Industrial society is designed to keep the majority of its citizens disempowered, be they male or female. Pop culture serves to distract them from this with fantasies and images of power, preventing real power struggles.<br><br>Note that I am not suggesting any of this was consciously concocted by evil conspiratorial overlords. These societal structures seem to emerge organically, without the need for deliberate scheming. Concentration of wealth creates hierarchy, disempowering structures stabilize the hierarchy, disempowered people are drawn to fantasies of power, which further stabilizes the structure. <br><br>One thing we will be seeing in the coming decades is the disintegration of the prevailing stabilizing forces that keep people content in their disempowered positions. THAT is gonna be real interesting, especially if enough people chose to reach for power by means other than riot, insurrection, looting, and pillaging. One of the main points of this blog (apologies for oversimplifying your goal here with some jargon, JMG!) is to discuss ways that people can empower themselves with skills and resilience rather than guns and bricks (be they clay or gold). <br><br>I have a corollary belief that, contrary to stereotypes, in general it is men who are the more emotional of the genders (on average, huge variation, any given individual can land anywhere in the spectrum). I mean, just look at it -- why do we need to go to such lengths to pound emotional control (repression) in to boys, if they are not inherently intensely emotional creatures? Men's emotions kill other people and themselves (think heart attacks as well as murders) at a far greater rate than do women's. You don't have strong cultural taboos against something unless there is a strong innate tendency that the taboos need to keep the lid on!<br><br><a href=#c3528699696343765691 title="comment permalink">8/21/11, 5:50 AM</a><br><br>

Is that really going to work?</i><br>What I heard him say is to step back and not let it take over your mind – very different from totally ignoring it. I know many Jungians who watch movies to get the symbolism from them, and discuss in groups the unconscious projections that were incorporated into the flick. I think that might be a good use for film-watching, if you have the stomach for it.<br><br><i>Popular culture is not as mindless as you make it out to be; it's just a different kind of mind and a different kind of voice.</i><br>Only if those symbols are conscious can you call it “mind”… when those symbols reside in the unconscious, they drive people and filter their views but they do not dialogue with the logical side, and thus are more like possession than creativity. Read Jung or any of the Jungian psychologists.<br><br>@LewisLucan: <i>They called my mother who said "Give him anything he wants." And that, was that!</i><br>Oh! To have had a mother like that!! Mine was super-keen on us following all the rules all the time (it didn’t apply to her, oddly enough. ;-}) I had to hide my copy of The Writer Magazine because I was certain she would have thrown a panic attack and accused me of writing up the family’s dirty laundry. <br><br>@JMG: <i>Jerry Mander's Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television may also be worth adding to the list.</i><br>AND his “In the Absence of the Sacred”! A very sobering book and I’d forgotten I had a copy. I’m gonna re-read it.<br><br>And a general thought viz. the theists and non-theists: it’s human nature to try to create dogma around a vision or novel idea. The followers of the visionary, the next generation, all (futilely) try to hang on to the original experience by codifying it. Even Jung was quoted to have said, “Thank God I’m Jung, and not a Jungian!” :-)<br><br>@Siddruge: <i>When I'm really mindful about reading … I am struck by the intimacy of the act - - where printed matter meets gray matter. What magic transpires there? What other human interaction can possibly compare?</i><br>Ooh! Well said!! I have felt that, too. What a marvelous experience, which seems as often taken for granted as a walk in Nature takes for granted the marvels surrounding the walker.<br><br><i>Bad enough for adults -- impossible for children who are like raw meat for those in the shadowy business of persuasion.</i><br>True. I just uncovered a diary from my youth (1968) and it mostly listed the tv shows I watched… and reading the list and my comments forcefully brought home to me how uncritically I took all that in. I thought I was savvy (what 8th grader doesn’t?) but I soaked it in as “reality”… I have seen clips of those shows and they are painful to watch – so much for an 8th grader being able to parse commercial tv!<br><br><a href=#c2893150845979508096 title="comment permalink">8/21/11, 7:29 AM</a><br><br>

When I found The Fountainhead, then Atlas Shrugged, they lit a fire in me that helped to propel me from my family and hometown. But looking back, it is clear to me that I had been stultified by both an Irish Catholic upbringing and extra dependencies within my family that both put a huge burden on me as a child, and showed me the utter hypocrisy of those who required sacrifice from me. So the Randian “enlightened self interest” that stated a person had a right to their own life and their own creativity and need not be yoked to demanding/dependent others just burned through me like a cleansing fire. Unfortunately I threw the baby out with the bathwater and it took me longer than Don Mason to regain sanity. I didn’t regain my spirituality until my early 30’s, but in the meantime, I experienced the downside of Ayn Rand – life is not a contract, nor can relationships bloom with only logical parameters; life is not very fulfilling when you treat “the weak” (from your point of view) with contempt or superiority. So I have “recovered” but I see how it might catch those who have experienced the dark side of “close relationships”… and there was rumor that Ayn Rand herself grew up in an alcoholic family, which would make her POV quite understandable. But she was a hypocrite, refusing to recant or revise once she experienced the inability to live without depending on others… so it’s a doubly-dangerous creed, because it is not just selfish, but impossible.<br><br>@Don Mason: <i>Today I ran across a New York Times article that summarizes some research about human decision- making: people develop decision-fatigue.</i> I have been following that research eagerly! It’s one more factor that the modern world has thrown at us – too many daily decisions. And I often wonder how much that affects the people’s inability to make decisions about important, longterm goals. <br><br>Oh, and I’m really enjoying the Foundation Trilogy, but I have to giggle at how hard it is to drop contemporary culture when writing about the future – every main character so far, male or female, except one very neurotic one, smokes tobacco! It’s a “given” – and it dates the books to the early 50s when they were written. LOL.<br><br><a href=#c8446726549713601350 title="comment permalink">8/21/11, 7:30 AM</a><br><br>

Very relieved to find that that's not the case. <br><br>But I have the subsidiary reaction of .... well, do we unplug or not? I suspect my habit of spending so much time reading one pundit, blogger, commenter, tweeter, or what-have-you or another expostulating on his or her theories of life, the universe, and everything is probably at least as mind-numbing/culture-killing as watching a few episodes of "The Wire" or "Arrested Development," if not more so. <br><br>I also suspect that contemporary popular culture has not really changed so much throughout history, whenever your version of "contemporary" is. It's the same as the "kids today" complaint... the same lament, repeated generation after generation; why can't we hear ourselves being our grandparents? Charles Dickens was not revered as a literary master in his day. He was more like, say, Stephen King. I can easily imagine that one day Stephen King will be respected more like Charles Dickens. <br><br>And I have to ask, why does everyone who wants to take a pot-shot at popular culture use Lady Ga-Ga as their target? Because it's easy? Requires no research, no verification of any claim? Because lots of people who have also not investigated will chuckle and nod? That's certainly one formula for appealing to the lowest-common-denominator. I'm not an art historian, I'm not a teen-ager, not a hipster, not even a Lady Ga-Ga fan. But it doesn't take too much investigating to see that Lady Ga-Ga is a phenomenal and powerful cultural force, delivering messages that seem to be going over most of our heads. Next time you need a cultural punching bag, I suggest you use a Kardashian, Justin Bieber, or maybe The Wiggles. But maybe, for the integrity of your argument, at least Google them first.<br><br><a href=#c503100113618792322 title="comment permalink">8/21/11, 10:06 AM</a><br><br>

I’ve always been skinny (6’ 1’’, 135 lbs. Body Mass Index of 18, which is regarded as underweight in modern society, although it’s average for a healthy hunter-gatherer.) <br><br>But due to a family history of heart disease, I had gone on the Ornish ultra-low fat diet, which included lots of rapidly-metabolized carbohydrates (unbuttered popcorn, corn flakes, etc.) <br><br>For the first time in my life, I found my weight was going up and down like a yo-yo (varying by up to 50 pounds, I had classic Metabolic Syndrome: I was a skinny guy with a big, fat gut.)<br> <br>Six years ago, I largely replaced the simple carbs with more fat (like raw nuts, which are roughly 50% unsaturated fat, 25% protein, and 25% complex carbohydrates), and my weight has been stable at my set point of 135 lbs. ever since – and no more sugar psychosis, and with a huge improvement in HDLs and Triglycerides. I don’t have to diet, I just eat when I eat – but I have to be careful about what I eat. <br><br>Many other people on low-fat diets have had the same problem, so it appears that some people seem to be genetically predisposed to have a problem with a diet high in carbohydrates, particularly simple carbohydrates with a high Glycemic Index.<br><br>How will this obesity epidemic play out in the future? That’s a puzzle. <br><br>People may grow and eat more raw foods (like raw vegetables and fruits) which contain a higher percentage of complex carbohydrates and more fiber - and they may get more exercise doing it. Consequently, they may look more like skinny hunter-gatherer types – which could help relieve some of the pressure on the health care system that is caused by the huge increase in obesity-related illnesses.<br> <br>On the other hand, carbohydrates are cheaper for the industrial system to grow, pack, ship, and store than protein or fat. As real incomes fall, people might tend to purchase more cheap carbs, and less of the expensive protein and fat. So the obesity epidemic may get worse – until real incomes get so low that people start to starve.<br> <br>And if people are languishing in a FEMA camp for refugees fleeing from an imploded, water-starved Las Vegas; and if the camp has an all-you-can-eat food line featuring cheap, industrially-produced simple carbs; then it’s going to be Blue Tarp Fat City.<br><br><a href=#c1816267823395662163 title="comment permalink">8/21/11, 4:32 PM</a><br><br>

Deep down, I just wish it would all go away honestly. The idea that we're going to come up with some ideology and organization to neatly manage the majority of needs and desires of 300 million people is patently absurd and the definition of hubris. I don't really know any other way we'd go about it than our current attempts, though, so I'd really rather just call it off and quit trying.<br><br>Anyone who's spent much time in a nursing home can probably understand it as a reflection on our society. We really spend a lot of resources to simultaneously take care of and forget about our loved ones when they are no longer of much use to us, it's rather scary. I suppose that's why I don't really believe in government as the source of charity, it depersonalizes the whole thing, and lets us just spend the money, call ourselves good people, and forget about them. Efficient, impersonal compassion for an efficient, impersonal people. People do indeed manage to eke out some semblance of a living on welfare and social security, but it's usually not a whole lot of one. Are they really better off alone in their rent-controlled apartment, buying subsidized food and watching television than having to depend on a specific benefactor with a real face who will likely place limits and expectations on their behavior in return for the charity? It's easier to misspend resources when it's someone else's money, too. I've lost count of the thousands in public funds (per patient) I've spent on getting alcoholics back to some semblance of health only to send them out and know they'll just do it all over again. But that's the current socially acceptable (and legally required in my case) definition of compassion.<br><br>I guess I lean more toward libertarianism, yet at the same time, I've seen people make positive changes in their lives and sometimes their communities on the public purse. Plenty of civil servants and the like do plenty of good for the world, and without public funds, they'd need to be independently wealthy to pull it off, which would curtail their numbers signficantly. It's not as simple as either side wants to make it.<br><br><a href=#c5303626866363397433 title="comment permalink">8/21/11, 4:37 PM</a><br><br>

That is to say, I pity the kid, and choose to direct my barbs at someone who's adult enough to have chosen her own fate. <br><br>Matt, no, no evil hobbits.

It's also interesting that the official definition of obesity has moved lower and lower over the years, and that the diets most often recommended to treat obesity -- as yours did -- generally goose people's metabolism so they put on weight more easily.

There are many other complex factors feeding in to the situation. For example, it's just recently been proven in replicated studies that if a mother doesn't get enough to eat during pregnancy, her fetus develops in ways that make it, after birth, extremely prone to obesity. Physicians have been ordering pregnant women to diet and refrain from "too much" weight gain since the 1950s. Nowadays it's practically considered child abuse for a pregnant woman to gain more weight than the doc thinks she should --- and if she has a BMI above 25, she's usually not allowed to gain the amount of weight that a woman with a BMI of 24 or less is allowed to gain. Voila, a couple of generations of fatter people as the kids of dieting pregnant women grow up to diet, and have kids of their own while dieting.<br><br>Add to that the way that the BMI categories were changed in the late 90s so that millions of people became overweight overnight, and millions more who were overweight became obese, all without gaining an ounce, and the "obesity epidemic" looks much less simple.<br><br>By the way, the definition of obesity has been set so low that many people who are clinically "obese" don't even look overweight. Check out <a rel=nofollow>The BMI Project</a> for an idea of just how thin an "obese" person can be.<br><br><a href=#c7678257669854033079 title="comment permalink">8/21/11, 9:20 PM</a><br><br>

There's more than a bit of grumpy-old-man-ism here: These darn kids today and their pastimes that don't appeal to me! And of course there's the usual nostalgia for the 70s. Plus, having "no sympathy for atheist beliefs" and dissing Richard Dawkins earns the Archdruid a demerit in my book. Dawkins is a pretty reasonable and admirable guy. Mind you, I'd say Karen Armstrong is pretty admirable, too. Anyway, I agree that getting rid of your TV is probably a good idea -- I haven't had TV for years (well, just for watching occasional DVDs). Reading great (or good) old books is also a fine suggestion. But I question the blanket denunciation of current popular culture. Depends what you mean by popular culture, maybe. There are always new cartoonists, musicians, writers, filmmakers, even comedians, and other kinds of artists and entertainers, coming along and beginning their careers. Some never become terribly "popular" or commercially successful but produce great work (and some produce great -- or good -- work and do become popular). There are also contemporary designers and craftspeople of multitudinous kinds doing interesting work! Surely you can find some whose work resonates with you or speaks to you -- and then you could support living artists, not just dead ones. (I say this as a professional illustrator and designer!) Finally, the rant about Care Bears is a bit odd. Are they still a big thing? True, there is no tragedy or change in their world -- but are you aware of Harry Potter? Plenty of tragedy, and character growth, there. As I recall, the kids loved it. Instead of "grumble grumble, I hate the modern world, I hate my own culture, etc" just look for the work being created now that's worthwhile to you! It's there! And it, too, (including your own work) is part of our current culture. Reading Isaac Asimov is great -- and ALSO, there may also be someone writing now, maybe one of these darn annoying kids with their crazy music and their weird non-1970s gadgets, who is just as good, in some interestingly different way. Instead of just glamorizing old stuff, appreciate the good stuff coming from currently living people, too.<br><br><a href=#c4445548815232946310 title="comment permalink">8/21/11, 9:37 PM</a><br><br>

They are also setup to provide employment for the children of those wealthy people and if you were really cynical - you'd say that the people setting up the charities were pulling strings from beyond the grave. I'm also pretty certain that they'd pursue pet projects and you have to ask what is their mandate for this anyway - shouldn't they just pay higher taxes if they're so keen to give?<br><br>There's been quite a bit of talk in the media in the past year or so here about charity. I can't help but think that this is driven by the same people who have taken so much of the common wealth here. The previous prime minister was deposed by only a $22m campaign against him - PR is pocket money for these types. It was an excellent return on investment for them.<br><br>Hi Les,<br><br>I'm still reading, although I only have the energy for two websites and that's it. I'll re-watch the Monty Python scene and thanks for the tip. I always felt that the scene was about a multiple occupancy. They're such a great idea and I even considered one for a while, but they always have difficulties because of the "passenger" predicament. My long term money is on a village concept - there may even have to be an overlord to sort out the bigger issues. Unpleasant, but workable on a sustainable basis.<br><br>Hi Bill,<br><br>Thanks for your thoughts. Ordinary eccentrics are OK by me as they're mostly harmless and usually reasonably attuned to their environment. There are a few old timers up here in the forest and I always appreciate and enjoy the time I spend talking with them. <br><br>I faced down an angry mob once (about 9 people) and I was an authority figure - it was solely directed at me. It was an unpleasant experience and not one I am keen to repeat if it can be at all avoided. <br><br>I live in a retreat hence my interest in the subject and it's good to know that you think that they may go past. There's always collateral damage though, although I am out of the way of anywhere important. How about where you are? I always imagined that you were down South on rural acreage for some reason.<br><br>Anyway, the reason that I posed the question was that some Aussie commenter many weeks ago posted a comment about having some police mates and if there were any problems they'd just take what they needed. It got me thinking about a suitable response, however their overall strategy seems so short term and pointless.<br><br>I have some thoughts regarding your posts about male/female issues.

I must say I enjoyed reading the latter work, but it’s always misfiled in the libraries in the science section – it actually belongs in the humour section…<br>Cheers,<br>LD<br><br><a href=#c6185529130425540954 title="comment permalink">8/22/11, 5:50 AM</a><br><br>

Jensen writes, "Toxic mimics...take a very real, necessary, creative, life-affirming, and most of all relational urge and turn it -- pervert it -- until it furthers not fully mutual relationships at all but instead superficial relationships based on domination and control. Toxic mimics...can cause people to forget those original relational urges, to forget mutuality is possible, to forget depth is possible, to believe control is natural and desirable."<br><br>In your case it would appear that Care Bears is a toxic mimic of the The White Stag from your childhood.

I agree mostly, but like all things there are extremes on both sides. NWA's "Straight Outta Compton", while full of false bravado and extreme violence displayed to the world a way of life and a response to government ill treatment that up until then had largely been ignored. There are plenty of underground rappers these days that have created there careers around criticizing and questioning the establishment. I think Immortal Techniques song "Peruvian Cocaine" is a brilliant commentary on the hypocrisy of the United States war on drugs.<br><br>Likewise punk is another genre of music that has sold records and become commercialized to a certain degree but has also been extremely influential on shaping the minds of young people, including my own. DOA, The Dead Kennedys, Propagandhi and numerous other bands have made careers out of questioning the status quo and searching for answers on how to build a better world. <br><br>I guess the obvious point to be made is that although these groups were relatively successful and able to make a living from their music they never had any illusions about 'making it big'.<br><br>My point is that not everything you perhaps don't understand is somehow damaging and something to be feared or ridiculed.

A lot of the returned WWI servicemen this far south were employed on infrastructure projects during this time such as the Great Ocean Road (susso work ie. sustenance work). In the north of the state (Murray Darling basin), people were provided with irrigated selections as well as in Gippsland much forest was also cleared. However, these failed because of: rabbit plagues and the drought which kicked off in 1937. The Great Depression only ended because WWII was a massive economic stimulus - sad but true. Yeah, there were swagmen on the road, but most people stuck to the cities as it's pretty hard to make a living off the land. The ideal of the swaggie was romantic but not very historically accurate. Historical records from around here state that these people would inevitably be living down the back paddock (whatever that means) and they'd help out in exchange for food.<br><br>Which gets me to the next point...<br><br>If I understand what you are saying (correct me if I'm wrong)then, you reckon that you'll get some land and then family and friends will lob up if anything untoward happens.<br><br>Well, you have to take carrying capacity into account and in OZ it's low. There's also the history of the land - like how was it used previously. How short or long is the growing season? What's the condition of the top soil? How much rainfall are you likely to get in both good and bad years? Can you store the rain water that you do get? What's your experience with agriculture? Do you understand how firewood works? Are you fit enough for hard labour? What infrastructure is in place? When will you know when to move? Do you have goal congruence with your family and friends?<br><br>The list goes on and if you get one wrong, you may end up being toast.<br><br>Much better to turn up and ask to do an apprenticeship in return for food and lodging with experienced people - or start now and learn.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1946372923501427479 title="comment permalink">8/23/11, 1:44 AM</a><br><br>

Some stories are only meant for their cultural moment; I don't see how this invalidates their purpose, or makes them not worth one's time. If one wishes to become a hermit, that's a noble enough enterprise for a number of reasons, but I don't see how anyone has ground to -really- fault someone who wishes to be engaged in the world around them as it is (an expression of which involves pop culture). <br><br>I adore the past. My bookshelves are altars to the old, dead white guys that have come and gone. I bothered to learn Greek so I could read the most lasting works of the canon in their original language. Don't mistake me; I'm deeply sympathetic to your major point. Reading the Newberry winners was a sacred activity to me once, and the thought of any of them anywhere near the trashcan makes me feel very hopeless about the state of the world as it stands.<br><br>But do you, in all honesty, think that the Great Celestial Canon of works is based on that which survives by its own merits alone? Cultural influence has nothing to do with it? Postmodernism would like a word or ten with you ;) This is, I think, an unsupportable position, even though I myself have exhaustively read Harold Bloom and my tastes are very much in line with what has survived. It's simply too arbitrary, and our existential needs -- the ones that drive us to seek out classics in the first place-- too dependent on cultural contexts. And too dependent, I have to say, on the dominant demographic. (Look up 'Franzenfreude' if you want a recent discussion on how that is _still_ an issue.) <br><br>So dammit, I have a love for pop culture as well as a love for the classics -- the common reference points with others, the surprising treasure to be mined there, the occasionally archetypal theater of it all. A lot of it is pure dross, but there is plenty to be examined and pondered over. (Wildly clever and incisive parodies of Twilight are just as pop as Twilight itself.)<br><br>Aside from that, you're also dismissing entire mediums wholesale; alot of what you're calling pop culture can be subversive and brilliant. As a child, alongside those Newberries, I played video games. In the grand scheme of human history, the Newberry winners will be much more important than the particular games I played; but I don't exaggerate when I say that the video games revealed nearly as much to me, and for reasons specific to their medium. Video games have taught me about what to do. <br><br>So here's my point: good TV exists. Spectacular TV, even -- TV that is (to rob a Matthew Arnold sentiment) _bettering_, and not just clever. After all, it's only film in a serial format. Is it worth owning a TV set to see? For me, no, but that doesn't mean everyone who owns a TV does so for escapist reasons. What points you have about incoherence and the sustainability of technology can stand apart from some assertion that no one should explore these avenues of expression. Saying "be discerning," and reframing your argument, will serve you much better than "turn off your TV." <br><br>I'm saying this as someone who is fundamentally on your side. ;)<br><br><a href=#c8950725477173279535 title="comment permalink">8/23/11, 11:02 AM</a><br><br>

You said, "<em>After all, it's only film in a serial format</em>".<br><br>Telling a story is an encompassing experience; listening to a well-told story is a shared experience.<br><br>Advertising is intended to disrupt the story, to implant urges to buy and use, to persuade the erstwhile listener to *stop* following the story, to *pay attention* to the colorful, blatant, often deliberately irritating (they work better!) interruption. The story teller -- the TV, the magazine, the newspaper, the web page, then *hopes* to re-establish the story and re-engage the listener/audience.<br><br>A movie, back in the old days when there were no pre-show ads to distract one from anticipation of the story promised, is closer to a play. That is, an uninterrupted storytelling.<br><br>The difference between TV and a movie is the same as the difference between a magazine or newspaper and a novel. It is not just the short snippets that "work" with TV or a newspaper, but the cluttered and disrespectful aspects of the storytelling.<br><br>In the past, novels and storytelling trained and rewarded skills in memory, in long-period attention spans, and attention to detail. Today we get ADD/ADHD, etc. instead of discipline.<br><br>You don't have to wait for the newspaper to find out what went on at the city council or school board meeting. You could just attend.<br><br>It will be interesting to see whether the energy and money will be available, to keep cheap paper and writing instruments available. And whether oral history and legal identities ("Remember Jack X, he was Lucy X's third boy? He just married Jane Y.") will be re-established any time soon. Funerals, weddings / handfastings, namings / Baptisms, and other life events are legacies of communities committing events and identities to the communal memory.<br><br>I shudder to think that some joker might perpetuate a seven minute interval, and insert product and self promotions in the midst of the story, just because "it has always been done that way."

To wit: I can't <i><b>stand</b></i> postmodernism, regarding it as time-wasting toxic pretentious drivel. And pre-show ads at movie theatres are a major reason why I no longer attend films at the cinema. Once when I criticized this practice in another web forum, some idiot actually attacked me and insisted that the movie business would go broke or that attending films would cost 25 bucks a pop if they didn't do it. Many minds, to paraphrase Mr. Kunstler, have apparently been colonized by corporations. <br><br>Not all teen pop stars turn out badly.

Back before you had to show a green card or Social Security card to get a job, the most likely questions would be "who knows you/will speak for you?" and "Who are you" -- in terms of people known in the community.<br><br>Reminding each other of who is related to whom was an important component of maintaining a record of who lives here, and who is a furriner. Today we rely on birth and death records at county, state, federal, and community levels to establish this, with maybe a finger print to compare to police files, and a list of jobs and residences for the last ten or thirty years (it depends on what you are applying for).<br><br>Divorces were much less common than widows and widowers. Remarriages were few, and marriages were for various reasons aside from affection, and seldom let to fall apart. Where you might have had ten elders agree on who was related to whom in the community, back then, today you have to run them each down and check -- something that is simpler to do in days of cheap energy, cheap transportation, and cross-indexed people.<br><br>@ Mike Noga,<br><br>That depends on what a degree in Library Science prepares you for -- and what the post-industrial library looks like.<br><br>Some parts of what will be needed -- caring for documents and books, perhaps re-binding, maintaining (hand printed card?) indexes, perhaps incorporating estate collections, perhaps keeping track of which books are checked out, and which are overdo. Most of this can be taught on the job, with little advanced education.<br><br>Perhaps I oversimplify. I suspect that many colleges are fundamentally rooted in cheap energy and the affluence gained from the use of cheap energy. As the current political abuse of the economy continues, and oil demand continues to challenge oil production, world wide, I think a number of college position, and colleges, will face tough times or outright closure. In the next five or fifteen years, will we see much change? Or will it be noticeable in 15 months? I surely don't know, and it is entirely possible that getting your degree now might prepare you to be a significant contributor in making the coming post-industrial world a better place for us all. It could happen; there are worse things than to follow a dream.<br><br>There is no reason that you can't focus on a Green Wizardry personal collection.
