It’s a funny thing, this attempt to discuss the future in advance. Much of the time, like everyone else in the business, I talk about the future as though it’s a place we simply haven’t reached yet, with a geography that can be explored at least to some extent from the vantage point of the present. That’s not entirely inappropriate; so much of the near future has been defined in advance by choices already made and opportunities long since foregone that it’s not at all hard to sketch out the resulting shape of things.
<br> <br>Still, the choices we make in the present are as often as not defined by our beliefs about the future, and so there’s a complicated series of feedback loops that comes into play. Self-fulfilling prophecies are one option, but far from the most common. Much more often, predictions about the future that gain enough of an audience to become a force in their own right kickstart patterns of change that go ricocheting off in unexpected directions and bring about a future that nobody expected.
<br> <br>Industrial civilization’s attempt to expand out into interplanetary space, the theme of last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, is a case in point. The handful of space technologies that turned out to have practical uses, and the technological advances that spun off from each of the major space programs, weren’t anticipated at all by the people who ordered the rockets to be built, the satellites to be launched and the astronauts to risk their lives. Cold War rivalry played a major role, to be sure, but that rivalry could have expressed itself in any number of terrestrial ways. What very few people noticed then or later was the extent to which all parties involved took their core assumptions and ideas from an utterly improbable source—a genre of pulp literature that most people at the time dismissed as lowbrow trash suitable only for twelve-year-old boys. Yes, I’m talking about science fiction.
<br> <br>I’m not sure how many people have noticed that science fiction is the one really distinctive form of fiction created by industrial civilization. Romances, satires, and adventure stories are practically as old as written language; the novel of character and manners had its first great flowering in tenth-century Japan, and detective stories were written in medieval China; even fantasy fiction of the modern kind, which deliberately cashes in on legends nobody actually believes any more, flourished in Renaissance Europe—it still amazes me that nobody has rewritten <i>Amadis of Gaul</i> to fit the conventions of modern fantasy fiction and republished it as “the sixteenth century’s number one fantasy bestseller,” which it unquestionably was. Science fiction—the branch of literature that focuses on the impact of scientific and technological progress—is the exception.
<br> <br>It’s important, for what follows, to be clear about definitions here. A story about traveling to another world isn’t necessarily a work of science fiction; the ancient Greek satirist Lucian wrote one about a ship tossed up to the Moon by a waterspout, and Cyrano de Bergerac—yes, <i>that</i> Cyrano; you didn’t know he was a real person, did you?—wrote a ripsnorter about traveling to the Moon and the Sun via a series of even more unlikely gimmicks; both of them were engaging pieces of absurdity riffing off the fact that nobody actually thought the thing could ever happen. It took Mary Shelley, watching the rain splash down on a Swiss vacation as her husband’s literary friends toyed with ghost stories in much the same spirit as Lucian imagined moonflight, to create a new kind of literature. <i>Frankenstein</i>, the novel she started on that vacation, became a bestseller precisely because it was believable; recent advances in the life sciences, especially Alessandro Volta’s eerie experiment that caused a frog’s amputated leg to kick by running electricity through it, made it entirely plausible at the time that some researcher might take things the next step and bring a dead body to life.
<br> <br>Take a single scientific or technological breakthrough, combine it with the modern world, and see what happens—all through the 19th century, and into the 20th, that’s what science fiction (or “scientifiction,” as it was often called) meant. Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, the two great masters of the early genre, rang just about every change on that theme that the technology of the age would justify. Of course both of them wrote voyages to the Moon; in an age of explosive technological progress, traveling to the Moon had moved just that little bit closer to plausibility, but it was just one of the many lively improbabilities they and other authors explored in their stories.
<br> <br>Except, of course, that a good many of them didn’t stay improbable for long. The feedback loop I mentioned earlier was coming into play; in the first decades of the twentieth century, a generation that had grown up on Verne and Wells started putting scientifiction’s dreams into practice. Captain Nemo’s <i>Nautilus</i> quickly took on an uncomfortable reality as the first U-boats slid down the ways. Wells’ “The Land Ironclads” provided the conceptual blueprint for the first generation of tanks, just as his <i>The War in the Air</i> got militaries around the world thinking of the possibilities of aerial bombardment. Most of the other technological notions in turn of the century science fiction got tried out by somebody or other during those years, and those that worked found ready acceptance among audiences that had plenty of fictional models in the back of their minds.
<br> <br>Meanwhile, the fictional models were shifting focus. It was in the 1920s and 1930s that science fiction changed from a genre about any kind of scientific and technological advance you care to name, which it had been until then, to a genre that was basically about space travel. Slowly—it wasn’t an overnight change by any means—stories about spaceships and alien worlds came to dominate the pulp magazines that were the major SF venue of the time; voyages to the Moon became old hat, something to stick in the backstory; Mars and Venus became preferred destinations, and then E.E. “Doc” Smith shot the characters in his Lensman series across interstellar space, and what Brian Aldiss later described as science fiction’s “billion year spree” was on.
<br> <br>By the late 1940s, many of the most popular science fiction writers were working within a common vision of the future—a future history that began sometime in the near future with the first voyages to the Moon and then went on from there, colonizing the solar system, then leaping the gap that separated our solar system from others and beginning the settlement of the galaxy. Whether humanity would meet alien life forms out there in space was a subject of much disagreement; the more romantic authors peopled Mars and Venus with intelligent species of their own, but the spectrum ran from there to authors who imagined a galaxy full of empty but inhabitable planets just waiting for <i>Homo sapiens</i> to inhabit them. Even among the imaginary galaxies that bristled with alien species, though, they might as well have been human beings; the universe of the original <i>Star Trek</i> series, where the vast majority of “aliens” were extras from Central Casting with a bit of funny makeup splashed on, was a pretty fair reflection of the SF of a few decades earlier.
<br> <br>It’s a useful exercise to go back and read essays by the SF authors of the 20th century’s middle decades—Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke were particularly prolific in this vein, but there were plenty of others—and take in what they had to say about the coming Space Age. It wasn’t, by and large, something they felt any need to promote or argue for; it was simply, necessarily going to happen. There would be the first tentative flights into space, followed by the first Moon landing; somewhere in there the first of many space stations would go into orbit, perhaps as a way station to the Moon; Mars and Venus were next on the agenda, first the landings, then the bases, then the colonies, growing as naturally as Jamestown or Plymouth into booming new frontier societies; the asteroids and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn would follow in due order, followed by the outer planets and the cometary halo, and then would come the challenge of the stars.
<br> <br>Among the most fascinating details that popped up here and there in this literature, though, was the conviction that science fiction itself—the literature, the writers, and the subculture that grew up around it in the 1930s and became something like a force of nature in the decades that followed—would play a major role in all this. I’ve long mislaid the title of the Isaac Asimov essay that argued that science fiction had the role of advance scouts on the great onward march of human progress, revealing new avenues for advance here, discovering dead ends and boobytraps there. That wasn’t just Asimov exercising his unusually well-developed ego, either; SF fans, droves of them, shared his opinion. "Fans are Slans," the saying went—I wonder how many people these days even remember A.E. Van Vogt’s novel <i>Slan</i>, much less the race of superhuman mutants that gave it its title; a great many fans saw themselves in that overly roseate light.
<br> <br>What makes this all the more intriguing is that all this happened at a time when science fiction was widely considered very nearly the last word in lowbrow reading. Until the paperback revolution of the late 1950s, most science fiction appeared in pulp magazines—so called because of the wretched quality of the paper they were printed on—with trashy covers on the front and ads for X-ray spectacles and Charles Atlas strength lessons in the back. The cheap mass-marketed paperbacks that picked up from the pulps dropped the ads but by and large kept the tacky cover art. ("There has been a great deal of talk about the big questions of science fiction," SF author L. Sprague de Camp said once. "The truly big question of science fiction is ‘What is that woman in a brass brassiere doing on the cover of my book?’") As for the stories themselves—well, there were a handful of very good authors and some very good short stories and novels, but let’s be honest; there was much, much more that was really, astonishingly bad.
<br> <br>Just as the young engineers and military officers of 1910 had all grown up reading Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, though, as America stumbled into its age of global empire after the Second World War, a very large number of its young men (and a much smaller but still significant fraction of its young women) had grown up daydreaming of rockets to Mars and adventures with the Space Patrol. All that was required to make those daydreams a powerful force in the American collective imagination was a well-aimed shock, and that was supplied in 1957 when a small group of Soviet scientists and military officers talked their superiors into letting them strap a 22-inch steel sphere on top of a big new ICBM and launch it into Earth orbit.
<br> <br>The advent of Sputnik I sent the United States into something halfway between a tantrum and a nervous breakdown. Suddenly it became absolutely essential, in the minds of a great many Americans, for the US to beat "godless Russia" in the Space Race. For their part, delighted to find an effective way to goad the United States, Soviet leaders started putting real money into their space program, scoring one achievement after another while Americans played a feeble game of catch-up. Before long a new US president was announcing a massively funded plroject to put men on the moon, the first rockets were blasting off from Cape Canaveral, and a nation already intrigued by the notion of outer space, and alternately amused and intrigued by the space-centered folk mythology of the UFO phenomenon, signed on to the opening stages of the grand future history already sketched out for them by decades of pulp science fiction.
<br> <br>For the next decade and a half or so, the feedback loop I’ve described shifted into overdrive as fantasies of a future among the stars shaped the decisions of politicians and the public alike. By the time the Apollo program was well underway, staff at NASA was already sketching out the next generation of manned interplanetary spacecraft that would follow the Moon landing and cutting blueprints for the probes that would begin the exploration of the solar system. That’s when things started to run off the rails that seemingly led to the stars, because the solar system revealed by those probes turned out to have very little in common with the "New Worlds for Man" that the fantasies required.
<br> <br>It takes a while reading old books on the prospects of space travel to grasp just how wide a gap those first planetary probes opened up. Respected scientists were claiming as late as the 1960s that the Moon was a world of romantic vistas with needle-pointed mountains glinting under starlight; it turned out to be gray, largely featureless, and stunningly dull. Venus was supposed to be a tropical planet, warmer than Earth but still probably inhabitable; it turned out to be a searing furnace of a world with surface temperatures hot enough to melt metal. Since 19th century astronomers mistook optical effects of telescopes pushed to their limit for markings on the Martian surface, Mars had been the great anchor for dreams of alien intelligence and offworld adventure; when the first Viking lander touched down in 1976, the Grand Canals and alien swordsmen of Barsoom and its godzillion equivalents went wherever wet dreams go to die, and were duly replaced by what looked for all of either world like an unusually dull corner of Nevada, minus water, air, and life.
<br> <br>Those were also the years when Mariner and Voyager probes brought back image after image of a solar system that, for all its stunning beauty and grandeur, cointained only one world that was fit for human habitation, and that happened to be the one on which we already lived. As the photos of one utterly uninhabitable world after another found their way into one lavish <i>National Geographic</i> article after another, you could all but hear the air leaking out of the dream of space, and even the most vigorous attempts to keep things moving launched by science fiction fans and other enthusiasts for space travel found themselves losing ground steadily. To stand the title of Frederik Pohl’s engaging memoir on its head, science fiction turned out to be the way the future wasn’t.
<br> <br>And science fiction itself? It fragmented and faded. The boost in respectability the space program gave to science fiction gave it a larger and more critical market, and thus midwifed some of the greatest works of the genre; a series of loudly ballyhooed literary movements, none of them particularly long-lived, zoomed off in assorted directions and, as avant-garde movements generally do, left most of their audience behind; efforts at crass commercial exploitation, of which the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise was the most lucrative example, came swooping down for their share of the kill. While other media boomed—visual media are always a couple of decades behind print—the sales of science fiction novels peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s and then began a decline that still continues, and a genre that had once exercised a potent gravitational force on the collective imagination turned back into just another option in the smorgasbord of mass-produced popular entertainment.
<br> <br>It’s a trajectory worth studying for more reasons than one. The intersection of imperial extravagance, technological triumphalism, and anti-Communist panic that flung billions of dollars into a quest to put men on the Moon made it possible, for a little while, for a minority of visionaries with a dream about the future to think that their dream was about to become reality. The dream unraveled, though, when the rest of the universe failed to follow the script, and a great many of the visionaries found themselves sitting in the dust wondering what happened.
<br> <br>That’s not an uncommon event. The dream of a new American century hawked by the neoconservatives a decade and a half ago, though it ranked down there with the tawdriest bits of pulp science fiction, traced the same trajectory. The election of George W. Bush and the 2001 terror attacks on New York and Washington DC gave them a window of opportunity to try to make that dream a reality, and it turned into exactly the sort of disaster you’d expect when a group of academic intellectuals try to impose their theories on the real world. It would be less embarrassing if the notion of invading a Third World country and turning it into a happy little puppet democracy hadn’t been tried over and over again, without a single success, since the Spanish-American War.
<br> <br>For that matter, the movement toward sustainability in the 1970s, the subject of a great many posts on this blog, followed a similar trajectory. That movement, as I’ve argued, might have succeeded—I grant that it was a long shot at best. Yet the rush of initial enthusiasm, the real achievements that were made, and the bleak discovery that the political and cultural tide had turned against it and the rest of the dream was not going to come within reach are very reminiscent of the arc traced above.
<br> <br>Still, the example that comes most forcefully to mind just now is the one this blog is meant to address, the movement—or perhaps proto-movement—trying to do something useful in the face of peak oil. Right now it’s still gamely poised on the fringes, attracting members and brief bursts of attention, weaving disparate perspectives into early drafts of the vision that will eventually catapult it into the big time. That’s still several years and a Sputnik moment or two away, but the increasingly frantic attempts of both American parties to treat the end of the age of cheap energy as a public relations problem suggest to me that sooner or later that time is going to come.
<br> <br>The temptation when that happens, and it’s a potent one, will be to assume that whatever window of opportunity opens then can be counted upon to last, on the one hand, and will lead to whatever encouraging future the vision promises on the other. Neither of those is guaranteed, and depending on the shape the vision takes, neither one may even be possible. The question that needs to be kept in mind, straight through from the giddy enthusiasm of the initial successes to the bitter winding down that will more than likely follow, is how much useful work can be accomplished during the interval we get.

I guess I always saw that old saying "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" as applying quite handily to SF. If it's fantasy, the magic is straight up magic (gods, wizards, what have you) ... in science fiction, the magic is dressed up as technology, but it's still magic, and it's still fantasy. (No offense intended to those who work with 'real' magic, of course, I'm using the term in the vernacular sense of "stuff that can't really happen in any ordinary way".) <br><br>I think the biggest thing I've gotten from SF is new ways of thinking. I have often said, quite truthfully, that my religious views are unreasonably influenced by the science fiction books I've read. Alternate universes, strange gods, ethical dilemmas that one would not perhaps be prepared to address straight on in their familiar Earth-bound contexts ... I am grateful to the SF writers for giving me the chance to explore those ideas in a safely-alien context, and then, after some pondering, integrate those thoughts into my every day existence.<br><br>It would be really nice if we could get in our space ships and fly off to other worlds, but it would be really nice if there were hobbits in the New Zealand meadows, too. <br><br>Ah, well.

As a matter of fact, I was re-reading A.C.

And that from a novel after the tail end of US manned moon exploration.<br><br>Anyway, S-F also had a heyday in the late 70s-early 80s in regards to the worldwide Internet network -Vinge, Gibson, Rucker and Sterling had the technology vision and it's attending social consequences down fairly pat by 1984 or so. It just took another 10-15 years before it was realized in the real world.<br><br>Anyway, more to say if I can find the time between work and gardening about the demise of our space age and the work that inspired it.

The ladies in the brass bras. "Great Science Fiction by Scientists," Collier Pub., 1962, Edited with an introduction by Groff Conklin (who?). The only names I recognize are one each by Asimov and Clarke (and, didn't he invent, or help invent, the communication satellite?) The copyrights on the stories run from 1930 - 1962. I may have to dip into this volume, with your current essay in mind.<br><br>Of course, we now have this whole genre of book / story that has to do with after the: economic collapse, EMP, peak oil, ecological and population disaster, plague, whatever. Probably has it's root in "after the bomb" literature. Often shelved along with sci-fi. There's a pretty lively thread over at Green Wizards, about those books.<br><br>I am very conscious that we're in a window of opportunity that may slam shut at any time. I just bought a treadle sewing machine. I like that, unlike the beast I am sitting in front of, my computer, that there are a finite set of skills I can master to operate said machine. My window of opportunity was getting it at a time when such things are not very valued. I had the opportunity of gas to haul it a distance, and may have the gas to haul it out to my retreat in the boonies (out of town, but not too far out). It is very heavy, and I can just move it myself.<br><br>Maybe a hundred years from now, someone will go on a quest for the semi-mythical sewing machine, rumored to be somewhere in the wilds of Lewis County. Maybe a quest to impress his lady love. I hope he or she has a strong back.

Cheesy monster iguanas with rubber horns. Fascistic soundtrack from Wagnerian operas. And hot babes: a girl-next-door blonde who always needed rescuing vs. an evil, scheming brunette, the daughter of Ming the Merciless. <br><br>We watched it on Community Discount Theater with host Larry Goodman every Sunday morning after church. (Frankly, I found Flash Gordon’s adventures on the planet Mongo to be more believable than some of the things I was being asked to believe in church. I’ll take flying around in a home-made space ship contraption built by Dr. Zharkov any day – particularly when it’s also occupied by hot babes.)<br><br>Everything by Robert A. Heinlein: from “The Moon is a Harsh Mistress” to “Stranger in a Strange Land” to the Vietnam Era’s “Glory Road.”<br><br>Many movies about giant bugs from outer space have been filmed, but “Starship Troopers” is the best. The way the director maintained the right-wing, fascistic philosophy of the book was perfect: the intelligence section agents for the good guy humans are dressed in black uniforms like the SS, fighting to maintain the purity of their species. And hot babes as Space Marines, showering with the guys. Quick: How do I enlist?<br><br>Edgar Rice Burrough’s John Carter of Mars series: Ten great, trashy books (the eleventh in the series was written by his son).<br><br>Swashbuckling swordfights on Mars! And great cover art featuring hot Martian babes who fortunately look just like hot babes here on Earth (except that when Martian babes get pregnant, they lay eggs.)<br><br>John Wyndham: “Day of the Triffids’ is great doomer porn – almost everyone on Earth goes blind after looking up at a war satellite designed to blind people, and then they are stalked and eaten by walking, carnivorous plants from the Amazon. Features a hot babe who is the author of a book called “Sex is My Adventure”.<br><br>Unfortunately, “Rebirth” didn’t really feature any totally hot babes, but it did inspire a (mangled) line in the Jefferson Airplane’s tune, “Crown of Creation”: “In loyalty to their kind, they cannot tolerate our kind. In loyalty to our kind, we cannot tolerate their obstruction.” More fascism, seems like.

The question arises as to who would loan funds to countries to purchase the necessary energy, skills, tools and resources to retool.

We could sum it up as “don’t get cocky, son.” We will try to bear this in mind when making our choices based on our own vision of the future. It seems appropriate to get those choices aimed at achieving something that is of itself satisfying and not overly dependent on the rest of the ducks lining up. As in simplifying life in such a way that is enjoyable as well as sustainable, but not getting hung up on the idea that everyone around us should see what we are doing and emulate us (and us failing if they don’t).<br>One nit to pick – I would argue that you are drawing a long bow to suggest a feedback loop between the early authors of scientifiction and actual scientists. I would suggest what you are seeing is more likely the zeitgeist that seems to surround most discoveries/advances – the same zeitgeist that sees so many things being developed independently by people working in the same field at the same time; from Newton and Leibniz’s development of calculus, through Darwin and Wallace, to the many recent shared Nobels we see for discoveries published by different, unassociated people working on the same problem.<br>I suspect that HG and his ilk were far more likely to be able to keep up with the literature than more recent writers, so were more likely to be tuned into that zeitgeist. Then, unlike the scientists and engineers of his time, HG didn’t actually have to go to all the bother of building and testing his ideas, which probably gave him an advantage when it came to publication…<br>Cheers,<br>LD<br><br><a href=#c9107177547701229716 title="comment permalink">9/1/11, 4:54 AM</a><br><br>

First, that it became synonymous with space travel and alien invasions, and second, that it then somehow got lumped in with the Fantasy genre so that we now have Sci-Fi-Fantasy all run together as one word. You'd think that SF and Fantasy would be antipodal, with the one (supposedly) founded on scientific and technological advances and the other founded on magic and mythology, two things which this society doesn't seem to be able to reconcile under any other circumstances! I guess folks don't really care so much whether the bearded dude and the buxom woman in the brass brassiere are wielding swords or ray guns...<br><br>Back to its having become synonymous with space travel, that leads to the bizarre phenomenon of Margaret Atwood refusing to describe herself as a science fiction author. How in the world can "Oryx and Crake" and its apocalypse-by-biotech NOT be science fiction?? But there are no spaceships, so it must not be. ChickieNobs Bucket O'Nubbins, anyone?<br><br>I wonder about the current ubiquitous zombie/vampire craze. I don't follow it in great detail, but I gather there is a developing trend where the zombies are brought about by genetically-engineered viruses. I care for vampires even less, but I wonder if they are going to start going the same way, with pseudo- medical/biological explanations for them. We already have ones that sparkle in the sun instead of bursting in to flames, after all. So it seems like perhaps we are coming back to where Mary Shelley started us off, leaving space and resurrecting Frankenstein (or at least his monster). I am getting the unsettling impression that a whole cadre of young people are actually expecting the zombie apocalypse to really happen, just as earlier generations expected to live and work in space. <br><br>When I worked in Academia, by the way, I had a quote from "Frankenstein" on my office door... it was not generally well-received.<br><br><a href=#c4042726833313561073 title="comment permalink">9/1/11, 6:47 AM</a><br><br>

These have always been the most interesting to me. And those who excelled at this style, people like Samuel R. Delany and Ursula K. Leguin seem to be able to slip from Fantasy to SF with ease... using the form more as a medium for getting across ideas that might be tricky otherwise.<br><br>Also there has been a great deal of environmentally based SF. While I really enjoyed Kim Stanley Robinson's "Mars" trilogy (for much of what I thought could be applied to Earth) I liked his "Three Californias" even better. The first was a version of California after a neutron bomb had been detonated in America. The second was something along the lines of where we are now -analysis of militaristic trajectories and hyper-capitalism extrapolated out a bit further, with the ensuing social discohesion of youth, and the third was a community that had moved towards environmental sustainability without being a utopia. That book showed with striking accuracy what political struggles over water in California might look like, and how even in a such a society there can still be personal misery.<br><br>Bruce Sterlings "Heavy Weather" about a hypothetical F6 twister sweeping through Texas &amp; Oklahoma, a Tornado powered by changes in the jet stream, also seems like it could be probable. A good read.<br><br>While some of the technological progressivism in Cory Doctorow's "Makers" may not play out, other aspects, such as tent cities and favelas springing up in Florida are prescient. Also the whole aspect of salvage in that book, making new things from the detritus of industry. <br><br>Earlier this year I read Kunstler's two post collapse novels, followed by Starhawks "The Fifth Sacred Thing". All had much to offer. <br><br>Palo Bacigalupi has written two books, both winners of various SF awards. His YA title "Shipbreaker" is set in a salvage yard where kids tear apart old ocean going vessels for the metal.<br><br>So SF is still a lively place, but the setting has returned to Earth and our environmental concerns.<br><br><a href=#c3692770757148167901 title="comment permalink">9/1/11, 7:06 AM</a><br><br>

An additional 60,000 words (<i>oh my</i>). <br><br>I also haven't read the original, full edition of Podkayne of Mars ( which always seemed incomplete to me), also released after Heinlein's death. Perhaps the foreknowlege that Poddy dies causes my hesitation. One wonders how many of the great sci-fi novels I haven't fully experienced, due to publisher editing....<br><br>You said: <i>"For that matter, the movement toward sustainability in the 1970s, the subject of a great many posts on this blog, followed a similar trajectory. That movement, as I’ve argued, might have succeeded—I grant that it was a long shot at best."</i><br><br>I'm not so sure the long shot has failed; it's only our expectations that were a long shot. The novel of sustainability is, as yet, incomplete, a work in progress. At least around here it is. Let us not edit the ending prematurely.. Our task is to get as many folks to read it as we can, to share the water. It's clear from the comments so far that even the more obscure sci-fi stories planted some pretty remarkable seeds.<br><br>Thanks again for another great, well written post, creating a literary wormhole into the past and future.

(And I still think that way about their writing). <br><br>I got to meet a bunch of the big names in the ‘80’s (Brin, Pournelle, etc.) because I’d written a couple children scifi’s and that got me to the conferences as an author… I remember that the “hard scifi” guys were disdainful of the “soft scifi” writers – kind of like cowboys looking down on city slickers… I wonder how those guys are handling this fall from grace? <br><br>I suspect there has been a quiet increase in that search for faster-than-light-travel (the “wormholes”) now that the steel buckets have been stilled. I finished reading Asimov’s Foundation Trilogy last week, and one thing that amazed and amused me was how calmly he described a civilization that spanned a galaxy as if it was America with its worldwide military bases – and the description of the world-encircling central city of Trantor made me shudder! No blade of grass or tree, except in the one emperor’s park (he was probably looking out on Central Park when he wrote that)… and how he assumed that even the fallen civilization would somehow be able to keep the magic machines running for 300+ years after those who knew how to build them were gone… such wishful thinking!<br><br>But if you’re right about scifi leading our thoughts (or reflecting/leading in a feedback loop) – what do you say about all the dark scifi that is prevalent right now? Starting with cyberpunk and now with the apocalyptic books, we aren’t writing ourselves into any kind of livable future… I can see your novel as an attempt to create such a future – one that has found a new balance after the crash… but as you say, even if we grab for such a future, there’s no way to count on the vision being realized… but isn’t that true of each of our lives? As someone turning 56 in a couple weeks, I realize that my visions of who I’d be and what I’d do have not borne the fruit I expected… possibly the ability to “vision” was built into humans to push them to grow in ways they wouldn’t otherwise.<br><br><a href=#c8566642395916754497 title="comment permalink">9/1/11, 7:30 AM</a><br><br>

Stephenson posits an ascetic, agnostic, monastic teaching order which survives for thousands of years, surviving in large part because of the social conditions you describe: in the order's history, which spans countless periods of natural and social disasters, any looters/invaders immediately discover that the order's treasures are primarily intellectual, and move on after stealing all of the food.

Thanks for the reminder, by the way; I really do need to take Clarke's Law apart here one of these days. <br><br>Harry, give it fifty years and the Big Bang will be out of fashion again. Science, like every other human activity, is powerfully shaped by cultural fashions and presuppositions. <br><br>SweaterMan, E.M. Forster had the internet down cold a century ago in "The Machine Stops," too! I look forward to your further comments. <br><br>Joe, you're talking apples and orangutans. The window I have in mind is of a different order, and on a different scale, than the one you're discussing. <br><br>Rich, thanks for the reference! You've also pointed usefully to one of the common failings of early SF -- the assumption that whatever the hot new technology was would turn out to be invincible. <br><br>Tim, we'll get to that. It just figures, though, that an economics professor would insist that a bit of cheap media exploitation like <i>Star Trek</i> was a valid source of evidence for the shape of the future!<br><br>Lew, the idea of a heroic quest for the Holy Treadle Sewing Machine has just about made my day.

Malacandra and Perelandra were based on the best current ideas about Mars and Venus at the time Lewis wrote his space trilogy, and of course he shared the same fantasy of an essentially humanized, domesticated solar system -- he simply used a much older model for it.

It talked of a nation that had fallen into serious decline and an as the decline progressed whispers of an unknown world were heard. At one point the heroine, or hero as she would now be referred to, came upon a valley in which flickering lights could be seen in the huts. Astoundingly they were tallow candles and she then knew the world she had believed in was truly lost.<br><br>Then a techno magic a valley in the mountains, hidden by an electronic shield and inhabited by beautiful people and a real hunk she just couldn’t do without magically appeared. The place was a combination of Shangri-la and New York City. Abounding in endless techno and monetary plenty, without the distraction of poor folks, everyone worshiped the almighty dollar and inculcated the perfect emotion – greed. The nasty techno-science myth generated by that book, Atlas Shrugged, [Yeah, I really read it three times, then I grew up and realized what dangerous nonsense it is] has for over two generations been a bible for the likes of Alan Greenspan, a generations of neo-con economists and now Tea Party types. In that context the works of Clarke and Asimov seem benign. It also demonstrates the power of myth even if that myth is massively destructive to our society.<br><br>Now we anticipate a brief moment in time in which the current myth is extinguished and a desperate world is ready to listen. Looking back at a Science Fiction such a hope is akin to the regular appearances of an electronic apparition in the Foundation Trilogy which guided the nascent society on its path to the future. Unfortunately events overran this nifty plan when a long known and expected appearance of an electronic apparition was not witnessed by anyone due to the turmoil associated with events then ongoing in the wider universe of the novel. <br><br>As with the novel our expected “window of opportunity” will open at some point in the midst of increasing chaos due to our accelerating collapse. Sadly that long coveted moment of enlightenment when the wider society realizes the true nature of our predicament will likely be lost, extinguished in the chaos of then ongoing events.<br><br>Houner<br><br><a href=#c8226760903874676574 title="comment permalink">9/1/11, 9:06 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the link to the Amadis translation!<br><br>Don, I'd put in a word for <i>Commando Cody, Sky Marshal of the Universe</i> -- unbelievably trashy, but fun. <br><br>Andrew, good. You get today's gold star. <br><br>Robo, the thing most people don't remember about Sputnik I is the sheer panic it caused in the US. It's when America wets itself in fear that change becomes possible, at least for a little while. <br><br>Clarence, thank you! Quite a few old favorites there. <br><br>Cherokee, "too late" is a judgment call; too late for what? Most of the things I've been proposing in this blog for the past year or so are workable when you've already got resource shortages and are scrambling to get by with salvage and scrap -- that's why I hope to see enough people who know how to use the salvage and scrap, and can teach those of their neighbors who are willing to learn. <br><br>Hadashi, "peak peak oil" is a very crisp way of putting it. Thank you! Not that the phenomenon itself will peak, of course, but the movement -- inevitably. <br><br>Anagnosto, it's precisely the shift from wonder tales about new technology in general, to travel tales predicated on space travel, and then to general fantasy with bits of machinery thrown in here and there, that I want to trace here. <br><br>Phil, I dropped out in the 80s when cyberpunk became all the rage. I found it stunningly dull -- a tame rehash of then-contemporary hacker-and-slacker culture with just enough spaceships thrown in to sell it to Tor Books -- and most of what wasn't cyberpunk was basically going through overfamiliar motions.<br><br>Andrew, that's one of those little difficulties in the way of the dream of space migration. When European settlers got to America, they didn't find a wilderness -- they found two continents that had been thoroughly settled millennia ago, but 98% of the inhabitants had just died of smallpox. Mapping that experience onto the far more overwhelming task of settling someplace that doesn't even have a biosphere is a grand source of misperceptions.<br><br><a href=#c4655948278249046232 title="comment permalink">9/1/11, 9:12 AM</a><br><br>

I can certainly see a movie of <i>Moon</i>, but the Foundation Trilogy? A vast, unworkable mess. Hard to do it in less than a 30 hour miniseries. <br><br>Siani, thank you. <br><br>Les, the zeitgeist isn't some sort of outside force; it's composed of the conversations and collective imagination within a particular culture or subculture. Newton and Liebniz were both part of a lively, fiercely competitive mathematical community in seventeenth century Europe, working to exploit the possibilities opened up by Descartes' revolutionary algebraization of geometry, and the calculus was a logical extrapolation from work that they and others had already done. If they'd both grown up reading stories about brilliant mathematicians who'd figured out a way to represent dynamics in the form of equations, it would be fair to say that those stories hadn't simply reflected a zeitgeist, but had actually helped inspire their discoveries; that's exactly what happened with SF and some branches of modern technology. <br><br>Speedscribe, "science porn" is a great phrase! You're right, of course, that a lot of hard SF is busy circling the wagons, or perhaps circling the drain, making believe that their favorite gimmicks still work; I'd like to see some hard SF get past that and grapple with futures in which the endless gravy train doesn't keep rolling. <br><br>Grrl, the best of the genre was stunningly good, and not least because of its willingness to grapple with massive moral issues at a time when most other contemporary fiction was busily evading them. <br><br>Mister Roboto, bearing the weight of a civilization's blind spots and habitual self-delusions is the natural environment of subcultures like the one that's grown up around peak oil. I worry a great deal more about what happens when it becomes popular in a big way, five or ten years from now.<br><br>Scyther, good. You're quite right; the core premise of most SF is falsified by the mess we've made with the technology and the biosphere we've got. <br><br>Maria, do that. We'll be talking about that quite soon. <br><br>DIYer, I'd recommend that!<br><br>Bill, you're preaching to the choir! I think Atwood is trying so hard to claim that she's not a SF writer because there's still, in many minds, a division between SF and "real literature," and she's staked out her territory firmly on one side of that boundary. As for vampires and zombies, that's going to be the theme of a post one of these days, possibly this October; I don't think it's accidental, or comforting, that so many people in contemporary America are putting so much effort into fetishizing death.<br><br><a href=#c8019607196894179905 title="comment permalink">9/1/11, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

It's still got a couple of years to run as a monthly blog serial, but I'll be interested to see if I can find a home in print for my SF novel-in-progress <a href=http://starsreach.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>Star's Reach</a> when it's finished, revised, and ready for publication. <br><br>Ghung, I'll take your metaphor and raise you. The sustainability movement of the 1970s was the first volume of a series -- perhaps a trilogy, perhaps not -- and ended, as so many first volumes, do, with apparent disaster and the surviving characters scrambling around to pick up the pieces. (Think of the last chapter of <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>.) Now we're in the early chapters of volume two; the pace is picking up as our heroes and heroines hunt for the lost secrets of Green Wizardry. Will they succeed in their quest? There are still a lot of pages to read...<br><br>Cathy, I'm not sure what to say about cyberpunk and the fad for "dark" SF, as I find much of it unreadably dull. Still, I think a lot of it comes back to the same turn toward nihilism I tried to anatomize in the "Alternatives to Nihilism" series in April: the sort of brittle, jeering, sullen cult of ugliness and despair for their own sake that you find in people who know they've cashed in their ideals. SF reflects that as much as any other cultural phenomenon; it's not building a future so much as it is reflecting the self-loathing of the present. Now of course that offers some possibilities for action, at least for those who are willing to grapple with the betrayal at the root of it all, and suggest alternatives. <br><br>As for "Star's Reach," in its own way it's a very ambitious project, though I know my limits as a writer well enough to doubt that it'll succeed as fully as I'd like. In my own way I'm trying to sketch a future that could actually happen, and in the process punch past the paired fantasies of infinite progress and total apocalypse that have hogtied so many people's visions of the future.

It's not a theory backed up by a lot of data, but we decided it was worth arguing about over a beer or two.<br><br>The Zombie Apocalypse appears to be an expression of fear on the part of some that some ghastly tragedy is going to result in vast hordes of people not being able to eat, work or manage their lives. Maybe a bank crash, maybe the failure of the transport network, maybe something else. But the fear of rampaging, almost mindless hordes, coming after you, is really about a mass breakdown of society.<br><br>The ravening Vampire, on the other side, is perhaps a representation of an aristocracy or oligarchy run amok. A small cadre of individuals who use combinations of advertising, fascination, magic, and other mysterious powers to drain all the life from other people... The current "sparkle in the sun" thing is a revision based on the idea, perhaps, that we no longer regard vampires as creatures only of the night ... indeed, the unrepentant oligarchs with no sense of <i>noblesse oblige</i> are the only ones who can spend vast amounts of time out in the sun, playing and enjoying themselves...<br>And werewolves may be in a sense stories about beings that appear human but are really sociopaths in disguise. They might look like you and me, but they don't think or act like we do.<br><br>As for the technological progressivism, in a sense it's already begun. A group of adults and I held a skill share in my house, to learn soldering and basic electronics assembly. And my friend Geoff has been pressuring the folks in India who make the <a href=http://www.jaipurfoot.org/01_org_whywere&amp;areweneeded.asp rel=nofollow>Jaipur Foot</a> to share that tech with the First World — so that the folks who can't afford $10,000 leg replacements have other options. <br><br>This is part of the Green Wizardry task, too... communicating with the 'developing world' while the communications window is open and the Internet works, to transfer back some of the "appropriate tech" that we in the industrialized nations think we've already bypassed.<br><br>I built one loom this summer...

I found myself in a bit of an odd position - a "radical" green campaigner of some note who also was a public space-exploration proponent. The same impulses which had me saving whales also had me pushing for O'Neill colonies; they seemed about equal longshots in the 70's. Those enthusiasms never died, but as I immersed myself in real systems over the decades and tried to identify my own delusions in an ongoing process, many inherent limits became visible, and here I am. <br><br>Still, I think that a love of scifi, and the whole experience of living with the space program, were necessary to become who I became, and that's not lessened by the fact that man will not colonize the rest of the solar system. Big-picture thinking and a certain audacity were nurtured by those things, making my life a bit more preposterous and hopefully a bit more useful to the world. I think scifi may become even more valuable during the long descent, though I suppose it could become a false narrative of the legendary past rather than a false narrative of the future.

I wonder in which era people of future centuries will want to live.

Frankenstein is my favorite book, as the metaphor of the monster works on many levels (such as the risks of releasing an idea or work of art into the world, and thereby relinquishing control of it). I agree that most Sci-Fi is junk, but so is most "serious" fiction, too: nearly any highly praised novel of ten years ago is either panned now or forgotten, to say nothing of other genres like mystery, crime, or romance. More importantly, some so-called writers of serious fiction (the aforementioned Atwood, Ian McEwan, Don Delillo, and others) have incorporated science fictional elements into their recent work, which on one level is the ultimate endorsement and mark of success. Regarding the dominance of the space opera, I remember being exposed to the concept of "speculative fiction," which was essentially a less outlandish branch of Sci-Fi, that focussed on Earth, the relatively near future, and one intelligent species: us. More recently, there has been a movement for Mundane Science Fiction, which embraces many more rules; I suppose it is an attempt to reject to some degree the myths of progress and apocalypse you have addressed here. Also, Science Fiction has infiltrated movies in less obvious ways (people don't refer to the current wave of super hero films as sci-fi, but that is what they are), and even music. So, I say, Science Fiction can claim the ultimate victory: it has become an integral part of many facets of mainstream culture, to the point of being undetectable.

We've been through a very atypical age when that isn't the case. Mind you, I agree that the capacity to think through possible futures is one of the real gifts of SF, though it hasn't been used to anything like the extent that it could have.<br><br>Lew, no double post problems. Me, I read a lot of SF but preferred fantasy or stuff on the borderline; unfortunately fantasy went in directions I found even less welcome than SF. Oh well. <br><br>Grrl, funny! Not a bad description of most of the future-tech claims circulating in the peak oil scene, too. <br><br>Tully, good question. I'd say the best answer is to start writing and telling the stories now. <br><br>Artinnature, that's a useful metaphor. Meanwhile, there's half a dozen brightly lit and loudly announced emergency exits elsewhere, and all of a sudden the lights go on and the sirens go off; people rush toward one exit or another. The thing is, nobody actually knows where they lead. <br><br>Kayxyz, I think you missed my point. It's because of the US military and empire that people in the US get to use far more than their share of the world's resources and industrial products. When that empire goes down, around 80% of what's supporting your current standard of living is going to go away, and when the process ends you're going to be living in a politically fragmented and economically bankrupt Third World country that still happens to be called the United States of America. You will be much poorer than you are today -- quite possibily poor as in "how am I going to get enough to eat?" Is that a bit clearer? <br><br>Kealolo, I hope that people 2000 years from now aren't using Klingons and Martians as figures in their myths, in the full sense of the term -- that is, the stories they use to make sense of the world and themselves. On the other hand, they'd make great figures in folktales!

I've also noticed the fixation on living in the future, the past, or some other nonexistent place, and will be discussing it at some length shortly. <br><br>Cherokee, in one sense it's already too late; most of the people now alive on this planet can pretty much count on shortened lives and a plummeting standard of living over the decades to come as the consequences of a lot of very stupid choices catch up with us. In another sense, though, "too late" is an abstraction; at every point, the question is what to do about the current situation; some options have already been foreclosed, others remain open, and the choices made by the unthinking masses are probably not a good thing to follow. <br><br>Phil, Ballard's very much of a British taste, I think. I could never stand the man's writing -- I'm sure he's very good, but it rubs me entirely the wrong way.<br><br><a href=#c2775373489350417394 title="comment permalink">9/1/11, 5:13 PM</a><br><br>

Those efforts predicted things like CNN (Brunner called it the English Language Relay Satellite Service) and the sort of environmental and social degradation that have become all to normal nowadays.<br><br>Distopian stories often have a bigger impact in the long run than utopian ones. It's the old, "If this goes on..." Oh, you mean, if we keep doing "X" then it will lead to the end of civilization as we know it? Well, maybe we really don't want to keep going down that path after all! <br><br>Several people have noticed the similarity between "A Clockwork Orange" and modern life in certain precincts of not-so-Great Britain in 2011. I wonder how that happened? <br><br>The predictive or proscriptive aspect of literature was only possible during the Age of Change that we are just now leaving. In previous centuries, change of the magnitude that we have experienced since World War I was slow or nonexistent; I'm not sure how a science fiction writer of the middle ages would have handled the invention of the horse collar (a useful thing, but not as revolutionary as, say, the steam locomotive or electricity), but absent the changes made possible by the use of fossil fuels, the world of one century would look pretty much the same as any other century. Is that the future toward which we are heading?<br><br>I remember reading an old Ace Double called <i>The Masters of Evolution</i>. I don't remember the story, but the concept seems logical enough. Even without fossil fuels we can still make (r)evolutionary breakthroughs in certain fields of science and some useful technologies, especially biological (plants that use a more efficient form of photosynthesis, or Niven's "Stage Trees", for instance). And, of course, we may actually see some interesting things happening in the field of nanotechnology before the end of the petrolium age.<br><br>Human ingenuity and curiousity will still be with us long after the last drop of oil is extracted from the Alberta tar sands, so the future may not be as bleak as we might assume. <br><br>BTW, we decided to have Dad cremated instead of buried with all of our other departed relatives down around Detroit.

Where do I start? You ask some difficult questions, but you get to the truth of the matter pretty quickly. It is difficult to be on a farm of my size and produce a surplus. I'm only about 40% self sufficient.<br><br>Historically, it's worth pointing out that 90% of the population were involved in agriculture. Today it's around 2% and that is only because of the fossil fuel subsidy. <br><br>It's only because of starvation that we sussed out things like: Rhubarb stems were edible, but the leaves were poisonous. Think about it.<br><br>You've hit on my big concern.<br><br>How do we feed ourselves once the economic cost of extracting and supplying oil becomes too high? Already here we pay about $6/gallon for fuel and you can see the costs of staples rising. By the way thanks for printing all that extra money because it's artifically inflating the value of our dollar which makes purchasing oil cheaper. Thanks also for crashing your economy as it reduces demand for oil, which in turn lowers prices. Well done.<br><br>In big agri business, oil is used everywhere. It's the only way to keep labour inputs low.<br><br>I worry about grains as I've just finished a book by Sara Pilzer about growing grains on small holdings. It's a tough school and I'm in a warmer area (but less fertile) than most of you lot in the Northern hemisphere.<br><br>Dunno. As I've read plenty of times before here on this blog, "before enlightenment, fetch wood, carry water".<br><br>On a positive note, we're coming into an early Spring so a lot of the fruit trees are blossoming and some such as the Early Moorpark Apricots (and the Quinces - Smyrna and Champion) are now in leaf!<br><br>Thanks to a ruling from the WTO they're now importing apples from countries with fire blight! Well done, we used to be self sufficient in apples....<br><br>PS: I settled on a name for the farm "Fruitwood".<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5864493188957568674 title="comment permalink">9/2/11, 3:04 AM</a><br><br>

And the pace of events will be moving very rapidly, so it's unlikely to last too long before people get swept away in whatever social disruptions come along. But if such a social sentiment happens then it should be encouraged, as anything that causes more people to learn skills and techniques that may be useful is a good thing. It may just cause someone to learn the one crucial skill that allows them to survive.<br><br>It's also possible that some branches of such a movement may end up evolving into things that are less than savory. But that doesn't really matter, as such social/political structures as typically happen when societies collapse would evolve out of whatever is available anyway.<br><br>While a widespread and long lasting social movement towards sustainable living would be a wonderful development, it would be foolish to put all one's efforts in that basket. What appeals to me about the green wizard approach is that it does not require such a thing. It's likely the skills and knowledge that make it through to some future time will go through some very narrow paths, perhaps sometimes no more than one person who passes them along to one other, repeated for generations. It's not a glorious movement, it's kind of grubby and dull, but it has the best odds of success. And you can start today. If a compatible movement builds up around you, then great, and if it goes away again you're no worse off.<br><br><a href=#c2441110689018942814 title="comment permalink">9/2/11, 5:14 AM</a><br><br>

My "great books" education had the hoped-for (by the profs) effect on me, I guess.

Beautifully, poetically and classical/Shakespearean in its comedic approach (though Banville dispenses with the unities, as did Shakespeare).<br><br>Mundane Science Fiction? <br><br>Interesting idea. My daughter and I once made up some rules for fantasy, which I guess you'd call Mundane Fantasy. One is that (borrowing from Tolkien) the protagonist shouldn't be the person with the ultimate world-saving magic powers (one of the places where HPotter falls down), and another of which is that use of magic should not be the game changer (or plot rescuer) and must always exact some physical price when used. <br><br>And JMG, regarding the theme of this week's post, so if peak oil community writings and thought get pervasive enough to become a cultural mainspring our future might bend in an ecotechnic direction?

The Mushroom Planet books, too, maybe.<br><br>Justin, thanks for the correction! I'd read an essay on the movement that simply said, "No aliens" -- which seemed reasonable enough, but my story headed in other directions. I'll have to look into Mundane SF-related venues for publishing <i>Star's Reach</i> when it's done. <br><br>Simon, that's a promising notion. While we're at it, is there any way to order a couple of crates of the retired engineers who used to read every issue of <i>Analog</i> back in the day, and send long critiques on every bit of bad physics that slipped past the editors' eagle eyes, complete with calculations they'd done on the spot with their slide rules? The peak oil movement needs them -- the giddy handwaving that too often passes for talk about renewable energy sources, just for starters, belongs in a Ray Palmer magazine...<br><br>Asturchale, your point one is quite true, and is probably the reason the US didn't end up fighting a guerrilla war there, the way we did in the Philippines after seizing them from Spain. Your second point -- that's a fascinating issue, and one I'll need to think about. <br><br>Rcg1950, I don't do a lot of visual media, thus don't tend to think of movies very often. As for Van Vogt's other novels, well, the less said the better; I don't think it's accidental that his stuff has vanished off the bookshelves. <br><br>Kieran, many thanks for the links.

The archetypal trufan (="true fan"), when he wasn't up to his eyeballs in the latest issue of <i>Astounding</i>, could be found hunched over a hectograph copier producing a fanzine, muttering "Ghu guide me as I pub this ish..."<br><br>Twilight, exactly! You get today's gold star for Getting The Point. <br><br>Hapibeli, thank you. Your first comment brushed up against an issue that, against my better judgment, I'm probably going to have to discuss a few weeks down the road in so many words: the limits of magic -- that is to say, what happens when the vision of the future you build up so carefully and forcefully collides with the hard limits of the universe.

That's very generous of you. Years ago I had the chance to read an old translation that had been gathering dust on the shelf of a university library since the gods alone know when, and thought it would make a rousing contemporary fantasy epic once the very different conventions of today's fiction were applied to it. I hope somebody does that. <br><br>Sgage, feh indeed. <br><br>Escape, whether it's a complete image of humanity, it's very nearly a perfect portrait of industrial civilization, which can be best defined as a very ingenious scheme for turning resources into pollution as fast as possible. <br><br>Will, many thanks for the book suggestion -- I'll check it out. Down the road a bit -- though it will probably be in <i>Star's Reach</i> rather than here -- I have a corollary to White's Law to suggest, which may just sum up the points you've made and the broader one these last two posts have tried to make. <br><br>Adrian, oh, <i>Anathem</i>'s a pleasant read -- it has the standard bad habits of modern popular fiction, but that's hardly avoidable at this point. I just wish Stephenson had grappled a little more extensively with the implications of radically nonhuman intelligence from within that perspective. <br><br>Jon, I think the crucial thing at this point isn't to try to plan out what that literature would be like, but to get to work trying to write it. As with any creative project, too much analysis early on can strangle the process; it's far more valuable to apply the seat of the pants to the seat of the chair and the tips of the fingers to the keyboard, and get at it. <br><br>The single best piece of advice I ever received on the subject of writing came from SF editor George Scithers, who used to run <i>Asimov's</i> back in the day. He argued that every writer has a couple of million words of bad writing stored up in his or her brain, and the only way to get rid of them and get to the good stuff was to write them out. That applies to a potential project of the sort you're discussing; as Chesterton said, if something is worth doing, it's worth doing badly. <br><br>So I'd like to challenge you to imagine the kind of story that might help spark the kind of visions we need, and then sit down and write it! That goes for everyone else reading this who has thought of writing a SF story one of these days...<br><br><a href=#c1983405964514654224 title="comment permalink">9/2/11, 5:39 PM</a><br><br>

It looks as if people were just getting tired of trying things altogether. I think we have chosen to stay at home and just update our Facebook account. Sci-Fi isn`t as popular as it used to be, certainly, but it`s much worse than that: Blockbusters are not a world event as they used to be some twenty years ago and pop stars are just not as popular as they used to be. We keep talking about U2, Madonna and the Rolling Stones because there just isn`t any replacement for them…<br><br>…It`s a too old world. I think we are all in the mood of the author of Eclesiastes.<br>In a sense it`s as if this world was turning medieval again: each one isolated in its own little hamlet, just waiting for the next harvest to arrive.”<br><br>Hank Williams, Chuck Berry, the Beatles, the Stones, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash – it seems that most of the popular songs that have stood the test of time were written before the mid-70’s.<br> <br>If you pull out a guitar and play their tunes today – just one voice and one instrument, which is the true test of a popular song - they still work: Chuck Berry’s “Maybelline” or “Johnny B. Goode”; Jobim’s “Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars” or “Wave”; Hank Williams’ “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry” or “Hey, Good Lookin’”.<br> <br>The lyrics and melodies still hold up forty or fifty years later.<br> <br>The songs from last year are now largely unlistenable – and most people didn’t even bother listening to them when they first came out.<br><br>In an earlier post, I said that Julie Christie was “in her 1960’s, hot babe prime”. I hereby retract that statement.<br><br>Julie Christie really didn’t peak until “Shampoo”, which – although it was released in 1975 – had actually been filmed a couple years earlier (the star/producer Warren Beatty held the release back because he didn’t think that America was yet ready for the movie.)<br> <br>Julie Christie didn’t really become a maximally hot babe until after she turned 30. (In hotness, maturity counts; and she needed to grow up.) Which means that Julie Christie peaked in the early 1970’s.<br><br>After that, surgical enhancement of the naturally-attractive female form became all the rage, and we are now are forced to view a succession of unnatural freaks; i.e., in the real world, some women have large tops and large bottoms; some have small tops and small bottoms; and some have large bottoms and small tops. But in nature, you almost never encounter a large top with a small bottom, which is now being foisted upon us by the miracle of modern medicine as the required standard of female beauty. (Disclaimer: I always dated and eventually married medium-large/large.)<br> <br>So Julie Christie was one of the last of the naturally-hot movie stars.<br><br>Peak oil in the U.S. was (depending on your source) in 1970 or 1973.<br><br>Peak space race was the United States moon landings from 1969 through 1972.<br><br>So in the early 70’s, America simultaneously hit Peak Oil, Peak Space Race, Peak Rock ‘n Roll, and Peak Julie Christie.<br><br>Cheap gas, great tunes, naturally hot babes, rockets blasting off into outer space – it all peaked forty years ago.<br><br>We were living the good life at the top of the hill in a science fiction fantasy world.<br><br>Maybe this helps to explain why so many people feel that “What’s the use? It’s all downhill from here.”<br> <br>It’s not the end of the world, but the world we’re currently living in is definitely downhill from where we were living forty years ago; and the world were moving to is way down in the misty valley below.<br><br>And who knows?

Stephenson's Snow Crash, around the same time, actually shaped the real world as we know it now, and described the collapse of nation-states followed by the rise of successor entities based on anything from organised crime syndicates to ethnic groups to philosophical entities.

I did like reading Larry Niven once upon a time. Relative to this post, and as good a confirmation of it as you'll get, I recall a piece of his called simply <i>Space</i>, a non-fictional record of the activities of the Citizens' Advisory Council for a National Space Policy, which he set up with Jerry Pournelle. <br><br>It was textbook example of what JMG has mentioned is the way democracy can be made to work for you -- get a bunch of people together and make a noise. The Council wanted to energise the US space program and produced documents called things like, <i>How to Save Civilisation and Make a Little Money</i>. They wanted to use the market to boost things and came up with some neat stuff which has signally failed to occur.<br><br>What strikes one is the tremendous confidence:<br><br><i>Twenty-five years ago, my ambition was to tell stories. It wasn't long before I decided I could save civilisation too.</i><br><br>I wonder what he's thinking now? I'd really love his reaction to this post. It's significant that he couldn't allow himself to write his own disappearing-resource story as sf -- it's a fantasy called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magic-Goes-Away-Thus-Inscribed/dp/B000TMFFUY/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1315084858&amp;sr=1-3" rel=nofollow><i>The Magic Goes Away</i></a>. Convenient -- fantasy with built-in obsolescence, ready to give way to the rational. I'll admit re-reading it left a bad taste. The highest compliment he can pay ancient magicians is to say they thought like modern scientists, and he positions our technoculture as their heir. (Riding on a cloud, the characters wonder if any human after them will ever see this view of the planet... you can feel Niven grinning through his beard at the cleverness of those who now do.)<br><br>He always has this idea that knowledge <i>should</i> be used to gain power. Did Campbellian sf really exist? Did people really think we were that clever? <br><br>I've been playing with a couple of ideas for 'mundane fantasy'... yes, more like JMG's version, with stuff that can really happen, but more on the energy work and trance front than on JMG's Golden Dawn style.

As a result she can tell by watching (but without describing, dang it!) the exact moment when to ask a horse to respond.

There was discussion of the high rate of change in modern life versus the gradual evolutions of earlier times. Then the example of people who join a club or organization then don’t have time or energy to participate. Finally, there have been many observations and examples that illustrate the apparent decline of Western popular culture as expressed in music and literature.<br><br>It does seem that the developed nations have come to a point where almost everything has gotten to be “too much”, and we are all suffering from at least one form of exhaustion.<br><br>The basic human organism is apparently incapable of absorbing environmental and lifestyle changes anywhere near as quickly as technological societies have been forcing themselves to do since the burning of fossil fuels made it so easy to speed things up.<br><br>Maybe the joyful and creative flames have died in so many of us because we have blown them out with the onrushing wind of our speeding contraptions and frantic consumptions. Perhaps our inner creative fires will have a chance to rekindle when things start to slow down. We’re not machines, after all, much as we’ve tried to be.<br><br>Younger generations in the most depleted and desperate cultures seem to have widely recognized this need for change, and appear to be addressing the prospect of a lifetime of economic decline. As mentioned earlier, many are attracted to things like vampires, zombies and werewolves. Perhaps it’s a way to pre-connect with a perceived future that will be more primitive, mythical and magical. <br><br>Ironically, they use the latest high-tech gadgets to form their tattooed virtual tribes, ignoring the centrally-programmed mass communications regimes that so shaped the lives of their parents and grandparents.There’s a movie out this weekend that may be directly addressing this techno/mythic split . It’s a science-fiction / zombie horror hybrid called “Apollo 18”. Haven’t seen it yet, though.<br><br><a href=#c5638448924811800601 title="comment permalink">9/3/11, 6:51 PM</a><br><br>

They had a good selection of trashy paperbacks, and magazines -- that's where I bought my first copy of <i>F&amp;SF</i> -- that's <i>Fantasy and Science Fiction</i> to the nonfan world -- with stories by LeGuin, Moorcock, and Zelazny among others. Pellucidar with an E, by the way; I used to win trivia competitions with details like that. <br><br>Robert, of course! Dissensus, again; there's got to be a good amount of diversity of skills being preserved. <br><br>Cherokee, I don't think culture has peaked at all -- the specific culture of late industrial civilization is a pretty fair mess, but that's a passing thing. One thing to look forward to, though none of us will see it: the decline and fall of a civilization usually gives rise, after an interval, to true epic poetry. The Gilgamesh epic, the Iliad and Odyssey, the Mahabharata, the Nibelungenleid and the Arthurian legends -- well, I could go on. That's probably six to eight centuries from now, but if past experience is anything to go by, the results ought to be stunning. <br><br>Grrl, the parallel between <i>Revolt in 2100</i> and the trajectory of Marxism gets you today's gold star for perspicacity. Marxism is a Christian heresy, anyway, so the parallel's very exact. The bumper sticker's a good one, too, though nobody will get it; I've pondered a button saying RUSSELL EIGENBLICK FOR PRESIDENT along the same lines, knowing that it will get blank stares. <br><br>Carp, as with Ballard, I don't claim it's not good; I simply don't like it. Among other things, I don't share the values and interests of the hacker-and-slacker subculture that's its main audience and the source of most of its themes, so it's a bit like reading erotica written by somebody with passionate fantasies about sea slugs; however proficient the prose may be, it simply doesn't speak to me. <br><br>Jason, I enjoyed Moorcock when he was still writing trashy heroic fantasy; the sophisticated literary stuff he's doing these days, not so much. Niven -- yes, I'm not surprised he thought he could save the world. I recall his story in one of the <i>Dangerous Visions</i> anthologies that insisted that the technology at the center of his story was inevitable and we'd all better deal with the consequences. No, it didn't happen, either. <br><br>Cathy, that piece of Jeffers is one of my very favorites. He was so controversial back in the day that his publisher stuck a note in one of his books of poetry distancing themselves from his opinions. Can you imagine <i>anybody</i> getting that bent out of shape about a poet these days? <br><br>Lew, interesting! Thanks for the link. <br><br>Kayxyz, good. That's exactly the sort of thing I'd like to see more people doing, because it's going to mean that many fewer people struggling to fend off death from hunger, sickness, and exposure, and failing.<br><br><a href=#c2536848449280612474 title="comment permalink">9/3/11, 8:57 PM</a><br><br>

I hear you though, man. <br><br>Still Kanye West's latest album was a truly dark and melodic look at US culture. I enjoyed it and it gets a lot of play on the youth station JJJ here. No need to respond as I'm being serious and not trying to stir you or anyone else. <br><br>I enjoy the zietgeist of music and I reckon as times get darker, the music just gets better. I agree with you about the epics too and would love to read them, however, we unfortunately probably won't be around at that time.<br><br>I look forward to your treatise on vampires, werewolves etc. I've seen some of the True Blood show and it's just silly.

I'm in awe of such writing.<br><br>Hey Carp,<br><br>I know... It's just that no one around here would get it as there's little Welsh influence. It was actually the Scottish who settled these parts (something about the relatively cold winters and mountains I guess) and I too claim heritage from them on both sides although my lot have been in Oz for around 7 generations. I'm probably showing my ignorance too, but after all this time, all I can claim from the Scotts is a name - Years ago I had three lovely Scottish ladies working for me (by a strange coincedence) and it took me ages to attune to their accents.<br><br>Hey hadashi,<br><br>Yeah, I know. Unfortunately, there are legal issues around the use of the word Organic that I don't want to go into.

What a nuisance. <br><br>Anyway, for commenters here there's a kind of intimate tone and sometimes I feel that I've revealed too much of my own opinions, some of which are socially unpalatable and I only hope they don't come back to bite me.

Star Trek, for instance, flippantly dispensed with routine poverty, disease, crime, and class conflict. Good luck with that. On the flip side, a remarkable number of dystopian future novels describe societies where the government has somehow managed to successfully suppress -- not just drive underground, but actually prevent -- all unregulated sex (or all sex altogether, when artificial gestation is thrown in). Good luck with that.<br><br>JMG, a central feature of your vision of the future is a long list of "things that are going away." Some entries on that list have sound rationale for being there, others not so much. One frequent possible weakness is the assumption that just because certain things exist today as part of a specific complex interconnected economic system, they can <i>only</i> exist that way.<br><br>The actual future is invariably more complex and diverse than any visions of it. For instance, even considering the entire materials life cycle, LED lights are more practical than candles, in any future except one in which the knowledge of how to make them has been completely lost. A scenario might be completely plausible in which they are extensively used, but produced in only a few dedicated enclaves, and transported by sailing ships and mule carts.<br><br>Thus, the closest literary archetype for our long-term future may never have been the starship heroes of space SF nor the dehumanized downtrodden proles of dystopian screeds, but rather, the <i>elves</i> of Tolkien and a thousand derivative genre fantasy books. Aren't the elves always lamenting a previous age of greatness (which, when examined more closely, always sounds violent and generally unpleasant)? Aren't they usually seen living in harmony with nature and yet exerting a certain mastery over it, in a garden-tending way, shaping species and environments to their own benefit? And isn't their appropriate-magic usually based on crystals (i.e. silicon)? <br><br>If so, let's not forget to leave a few terrifying weapons of mass destruction hidden away underground, so that future dark lords and future questing heroes will have something to contend over.<br><br><a href=#c2427902237001091474 title="comment permalink">9/4/11, 9:29 AM</a><br><br>

I think you're stretching things a bit by comparing the things that the Star Trek universe claimed we'd get rid of, like war -- which has been around throughout human history -- with some of the things I expect us to lose the ability to produce or maintain, many of which have only been in existence for a short time and depend on nonrenewable resources. There's also the economic issue, which most fans of technology avoid altogether -- whether or not it's possible to make something is, in practical terms, far less important than whether making it can pay for itself given the economy in existence at the time; if LEDs go out of existence, it'll most likely be because maintaining the enclave that makes it would cost too much compared to the other alternatives.

Especially when it comes canned with all of the nostalgia for the pop products of a generation that really, weren't that great, folks. I'm saying this as someone who falls squarely in the middle of the boom: date of production 1953. All I'm saying is, is it possible that there's a general malaise that has probably leaked into the larger population and a lot of popular culture because of the very real exhaustion felt by the mid-40s through mid-60s currently making their way through time's digestive system? I know I sure feel that way a lot of the time.<br><br>Not just from age, of course. It's daunting, knowing what's most likely ahead for our children if not for us, and probably why a lot of people just push the snooze button rather than waking up to the enormity of what needs to be done.

I think this is just what a lot of people are going through these days.<br><br>When I was in my 20s in the mid-70s I studied the Club of Rome report and writings by Ehrlich, Dassman, and enough others to already have a pretty negative attitude about the future of industrial civilization. But I was anything but exhausted: I looked at it as a great adventure ahead. Little did I know that it wouldn't catch up till I was old enough to be exhausted by the thought. But at the time, I studied martial arts, body work, herbs, gardening, community, political action, and thought I would live in a better world for all of the changes coming. Sometimes, I can still rekindle that spirit, or at least maintain a slow pace, step-by-step, building something I hope will matter. I sure hope young people today can capture a little of that feeling and not be sucked down into the terminal depression and bitterness of their elders.<br><br>Oh, and rock &amp; roll has always been crappy music. It's just that youth once gave it enough energy, excitement, and immediacy that we could ignore it. The last hurrah of that kind of vitality went out not long after the Clash broke up, if you ask me. Now that it's the province of the geriatric crowd, I don't blame the young for going for other sounds, or recycling the old stuff.<br><br><a href=#c6155982191691690364 title="comment permalink">9/4/11, 6:51 PM</a><br><br>

Published in 1979, it was a survey of horror films and literature over the previous three decades. King is very good at explaining what horror is and how it works. According to King, horror works on "phobic pressure points." And because books and film are mass media..."the horror genre has often been able to find national phobic pressure points, and those books and films which have been the most successful almost always seem to play upon and express fears which exist across a wide spectrum of people. Such fears, which are often political, economic, and psychological rather than supernatural, give the best work of horror a pleasing allegorical feel..."<br><br>When I picked it off my bookshelf the other day, I was surprised to rediscover that it opens with the launch of Sputnik: "Terror--what Hunter Thompson calls 'fear and loathing'--often arises from a pervasive sense of disestablishment: that things are in the unmaking."

My main point is that speculative fiction of all kinds tends to organize each future scenario around one single consistent motif.<br><br>In my youth, nuclear war, in the public imagination (including countless works of fiction) meant either immediate total human extinction, or a social and cultural clean slate for a few scattered survivors. That's because those "end of the world" possibilities (with or without also beginning a supposed new world) fit the motif. They are also much easier in all respects to think about. A messy aftermath for hundreds of millions of survivors would be far more likely but almost literally unimaginable.<br><br>Such simplification is fine for fiction, but it is never accurate prognostication. The habits of storytellers ill-serve prophets. And yet, historically, serious prognostication appears to be as motif-driven as popular fiction.<br><br>The issue I wonder about in the ecotechnic scenario is predicting the survival (or reinvention) or disappearance of technologies based on their complexity (necessity for centralized specialized manufacture from traded and transported resources) without regard for their value. High-complexity low-value technologies (SUVs) disappear. Simple. Low-complexity high-value technologies (knives) tend to survive. Simple. Low-complexity low-value technologies (dolls) tend to survive, at least sporadically. Even hungry people make dolls.<br><br>The likely simplicity-breaker, the unknown territory, is high-complexity high-value technologies. Composite bows, silk fabric, and Almagests aren't quite, I admit, in the same complexity class as dynamos, calculators, and automatic firearms. (Nor are they quite as valuable.) So there is little historical precedent for what happens to them in a protracted collapse, especially when information on how to make them starts out in millions of copies, instead of a handful of scrolls in libraries.<br><br>As fine as <i>Little, Big</i> is, <i>My</i> favorite John Crowley novel, in fact my favorite single book of any kind, is <i>Engine Summer</i>. It depicts a tiny portion of a post-collapse world, merely hinting at the diversity of it, but visits stable communities (Little Belaire, and arguably Dr. Boots' List), scavengers and reconstructionists (the latter represented by a puzzle-solving hermit poignantly oblivious of how tiny a scrap of the past he possesses), and preservationist enclaves (the off-screen manufacturers of the indispensable Four Pots). Certain elements make it unrealistic, but it is realistically complex, an odyssey of dissensus.<br><br><a href=#c6927808608700087414 title="comment permalink">9/7/11, 4:24 PM</a><br><br>

It relates, in story form, what it was like to live in Edo Japan on solar energy plus gravity. Japan had a stable population of 30 million people for a long time. My guess is that if you forced the existing people in Japan to live on solar energy and gravity, a lot fewer than 30 million would survive. Therefore, the issues are both recovering from the collapse of a certain kind of modern culture and also remastering the skills required to live on solar plus gravity.<br><br>I cannot think of any fundamental way in which we modern people are more prepared to live on solar plus gravity than the Edo Japanese. Therefore, I regard the stories laid out in the book as about the best we can achieve--and that won't be easy.
