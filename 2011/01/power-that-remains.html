The passing of fitness icon Jack Lalanne, who died last Sunday at the age of 96, called up a modest flurry of tributes and retrospectives in the media, and a great many of these made a point I don’t think their authors had in mind. If I’d tried to dream up an imaginary example of the way our culture’s obsessions distort our sense of history, I doubt I could have managed anything half so telling.<br><br>Not, you understand, that Lalanne’s life and achievements didn’t deserve the attention the media gave them, or indeed a good deal more than they’re likely to get. If the value of an exercise system is best measured by the long-term health and strength of its chief promoter, which seems fair enough, Lalanne is hard to beat, given that he was still doing strength feats in his nineties that would put most of today’s muscular twentysomethings to shame. Nor were these achievements the result of the gimmickry that so often catapults people to their fifteen minutes of fame; Lalanne’s feats as well as his career as a fitness teacher were achieved the old-fashioned way, through the unfaddish combination of sound practical advice, hard work, and a cheerful and consistent willingness to walk his own talk.<br><br>No, the thing that made the media tributes so striking is the extraordinary way that they edited Lalanne right out of his actual historical context. Stories in print and electronic media alike called Lalanne a pioneer, the man who first taught Americans to exercise. It’s no discredit to the man to point out that he was nothing of the kind. Lalanne was, rather, one of the very last great figures in what was once a huge and influential movement in American culture, and has now been systematically erased from our collective memory. <br><br>The phrase that was standard before that erasure took place was “physical culture.” From the 1870s until the Second World War, across the English-speaking world and in many other countries as well, those words conjured up much the same imagery that the current Lalanne retrospectives put back into circulation, however briefly, in the imagination of our time: a genial blend of robust exercise, healthy eating, spectacular feats of strength, and more or less colorful showmanship. Against a background of Victorian ladies doffing their corsets to swing Indian clubs, young men stripped to the waist hefting kettlebells full of lead shot, and circus strongmen challenging all comers to match them lift for lift, scores of figures now forgotten made their names into household bywords: Eugen Sandow, whose impressive exploits and even more impressive physique first made weightlifting fashionable in the Western world; Genevieve Stebbins, who taught exercise to three generations of American girls around the turn of the last century; Joseph Greenstein aka “The Mighty Atom,” the diminutive Polish-American strongman whose signature trick was tying a #2 iron horseshoe into an overhand knot with his bare hands, and many more – among them, and far from the least, Jack Lalanne.<br><br>It takes only the briefest bout of research, especially in the age of the internet, to uncover all this and put Lalanne into his proper context. Why, then, the distortion of history, reminiscent of nothing so much as those Politburo photos from Stalin-era Russia from which former members were so studiously erased? Why, for that matter, is it a fairly safe bet that when Jane Fonda passes away, the media will briefly if lavishly praise her as the pioneer who taught America to exercise, and pretend that Jack Lalanne never existed?<br><br>There are at least three reasons, and all of them are relevant to the wider project of this blog.<br><br>The first, a point discussed here tolerably often, is the contemporary American obsession with fantasies of progress. We don’t like to think about the fact that by and large, Americans these days are weaker, less healthy, and less capable than their great-grandparents. When we do think about that, we like to frame it in a narrative that turns it into a brand new problem ready for some clever solution or other – that is to say, another opportunity for progress. Now it so happens that declining health and fitness in industrial societies has been a recognized issue since the nineteenth century, the physical culture movement emerged as a response to that issue, and what we are pleased to call cultural progress since that time has undercut the response and made the situation significantly worse, but this doesn’t fit the sort of historical narrative most of us prefer. The tacit amputation of the past is a neat solution to that difficulty.<br><br>The second reason, which is closely related to the first, is that from its beginning, the physical culture movement took a critical stance toward the products of industry and the lifestyles made possible by the extravagant use of fossil fuels. That expressed itself in a great many obvious ways – Jack Lalanne’s trademark habit of teaching people to exercise using simple household items instead of expensive apparatus, and his insistence on leaving most industrially processed foods out of the diet, are classic examples – but it also ran right down to the root assumptions of the whole movement. The core idiom of modern industrial society, after all, is the replacement of human capacities with gaudy technological crutches; we buy cars as substitutes for feet, televisions as substitutes for imagination, and so on. <br><br>Physical culture focused instead on developing the innate, extraordinary capacities hardwired into the human individual. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when a great many people were deeply concerned about the consequences of human dependence on an industrial technostructure, that was an exhilarating prospect, and it’s no accident that the most famous stunts of the more colorful physical culturists very often took the form of an unassisted human body accomplishing some feat usually left to machines. These days most of us have surrendered to the technostructure so completely that we try to avoid thinking of the downside of that surrender, and spectacles that astonished and delighted our great-grandparents make today’s audiences uncomfortable and bored. How many people would turn out nowadays to watch the Mighty Atom tie horseshoes into knots? We’ve all seen fancier things done with CGI, and CGI allows us to avoid the awkward and quite explicit subtext of the Mighty Atom’s demonstrations, which was that anybody who was willing to do the necessary work could accomplish the same thing – or, for that matter, very nearly anything else.<br><br>That brings up the third reason why Jack Lalanne had to be presented as a unique, eccentric, and therefore harmless figure, rather than the last major public exponent of a movement that invited everyone’s participation. His accomplishments, like those of the great physical culturists before him, depended on something utterly unmentionable in contemporary industrial culture. It’s more strictly tabooed than sex or death or the total dependence of today’s middle-class American lifestyles on Third World slave labor. Yes, we’re talking about self-discipline.<br><br>It’s an interesting wrinkle of history that imperial societies in decline normally fear what’s left of their virtues far more than they fear their vices. James Francis’ useful 1994 study <i>Subversive Virtue: Asceticism and Authority in the Second-Century Pagan World</i> chronicles how Rome’s rulers found the reasoned self-discipline taught by Stoic and Platonic philosophies an unendurable challenge to their authority. You can find similar conflicts in the history of imperial China, the Muslim world, or, really, wherever the decline of imperial states is well enough documented. The reason behind these conflicts is simple enough: people who are ruled by their passions and appetites can be ruled just as efficiently by any political system willing to pander to those things, while those who control themselves can’t reliably be controlled by anyone else. Thus the Roman government regularly sent Rome’s philosophers into exile, failing Chinese dynasties praised Confucius to the skies while doing away with anybody who took his teachings too seriously, and modern America uses every trick in the media’s book to marginalize those who remind us that the life of a channel-surfing couch potato might not express the highest potentials of our humanity.<br><br>The taboo on self-discipline in contemporary America is all the more intriguing because just at the moment, sadomasochism has become the hottest new fad on the American left. Connoisseurs of the return of the repressed have much to appreciate in the spectacle of a subculture that claims to place an absolute value on human equality, but is busily getting its rocks off by acting out fantasies in which male dominance and female submission are far and away the most popular themes. Still, I suspect that part of what set this fad in motion is an inchoate but widespread sense that there are whole worlds of human possibility that can’t be reached by drifting along aimlessly and doing whatever seems easiest at the moment. Those who have that sense and are unable to conceive of self-mastery inevitably seek masters elsewhere; we will be very fortunate indeed if that quest goes no further than latex lingerie and a fashion for wearing leather collars.<br><br>However that process works out, though, Jack Lalanne and the movement that gave him his context have another lesson to teach that will be of key importance in the decades to come. The replacement of human capacities with technological crutches that provides industrial society with its central idiom depends utterly on the ability of industrial society to keep itself fueled with the energy resources that keep those crutches powered, supplied with spare parts, and replaced when they break down. As we move further into the twilight space beyond the world peak of conventional petroleum production, the ability to keep those resources flowing as abundantly as current expectations demand is coming into question. Those nations with the power to push their way to the head of the petroleum feeding trough are doing so with even more alacrity than before, while those shoved back to the end of the line are increasingly facing crippling energy shortages. Within nations, those classes and pressure groups with a similar preponderance of power are behaving in much the same way, with similar results.<br><br>The instinctive response to these struggles is generally to get right down there into the mud-wrestling pit and fight for a share. A more effective strategy, though, might well take the opposite tack. When a resource is depleting and no plausible replacement for it is in sight, staying dependent on that resource is a fool’s game; even if you win this round, sooner or later you’re going to lose, and time that could have been spent learning to function without the resource has been wasted floundering around in the mud. Phase out your dependence on the resource before you have to do so, recognizing that the actual requirements of human existence are quite modest and can be met in many different ways, and you put yourself in a much better position for the future.<br><br>Over the weeks to come, as this blog returns to the nitty gritty of the Green Wizards project, we’ll be discussing various ways to cut back on dependence on fossil fuels and the goods and services they provide. Much of the material to be covered in the posts to come will involve tools and devices of various kinds – most of them cheap, many of them suited to basement-workshop manufacture, all of them means toward a certain degree of independence from the vagaries of an industrial civilization that faces a rising spiral of crises and an increasing lack of ability to provide its inhabitants with the goods and services they have become used to getting from it. Still, it’s too often forgotten that the vast majority of the energy and technology most of us use each day goes to provide support of various kinds for an individual human body and mind. If that body and mind require less support from outside their own boundaries, there’s less need for the energy and technology in the first place. When every other source of power runs short, that’s the power that remains.<br><br>This doesn’t necessarily mean that you ought to break out the Indian clubs and kettlebells and download a couple of old physical culture manuals off the internet, or for that matter pick up an old Jack Lalanne book or two, though I certainly wouldn’t discourage anybody who chooses to do this; there’s a certain definite attraction, after all, in the prospect of reaching one’s nineties with the kind of physique and vitality that most thirty-year-olds only dream about. What it means, rather, is that a certain capacity to cope with physical challenges, take over responsibility for your own health, and get by comfortably in most situations without a great deal of technological assistance, are all useful items in the toolkit of anyone who hopes to face the difficult years ahead with any degree of efficiency and grace. How you choose to pursue that is up to you, but however you do it, if you do it, I suspect that Sandow, Stebbins, the Mighty Atom, and all their sturdy peers – Jack Lalanne very much among them – would be pleased.

I grew up thinking (because of my father) that Jack Lalanne was the paragon of what it meant to be actually fit, rather than muscle-bound from a gym.<br><br>I'm wondering how what you wrote interfaces with two things. The fist is the sub-sub-culture of feats of physical strength like that of the great atom mixed with fundamentalist Christian ideology. If you look on youtube you can find quite a few examples of big men ripping phone books apart to show the strength of God's love for us all and similar, um, analogies one might say to be polite.<br><br>The other thing that is often left out in most ideas of independence, be it physical, mental, spiritual, or what have you, is our responsibility to each other. It's all well and good to try to free one's self from society's tyranny, but if we don't take helping those around us as a central part of any good life, we've internalized one of the central toxic messages of our culture, that of self-centered, got-mine-where's-yours-ism.

I suppose that if, as seems likely, the availability of desk jobs tails off, combined with an increasing need for human labour (i.e. muscle power) a lot of people are going to find things a bit tough.<br><br>I took on a labouring job about three years ago, working on a building site mixing cement and that kind of thing. Before then I'd had only desk jobs and, although it was a strain at first, I soon became a lot fitter and tougher. I'd be very physically tired at the end of each day and slept like a baby. I loved it.<br><br>Also, the feeling of accomplishment was much greater. I remember building a stone wall from 'waste' rocks that had been dumped in a ravine by highway building contractors - it was the first actual real solid thing I had ever been paid to make (prior to that I had been (don't laugh) an energy trader at a big company (no, not Enron, but almost)<br><br>I'm not saying that things will necessarily be 'better' if we all give up our desk jobs - many people would face awful challenges. I was lucky in that I had a good boss and was working on 'eco' projects, rather than industrial building sites.<br><br>As an aside, here in Denmark - and I'm pretty sure it is the same in the US - there is a craze for power tools which means that almost any job can be done with the minimum of effort. I was astonished recently to see that, seemingly overnight, everyone at the local allotment had diesel powered wheelbarrows, complete with 4WD and gearboxes. Now, I'm sure that these can be very useful things, but I couldn't help notice that most of them were being used to move hedge cuttings. <br><br>Whatever next, I wonder.<br><br><a href=#c3319214351028696539 title="comment permalink">1/26/11, 11:58 PM</a><br><br>

He was impressive indeed, and every able-bodied person would do well to develop his attitude toward rigorous exercise. I'm sure I will one of these days. <br><br>"All the power that is or ever was is here now," astrologer and radio host Caroline Casey likes to remark. Which is very encouraging, but I presume she's talking about magical and spiritual power, not the sort that comes from the socket or from coal-fired power plants. <br><br>You may be aware that Gore Vidal has often referred to the USA as "the United States of Amnesia." I can think of a good example of this even from within my own lifetime. Last year I came across a splashy coffee table book about the 1960s that purported to tell modern youth what it was all about. Only the authors seemed to have overlooked the fact that, for instance, at that time many young people became involved in sex. Also they apparently never heard that a lot of folks back then often consumed certain exotic mind-altering substances. They didn't seem to think gay lib or the Stonewall rebellion worth mentioning. The prevalence of hitchhiking in the youth culture was likewise unmentioned. These rather large omissions left only a palatable patina of civil rights, anti-Vietnam war protests (with no reference or comparison to current wars of course), middle class-seeming communes, apparently drug-free be-ins, feminism, ecology, folk music and guru-fandom-lite: a sanitized history scrubbed clean of awkward facts that might give young folks funny ideas, and of course putting it all safely and inaccessibly in a past populated by people wearing quaintly colorful eccentric clothes. <br><br>Self-discipline: oh dear. That's going to take some work. Time to get down to it.<br><br><a href=#c8105642948613298088 title="comment permalink">1/27/11, 2:19 AM</a><br><br>

A mate of mine is quite proud that he earns his living from desk work. No disrespect to those that do, as I am also one of those although not on the same schedule as everyone else. He is now into his early 40's, quite portly and abhors manual labour (he is a Spanish bullfighter, is he not? hehe!). Actually, I came across someone a few years ago that was proud of not being able to put together an IKEA bookcase.<br><br>Seriously though, I've been building my own house over the past 2 years (almost finished!) and it is physically hard. You also have to be able to plan ahead which is not something that I see in the general population. People always say to me, "yeah, we built our own house too and picking the tiles was really stressful". What they actually mean is that they engaged a builder to do it for them. Tiles are the least of my problems...<br><br>Mmmm, self discipline and planning. I received a large dose of this whilst young. I left home as early as possible and put myself through part time university (whilst working full time) to get a degree (over 8 years and completed with honours plus another 2 1/2 years for a post grad). Nothing quite teaches you self discipline like having to make the conscious decision to study when all of your mates are partying away and you live in a house where it's also going off tap. Fun times though and I wouldn't change the path that I chose!<br><br>Around here there are plenty of opportunities for walks through the bush. I've noticed something about people. If they see me, they'll accelerate to overtake me and then race on ahead. At the end of the walk though, they are knocked out and I'd be surprised if they could do the same walk the following day. Multi day walks are even stranger, day 3 is the killer.<br><br>I reckon it may have something to do with the culture of immediacy that we seem to live in. Try growing some fruit or vegetables and you have to start thinking long term. It's becoming a lost art. If your life depended on it you would take it very seriously.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c4727279408375983638 title="comment permalink">1/27/11, 2:31 AM</a><br><br>

I see this framing of reality around media and technology in the community college classes I teach, when students are astonished that I don't have a cell phone or even want one. They can't understand how I can exist without one. Most also have no clue how to begin researching something without the Internet. <br><br>When you mention people's apathy, boredom, lack of excitement about REAL LIFE physical feats, that CGI in superhero, fighting, action, and/or martial arts movies can easily surpass in effects, and which <br>therefore become the new standard for what people "can do," this of course also reminds me of something else: Magic.<br><br>One could easily argue that LaLanne, Sandow, and the others were true magicians in their ability to create changes in the real world, including their own bodies, through will and self-discipline.<br><br><a href=#c2010635645502985129 title="comment permalink">1/27/11, 5:18 AM</a><br><br>

It is much in need of being said. Having the self discipline to do what is necessary physically to stay in shape is severly lacking in our society. <br>As a martial artist who trained 4 hours a day for three years in Japan back in the 80s pushing yourself (or being pushed) out of your comfort zone challenged both your mental and physical abilities. <br>Today most people won't stand for a karate class that calls for enough repetitions to make your muscles ache.<br><br>The muscles in the body respond to what we ask of them. If we start a program of weight lifting, at first our muscles have difficulty, but soon they realize we are asking more of them and they grow stronger. <br>The body adapts to the demands we place on it.

Most of them seem to feel that they are "making do for themselves" by doing so; it is also cheaper per BTU than local electricity even if you pay other people to do all the dirty work. Still, I doubt that very many of these people have ever contemplated the extent to which they are really heating their houses with gasoline, not wood -- gasoline in the chain saws, power splitters, and trucks. I wonder if they have ever passed a thought to what this would (will) be like with cross-cut saws, axes, mauls, wedges, and hand-pulled carts. Suddenly it's not so "cheap" anymore. I wonder if anyone even knows where to get or how to fabricate a cross-cut saw anymore, much less forge an axe head? <br><br>Of course the "old ways" have their challenges too. The patch of regrowing woods I have had my eyes on for years for starting my experiments in coppicing has been raided by beavers and reduced to pungee sticks. So I have accomplished my first lesson: Don't plan your coppice near the creek! <br><br>Modern "fitness" has gone much farther away from the "physical culture" than just fad diets and expensive contraptions. My octogenarian mother has knee problems, and after having a bionic knee installed (at great expense to the taxpayers) she has finally been persuaded by her doctors, physical therapists, and son (i.e. me) that she needs to engage in a regular exercise discipline. Of course the only way this was going to happen was if I did it with her, so we got a membership in our local small-town gym and we go three times a week. Most of the "contraptions" are really very simple machines with just some levers, pivots, and pulleys, really not particularly high tech -- similar devices could be easily made from wood, rope, and big rocks. And a fair number of the guys (all guys, 100% male) who spend time in the rear room with the weights still do the old-standby basic moves that are direct muscle-pushing-big-heavy-pieces-of-steel-around. But as I have spent more time there and gotten more in to the chatter, the real sad techno-syntho side of all this has become apparent. Even here in a town of a few thousand people in an impoverished rural area, steroid use is rampant. Some of the high school football players have been taking them since they were 15 years old; most of them seem to have used the 'roids at some point. ALL the "big guys" with the traps that strain their shirts and arms the size of my legs seem to be juicers -- curiously, these unnaturally huge arms usually have christian tattoos on them -- 'roids for Jesus? If I could get the similar secrets of the young women on the cardio machines, I fear I would hear equally disturbing tales of potentially-lethal supplements and eating disorders. The all-pervasive social attitude is very clear: self-discipline is for wimps. Results are the only thing that matter, and you get these from a bottle.<br><br><a href=#c7859081275304257790 title="comment permalink">1/27/11, 7:20 AM</a><br><br>

The full historical context of his life and career would have taken valuable time to research and recount. It's easiest just to toss Jack into the memory hole for one last quick burst of flame and then move on.<br><br>As you point out, Lalanne was living proof of the personal empowerment and happiness that plain old physical fitness can bring to anyone with the discipline to maintain it. Aside from the purchase of a few books or the faithful viewing of his TV programs, no special equipment, clothing, dietary supplements or health club memberships were necessary to benefit from his methods. All it took was old-fashioned hard work and persistence; just like stoop labor on the farm, clearing the sidewalk with a shovel and driving nails with a hammer. Pretty dull stuff for our plugged-in consumer culture today. Very low tech. There's no app for it. No 'i' or 'e' anything.<br><br>Speaking of the memory hole, a few weeks past we watched the 1984 film version of "1984". I am reminded here of the scene in which Winston Smith is obliged every morning to do rigorous calisthenics under the pitiless gaze of the Telescreen. The female fitness instructor, clad in a plain jumpsuit, barks out personal admonishments to Smith in a severe and critical tone. It's physical fitness as abusive drudgery. She's a G.I. Jane Fonda and an anti Jack Lalanne. <br><br>Assuming that the telescreens remain in operation, that could be one way to keep demoralized couch potatoes moving in a dystopian future.

Out of economic necessity, I worked for a while in an S&amp;M "dungeon."

The balance of gender is such that many women working in the industry convince themselves that their job has feminist implications, which I don't particularly think is the case.<br><br><a href=#c1032010705448097099 title="comment permalink">1/27/11, 9:24 AM</a><br><br>

Why not actually go live in a cave and hunt your own food, rather than buy it from a butcher? Why not go live like Daniel Suelo? It seems more like a cult or fad to me, and Americans are always looking for the next cult or fad (note this is in the Fashion and Style section). I doubt any of these self-described cavemen would last long among the !Kung San, Inuit or Yanomamo in a real jungle as opposed to the concrete variety. Still, maybe it is a positive sign. Unfortunately, it's obvious we all can't live like that.<br><br>By far the biggest contributor to our overall poor health is the fact that most of our jobs require us to sit motionless in from of a screen for eight hours a day, minimum. The human body wasn't meant to do that. There's increasing evidence that no amount of exercise can make up for that amount of inactivity-our office jobs are literally killing us, and there's nothing we can do about it. Physical labor jobs are in short supply, and these days, the conspiracy seems to be to make them pay too little to survive.

Eschewing processed foods goes a long way toward allowing a body to fulfill its potential. I'd also like to point out that we have a dogmatic belief in the USA that if one is obese and couch-bound it is the latter that caused the former. This is not well supported by the evidence. Much more likely is that obesity and generalized physical torpor are caused by the same mechanism - disregulated fat cells. In a body where much caloric intake is promptly shunted into fat storage there is less left to promote healthy behaviors like exercising and taking an extra flight of stair.<br><br>I used to think people who were overweight had some moral weakness that thankfully I skipped past.

But in those circles it can be a real annoyance (to say the least) if it is not your particular bag. If one is an aficionado of gay erotica one can be hard pressed to find some that does not include dom/sub games, humiliation, and verbal abuse (including language that if it were uttered by a straight man might land him in court on hate crime charges). In the neopagan world I have found myself exclaiming "Sheesh, doesn't anyone just #^@&amp; anymore?!" with all these scenes, frequently dom/sub, more often than not female sub to male dom. And it's not just scenes and games, there are plenty of long-term master/slave relationships in these circles. And all the highly codified terminology and structures!

Tuesday morning, 6:15 am I discovered a flat tire on the family Honda CRV. As I suspected it was the result of working at a steel mill where random pieces of metal are part of the sifting sediment over which I must drive. Also was the reason I had no spare, since the previously punctured tire was sitting unrepaired in the spare rack. (I know, stupid! D'oh!) Anyway, the derelict minivan in our driveway has very good tires to match the CRV, only problem is the rims don't fit, (another D'oh!) so brought to the shop two flats on Honda rims and two good tires on Ford rims and had them swapped, brought them home and rotated them so best tires were on front of CRV. All in all involved 5 jack operations 6 lug-loosenings, and 6 lug-tightenings ( or something like that...) Why didn't I just call a tow truck and gotten new tires? I'm too cheap I guess, but I also saw those van tires as an available resource that wasn't being used, and the physical toil helped take my mind off the stress of the situation, and felt a heck of a lot better than waiting for the service department to open. <br><br>As a sideline, DW asked "what about when we want to get rid of the van." I replied we'll find tires when we need them, then added, more seriously than she suspects, that I thought it would make a good chicken coop and/or greenhouse. (It's already pretty useful for storage).<br><br>If that wasn't enough, we had a load of heavy snow overnight, and our power was out for several hours. Nobody panicked, but we thought about what we had and didn't have as a result (hot water but no furnace, range top but no oven, etc. Definitely not comfortable, but muddling was a possibility, and highlighted weaknesses in our preparedness -- service has been very reliable here.)<br><br>Anyway, my father-in-law thinks I'm crazy for hand-shovelling a 100' driveway while he uses a snow-blower for his 20' (he's in pretty good shape BTW). My thought, literally, is "f... that noise, give me a good shovel!" There is something about the rhythm of physical labor, whether it's sodbusting, mowing with a push (reel) mower, raking leaves, or shovelling snow that is very relaxing and invigorating, and that gives me some hope that muddling through in the long haul won't be so bad...<br><br><a href=#c7387526301796704852 title="comment permalink">1/27/11, 11:31 AM</a><br><br>

The best place to get them is on eBay. I could probably almost make one if I had to, but I'd need a long piece of spring steel. No idea how to make that. And splitting with a maul is a lot less exercise than people seem to think. It's mostly a zen thing - moving the maul the same way every time, and concentrating on the spot you want to hit. I suppose it's also a bit of learning to read the wood, so you don't try to split across a knot. Actually, it's even cheaper when you're working with the hand tools, but you do have to enjoy doing some physical labor. <br><br>And the other side is, how much better off would all the people be who are heating their houses with gas, electricity, propane, or oil?

Healthy BDSM is all about equality through consent; any sexual power dynamics that exist in a (healthy) kinky community are deliberately forged between consenting adults, rather than enforced by a broader culture. Where I live, there is TREMENDOUS overlap between the kink community and the "do it yourself" community; when we aren't getting together and screwing around, we're re-roofing one another's houses, working in gardens, sharing food canning tips, and making our own tools (including whips, floggers, and chains, of course!).

Lerwill</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I’m fascinated by subcultures and the subtle reflection they give to the subconscious of society. I believe you’ve commented previously on the new age subculture and the possibility that the next major religion may have its seeds in the present trends of ‘paganism.’ I often chat to people about what drew them towards a subculture. <br>New members of our local “Widow’s Sons” bike group (a Masonic organization) tend to join because they’ve bought a bike as a way of cutting transportation costs or beating traffic. Very few are buying the larger bikes and joining the culture for the classic themes of open roads and easy riding. They bought the bike to save money but join for the socialization. A few years ago, the members were much more inclined to be riding purely for the joy of it. Now they’re more likely to gather to chat and socialize than to partake in a weekend road trip.<br>The roleplaying community (table top gaming, another interesting subculture) has far more fantasy than science fiction games going on at present. Fantasy often reflects a desire to escape from the pressures of the moment, whereas science fiction reflects hopes for the future. Like the sales of books in the genre, science fiction does well when the hopes for the future are positive, whereas fantasy sales do better (in comparison) when people are struggling. <br>When I look at the sadomasochistic (BDSM) communities I don’t see an influx of people who lean predominantly (sorry, could not resist) to the left. Over the last year, there seems to be an influx of a younger generation who are disillusioned with politics altogether. I don’t know whether a feeling of political impotence is an underlying factor in their seeking alternative lifestyles, but some I have talked to seem almost desperate to have an area of their life that is not subject to the forces beyond their control. With some, it seems an act, an artificial personality that hides the underlying fear and insecurity that, having been the same age at the end of the Thatcher/Reagan years, I can relate to. I hate pointing out that it will not be getting better anytime soon for their generation.<br>The younger crowd tends to be strongly Dominate male/submissive female whereas older people appearing on the ‘scene’ tend to be men searching for dominant women, in particular older males seeking humiliation. Both groups seem despondent about current society - but would they have chosen to seek out that lifestyle in more affluent times? Income levels of both groups are below median in those I have chatted with. Again, it seems to be a form of escapism or a coping mechanism for these people. <br>When I began watching the sexually-oriented subcultures, I expected to see a reflection of the hedonistic aspects of the latter days of the Roman Empire take hold as the American Empire declines. Then I realized that those expectations were based on Hollywood’s portrayal of the upper classes of Roman Society, rather than the behavior of the masses that supported Rome’s elite citizens. Instead, I found pure escapism and sublimated frustration. The older generation of men entering the scene is dealing with the dissonance between social expectations of being bread winners and the reality of permanently high unemployment. The younger generation seems rudderless, they lack the self-discipline you talk of and perhaps seek it without. Eventually a demagogue will harness that energy and then I suspect the shackles that bind will no longer be just their lifestyle.<br><br><a href=#c5572984966069255273 title="comment permalink">1/27/11, 3:20 PM</a><br><br>

So I think your point mostly stands.<br><br>I ought to note that in the all male versions, these scenes play out along the traditional male power hierarchies, not gender roles -- daddy/son, guard/prisoner, coach/schoolboy, teacher/pupil, boss/employee, etc. etc. Plus a lot of really disturbing stuff which is along the lines of "real man" versus "sissy f****t" (yes, that is the language used), which always makes me see a lot of internalized self-loathing.

Even if you have a life that gets you regular physical activity and moderately heavy lifting, odds are that there are occasional events when you have to exert yourself beyond the usual routine. Sure you may have to haul 50 pound feed bags and 80 pound poles every day, but occasionally you might have to move a 400 pound piece of equipment or subdue a very strong uncooperative animal. If all your conditioning is to hoisting 50-80 pounds at a time, tackling tasks that far exceed these limits is a recipe for failure and personal injury. How many men with physically demanding occupations also wind up with wrecked backs? Enormous numbers of them. A discipline of strength training gives you the balanced muscle development and the proper body motions for handling these tasks, as well as making those 50 pound sacks and 80 pound poles much more manageable on a day-to-day basis. So yes there is real value in being able to deadlift 500 pounds and bench 300 pounds when it comes time to load that piano up in the back of the truck without injuring yourself; which, unless you are a professional piano mover, is not something that will be part of your regular daily routine.<br><br>Now as for cardio, that's another matter. If you bike to work or walk 10 miles around your ranch up and down hills every day, you probably don't need any extra cardio conditioning. <br><br>Yoga and martial arts style practices also serve a very special function that you are not likely to get in your daily routine of manual labor no matter what your occupation (with a few exceptions, of course).<br><br><a href=#c306954108887567031 title="comment permalink">1/28/11, 6:58 AM</a><br><br>

I am sure others have heard of this morning’s horrible news on the agricultural front that the USDA, in all of its infinite wisdom, approved Monsanto’s genetically-modified alfalfa lock, stock, and barrel. Like all of the other GMO garbage that this company has pumped into the U.S. food system, GMO alfalfa now runs the risk of spreading like wildfire through U.S. agriculture, including the organic sector, because of how easily it is propagated by insects. R-selected industrial agriculture wins yet again, this time possibly at the expense of K-selected organic and sustainable farmers. <br><br>While I am not surprised at how our leaders bowed to the demands of corporate interests (I seriously think these morons would contemplate selling the limbs of their second-born child if it could guarantee the creation of about five jobs), I am horrified about the detrimental environmental impacts that this decision will likely cause. These seeds will poison thousands of new acres of U.S. farmland as RoundUp and other petrochemicals will be utilized in conjunction with these genetically-modified seeds, which is just the way Monsanto wants it. I have seen stats that indicate that 1/3 of U.S. agricultural land, and about 1/10 of global crop land is now planted with Monsanto seed, which means that is also being sprayed with toxic chemicals that kill the soil and run-off into adjacent ecosystems. <br><br>The answer to this, of course, is local, sustainable agriculture of the type that you advocate through your blog and the Green Wizards project. I just think that this decision makes our work all the more crucial for the continued survival of our species at this point. The best way to defeat these entities is to deny them what they want, which is profits by eating local, rejecting industrial food, growing your own, and saving seed. That, coupled with the fact that they are playing a fool’s game by continuing to rely upon dwindling petroleum stocks to feed their gluttonous, greedy behavior, I think, will be enough to secure the future for those that do not wish to pollute our planet, or our bodies.<br><br><a href=#c3473832136397501205 title="comment permalink">1/28/11, 8:08 PM</a><br><br>

You are probably aware, as are many acupuncturists, acupressurists and other bodyworkers of the power of intention. (LaLanne, as a chiropractor might have been on some level.) I have had many hard physical jobs in my life, but they are never the same as a good, solid program of physical fitness. In fact, I came to believe over the years that hard work can be very damaging if you don't also have a workout system. It may seem paradoxical, and no one feels like doing before or after a hard day's work, but it can be the best thing you can do to avoid injuries and keep systems that you don't happen to work in your job from stiffening up and atrophying. Also very few of the most arduous jobs give you proper aerobic conditioning.<br><br>In saying all of this, understand that I'm not a very good example. I have really let myself go the last few years.

Grandparents, born 1880s, were certainly fit in a wiry sort of way. Very poor nutrition though. Oppressed by poverty.

When WW1 started the authorities were apparently shocked by the general poor physical shape of people. The reason was poverty.<br>My parents were born in the Depression. They had poor nutrition till WW2. Mum had polio in 1952, never learned to drive but would always walk to market and bring home groceries in a baby buggy. Walking, cycling kept them fit. The wartime siege diet was excellent (fresh local veg, food rationing till 1954). That generation sort of went crazy on prosperity in 60s and 70s - sugars, fats, booze, tobacco - heart and lung problems, bad teeth. The coal man of my childhood could carry hundredweight sacks all day - now the legal limit is 25kg for men. We should be aware that repetitive work like that grinds us down. We need to keep healthy backbones as long as possible in life. <br>My 50s generation has had good nutrition in later life. Also I'm the first generation for a long time that hasn't had to go to war. <br>I'm certainly stronger than most twenty-year old born in the 80s.

And JMG's crusade to remind people about physical culture also has the effect of helping to change the somewhat unhealthy, 'pale-goth-needs-more-sun' image that western occultism has for many! I don't know why that's there -- after all even dissolutes like Crowley turn out to have been capable mountaineers -- but for people like Stebbins and Greenstein, the sheer unhealth of the average lifestyle of their day absolutely made spiritual and physical development necessary partners. We just don't happen to accord as much legitimacy to that as to the asceticism of monks from thousands of miles away.<br><br>And how the nature of words changes! To belittle the western traditions of personal discipline seems the goal there too. 'Stoic', 'Epicurean' and 'Platonic' don't mean to us anything like what they would have meant to classical humans.

In societies that have a history of imposing strict social or sexual regulations upon the individual, it seems to flourish. I gather leather is big in Germany. In Japan, reputedly a rather agonistic society, S&amp;M-related material forms a substantial part of the manga market, which seems in part to function as a kind of safety valve. By contrast, in easygoing Thai society with its relatively relaxed morés and emphasis on being "sanook" (fun, lighthearted) there doesn't appear to be any sadomasochism. The Thai just can't relate to that phenomenon, and it completely baffles them, or so I've heard. <br><br>I don't really believe that a resurgence of S&amp;M is the result of ever more permissiveness. The Romans didn't practice it that I've ever heard of, and they had far fewer sexual restrictions than any post-Christian western society. Perhaps they didn't play master-slave games because they had real masters and slaves. The closest thing to a reassignment of power relationships in that society that I've ever heard of would be the reversal of roles during the Saturnalia. <br><br>Too bad no Dr. Kinseys can time travel back to that festival to report for us what really went on. I fancy Caesar Augustus and his successors might have found quite interesting the notion of statistical analysis, if they didn't have their own prototypical version thereof.<br><br><a href=#c5626972139339336463 title="comment permalink">1/29/11, 1:18 PM</a><br><br>

Chain saws are among them. <br><br>Chris, that's what I call "yuppie logic" -- driving to the gym to pay to use a walking machine, mowing the lawn with a riding mower and then paying for aerobics classes to get the exercise you didn't get from a push mower, etc. Gah. <br><br>Scarlet, I didn't know that was something you were into! We may need to have a conversation about that sometime soon. <br><br>Bill, hmm. Do people in cultures where everything is done by muscles have exercise programs? <br><br>Blue Sun, excellent! You get today's gold star for cultural conservation. Don't let anybody tell you that the stuff you're saving isn't important, either.<br><br>Hal, good. There's some evidence that Chinese martial artists were up on what was going on in Western physical culture, and borrowed things as needed; and there's even more evidence that early writings in Europe about kung-fu were a major influence on the birth of physical culture in the first place. <br><br>Ponter, all we can do is learn self-mastery ourselves, and teach it to those who are willing to learn. Fortunately, that puts Darwin on our side. <br><br>Bobby, it was pretty much inevitable, and yes, the best response is local action -- with growing your own organic garden high on that list. <br><br>Hal, I wonder whether it's largely a matter of strenuous jobs in an otherwise unstrenuous life. <br><br>Sofistek, you can lead a horse to water...<br><br>Tom, I'll take morris dancing over the latex-lingerie business any day. <br><br>Jason, that's an excellent point. <br><br>Logic, that's great news. Get kids to start having fun in nature again, and it might just be possible to salvage a little more of that generation. <br><br>Kevin, I don't think the popularity of sadomasochism has anything in particular to do with permissiveness; it's about the locus of control. I've heard a lot of people in the scene talk about how BDSM pushes them past their limits, or makes them feel safe in somebody else's control, or what have you. You don't need fetish wear to do that if you choose to push past your own limits, and control yourself! All you need is the concept, and the values, of self-mastery.<br><br><a href=#c5501678957793832752 title="comment permalink">1/29/11, 2:47 PM</a><br><br>

My wife of course, who is not collared and submissive (neither am I for that matter!).<br><br>Feminism has won many gains. My mother who was a single mother, had to get her own father to guarantee a mortgage in 70's despite her job status and income. This wouldn't happen now.<br><br>The problem is that cultural programming is very hard to fight and that we as a society are easily manipulated. Women are told that they can have it all which is clearly a lie. Keeping all options open is not possible for anyone.<br><br>You have to pick and choose what you are going to do in life and with every decision comes benefits and sacrifices and may close off some paths. Outcomes are also unkown and the future is never certain. <br><br>Remember also that to make no decision (or be apathetic) about your life is actually making a decision with very uncertain outcomes (and usually not good ones either).<br><br>It can be quite eye opening to recognise and accept that the decisions that you made in the past present you with the circumstances that you face today.<br><br>I think it's really difficult for women to find role models that aren't proceeding along the social norms. There's not that many out there and women are subject to a massive barrage of content (and condemnation from other women) everyday which is aimed at unempowering and normalising them.

Today, what with the neurological programming of modern media (even before texting and the internet) and the short, abrupt, professionally crafted messages oriented to ambition and appearance and intended to disrupt a narrative, it is a wonder we don't elect empty suits with no (legitimate) background or (moral) substance to high office.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br><a href=#c1401008720209587510 title="comment permalink">1/30/11, 11:01 AM</a><br><br>

Part of the Naturist Society history traces back to Germany and one of their interpretations of physical culture. It isn't a long stretch to regarding the health and fitness of the body to challenging Victorian coverup taboos rather than hamper the movement of the body, or deny the touch of wind and sun on so much of that massive, major natual sense organ, the skin.<br><br>I have no problem, myself, in condemning the decadence of the Victorian era for it's amorality and brutality between classes. Yet one invention of the Victorian age, an abhorrence of nudity (as well as prurient obsession) is still active in many people today.<br><br>Another aspect of revisionism and popular sensitivity is folk songs.<br><br>There are a lot of folk songs, spirituals, and lullabyes that seem to offend some revisionist or other. Which means that we are likely into the second generation of children that were never taught that aspect of cultural history - not of any culture older than 1990.<br><br>Is it any wonder that a fry cook would be texting while cooking, when she never learned "Can she bake a cherry pie", or "Red River Valley", or even the tuneful "Blue Danube Waltz"? Electronic and other social media are no substitute for regular, personal ties to the past, to cultural history, to reminders of the way things were done and could be done again. <br><br>We don't teach the old stories that carried wisdom that our grandparents learned about trivial things. Like getting up in the morning, keeping your word, being honest with your family and self as well as with others.<br><br><br>Yes, there are new stories told that are more current, new books of value. But there is value, too, in knowing the same songs and stories your parents and grandparents knew. <br><br><br>@ Siani,<br><br>A thought about exercise. In software engineering we learned that you measure what you want to improve. I think that goes for fitness and health, as well. I took a class in yoga some years ago, and one of the more important benefits was learning balance (so I can stand on one foot while putting on the other sock) - and learning to sense and affect distinct parts of my body. I have a much better awareness of what might be bound up, how far from the uncomfortable spot the actual binding might be, etc. <br><br>What we call 'yoga' is actually introductory yoga. The Yoga teaching goes that the student needs a sound (pain free) and strong body, well connected with and under conscious control of the mind, before the student is ready to study the heart of the beliefs of the religion. I can see various aspects of yoga that showed up in elementary school and in US Navy boot camp; apparently others think that formal exercise helps integrate awareness and control of the body, to the benefit of all.<br><br>Using your work as your exercise program adapts your body to your work, and your awareness of your body is partly limited to how your body affects, and is affected by, your work. I wonder if there might be a wider scope of awareness, both spiritual and secular, if you prepare for a 'wider' horizon.<br><br><a href=#c1554948325665208259 title="comment permalink">1/30/11, 11:20 AM</a><br><br>

I reckon we've swapped quality for quantity. <br><br>You see it in the housing stock. As a society we could build better quality housing, but we mostly choose larger housing which has a shorter lifespan and requires more energy to be able to shelter it's occupants from the environment. The upfront costs are low, but the ongoing costs are huge. <br><br>It's not really possible to build a large house that embodies sustainable low energy principles. Some may argue this point though.<br><br>Another goodee is motor vehicles. Do you really need to drive around in a vehicle that weighs 2.6 tonnes and carries only a single person? The greater the weight, the more energy is required to move the vehicle. Little wonder electric vehicles haven't taken off. Inertia again.<br><br>It kind of just feeds peoples ego's and social standing if they control (or have the appearance of controlling) more stuff than others.<br><br>In the past people were measured based on what they produced, now it is based on what they consume. Sad.<br><br>Hey sofistek,<br><br>The turning point for me was reading a couple of books:<br>Dr Clive Hamilton - Affluenza;<br>Dr Tim Flannery - The weather makers and The future eaters;<br>Dr James Lovelock - The revenge of Gaia and The vanishing face of Gaia;<br>Paul Roberts - The end of oil; and<br>(this inclusion is serious too!) Neil Strauss - The game<br><br>All dismal reading (except for, The game of course), but clearly puts things into perspective. As a person I seemed to be aware that something was not quite right and that the environmental and social books aren't quite balanced, so I researched what was going on in the world.<br><br>At the time, I also worked for this very wealthy dude, who I realised after a few years was like a black hole in that no matter how much energy you put into him, he would always require more. He was a pretty good metaphor for society. I rejected activisim because the system quickly also swallows you up (which is incidentally also handy for it) and so set out to live differently with an eye on the long term.<br><br>It was a hard decision to make, but I saw a difficult future ahead.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c8556607637584239207 title="comment permalink">1/30/11, 8:07 PM</a><br><br>

They know better.<br><br>In practice, feeding ourselves any which way requires a tremendous amount of work, and work-avoidance shows its smiley-face like a Betty Crocker mutant at the mere mention of digging and hoeing. Why not just lay the cardboard all about, then scatter the clovers and wait a few years? Then do what, study Zen? <br><br>I think it's precisely because we've made such a muck of things that we must work even harder to re-build the fertility and plant the orchards. And re-learning how to work is essential to any re-skilling curricula. <br><br>The path to any permanent food supply must proceed through the annual garden; it's simply called Year One. And there's a place for every technique at the table, but none of them will actually set the table for us. Bye-bye, Betty.<br><br>Maybe industrial minds are stuck on work/no work just like the false polarity of work/leisure because far too many of us don't do any actual work, since so many jobs are cubicle-surfing, life-sucking, hemorrhoid-makers.<br><br>For me, making compost is a deep joy; a hard piece of work that's profoundly rewarding as well. I never say, Oh crap, I've got to go turn the pile, and then when I'm done, thank God that's over, now I can relax.<br><br>There's a pace to hard labor that allows it to be done all day; I finally have a taste of it in my fifties. Yet I find I can go for hours in the summer if I let myself nap more in the winter. <br><br>These rhythms of the day and year are lost to the time card, and their depths can find no place within us by working a clock.

I think this has a whole lot more to do with the fact that the things motivating the multi-national uprisings (e.g. government brutality, violent oppression, food insecurity) are not things that typical mid-level Americans really experience. In spite of ample angst, most Americans still remain free, comfortable, and well-fed compared to our brethren in many (most..) other nations. Please, don't bother trying to contradict me by pointing out that there are millions of Americans who do experience these things on a daily basis; of course I know this. The more important point is that there are HUNDREDS of millions of Americans who do not and have not experienced these things other than as vague fears and occasional brief brushes. Those here who do live under these conditions are also our weakest groups, politically; they do take to the streets and hardly anyone listens. <br><br>When the middle classes here really do experience significant food insecurity you can bet your life that they WILL take to the streets (and will probably be rather well-armed...). And if real (not just rhetorical and demagogic) jack-booted thugs come in to put them down, I doubt the resulting mass uprisings will be very "velvet."<br><br><a href=#c6919585751941485859 title="comment permalink">1/31/11, 8:59 AM</a><br><br>

Obviously being in good shape as discussed in this post is crucial and foundational. But what about herbalism, naturopathy, home remedies, military medics with basic training in surgery, home dentistry and eye care, etc. A lot of us are on our own now, and more will be in the future.<br><br>That might be an issue you can fruitfully address.<br><br><a href=#c4178748006717095992 title="comment permalink">1/31/11, 3:24 PM</a><br><br>

Quickly, they educated many people in herbs, acupunture and other traditional techniques to wander from village to village to help people.

And exercise--what's that?"</em><br><br>I think exercise comes from two distinct directions. Formal, intentional exercise is performed for a purpose. Yoga - Hatha Yoga or introductory Yoga - comes from ancient religious practices in India. The concept is that a sound body and mind is required to begin the study of their religion. This intro yoga focuses on increasing strength and agility of the body, making the mind more aware of the body and improving control of the body, and on managing pain. This is <em>not</em> an example of indolent rich people with too much time and money on their hands.<br><br>Many religions include some carnal effort or sacrifice - from scourging to fasting (perhaps just for the period of a long sermon ;-)) and participation in rituals and community efforts.<br><br>Religion is a 'cost of living' that everyone - including atheists, I believe - choose what portion of their life to invest in individual and collective contributions.<br><br>'Exercise' that would improve the overall health and agility of the fishermen might include walking, tumbling, even martial arts training. Or quilting, a modest exercise of the hands - and of the mind and hand-eye coordination.<br><br>Cherokee Organics,<br><br>When you chose a different path, I wonder - how many children are you affecting, so that what you learn passes into the local and global communities and onto the next generation?<br><br>I am not criticizing. In contemplating the failure of many romantic relationships I have come to believe that failing to build a home <em>with the intent</em> of raising children is the primary reason for failure - that people aren't choosing a mate based on prospects of being a good co-parent to their children, and aren't building a home (whatever the structure) by intentionally building a (micro-)culture where they agree on what is right and wrong, what traditions and rituals they will observe, with the intent of informing and passing that legacy onto their children.<br><br>So I am curious, if you had considered building a family to hold your home.<br><br>I know I wish I had understood better about homes and families, years ago.<br><br><a href=#c7982290490457111799 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 8:41 AM</a><br><br>

I got busy with life and have not had a chance to keep up.<br><br>Secondly, I am going to agree with you and disagree with you in the same breath. I am an old time hand at the BD/SM scene (I helped found an organization in Portland Oregon back in the 90s). At that time (and probably still today) the majority of submissives were weatlhy/powerful business men. The belief was that they spent their days being in charge and so they wanted to spend their nights having someone else in charge. This would fly in the face of you "submissives are looking for discipline from someone else" theory. These guys had plenty of discipline in their day lives.<br>But that said I also had (back in the 90s) already encountered a few people who were looking for someone to "take care of them". They were often at a loss in their lives, without direction. They usually had very low end jobs or even no jobs. As one of them put it to me, "I have known since I was a kid that I was supposed to be taken care of by someone and that they were supposed to give me the space to spend my time focused on my religious calling. In return I would take care of them. I can't understand why I can't find that person!"<br>I would not be surprised if that attitude begins to supplant the first one.<br><br>Tristan<br><br><a href=#c8968264367810522560 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 10:35 AM</a><br><br>
