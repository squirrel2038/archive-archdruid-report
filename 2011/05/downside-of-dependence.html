I’m not sure if last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post hit a nerve, or if thoughts similar to the ones I discussed there have been busy all by themselves stirring up nightmares in the deep places of our collective imagination, but it’s been fascinating to note how many blog posts over the past few days have taken issue with the core point my post raised. That point, for those who readers who are just joining us, is that using less – less energy, less resources, less stuff of every kind – is the hallmark of any serious response to the predicament facing industrial civilization<br><br>Typical of the responses, if that’s what they were, was <a href=http://blogs.forbes.com/rogerkay/2011/05/02/beer-yeast-dilemma-2/ >a blog post</a> by <i>Forbes</i> blogger Roger Kay. It’s a clever post, to be sure, and Kay’s an engaging writer. He imagines beer yeast in a vat of wort – for those of you who aren’t yet initiated into the mysteries of brewing, that’s what you call the stuff that turns into beer before it turns into beer – faced with the inevitable problem that beer yeast face in a vat of wort: once the alcohol produced by their own life processes reaches a certain level, it poisons the yeast and they die.<br><br>Kay goes on to imagine a yeast cell with a conscience, who decides not to consume the sugars in the wort, and points out that the only thing that results from the moral yeast’s decision is that the other, less scrupulous yeast cells eat all the sugar, and all the yeasts die anyway. His conclusion is that we might as well wallow in our fossil-fueled lifestyles while we can, since everyone else is going to do that anyway, and the only hope he offers is that technology might save us before the consequences hit. <br><br>George Monbiot, who’s carved out a niche for himself as the staff pseudoenvironmentalist of <i>The Guardian</i>, had a <a href=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/may/02/environmental-fixes-all-greens-lost>blog post of his own</a> on much the same theme. His argument is simply that most people in today’s industrial societies are not going to accept anything short of continued economic growth, and so a strategy based on using less is simply a waste of time.<br><br>Like many people these days who worry about global warming, he dismisses the issues surrounding peak oil out of hand – the problem we face, he insists, is not that we have too little fossil fuel, but too much – and as evidence for this, he points to the recent announcement from the IEA that world production of petroleum peaked in 2006. Since industrial civilization hasn’t collapsed yet, he tells us, peak oil clearly isn’t a problem. I suppose if you ignore drastic and worsening economic troubles in the world’s industrial nations, food riots and power shortages spreading across the Third World, and all the other symptoms of the rising spiral of peak-driven crisis now under way, you might be able to make that claim. Still, there’s a deeper illogic here.<br><br>It’s an illogic that seems highly plausible to many people. That’s because the fallacy that forms the core of the argument made by Kay, Monbiot, and so many others is a common feature of today’s conventional wisdom. An alternative metaphor – one at least as familiar to the peak oil blogosphere as Roger Kay’s yeas – might help to clarify the nature of the failed logic they’re retailing.<br><br>Imagine, then, that you’re on the proverbial ocean liner at sea, and it’s just hit the proverbial iceberg. Water is rising belowdecks and the deck is beginning to tilt, but nobody has drowned yet. Aware of the danger, you strap on a life preserver and head for the lifeboats. As you leave your stateroom, though, the guy in the stateroom next to yours gives you an incredulous look. "Are you nuts?" he says. "If you leave the ship now, somebody else will just take your cabin, and get all the meals and drinks you’ve paid for!"<br><br>Your fellow passenger in the metaphor, like Kay and Monbiot in the real world, has failed to notice a crucial fact about what’s happening: when a situation is unsustainable in the near term, the benefits that might be gained by clinging to it very often come with a prodigious cost, and the costs that have to be paid to abandon it very often come with considerable benefits. It’s far more pleasant to walk down to the cruise ship’s bar, order a couple of dry martinis, and sit there listening to the Muzak, to be sure, than it is to scramble into a lifeboat and huddle there on one of the thwarts as the waves toss you around, the spray soaks you, and the wind chills you to the bone. Two hours later, however, the passenger who went to the bar is a pallid corpse being gently nibbled by fishes, and the passenger who climbed into the lifeboat and put up with the seasickness and the spray is being hauled safely aboard the first freighter that happened to be close enough to answer the distress call.<br><br>The metaphor can usefully be taken a little further, because it points up a useful way of looking at the equivalent situation in the real world. As a passenger on board the ship, your relation to the ship is a relation of dependence. You depend on the integrity of the hull to keep you from drowning, on the fuel and engines to get you to your destination, on the food supply and the galley to keep you fed, and so on. That dependence has very real advantages, but it has a potentially drastic downside: if the systems you rely on should fail, and you don’t have an alternative, your dependence on them can kill you.<br><br>It’s this downside of dependence that Kay and Monbiot miss completely. Imagine, to approach the same argument from a different angle, that Kay’s yeast metaphor left out two crucial points. The first is that the yeast cells have choices other than either eating the sugar or not eating the sugar. They can, let’s say, evolve the capacity to live on starch rather than sugar. Starch isn’t as rich an energy source as sugar, and it’s harder and costlier in energy terms to digest, but (let’s say, for the sake of the metaphor) yeast who eat starch don’t produce alcohol and so don’t poison themselves. A yeast that evolves the ability to digest starch thus has to accept a far less lavish lifestyle involving a lot more work, but it’s an option that doesn’t result in guaranteed death.<br><br>The second point Kay’s metaphor left out is that the wort in the beer vat doesn’t actually contain that much sugar. The brewer, let’s say, didn’t do an adequate job of malting the barley, and so most of what’s in the wort is starch rather than sugar. As a result, the thing the yeast need to worry about isn’t poisoning themselves by the products of their own digestion; it’s starving to death when the sugar runs out. Given these two conditions, a yeast cell that shrugs and goes back to eating sugar, trusting that the Great Brewer in the Sky will dump more sugar into the wort before it starves, isn’t making a rational choice; it’s allowing the immediate benefits of a temporary abundance to blind it to the fact that the downside of depending on that abundance includes an early and miserable death.<br><br>That, <i>pace</i> George Monbiot, is more or less the situation we’re in right now. We have a small and very rapidly depleting supply of highly concentrated, easy-to use "sugar" – that is, petroleum, natural gas, and the better grades of coal – and a much larger supply of diffuse, difficult-to-use "starch" – that is, renewable energy sources such as sunlight and wind, along with diffuse nonrenewable sources such as low-grade coal, uranium ore, and the like. Industrial society has evolved to use sugar, and even its forays into the starch supply are dependent on using up a great deal of sugar to make starch into a sugar substitute – consider the vast amount of natural gas that’s burnt to process tar sands into ersatz petroleum, or the natural gas (used to produce electricity) and diesel fuel that goes into manufacturing, installing, and maintaining today’s gargantuan wind turbines.<br><br>The coming of "peak sugar" has two implications for our modern industrial yeast. First, it means that the increasing comsumption of sugar has reached the limits of supply; there’s still sugar left, but as we near the end of the bumpy plateau that ordinary stochastic noise imposes on the smooth theoretical arc of the Hubbert curve, we’re getting closer and closer to the point at which yeast start to die of hunger because there’s not enough sugar to go around. Second, it means that trying to deal with that predicament by pursuing existing strategies – that is, by burning sugar to convert various kinds of starch into an edible form – is going to make the situation worse rather than better, because it’s going to decrease the supply of available sugar just as yeast cells begin to die for lack of it.<br><br>All this imposes a hard choice on the yeast cells that make up modern industrial civilization, collectively and as individuals. We know already what the collective decision has been – keep gobbling sugar and hope for the best – and though it might be possible to make a different choice collectively even this late in the game, the costs would be appalling and the political will to make such a decision clearly isn’t there. What remains are decisions on the part of individual yeast cells to go along with the collective choice or not. Those who reject the collective choice face the hard work of evolving to feed on starch that hasn’t been converted into a sugar substitute, knowing that in doing so, they’re exchanging a lavish but temporary lifestyle for a more difficult but more enduring one.<br><br>That latter choice is the one this blog has been advocating for most of a year now: using the proven appropriate-tech toolkit of the Seventies era to dramatically reduce individual, family, and community dependence on concentrated energy supplies, and make use of diffuse energy sources – primarily sunlight – that can be collected and used right where you are. Most people in today’s industrial societies have shown no interest in considering that option; they’ve made the other choice, and seem to be sticking to it even as the downside of their dependence on a collapsing human ecology is beginning to become visible. Some may change their minds, but there’s another factor that has to be taken into account, the factor of time.<br><br>One of the many comments I fielded on last week’s post pointed straight to that factor, though I don’t think the person who wrote the comment realized that. According to his comment, he’s an unemployed union carpenter with thirty years of now-useless experience, who’s about to reach the end of his 99 weeks of unemployment benefits and become one of the growing mass of America’s economic nonpersons. His children are struggling with the same scenario. Wrapping insulation around his pipes, he pointed out, won’t fix the predicament he’s in.<br><br>He’s quite right, if "fixing the predicament" means enabling him to return to what has been, until now, a normal American middle class existence. Millions of Americans right now are finding themselves shut out of that existence, and few if any of them will ever find a way back into it. Over the years to come, more and more Americans will undergo the same profoundly unwelcome shift, until what used to be the normal middle class existence becomes a thing of the past for everybody. That’s the inevitable shape of our future, because of the awkward fact I mentioned last week – there is no way to make a middle class American lifestyle sustainable – and its corollary, which is that if something can’t be made sustainable, it won’t be sustained.<br><br>That doesn’t mean that we’re all going to move into cozy lifeboat ecovillages, or any of the other green-painted Levittowns that fill so much space in so many middle class fantasies today. It means, rather, that in the decades ahead of us, something like half the American population will most likely end up in shantytowns on the model of Latin America’s favelas, without electricity, running water or sewers, caught up in a scramble for survival that many of them will inevitably lose. It means that most of the others will likely face a reduction in their standards of living to levels not too different from the one that the poorest Americans experience today, while the rich of that time, if they’re smart, ruthless, and lucky, may be able to scrape together some of the luxuries a middle class American family can count on today, and may even be able to hold onto them for a while.<br><br>Does the picture I’ve just painted seem unbelievable? It’s simply the equivalent of saying that the United States will become a Third World nation in the not too distant future. It’s also the equivalent of saying that the United States will undergo the usual pattern of severe economic contraction that’s a normal part of the decline and fall of an empire, or of a civilization. Neither of those are improbable statements just now; it’s simply that most people shy away from thinking about the implications.<br><br>What all this implies, in turn, is that those people who make the shift to a low-energy lifestyle in advance, before the sheer pressure of circumstances forces them to do so, will have options closed to those who cling to the unsustainable until it’s dragged out of their grip. Those who downshift hard, fast, and soon, cutting their dependence on fossil fuels and the goods and services that fossil fuels make available, will have a much less difficult time paying off debts, finding the money to learn new skills, and navigating the challenging economic conditions of life in a near-bankrupt society. Had the unemployed carpenter whose comment I mentioned above wrapped insulation around his pipes ten years ago, he’d have spent less money on energy for the last decade, and could have used that extra money to get ready for the hard times to come; had he wrapped his pipes, insulated his walls, slashed his energy bills, recognized the dependence of his income on a totally unsustainable housing bubble and gotten into a different if less lucrative line of work – and there were people who did these things at the time, and are doing them now – he’d likely be fine today.<br><br>These are the kinds of steps that leave people in possession of a home, a garden, a career doing something people need or want badly enough to pay for even in a depression, and other desiderata of hard economic times. These are also the kinds of steps that make it easier for people to offer help to their families, friends, and neighbors, to teach vital skills to those who are willing to learn them, and preserve precious cultural legacies through the crises of the present to they can be handed on to the future. That’s the payoff for living with less; it’s a lot easier to avoid getting trapped by the downside of dependence on a society moving steadily deeper into systems failure.<br><br>These considerations aren’t the sort of thing you can expect to read in the pages of <i>Forbes</i> and <i>The Guardian</i>, to be sure. You’ll have a hard time, for that matter, finding them anywhere in our collective conversation about the future of industrial society. Even among those who haven’t tried to squirm away from the unwelcome realities of our present predicament, there seems to be a tendency to avoid talking about exactly what the landscape of the American future looks like. It’s understandable; science fiction scenarios and apocalyptic fireworks are so much more exciting than the future of mass impoverishment, infrastructure breakdown, sociopolitical disintegration, and ragged population decline that the misguided choices of the last few decades have handed us.<br><br>It’s true, in other words, that huddling in a lifeboat, tossed by waves and soaked by spray, is no fun. It’s a lot less fun than sitting in a cruise ship bar chugging martinis, even if the reason why you’re chugging the martinis is that you’re trying to pretend not to notice that the deck is slowly tilting under your feet and the waves are a lot closer to the porthole than they used to be. There’s every reason to think that a great many people will choose this latter option or, more precisely, that they have chosen it, and are continuing to reaffirm that choice – sometimes, like Kay and Monbiot, at the top of their lungs. Still, those aren’t the people for whom these posts are written, and I’m encouraged by the number of people who are making a different choice.<br><br>*********<br><br>Those of my readers who are interested in the green wizardry project discussed in these posts may also be interested to learn that a sustainable community in Oregon is hosting what, as far as I know, is the first-ever event focusing on the Green Wizards theme. It’s over the Fourth of July weekend this year; you can read all the details <a href=http://www.windward.org/gwiz/index.htm>here</a>.

We're meeting with a roofing fellow tomorrow afternoon about a metal roof to replace our asphalt shingle roof, which still has a lot of life in it, but my husband and I both are concerned about the fate of the US dollar, and I would like to start collecting rain water ASAP, and you can't use water off an asphalt roof for watering vegetables or drinking. (The Douton countertop water filter arrived today.) The roofing company we're talking to tomorrow also has a roofing product that has solar panels built in- the panels <i>are</i> the roof. We suspect that it's wildly expensive, and that we will probably not be able to swing it, since we will be paying cash for this job. Anyway, the metal roof is supposed to be an energy star rated product, and we want to replace our insulation in the attic at the same time. The house was built in '76, so we think between the two, new roof, new insulation, we should save quite a bit of heat in the winter, and be much more comfortable in the summer. <br><br>Then after that, we save for new siding and new wall insulation. I'm still working on using less electricity, but at least I know how much we're using every day. You can't know how much you're saving until you know how much you're using.<br><br>And the lifeboat? I'm the kind of person who would take her martini with her to the boat.

Adjust for the distorting effect of those influences, and you'll find that things are far from hopeless -- though you might want to put some thought into adding in some skills you can use here and now; spinning's great, but you also want things that help make the transition in your present situation.

It's interesting to see the same predicament taken on by Monbiot, then deconstructed (the yeast given hope!) by yourself.<br><br>In the real vat, there are few survivors, but there are a few. I don't pasteurize or sulfur my wine, so I find a bottle here or there that blows a cork-- a result of a small number of yeast cells slowly continuing to ferment even after all of the yeast cells should have died off. The process of making wine involves millions, possibly billions of yeast cells and likely hundreds of generations. There is the possibility of natural selection to select out individual yeast cells better adapted to the given conditions- that is- more resistant to the lethal effect of alcohol, or able to digest something such as starch- as unlikely as that may be. <br><br>There are even some hobby winemakers who use the dregs from their previous batch of wine to start their new batch, I think some of the logic being that the surviving cells may be adapted to producing a stronger wine. <br><br>I wonder if there are some yeast cells who see the inevitable coming and choose to adapt before it is too late, and before doing so is fashionable. <br><br>Thanks for a good analogy.

What you are essentially advocating is a wholesale rejection of the current industrialized model of economic development. <br><br>That is fine, and I think where you are different than a lot of people advocating using less, the reduce, reuse, recycle paradigm, is that you are not fooling yourself about the logical end point of widespread adoption of these principles; which would be economic depression.<br><br>Your point is that we need to have that 'depression,' which is a term that has a negative meaning in the context of industrial capitalism only, because what we think of now as normal is unsustainable and we pursue its short term comforts at the risk of long term extinction. Most of the time, when I point that out depression would follow a widespread adoption of sustainable practices and outlooks owing to plummeting demand across the board, green people look at me like I am crazy or refuse to answer.<br><br>So I should modify my nit to pick, which is this. There are some very powerful forces, i.e. corporations, in the interim that will fight back with everything they have to prevent that from happening should it begin to come to pass. That they are ultimately destined to lose does not mean they will not go down swinging. I am guessing you know this too, but there is really no way to prepare for that or reason to when there are still people who have not weather stripped their homes.

What a sweet concept!<br><br>JMG, your vision of America's future is 100% opposite to the kind of middle class liberal fantasy that is hallucinated up so often. Just last night I was sent a link to an article detailing one such fantasy that described the US in 2100 as some kind of eco-village utopia powered by solar panels, its leisured (and extremely liberal) inhabitants seemingly having transcended work and able to spend all their time focusing on their personal growth in a world without borders. The article can be seen at: <br><br>http://www.uvm.edu/giee/ESDA/am2100.html<br><br>But seriously, I hope we can still talk about nihilism a bit as something Bill mentioned last week has been going around in my brain ever since. When he mentioned 'peak complexity' it got me thinking that he might be onto something (thanks Bill!). I'm sure the Romans had very a very sophisticated society at their zenith, but I'm equally sure that it wasn't a patch on the turbo-charged microprocessor fuelled hyper complex world that we live in today. For the average person who doesn't have the time to think deeply about how to decipher all of this, it must appear as white noise. I'm sure you mentioned before that high technology, to a 'primitive' society, is effectively magic. Does it follow that a high degree of societal complexity simply cannot be grasped by people who have had their mental toolkits confiscated at birth and have spent the time since being manipulated by marketing campaigns (that's most of us!)? <br><br>So, faced with the prospect that you'll never understand how things work, and that so far civilization as you know it hasn't collapsed (i.e. the X Factor is still running, the talking heads on Fox News seem to know how to fix things) it's far easier to sit back and assume that some higher power is in charge of things, leaving the mental door wide open for conspiracy theories to walk in.<br><br>Aside from this, another factor that I think could be at work is the so-called Stockholm Syndrome, where kidnap victims end up empathising with their captors. If people are captive to the prevailing economic and philosophical system which forces them to work endlessly in pursuit of the short lived satisfaction derived from a consumption driven lifestyle, who's to say that the emotional reaction you see when this system they depend on is challenged isn't caused by some such syndrome? Could it be that this is the reason the nihilism you mentioned (and which I was initially puzzled about) seems to be so much more prevalent in the US than elsewhere? <br><br>BTW loved the fish nibbling analogy – something I shall keep in my mind when I am dealing with the next person who insists that we're sailing towards the stars.<br><br><a href=#c1623074088937261208 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 12:01 AM</a><br><br>

Practically everything you can do to become more self-reliant requires SPACE.

I am reading everything I can get my hands on about sustainable living, and saving every pathetic penny that doesn't go towards [frugal to the bone] living expenses so we can buy a scrap of land someday. <br><br>But won't someday be too late?

I seem to have read his book 'Heat' about the same time as Sharon Astyk, and like her drew the conclusion that there was enough fossil fuel to doom us, and the less the world used the better. We the fortunate needed to cut our use by 90%. Climate change was it seemed the looming catastrophe for future generations and for 'nicer' aspects of our modern life. (My attention to climate science as it evolved over the last 25 years put me in mind to agree with Monbiot.) George though was always wobbly on future shortages of fossil fuel and other resources key to our 'comfortable' industrial life - and many of us in UK complained to him and about him. I think though that personally he tries hard to use a lot less of the 'goodies'and tries to walk his talk and depend much less on the fueled infrastructure that surrounds us (he uses I understand, the bike, the train, no car etc).<br>PS 21 years ago I found out abruptly that I had dodgy cardio arteries, and rapidly realized that eating frugally and not using the car, getting on the bike, prioritizing and having fun with a young family, and making sure we got our veg and fruit - in our case we had a large garden - was essential for survival in the here and now. Still is. But still way to go. Fix the house - help the kids, etc..<br><br><a href=#c2211661027108256797 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 2:04 AM</a><br><br>

There's a reason old farmhouses in our part of New England were so large--people needed a handful of kids or hired hands to produce food and fuel from this challenging landscape.<br><br>Our small, well-insulated house has lower ceilings and a more efficient woodstove than the farmhouses of old, and we're working on window quilts and such.

But I also think that the reality for many folks is that there won't be a lifevest or a lifeboat to get onto, and even if they do get aboard one, there's no telling if a large swell out on the sea might just swallow them up before any freighter arrives to save them (and will there be a freighter, or will they just have to hope they run aground somewhere and make the best of it). I keep thinking that perhaps a good deal of the tools for "living into collapse," might just be some solid spiritual practice or sense of roots.<br><br>Depression and despair are going to be realities for a lot of folks -- indeed, they already are -- and the toxic pharmaceuticals that play games with neurochemistry to make people feel good enough to get out of bed in the morning are going to become too expensive for most. How are people who have been insulated from material poverty and deprivation going to react as collapse continues?<br><br>What I'm circling around here is that suffering will probably abound in the industrial world in ways that folks here simply are not used to coping with. Suffering can cause the human animal to engage in numerous unhealthy practices -- violence, anger, "nihilism" as you call it -- and without the tools to cope with suffering this can propagate itself rapidly, particularly in a culture like in the US where the denial of fundamental reality -- our mortality being the thing closest to home -- is the very thing the culture is trying to escape... through some expectation of a future-heaven.<br><br>In this case, perhaps the tools for many who are still in the suburbs or the city isn't to try to find ways to "make it through" collapse or save themselves from a sinking ship, but merely to face their own mortality and find the soul-power to help others go through similar coping processes. The dying industrial world might need some bodhisattvas who can cook with a solar oven and provide support to others in the form of upfront hard hitting truths about their sense of entitlement and how an attachment to false expectations may get of the way of simply living well in the moment.<br><br>I think without this element of soul or roots or whatever you want to call it, we could see some pretty nasty reactions to what now unfolds. I think it's in all of our interests to consider the deeper issue that collapse brings to the fore.<br><br><a href=#c5516934957001849331 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 4:42 AM</a><br><br>

We realized ca. 2004 that almost nobody has relatives living in the country so we decided to be those people, and being retirees loaded to the gills with good fortune we could simply sell and move, and now we're learning skills. We have built a house (losing 15 and 25 pounds respectively) to last very many decades, and trying to build soil, and we'll plant trees - all for the future we won't live to see, but it's what all us well-to-do retirees should be doing. <br><br>In a small town an educated retiree gets onto committees and other town work, and I occasionally wonder about hordes from Phoenix maybe coming up here with all their guns once they run out of water.

I don't even know how to identify the people already in this town who are full of purpose and energy but need some assistance (e.g. cash, a garden plot, other leverage) to get started. A local timber-framer is interested in the design of low-cost energy efficient housing.

Also suggest you ADD to your existing insulation rather than replace it. Use an insulation product that does not have facing (paper layer) or other treatment that traps moisture in old insulation. Besides, adding to your existing insulation makes use of the old stuff, which still provides SOME insulation, I bet. Good luck!

To use your yeast analogy, wouldn't it make sense for the yeast to use the sugar while it is available and at the same time develop the ability to use starch for when the sugar becomes unavailable. While cheap energy is still available doesn't it make sense to use that energy to produce things such as solar panels that can produce energy far into the future. I agree with you that we are on a downward slope towards a less industrial society, but individuals can make the choice to use the resources that are currently available to make life more comfortable while riding down that slope. <br><br>As a personal example, I work in the IT industry and while I realize that computers likely won't be as common in the future, they are around now and this industry gives me the income to allow me to get debt free and to build a home that is highly energy efficient. It also gives me the resources to learn other skills that will be useful in a less industrial society. I believe that we should make hay while the sun shines, but to also prepare for a less abundant future. I try to live with the philosophy of hope for the best and plan for the worst.<br><br>For most people in the Western world and North America in particular, they will not consider giving up their current lifestyle until there is an emotionally significant event the makes the situation obvious. This would be an event like the oil crisis of the 1970's. We can only hope that such an event comes sooner rather than later, but in the mean time all that can be done is to convince people of the needed changes one person at a time.<br><br>@Breanna<br>Something that you might want to consider while you are saving up for your own land is to find a senior out in the suburbs that has land but not the energy to maintain it.

Not a great way to try to make a living in a collapsing economy and not necessarily a useful skill for keeping alive unless someone changes the laws on killing seals.

But more importantly, making things by hand also teaches you how to repair things and keep them going. And quite frequently, I scavenge materials to make my kayaks. Again, the kayaks are not so much the point as the ability to apply the scavenging technology to whatever task arises. I can understand the despair of posters who feel that their limited skill set will not allow them to survive on one skill alone.

The depression is already here, and it's not here because people aren't consuming -- it's here because we're running out of things to consume.

A great many people think they're ready to climb aboard the lifeboats, but balk at what's actually required to do so. WWOOFing is certainly one option; you might also post a discussion of the issues at <a href=http://www.greenwizards.org rel=nofollow>the Green Wizards forum</a> and see if you get any takers. <br><br>Lei, given that China's almost certainly going to be the global hegemon for the next century or so, people who can read and translate Chinese in other countries are likely to do fairly well.<br><br>Evan, the spiritual dimension of what we're facing is one that I've tried to handle with a very light touch in these posts, since the people who read this blog come from backgrounds ranging from hardcore scientific atheism through evangelical Christianity out into the strange territory infested by Druids and the like. Still, you're quite correct; one of the reasons that so many people have taken to treating spirituality as a kind of fashion accessory, rather than the more than life-or-death issue it actually is, is precisely that we've had so many comforts and so little actual suffering for so long. As that changes and life gets harder, shorter, and more uncertain, spirituality is going to be an issue that can't be ignored.<br><br>Robin, I think the herd is already in full stampede mode, heading straight toward a cliff. I'm interested in speaking to the cattle on the edges who aren't too certain about this stampede thing, and are looking for other options. <br><br>Geowend, excellent. The stuff that builds your soil is stuff that most people don't want anyway. <br><br>Draft, well, as I said to Justin, your decision to climb aboard the lifeboat isn't what's sinking the ship. I'll be addressing your concerns along with Breanna's in an upcoming post; in the meantime, though, the key to keep in mind is that you need to plan for the transition, not for the endpoint. More on this soon. <br><br>Jessica, I haven't posted at any length on the subject, as it's become the kind of issue about which very few people seem to be able to think clearly these days. My basic take, though, is that anthropogenic climate change is a real issue, and could cause some whopping disasters over the next century, but it's limited by the fact that the amount of fossil fuels available to industrial civilization, at a net energy that will allow its extraction, is much smaller than the worst case scenarios on climate change assume.<br><br>The IPCC estimates, for example, assume that the world can keep on increasing its consumption of all fossil fuels straight through until 2100; with peak oil five years behind us and peak coal and natural gas only a few decades ahead, that's not going to happen. <br>Mind you, we may still see the Greenland ice sheet break up and flood a lot of coastal cities, and we may also see tornado outbreaks like last week's become standard weather features. Thus I'm arguing a middle ground; climate change is a problem, and a serious one, but fossil fuel depletion is at least as severe an issue and we're already in the middle of it.<br><br><a href=#c7017195638656063167 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

A year ago we had what was rated as a 500-1000 year flood, which did a real number on the rural road network. Our 6-mile long county road had about 4 bridges washed out, and about a mile of pavement just simply washed away, piled in heaps like carpet scraps. It has been a year, and FEMA and its money have come and gone, and the roads are supposedly "fixed." Except they aren't. They were returned to passable and serviceable. They were not returned to their pre-flood conditions. <br><br>I think it is fair to expect that this is a small window on what the coming decades hold -- infrastructure is maintained, sort of... a little bit more is allowed to slip between the cracks with each incident. Eventually the potholes will become so numerous, and fixing then so uneconomical, that the county will decide they are better off just sending out a crew one final time to remove what remains of the pavement. Then the visits from the county road grader will gradually become less frequent.. so we will wind up maintaining the stretches in front of our own houses ourselves... that will inevitably fall short in some places, and about the time we can't afford to operate our motor vehicles anymore the roads will no longer be passable to them anyway. <br><br>I have also noticed that the crews that are supposed to clear and maintain the power line rights-of-way every four years are about two years late on this cycle.. and still no sign of them. You wanna watch the power grid become unstable, then leave it to each individual landowner to take full responsibility for keeping trees from growing into and over the power lines traversing their property!<br><br><a href=#c5519675722282157967 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 8:30 AM</a><br><br>

I think they've realized just how ghastly the view out the porthole has become, so they're pulling the shades and ordering another martini. <br><br>Ward, my experience has been that people start out thinking that they can split the difference, but end up just as dependent on the existing system as their neighbors. Mind you, you can certainly keep your IT job if you think it's going to last, but for heaven's sake, use that income to pay off your mortgage, insulate and weatherize your house, and get used to living with less so you know how to do it by the time the necessity arrives. <br><br>Iaato, the crucial point as I see it is that thinking that it's got to be the alcohol leads to counterproductive notions of the sort that Kay and Monbiot have been advocating. I find the old <i>Limits to Growth</i> model more useful: rising costs from resource depletion and pollution form the two jaws of the vise that squeeze the life out of industrial society. <br><br>David, as I mentioned to Phil earlier, my exposure to Monbiot's work has been occasional pieces in the blogosphere, notably his advocacy of nuclear energy. What I've seen has not impressed me, but I'm always willing to be wrong. <br><br>Bill, thanks for the vote of confidence. I thought Monbiot's message seemed pretty straightforward. <br><br>Chris, it's a harsh way to look at things, but yes, that's pretty much what it amounts to. <br><br>Wolfgang, those are excellent points. The ability to leverage one set of skills into a range of related possibilities is something that deserves particular attention as things tighten up around us. <br><br>Phil, we can certainly agree on that! In fact, that's basically my point; drastic decreases in the consumption of energy and resources are going to happen, for a galaxy of reasons including but not limited to energy and resource depletion, and the sooner each of us gets moving down that curve of descent, the better off each of us and our families and communities will be. <br><br>Medved, true enough.

He was looking for reference material on urban planning and simply didn't know how to find the books. I gave him some background info on the dewey decimal system and lead him to the books he needed. A week or so later, I asked him how his paper was coming along. He lamented that none of the books I showed him had the answer to the specific question he was set by the teacher. I suggested that was why the specific question was asked and he needed to synthesize his own answer from several viewpoints within the source books. He looked at me as if I had two heads. I can only suppose he thought all answers to all questions are written down somewhere and I wasn't telling him, or maybe the effort wasn't rewarding enough.<br><br>Imo, the green wizard project is alot like that described above, but to a more personal degree.

In ramping up to more difficult tasks and projects, I'm meeting some of my limitations but finding out about overcoming others. If tomorrow turns out not to be like today, I may be able to cope just that wee bit better. I'll certainly be finding out some answers to my own particular journey. anon-anon<br><br><a href=#c5856031693181922998 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 10:00 AM</a><br><br>

I think a lot of people know, at least dimly, that we're in a world of hurt, and are trying to pretend otherwise. That's why they get so edgy when you bring it up. <br><br>Steven, I tend to ignore Bill Gates as often as I possibly can. Of course he's down on "cute technology;" he can't make a profit off it. As for your future teaching career, learn how to teach reading and reasoning to teens and adults; we've got a couple of generations now whose education has consisted almost entirely of parroting answers to multiple choice tests, and those who realize they've been sold down the river by the education industry, and decide to do something about it, will be looking for someone who can teach them to locate and extract the knowledge they need, think through it effectively, and share it with others.

I'll be discussing this in much more detail in posts to come.

Such is the case for all empires and civilizations. However, I wonder if it is not premature to state that global industrial civilization *as a whole* is already past peak? <br><br>Individual pieces of the system like the United States that held special positions are getting knocked down, but it might be at least possible that the larger system as a whole could remain similar in scope for quite some time. While the days of perpetual exponential (or even at all dependable) global growth are almost certainly over for good, it is not *inconceivable* that things like fossil fuel and raw material production might manage to lurch onwards at roughly (say +/- 20% ?) current levels for quite some time, rather than decline in a mirror image of the gains so far. No one society would necessarily reach the extravagance that the 'haves' have now (especially considering that less and less of the gains would go to the population rather than maintaining production), but the system as a whole might be able to maintain its level of impact for longer. <br><br>In the long run of course it must end due to the simple facts of geology, but it is very difficult to call 'peaks' anywhere but in significant hindsight, and I am wary of jumping to these conclusions too early. It also seems that such a widespread, lower-level grind could be a worse thing in the long run for our species and the biosphere. Constant conflicts between new power blocks as they vied for the non-increasing pie they have to split. More time when nuclear power might be viable, more time spent letting industrialized agriculture strip soil and desertify land, more generations of attrition of skills and ideas before things have to fundamentally change again, more time letting the products of industry destroy ecosystems, etc. As a possibility that could be quite serious and is NOT at zero probability, it deserves some thought...<br><br><a href=#c6547973351986426812 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 12:42 PM</a><br><br>

It's hard to communicate this urgent feeling with others, because it feels a little bizarre. "Umm, yeah, well, I think that water issues are going to be a problem here in the future, so we need to get out now ..." It makes total sense to me though, and I don't pay too much attention to what others think. We're in Colorado, and a study *just* came out (saw it on HuffPost) detailing the intense water problems that'll be facing the western US in the decades ahead. We're just trying to be smart and take action with what we know. Also, the train systems here are awful, and you can't live off scenery.<br><br>I'll also say that, and I haven't read all the comments so I don't know if this has been brought up yet, but something I've noticed lately are the many books on the value of simplicity that have come out lately, and they relate to a variety of topics. The most recent that I've read is called "Simplicity Parenting," and it discusses how much more children respond as people to a simple, very pared-down environment. Children thrive in nature with sticks for toys, and I think that that's not really just something for childhood. I think that there's just something about humanity that really responds to simplicity--we didn't evolve in a plastic environment--so again, I suppose what I would say to the two authors you discuss in your post this week, is not only is it smarter to shift to a lower-energy lifestyle sooner than later, but making your life simpler, and living more, well, organically, really just seems to resonate much more with our human nature. Not that it's all some kind of perfect fantasy ecotopia, but downsizing, when it's done by choice and not hard necessity, really does seem to have a lot of benefits.<br><br><a href=#c4355189549213690467 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 12:43 PM</a><br><br>

We don't have wealthy family members to depend on, we're not already on a good career path, and we have the pressures that come with being a young family. So we've spent a lot of time thinking about this.<br><br>What's been useful for us is to be willing to change and try to think outside the box. For us, this has included selling a home in order to enable my partner to return to school--that was our very first step. Now we are in an apartment, but our lease is up soon and we're going to be spending the summer with family to try to save up some money. We tried finding a WWOOF position but no one was willing to take us on with kids. My partner has spent the last year learning woodworking, and he's got about a year left to study on the GI Bill and is considering learning boatbuilding or alternative energy. We do want a little bit of land--mostly because we enjoy the quiet--but I know that this is going to require some creative thinking and may not happen at all. Ecovillages and intentional communities tend to be really expensive, as do "artsy" areas, so we'll probably end up somewhere less than ideal where prices are really affordable. While I can't speak to the price of JMG's house, I do think that he's said that he's moved to an area that's not doing super-well economically right now and I think that was wise because you really could look at it as being ahead of the game (I would think it would be more affordable). Our worst-case scenario is probably that we'd end up living with family. I think it's really a positive step to be considering these options and small steps now, rather than say, 5 years from now, when everybody's rushing to do the same thing. Breanna, I'm also 26, but I have kids which seems to limit a lot of my options, but if you really want to get out of your apartment, you could consider alternative living situations where you might start out WWOOFing or even living with family to save more money if that's an option. I don't know if you have religious leanings, I don't, but I find a lot of inspiration from certain religious groups that practice voluntary poverty/simplicity in alternative ways, such as the Simple Way, certain Mennonite groups, and Quakers.<br><br><a href=#c1793478705869712637 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 1:34 PM</a><br><br>

The UK has already seen car usage peaking some time in the last 10-15 years, and falling since then. <br><br>And the argument seems to be that this is traceable to young people, fewer of whom are getting driver's licenses. e.g. see <a href=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/trends/current/section1rvc.pdf rel=nofollow>figure 1.11b in this document</a>. This holds true in the US too -- <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/23/AR2010012301339.html rel=nofollow>only about 30% of 16-year-olds are getting licenses now vs about 45% 20 years ago.</a><br><br>Unfortunately, not much of this is ascribed to altruism -- reasons suggested are more along the lines of increased inconvenience in getting a license, increased cost of owning a car, etc. But one argument is that <a href=http://www.shareable.net/blog/the-iphone-is-the-new-prius rel=nofollow>computers are weaning young people off of cars.</a> I'm not sure which has the higher lifetime ecological footprint between an iPhone and a car, but I suspect it might be a shift in the right direction. To continue your metaphor, perhaps the smartphones are a move towards shorter sugar polymers than starch, but at the very least is a move away from the sugar.<br><br>I also wonder if Kay's argument doesn't apply somewhat more to baby boomers than it does to the newer generation?

Since it's late, I'm going to have to contribute only a stream of consciousness, I'm afraid. Thus:<br><br>* Today I watched an absolutely terrifying report from an Australian current affairs program regarding peak oil: <a href=http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/3201781.htm rel=nofollow>Catalyst</a>. Everyone reading this will want to watch it. One key point for me is that the chief economist of the IEA expects the price of oil to rise 30% in the next three years. The journalist has a conversation with another oil researcher, in which the following snippet appears: <br><br><strong>Dr Jonica Newby</strong> (the reporter)<br>How soon before I can't really afford to fly from Australia?<br><br><strong>Chris Skrebowski</strong> <br>Well get your flying in fairly quickly, shall we say. <br><br>In those two sentences I see my job disappearing very very soon.<br><br>* That leads me on to the question of what is a good choice of career for readers of this blog to select as they prepare for the crash. I've already noted my choice; since the boomer generation will continue to get ill, and petroleum-based pharmaceuticals will essentially vanish from most people's lives, and <a href=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/apr/07/antibiotic-resistance-bacteria rel=nofollow>antibiotics become useless anyway</a>, health is going to become a major concern. I am going to build on my past exposure to Chinese medicine, martial arts, and meditation to try to create a niche here. This will take most of my spare income while I still have a job. It may be more profitable to train as a plumber or electrician, but I would not find these as satisfying.<br><br>* The &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/%D0%A1%D0%98%D0%A1%D0%A2%D0%95%D0%9C%D0%90-%D0%A1%D0%98%D0%91%D0%98%D0%A0%D0%A1%D0%9A%D0%98%D0%99-%D0%9A%D0%90%D0%97%D0%90%D0%9A-SYSTEM%D0%90-SIBERIAN-COSSACK/175185753921?sk=app_2392950137#!/pages/%D0%A1%D0%98%D0%A1%D0%A2%D0%95%D0%9C%D0%90-%D0%A1%D0%98%D0%91%D0%98%D0%A0%D0%A1%D0%9A%D0%98%D0%99-%D0%9A%D0%90%D0%97%D0%90%D0%9A-SYSTEM%D0%90-SIBERIAN-COSSACK/175185753921@&gt;Siberian Cossacks&lt;/a&gt; are an interesting case study. I've had no personal contact with them, but they seem to be reviving traditional community spirit by combining folk dance, group singing, and martial arts. Their values are not my own, but they do seem to be very successful at building a resilient community.<br><br>* It may be coincidence, but it seemed to me that Geaorge Monbiot had his conversion to nuclear power at the same time that there was a lot of media coverage of thorium-based nuclear power. While the use of uranium-based nuclear power (fast running out, leaving waste that will be dangerous for millenia) is clearly insane, the limited amount that I have read about thorium leaves me wanting to know more. I have no idea how mature the technology is, but I have not yet read about a downside to it in the theory.<br><br><a href=#c7725267041501789173 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 2:52 PM</a><br><br>

After reading your blog for last couple of years I have finally managed to sign and post a comment! <br>The real issue with these kinds of metaphors is that they present a false dichotomy i.e. A false choice between two alternatives. I am not an expert in this field, but I am not so sure the yeast die. Yeast reproduce by division, and microbes are well known for their ability to create cysts or other kinds of "space suits" to survive in hostile environments, going into stasis. A quick Google search on bacterial life cycles didn't mention dying as part of the cycle. There could be other factors limiting yeast production in the brewing process. Indeed, before commercial "starters" were available, wasn't all fermented products (bread, yoghurt, beer/wine) "started" from the last batch? So in actuality the yeast have already evolved a solution. They grow rapidly when the conditions are right, enter into stasis when conditions are not right. The truth is the people who trot out these sort of analogies don't want to even contemplate life without cheap energy. They simply don't want to put the effort into adapting to changing circumstances. <br>Case in point: my wife and I have ditched our cars and bought scooters. I was not prepared for the physical and mental adjustment needed to go from 4 wheels to 2. But 90 miles to the gallon is a powerful pursuader. Plus they are a real blast to ride!<br><br><a href=#c6154872475088180849 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 2:52 PM</a><br><br>

On the motorway they are at least roughly patched, but on some of the minor roads they can be pretty bad. Some seem to have been marked for repair but, even if they are mended, the next winter will see them back, and worse. This does not look like it will have a happy ending, given the combination of falling local revenues and the rising cost of oil. If I had the money, I would seriously be considering investing in a pony and trap for local transport (replacing taxis/short car trips) and deliveries. Unfortunately, I have neither the funds nor the knowledge of horses. I'm sure that someone will fill this niche, though.<br><br>I'm pretty sure that the endgame Bill suggests, of householders having the duty to maintain roads, power cables etc that adjoin their property has pretty solid historical precedent, though the exact details escape me at the moment - the Byzantines perhaps?

He paints the standard scenario of us continuing to consume and consume, at ever-increasing rates, until we have consumed the earth right out from under our feet and we finally plummet into the inky blackness below. There just seems to be this belief that nothing can stop the growth juggernaut, nothing can make people chose to use less. <br><br>Bollocks. There is a very easy way to make people consume less; Make it too expensive. Energy consumption will fall; this is not a choice it is a fact. And it is clear that the way this will happen is that energy will become less affordable. Whether this happens by energy getting more expensive or by people getting poorer or both, people can't use energy they can't buy (except for the modest amounts they can grow or collect themselves). The cry goes up at this point that you are "rationing by price," and that this is unfair. Well, news flash: we ALREADY ration the necessities of life by price. Your access to food, housing, and energy is already a function of how rich you are. Why on earth would we expect this to change?<br><br>In Monbiot's scenario, each of these more exotic and far-flung energy sources is also more expensive. We're not gonna just plow right through them until we've used them all; eventually the expense will put the brakes on civilization. EVERYONE seems to have forgotten that one of the triggers for the 2007-2008 economics debacle was the spike in oil prices and the economic slowdown that caused. This is one of the main things that set the house of cards to wobbling and lead to its all coming down.<br><br>We will use less. It doesn't matter whether we do this willingly or not; we will do it. We will not consume the Earth out from under our feet; only hubris, short-sightedness, and tunnel vision would allow us to think we could possibly be capable of that.<br><br><a href=#c5192984656717521934 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 3:24 PM</a><br><br>

Most solid estimates of future fossil fuel production project declines ranging from 1% a year on up, and accelerating as depletion proceeds, starting in the current decade. To keep petroleum production level in the face of current depletion rates of existing fields, for example, we'd have to come up with a new Saudi Arabia worth of oil fields every couple of years; we're not doing that now, and there's no reason to think we're going to do it any time soon. That means crunch time is fairly close. <br><br>Matt and Jess, you aren't the only ones feeling the urgency. We really don't have a lot of time. As for simplicity, yes, it's a good thing -- as long as it doesn't get turned into a sales pitch for "simple" products, as so often happens!<br><br>Richard, exactly. The trap of hoping that things will work out while flushing your chance of a decent future down the non-composting toilet is an easy one to get into. Doesn't make it any less self-defeating, of course.<br><br>ZZ, sure; just remember that Cuba's a dictatorship, and it's a lot easier to get certain things done when you can basically order them to be done, and nobody has the right to disagree. <br><br>Houner, we're urban -- a small city, granted, but still well within city limits -- and deer haven't been a problem. (Groundhogs, on the other hand, are an issue.) The stakes are still a good idea, of course. <br><br>Steve, those are excellent tips. Thank you!<br><br>Thardiust, human beings may not be insects but we make a lot of the same mistakes.<br><br>Adrian, agreed -- unfashionable urban and semi-urban zones have a lot going for them; that's where we are, comfortably settled in a small Rust Belt city where costs are low, real estate's cheap, and people are friendly.<br><br><a href=#c4150490518599881078 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 3:31 PM</a><br><br>

His argument is quite simply we as a species will use all available resources in our efforts to keep our standard of living intact, and as decline sets in that means having enough to eat. In the process we will destroy the environment and thus crash our populations even more steeply, along with much of the biosphere.<br><br>Your argument is well made, but is taking the perspective of how individuals can prepare for inevitable decline rather than looking at strategies to mitigate the effects of the decline on the environment.<br><br>What Monbiot does not honestly address is population, as the multiplier which will do all the damage on the way down.<br><br>Do I detect some emotion from your side, by the way, in calling Monbiot a 'psuedo-environmentalist'? Defining an environmentalist as someone who deprecates nuclear power is bizarre, in my view. Those who understand the physics (I flatter myself that I do) would soundly dispute your assertion that it represents a major global danger. Compared to the carnage resulting from the onset of economic decline, radioactive poisoning on almost any imaginable scale will be *utterly* insignificant.<br><br>I would happily accept more nuclear power if it could help make the decline smoother and less destructive to the planet. Sadly I think we've missed the opportunity to develop the efficient Thorium based fast reactors which would really make a difference (they generate almost no waste and consume today's toxic waste).<br><br><a href=#c3227372342587261866 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 3:36 PM</a><br><br>

As they dried up I would collect the poor pathetic pollywogs squirming in the mud and transfer them to the ponds still around. Eventually I ran out of ponds and returned one day to find all the dried out tadpols. What I eventually realized is that frogs and toads in our desert climate don't bred once and then lay eggs, but are laying eggs continually over the wet season. The tadpoles themselves don't develop at the same rate, some mature faster than others. This is the basis of natural selection. I think the same thing happened to your compost pile. Its easy in these situations to draw the wrong conclusion.<br><br><a href=#c3940920621087528274 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 3:36 PM</a><br><br>

Little bits of unused space like that are a great way to get going on a garden. <br><br>Kieran, that's excellent news. I've done without a car my entire adult life; it's never been more than an occasional hindrance, and the money I've saved went a long way to make it possible for me to pursue a writing career during the early and not very lucrative phase of that career path. With any luck, some of the young people who are doing without cars will make the same discovery: you're a lot freer without a car than with one. <br><br>Carp, we're very close to peak air travel, if not past it. As for thorium reactors, er, have you noticed that every generation of nuclear power gets sold with the same enthusiastic claims that it'll be safe, cheap, environmentally benign, and so on? Then it gets built, and it turns out to be nothing of the kind. I think it's time to stop buying the hype. <br><br>Bruce, that's been my sense, too -- there's a huge amount of pseudo-green rhetoric that focuses on insisting that there's some way for us to have our planet and eat it too. Good for you, by the way -- a scooter's a much more sensible technology than a car. Mind you, I prefer shoes, but to each his or her own. <br><br>Carp, in the Middle Ages you could get into heaven for repairing bridges and roads -- they were generally so bad that the Church offered indulgences for just about any sin you could think of for people who fixed them. Hermits used to build their huts near some bridge or other, and make repairing and tending the bridge part of their devotions; the locals would make sure the hermits stayed fed, out of sheer gratitude, and also because giving alms to a hermit would get you time off purgatory. I don't know how long it'll be before bridge-tending hermit becomes a viable job, but it's probably somewhere in our future.<br><br><a href=#c8735166008146415911 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 3:42 PM</a><br><br>

On the titanic, there were not enough lifeboats for everyone!<br>So upper-class people were maybe a little favoured. In this case you could argue that only people with access to certain info, which may require a certain level of education, will have access to the relevant info/viewpoint.<br>However the advantage of your vision is that it is modest - that s why it stands more chances of leading to practical change than say neoprimitivism, which is equally well-built intellectually. No need for large amounts of time, or expensive instruction, or access to unsoiled ecologies...:) In a way, the whole Green Wizard project is to try to come up with some kind of Third World 2.0 - how to make the most of what would now be regarded as 3rd World living, and would be considered now as an irrealistic project "bad bad bad!!" <br>This is the genius of your vision - choose the easiest solution, in terms of energy and resource necessities. But not in human terms!<br><br>Another point to consider about the Titanic: we are not living on an isolated boat. The possibility of a crowd panic (on the Titanic, or say, in Western Europe's 1930s...) could take you away and prevent or forbid you from even choosing to get to the lifeboats.<br>Besides when the proverbial liner is down on the seabed, there is not much long term consequence except for a terrible loss. However not quite the same could be said of a civilization using or affecting pretty much all of the planet's ecology !<br><br>Finally, having conventions dedicated to Green Wizardry is not a criteria of success. Neoprimitivism also has those, and so does the Climate Change activism... In the latter, even the governments are invited!<br>However, the increasing number of people taking a quiet interest in the informations related to your topics of predilection is very encouraging.<br><br>Here in Western Europe we definitely lack the ability of USA people who are more individualistic and also more prone to adopt new ideas, and even if the energy shortages are not as threatening as in the US, the collective panics that we are trying to forget are much more of a threat!<br><br><a href=#c1009490380236323403 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 3:46 PM</a><br><br>

The whole point of environmentalism is giving up the habit of stealing from the future -- grabbing at benefits now and pushing the costs off onto our descendants. Nuclear power's the ultimate example of stealing from the future, since it produces wastes that will be around to poison living things a quarter of a million years from now. Once a soi-disant environmentalist starts preaching about how nuclear power is the best option we've got, when the best option we've got is, ahem, USING LESS ENERGY, they've come out in favor of stealing from the future in its most egregious form. <br><br>As for thorium reactors, sure, they're safe, clean, and environmentally benign. Right. And nuclear reactors will give us electricity too cheap to meter, and fusion power is just twenty years in the future.

I mean, were animals after all. I mean... what does that mean? I think that means that instead of living under the sun and the moon and the sky and the stars, we're living in a fantasy world of our own making.<br> <br>WALLY: Yeah, but I mean, I would never give up my electric blanket, Andre. I mean, because New York is cold in the winter. I mean, our apartment is cold! It's a difficult environment. I mean, our life is tough enough as it is. I'm not looking for ways to get rid of a few things that provide relief and comfort. I mean, on the contrary, I'm looking for more comfort because the world is very abrasive. I mean, I'm trying to protect myself because, really, there's these abrasive beatings to be avoided everywhere you look! <br><br>ANDRE: But, Wally, don't you see that comfort can be dangerous? I mean, you like to be comfortable and I like to be comfortable too, but comfort can lull you into a dangerous tranquility. <br><br>ANDRE: "I wouldn't put on an electric blanket for any reason. First, I'd be worried if I get electrocuted. No, I don't trust technology. But I mean, the main thing, Wally, is that I think that kind of comfort just separates you from reality in a very direct way."<br><br>And another from the same film:<br><br>ANDRE: "OK. Yes, we are bored. We're all bored now. But has it ever occurred to you Wally that the process that creates this boredom that we see in the world now may very well be a self-perpetuating, unconscious form of brainwashing, created by a world totalitarian government based on money, and that all of this is much more dangerous than one thinks? and it's not just a question of individual survival Wally, but that somebody who's bored is asleep, and somebody who's asleep will not say no?" <br><br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>As for what jobs might be needed in the future – RICKSHAWS!

But I think it is also quite legitimate and reasonable to try to enjoy some of the nice aspects of this civilization, realizing they will sooner or later disappear. Especially for us whose outlook without modern medicine is very uncertain. I mean, going to concerts, playing with a band, buying and reading books on topic you have been enthusiastically interested in for years but which are not useful from the "survivalist" point of view. I suppose I would later regret very much I spent all the time and each penny on preparing for a collapse without exploiting these last opportunities, possibly just to die in ten years.

But there are things crucial to my spiritual life that I won't simply through away in anticipation of their demise.<br><br>As for perspective skills - I am thinking of bicycle fixing, as it is seem very probale people will need bicycles, just in the way Chinese were used to use them until recently. The question is, how long will be bicycles viable - you have to get tires from somewhere, etc. On the other other hand, it seems that bicycles were viable in some part of the Third World even without much oil.<br><br>And as for "spiritual preparation" - well, you know, culture (especially for an intellectual) and associated spiritual life are not things that you simply pragmatically throw away or change if they seem "outdated". They form you, or at least me, as a distinct individual, they "make" you, and they "make" your world. However unprofitable for me, I will certainly not throw away the things I have believed for my whole not that long life. This is a kind of vain idealism, but without it is not me, and I might die as well physically. Actually, it seems to me that this single issue belongs to the most important yet most difficult to figure out ones, vis-a-vis peak oil.<br><br><a href=#c3388238473524302467 title="comment permalink">5/6/11, 2:29 AM</a><br><br>

The argument turns on coal. <br><br>However much coal will be actually mined, blowing off the tops of mountains etc. it might or might not be the trigger for catastrophic climate change, for example taking us over the threshold and triggering methane pulses from soil and sea bed reserves, but coal causes a very large number of deaths each year and leaves a legacy of, for example, dispersed mercury that will accumulate in food chains (exterminating large marine animals, for example?).<br><br>We do carry natural radioactive potassium in our bodies, so it is not a clever idea to add to the dose we must get inevitably. Nuclear power will produce incredibly long-lived elements like plutonium, which are toxic, but most of the hazard to humans has come from relatively short lived radioactive Iodine (half life 8 days). A recent US National Institute of Health report of ongoing Chernobyl studies, talks about ongoing deaths from thyroid cancer in people who were children and young persons at the time, and who got their dose in the week or so after Chernobyl. Several hundred deaths are reported from Ukraine and Belarus over the years, and there will be more.<br><br>I have been opposed to nuclear power for many years for the obvious reasons, and the less obvious reason that it could be a waste of money and resources compared with what we really need to do, like getting our health, safety and well being while using a lot less of modern conveniences (JMG's lists!).<br><br>Having said that, there is a powerful argument for not burning coal - and it might be possible to temporarily 'trade' nuclear power for some of the remaining coal. At least George Monbiot thinks so. The 'trade' also might just cushion the future for a while for a lot of people, and provide some additional margin of safety for the climate. Nuclear power of course is not sufficient to maintain business as usual (BAU) and my guess, for what it is worth, is that not much NP will get built world wide - too big and expensive to build and fuel and maintain.<br><br>George Monbiot remains an environmentalist in my view, and his attention for example to the devastation of the peat-soil forests of Indonesia and Malaysia by the mad dash for palm oil (think transport and even UK power stations firing palm oil) might be a lot more important than any discussion of nuclear power.<br><br><a href=#c399067041181269164 title="comment permalink">5/6/11, 2:33 AM</a><br><br>

Then, - though it is clear that the history does not recur and the process will be asymmetric to a considerable extent - I do not fully understand the points regarding e.g. cultural conservation, as if we really had to return to the Stone Age. Let us take public schools - they were quite common in the 16th c. in Bohemia, long before oil. I know, on a completely different scale than today, but still, you had the system of education plus the central university (since 1346), and flourishing humanistic literature. The same is true of the Third World countries. Likewise, it is not clear whether there will really be a sociopolitical disintegration, maybe it depends on region - most of the European states, for example, have been here in a form since before 1000 AD and survived many crises.

If that were the case, every level of society would be showing less money and lower living standards. Rather, the rich have gotten correspondingly richer almost exactly in proportion to the poor getting poorer. Its been a political/economic transfer, nothing to do with peak energy. The American middle class has been gutted since the late seventies even as our energy supplies increased. I agree that over time we'll see all levels take a hit, but that's not what we're seeing now, at least not yet. Of course, the practical results for the average person are exectly the same, so its a bit of an academic distinction.<br><br>Still, in terms of careers, I dont think enough consideration has been given to the money side of the equation. I read in my community newspaper that a popular local farmer just ended his small poultry farm operation because the price of corn doubled, and he realized he could not pass the price increase onto his customers because his eggs were already more expensive than the eggs in the store. Similarly, there is a pioneering aquaponics facility not far from me, but they are undercut by cheap Chinese imports farmed under far less environmentally friendly conditions and flown in from across the world. I read all the time about farmers being foreclosed on and having to learn new careers because they can't make things work economically, and these are experienced farmers. These are things to think about for anyone thinking about trying to go into farming or start some sort of post peak business. How can anyone build sustainable businesses under current economic conditions? Some think its going to crash eventually, but when? I see no end to cheap imports and multinational corporations cutting potential domestic entrepreneurs off at the knees. I don't know about the rest of you, but I have precious little need for a blacksmith.<br><br>It seems like a lot of posters here are economically well off - their own land where they can grow their own food, insulate their house, add passive solar, etc, etc. What about the rest of us? We will still need to earn money, no matter how frugal we live. We still need to cover the rent. Even if we own a house (I don't), we still need to pay property taxes and utilites. To forego utilities would require major investments like photovoltaics and solar water heating which are expensive investments. Growing a significant part of your own food requires a great deal of land. I can't feed myself with a small community garden plot. It seems like a paradox - the very people that need and want to build a sustainable lifestyle outside of the money economy do not have the resources to do so, whereas those with ample resources who are reasonably comfortable are able to do so. Those of us with very little have no choice but to play the game - we cannot afford to purchase independance.<br><br><a href=#c4797069026202509464 title="comment permalink">5/6/11, 11:23 AM</a><br><br>

I liked the metaphor about the life boat and the Titanic.<br> <br>I teach elementary school science and we have a school garden. It is encouraging to see the salubrious nature of the garden itself to the children. Even if all we do for a lesson is learn about weeds and pull them, the kids (for the most part) are on task and very happy to do so. While planing for trips to the garden, as a professional, I struggle with putting my teaching into terms of what can get done in a certain amount of time. If I kept the kids indoors and worked solely in my classroom, far more material can get covered. However, true learning about a garden, or ecosystems, or just about anything else, can only take place once their little hands have hit the soil. While on paper I get far less "done" while outdoors in the sun or rain, I get to watch the kids build a relationship with what they eat, I watch them learn that it takes no small effort to grow food (time, pests, disease, etc.) and observe them discover that food is seasonal. If they walk away with no more than that I feel like I have helped further their learning.<br><br>My next professional struggle will be to try and have the kids discover how our modern society functions within the earth's ecosystems. I want them to discover that without fossil fuels our society could never have developed to its current size or complexity. Further, I want at least some of them who can take it a bit further to draw to what should be a fairly obvious yet profound conclusion that should fossil fuels become scarce then society will have real difficulties maintaining its complexity and size. My wish is not to scare them - rather just to set in their mind the seed that there are deep troubles in the way our system is currently running and that they are going to need to think about the larger picture of how to deal with the untenable situation our society finds itself in now.<br><br>Wish me luck!<br><br>Cheers,<br>BB<br><br><a href=#c1754201309987190477 title="comment permalink">5/6/11, 11:57 AM</a><br><br>

As for your water shortage, that's something you're probably going to have to learn to live with; radical water conservation and other desert-dweller habits temporarily abandoned during the Age of Affluence will likely define the only way forward.<br><br>Gypsy, your best bet is probably to pick up (at the library, if the budget's tight) the two books I've published with those titles; they're the finished product of which a bunch of the posts here were first drafts. Congrats on your container gardens! That's an excellent step. <br><br>Iaato, since you can't control it, it's probably wisest to focus on the things you can control, like your own energy and resource consumption. The old Stoics used to point out that the best way to get through life is to concentrate on the things you can actually do something about!<br><br>Beneath, you're welcome! For the time being, at least, it's not an inordinate burden. <br><br>Greg, good. Now could you repeat that point about exponential growth on a finite planet where the rest of the world can hear it, and get a clue? ;-)<br><br>Sruggieri, thank you! Andre's point about boredom is actually much more important than most people realize. I'll be addressing it in an upcoming post. <br><br>David, well, that was a nice thumping denunciation! Still, it won't wash. It's precisely the insistence that people won't use less energy -- an insistence that was disproved by the experience of the late 70s and early 80s, when the world's industrial nations racked up double-digit percentage decreases in energy use in a decade -- that amounts to advocating business as usual. What was the difference between then and now? Partly high energy prices -- which we're getting back -- but also principled advocacy <i>backed by personal example</i> of energy-saving techniques and lifestyle change by environmental groups back then. <br><br>Furthermore, the claim that we have to go with nuclear or we'll destroy the biosphere by burning fossil fuels is a whopping fallacy in its own right. Despite Monbiot's claim -- and I note that none of the people who've waded on here to defend him have challenged this part of my critique -- peak oil is here; peak coal and natural gas are not far off; <i>we are all going to use less anyway</i> because the "alternative" energy sources -- including nuclear -- aren't viable without the massive energy subsidies they get from existing, highly concentrated fossil fuels. That's the challenge we need to get ready to face. <br><br>Jason, I hadn't thought of that. I wonder if there's any way they can come up with an acronym for the next round of printing money that works out to TITANIC...<br><br><a href=#c6874080632473610039 title="comment permalink">5/6/11, 1:00 PM</a><br><br>

The crucial point is not to be dependent for your survival on anything that's going to collapse out from underneath you in the not too distant future. <br><br>Phil, burning palm oil as a biofuel doesn't contaminate the biosphere for a quarter of a million years. As for coal, no, it's not the issue; the issue is the refusal, even on the part of people who claim to be environmentalists, to USE LESS ENERGY, and to advocate forcefully for steps that will make it easy for others to do the same. For heaven's sake, just the cost of replacing America's two dozen or so Fukushima-style nuclear reactors would pay for a $2000 weatherization retrofit for every house, apartment, and condominium in the United States! We have plenty of options beyond the fake forced choice between coal and nuclear power. <br><br>Lei, this is why I stress the point that my blog focuses primarily on American conditions. What's true on your side of the pond is not necessarily true over here!<br><br>Remnant, thank you for a good solid dose of common sense. It's exactly the unwillingness of the technically educated to deal with the poor fit between their models and real world conditions that has helped make so many dimensions of our present predicament. <br><br>Grrl, coffee gives me migraines, so that was an easy one for me! One of my current projects is figuring out domestic sources for green tea -- my preferred vice -- or, if necessary, trying to grow it myself. <br><br>Hawlkeye, that's a good point. Maybe we need to talk about old-fashioned lifeboats, the kind with oars, where everyone aboard who could lent a hand rowed the thing to shore. <br><br>Adrian, good. Very good. You're getting the core strategy I have in mind here. <br><br>Tom, as I discuss in my forthcoming book <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/W/The-Wealth-of-Nature rel=nofollow>The Wealth of Nature</a>, the current habit of blowing bubbles is actually a function of energy and resource depletion -- there's so little profit to be gained by producing goods and services at this point within the existing system that money moves into the "tertiary economy" of paper wealth instead, inflating ever more drastic bubbles. Expect more of the same, until the whole thing comes unglued. <br><br>Draft, that's correct. As for Mumford, er, check the bibliography; I note that he didn't make it into the index, which was an oversight, but <i>The Myth of the Machine</i> in particular was an important influence on my work. <br><br>Remnant, well, if you find Mises useful, by all means; I don't. We had bigger bubbles and worse depressions in the second half of the 19th century, before the Fed was founded, than we've had since then. <br><br>Bruce, that's a great story!<br><br>Escape, from my point of view. that's an overly simplistic analysis. Most of the money currently lining the pockets of the very rich is hallucinatory wealth -- derivatives and other paper with no real value outside the willingness of the current moneyed classes to pretend that it's worth its face value. That's become so large a part of our economy, in turn, because the real economy of goods and services is in decline. <br><br>Blackbird, luck! It's a noble effort -- I hope it works out.<br><br><a href=#c1578096037270128452 title="comment permalink">5/6/11, 1:24 PM</a><br><br>

Then he goes on to say:<br><br>“Decarbonising the economy involves an increase in infrastructure.

I believe that it is possible to have “infrastructure” that is beautiful, ecologically sound and controlled by human beings and the communities that we participate in. JMG doesn’t paint a rosy picture of the future and I don’t subscribe to one either. However, I also am convinced that such an ecologically sound “infrastructure” is easier to finance locally and better able find its footing admist economic and ecological tragedy once we get past the stages of denial that reinforce our past bad decisions. Insisting on trading one kind of ugliness and destruction for another is not only unacceptable but also completely pointless. I think the remote governments and corporations have already made some decisions about this anyway. According to a recent report by The Union of Concerned Scientists private corporations have not invested in nuclear electricty in decades and in fact the whole industry has cost more in government subsidies than the market value of the electricty it produced. Once the governments can’t afford the subsidies the industry will be abandonned whether we can convince ourselves it is the “new green” or not. <br><br>Michael<br><br>PS-<br>http://hornofamaltheia.blogspot.com/2011/03/horn-of-amaltheia.html<br>(some similar points regarding the narratives behind a debate about nuclear power between Stoneleigh and Karl Denniger in March 2011)<br><br><a href=#c7886628673468247476 title="comment permalink">5/6/11, 2:38 PM</a><br><br>

That's just to be a hair-splitter for a moment... But since I've decided to react I'll also leave several of my seeds to you, JMG.<br><br>To begin with, thank you for your suggestive and eye-opening work. A friend of mine who is living in Burgundia in a rural area, doing a lof of gardening, learning bee-keeping and other steps towards re-skilling, is right now translating The Long Descent into the Czech language. I hope she'll spread the word about it among her French circles too. Saying it is definitely worth it would purport as - to use a nicely outdated idiom - carrying coal to Newcastle.<br><br>However, I would say - as far as I am familiar with the "peak fossil liquid hydrocarbon net energy" - that you underestimate the potential of "alternative" fossil fuels and exxegarate current impact of peak oil – I am on that with GM, I think ERoI is a holy cow of some „peak-oilers“, much bigger problem seems to be the depedence on the current infrustructure. I still bear in mind the famous Max Weber's quote from The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (many of you know form TOD): "This order [i.e. capitalism] is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which today determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with the economic acquisition, with irresistible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt." Fossil fuels are conditiones sine quibus non of industrial era. However, take into account for instance shale gas (very environmentally unfriendly) or one of the Brazilian megaprojects Santos Basin (it is estimated there are 500 billions barrels of this pre-salt, indeed, very difficult to extract oil but the estimated costs of one barrell are somewhere around 50 dollars).<br><br>Plus it seems to me that you underestimate several other more actual topics (what I completely miss in your thougts - as far as I know them - is political, jurisdical and managment perspective even though I do realize a pile of reasons for not including them; unfortunately that does not mean these areas won't be crucial, I especially think you do not cover properly our direct dependency on money – well, green wizardy is a great idea, no doubt about it, but there are still many related problems that cannot be solved via that way, e.g. mandatory expenses) and as a result ecotechnic future seems to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. I know that it is precisely what it tends to be but shouldn't we use while promoting it more accurate descriptions of status quo instead of those kind of distorted ones? And very likely the hardest dilemma: should we try to maintain status quo in its current state, or not? Maintaining the BAU seems to provide more time and I think that is what we need the most. Take also into account that it is inevitable several crises will come sooner or later despite our tries to stop it. While shipping between Scylla and Charybdis we are facing many Sophie's choices; that is also the case of nuclear power. Is it is very easy to critize and refuse it at all but one should not forget there are many of us still using it.<br><br><a href=#c4725785412750650205 title="comment permalink">5/6/11, 5:01 PM</a><br><br>

From that perspective I consider the text "Discounted future" written by Nicole Foss as timeless and I higly recommend it to everyone. It is important to realize that we cannot expect that our future will bring as much (many times low-quality material affluence and abudance) as majority of us has been used to until now. We'll sooner or later realize that we no longer live the bright idea of growth that itself is an expression of the idea of progress and that makes a lot sense to everyone, no matter he or she understands the theory behind or not. The idea of progress is originally invention of the age of Enlightement and it is based on the secularized linear philosophy of history. Even though there are works describing the end of idea of progress (Zdzislaw Krasnodebski). I doubt it counts for the reality that is lived by individual lifes. There is still a lot of progress interpretated/expressed as economic growth present in us. Is it possible to change the interpretation/expression? Isn't this expression wrong path taken by secularized form of modernisation? Do we want to preserve the idea of progress? That are the questions. Indeed, we won't have in many times that choice but we'll still live this inner and external paradox. And it will be burden our souls. I think this shift from progress-orientation to descent and resilience thinking is the core of the whole problem.<br><br>Your metaphors of yeast-sugar or staying on a board-escaping on a lifeboat are too black&amp;white.

Still, the climate here in the Appalachians isn't that far from the climate in some tea-growing regions of China, and there are varieties of tea that grow in Russia, so I have hopes!<br><br>Rich, one of the most challenging tasks ahead of us is that of reshaping our lifestyles to fit the ecologies of the places we live. Irrigation canals commonly shut down in the declining phases of civilizations; even when soil salinization hasn't become an issue, maintaining complex infrastructure stops being an option. There are ways to live in an arid or semiarid region without irrigation, but they need to be (re)learned, and fast. <br><br>Michael, that's funny. You're quite right; Monbiot immediately proves his own point by making a statement about infrastructure that's based on a belief system, not any sort of technology. If we, ahem, USE LESS ENERGY, that doesn't take any kind of massive infrastructure buildout; what it takes is the much cheaper and lower-impact process of retrofitting our homes and other buildings to conserve energy and to produce some of what's needed on the spot via solar water heating and other proven, sensible steps. That approach isn't in Monbiot's belief system, so he talks about infrastructure -- and quite frankly talks nonsense about it. What part of nuclear infrastructure isn't "ugly, destructive and controlled by remote governments and corporations"? <br><br>Archivist, once suburbia completes its historical trajectory and turns into a ring of shantytowns and truck farms surrounding the deindustrializing cities, it'll use very little energy outside of human muscle power -- with some solar and wind, if we work hard at getting low-cost, locally relevant technologies into people's hands as soon as possible.

It sounds to me, though, like you’ve speeded up your process a little since last year’s posts? There seems to be a bit more urgency in your writing, and I understand why. It’s a lot like walking on an iced pond in spring… a feeling like the wrong move could send you into icy waters! <br><br>One of my biggest struggles now is how fast to prepare for what. Example: I tend to save materials that might be useful, but today I cleared out a bunch because I realize I need the space, and it probably won’t be useful to have a ton of tin cans this early into collapse. I need to be saving for an intermediate scenario, but that’s so hard to judge. I have a nice collection of hand tools, but use the power drill and sharpener and mower just to save my strength for the hard manual gardening. I don’t want to wear myself out before I have to, as long as power is still available… so the struggle is to have the ability to manage if some major services drop off, while still not killing my (not so young) self in learning all this green wizardry. <br><br>@forestdoor: <i>My pressing question, however, is this: How can one prepare for any of this when one is currently poor enough to probably never own land, a house, etc.? It seems that most stories of people downsizing, returning to the land, etc., feature people who already had some degree of wealth.</i> You might want to check around (via Craig’s List or something) for older folk in nearby rural-ish areas who would trade labor for veggies or fruit. I sure would love some strong young person who would be interested in that! The young folk here don’t want to do manual labor, or they expect $25/hr! At some point, you might find yourself making a deal with someone who has land but lacks energy or strength.<br><br>@DaShui <i>A problem with switching to a low energy lifestyle (for a man) is that no woman will have anything to do with you, as women have evolved to seek out high status mates which means in modern society conspicuous consumption.</i> <br>I beg to differ! Heck, I’m doing it all myself on my ¾’s acre, and would love to meet men who also believe in green wizardry and getting ready to manage a low-energy life. And when I go down to the “big city” (Eugene) I find women at the sustainable meetings as well as men… don’t give up. ;-)<br><br>And hey, if any of you are in upstate NY, I notice Sharon Astyk is looking for two summer interns to work for learning all sorts of sustainable skills! <a rel=nofollow>http://scienceblogs.com/casaubonsbook/</a><br><br><a href=#c1056743619391118053 title="comment permalink">5/6/11, 9:35 PM</a><br><br>

Happens all the time in the not very free market where stocks are sold. <br><br>Cathy, yes, there's more urgency. Events are moving very quickly now; it's anyone's guess exactly when the next really big wave of crisis is going to hit, but the next couple of years could get very lively. It's still the same old work that has to be done, but those who aren't getting to it may miss their chance.<br><br><a href=#c5050591746615461059 title="comment permalink">5/6/11, 10:23 PM</a><br><br>

That is, what is our emotional experience of and response to this whole predicament? And can that be changed? I'm convinced that in many cases, this is the most important change we can make in our lives to prepare. It's more of a spiritual than a practical preparation.

But has it ever occurred to you Wally that the process that creates this boredom that we see in the world now may very well be a self-perpetuating, unconscious form of brainwashing created by a world totalitarian government based on money?

He's a Swedish physicist, Christophe Bjornsen, and he told me that he no longer watches television, he doesn't read newspapers, and he doesn't read magazines. He's completely cut them out of his life, because he really does feel that we're living in some sort of Orwellian nightmare now, and that everything you hear now contributes to turning you into a robot.<br><br>***<br><br>IMO, if folks are looking for something to do, the physicist offers a wonderful suggestion. <br><br>I cannot help but notice the tone of fear I see in many posts here - people are operating from a place of fear in regard to the present and future, e.g. losing modern medicine. This is what I meant in my earlier comment about the emotional experience of these times and our predicament.<br><br>I think that this fear is induced - intentionally IMO - by much of modern 'culture' - especially the political culture. As HL Mencken famously said decades ago:<br><br>"The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed – and thus clamorous to be led to safety – by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary."<br><br>While I disagree that all are imaginary, I think Mencken gets it exactly right that 'menace' is the basis for politics, and that Americans have been steeped in an environment which is based on their manipulation via fear-mongering. True of both the so-called left and right, IMO.<br><br>So it seems to me that the very first effort we need to make as green wizards, or even as human beings, is not to learn how to compost (as vitally important as that is), but to learn to free ourselves from the pall of fear that hangs over us and inhibits effective action. But this has real implications. Mencken also said:<br><br>"The fact is that the average man's love of liberty is nine-tenths imaginary, exactly like his love of sense, justice and truth. He is not actually happy when free; he is uncomfortable, a bit alarmed, and intolerably lonely. Liberty is not a thing for the great masses of men. It is the exclusive possession of a small and disreputable minority, like knowledge, courage and honor. It takes a special sort of man to understand and enjoy liberty — and he is usually an outlaw in democratic societies."<br><br><a href=#c2862441291937874835 title="comment permalink">5/7/11, 9:02 AM</a><br><br>

The second is that most people have to prepare for the energy poor life ahead while remaining fully engaged in the present economy. (I loved the comment describing this as having one foot in the lifeboat and the other on the deck.) <br><br>You would think that there would be a way to pair up the people who cannot find a role in the present economy with those who are wobbling in between the lifeboat and the deck of the sinking ship. <br><br>Perhaps that "matchmaking" role would be a good career choice at this point. It is fraught though, with potential problems. There is the fact that most people don't want to perform what they will inevitably perceive to be backbreaking menial jobs on other people's property for "free".

I would like to point out a few other benefits. :)<br>Fibre work is meditative and restorative for many people. The rhythm of knitting or spinning or weaving is like telling beads on a rosary, it can be like a prayer, if you choose to make it so. The need for grounding spiritual practices has been mentioned here, and fibre work can be part of your spritual practice. As a plus, you are making something while you meditate – a sock meditation! a shawl prayer! <br>And, although we all recognize that people in general aren't going to be beating down the door for hand knit socks while Walmart is still there and they can get a bag of them for six bucks ... wait, hang on, do you actually knit socks? If you do, you probably know that lots of people already DO clamour for hand knit socks, especially wool ones. :) If you know how to knit socks (shawls, scarves, hats, mitts..) you're able to create welcome gifts for every occasion, and have a stash of stuff you can barter for things you need. Oh, it won’t fill the pantry, but I made mitts for the construction guy who did a bunch of work for us, and I know he appreciated them. In a low energy world, I might be able to pay for something in partial cash, partial food (meat, produce), partial knitted goods. <br>For fibre craft to really work in a low energy world, though, you need to have access to raw fibre: they are awesome lawnmowers, you can eat the offspring (you can eat alpaca as well as lamb), and one sheep has enough wool for at least 2 sweaters, probably more. Most sheep farmers throw away their wool these days, so if you can find a sheep farm you can get wool to practice on at least. It’ll be dirty and hard to work with, to be sure, but now’s the time to learn. Fibre prep is a piece of the craft a lot of people aren't familiar with - working with mill processed rovings is extraordinarily pleasant, and washing raw wool is stinky and messy ... but if you can wash the fleece (do check out the fermented suint method - low energy), card it (hand carders are cheap, but if you're gonna do a lot of this save up for a drum carder as well, and maybe a set of combs), and spin it (a spindle will work just fine, a wheel is faster) ... then you are set for a lifetime of sock knitting, blanket weaving, sweater making meditation.<br><br><a href=#c7659771630985617402 title="comment permalink">5/7/11, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

However, there is a problem which is not often spoken about, but impacts you directly. At the core of Industrial societies problems is that the use of fossil fuels has allowed our population numbers to grow beyond the carrying capacity of the land.<br><br>I live on acreage, and grow a percentage of my own food (which is increasing every season) but I don't for a second pretend that I'm self sufficient. <br><br>The other thing that is constantly impressed on me is that it is hard work. Today I spent four hours chopping hardwood stumps with an axe. I would use my last 20 litres of fuel in the chainsaw because it's the best use of that fuel. <br><br>The point is though, that because everything here is a bit old school (with new techniques), I realise that any large scale agricultural systems require vast amounts of oil. You and I eat oil and there are no alternatives to this scenario. It will unravel one day in our lifetimes and hungry people make for unpleasant companions.<br><br>I often read in the comments week after week, "woe is me, I don't know what profession to take up to survive any downturn." Well, it's pretty simple really.<br><br>People die in:<br>3 minutes without air;<br>3 days without water; and<br>3 weeks without food.<br><br>Remember that our numbers are in excess of the carrying capacity. You ask, what to do? Well, you don't have to worry about the air. However, you can see that it might be worthwhile researching water collection and storage methods and more importantly food. Growing it, harvesting it and cooking it. More importantly you might also want to learn about how to return the nutrients back into the soil to improve soil fertility - this is not happening in our current system. Go practice on either your balcony or in community gardens. Rip up your parents backyard - whatever, just practice, practice, practice.<br><br>When you've got your head around food, then move on to how to make alcohol (beer, wine, or spirits). Nothing will keep you in good stead like the ability to produce alcohol, as it's a tradeable commodity. It will keep you safe from harm (mostly anyway) and provide a reason for others to provide protection.<br><br>During the gold rush era here between 1850 to the 1890's people made more money by selling fruit, vegies, meat and booze than those that were out panning (or mining) for gold. Any future will be no different.<br><br>Next you'll want to start thinking about shelter. How are basic dwellings built using recycled or locally available materials. Your apartment won't be a very nice place to be if there is little or intermittent power.<br><br>You should still have some available time after all that. So learn a martial art and get fit. I don't mean go to a gym, but real endurance fitness like being able to walk 20 kilometres and then be able to do it again the next day. Try a couple of long hikes with a backpack. People aren't fit enough these days for really hard manual work.<br><br>Once you've done all that, you can start working up Maslow's heirachy of needs. A very useful individual is unlikely to get into too much trouble.<br><br>I hope you find this to be useful.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1880499327059634522 title="comment permalink">5/8/11, 12:57 AM</a><br><br>

You are dependent on the larger system that expects other ships to recognize and respond to such crises, and then to rescue those in need.<br><br>That is, where you cite lessened dependence, instead the average passenger benefits from following the established, recommended procedure, using prepared and provided supplies and facilities.<br><br>It is the hoarder, the foolish choice, that refuses to follow *conventional* wisdom.<br><br>I think I prefer a scenario where the aware person chooses to eschew the ocean voyage except to emigrate -- and for emigration to accept that dependency as being unavoidable.<br><br>When listing post-industrial jobs, I hope you include tinker, peddler - and music teacher and minstrel, and storyteller. Oral traditions for passing news and preserving culture and heritage served the pre-industrial world well. Instrument maker for non-electric instruments, birdhouse makers and people that dig ditches and wells will be needed. Working rock for removal when building as well as using rock to build structures, foundations, and fences should be useful in various regions. Fishers in rivers, lakes, and coastal waters, too. Likely even the shrimp farming of the Forrest Gump book (not the seagoing venture of the movie) will be useful.<br><br>Curing and preparing hardwoods for artisan use, making of bricks and mortar, maker of shoes and tanner of leather. Buttons may not come into need any time soon, but the times of the appropriate tech were also characterized by homely embroidery as well.<br><br>Most of all, preserve the music, and the joining of voices in song.

But consider what a mate should be, to thrive in a post-industrial world. What skills, what character, what expectations you and she must possess and what goals and ambitions you hold dear. <br><br>Then, like any endeavor worth your time, consider who you must be to attract, comfort, and cherish that caliber of mate, and what roles you will be playing in family and community to live the life that returns what is needed for your home.<br><br>Look among those people that you respect. Become a trusted member of your community. Live a life of character, honor, and integrity, and associate with such people, only. <br><br> (Hint: All the talk about beer and wine aside, I would not start the search where alcohol is served.) I would suggest that the current fashion of dating for recreation is a squandering of resources and creates bad relationship and character habits that will haunt a so-called "long term relationship". Look for someone interested in a home, not someone highly skilled at attracting dates.<br><br><a href=#c7067821240119016158 title="comment permalink">5/8/11, 2:37 AM</a><br><br>

His notion that exponential increase in the complexity of dependant consumption by advance on imaginary future means could by delaying the immediate necessity to do so somehow ensure that we just use less, seems on the face of it absolutely outrageous; and the Archdruid rightly took him to task. But considered in the context of decreasing returns from increasing complexity, the expense of implementing Monbiot's nuclear daydream, if not outright prohibitive, would at least reduce the capital available for competing options. And as a result, we would just have to use less. In fact, it is just that sort of misallocation of resources that can accelerate the certainty of using less, though that does not seem to have occurred to Monbiot. <br><br>Monbiot is still in search of a solution to a defined problem. He thinks human ingenuity can avoid predicted catastrophic discontinuity from resource depletion and atmospheric pollution. But he is clearly uncertain. Greer on the other hand is certain; certain that the catabolic collapse underway cannot be halted. And his belief system too hinges on human ingenuity; he is hopeful that sufficient numbers of people will adapt appropriately, slowing the rate of the unraveling, and enabling the conservation of knowledge and skills essential not just for species survival but the retention of an historic cultural identity.<br><br>While I think it possible that we could sterilize the planet, or short of that simply exterminate much of life on it including perhaps ourselves, I do not believe that is inevitable. We have ensured that the road ahead will be a rough one, and then one with no pavement, and finally there will be no roads - only trails.

One other point, which I'll be making in more detail later, is that there are two things on the agenda here: the first are the things that will get each of us through the mess that's looming ahead of us, and the second are the things our descendants are going to need to know, and we need to be prepared to pass on to them. Whether or not fiber arts are in the first category, they're sure as heck in the second. <br><br>Trippticket, may I take that last sentence of yours, have it made into the business end of a branding iron, and apply it freely to the backsides of all the people who think that buying lots of gold, or other assets, is going to get them through the near-to-middle future in comfort? Thanks. <br><br>Chris, nicely summarized. <br><br>Carp, I have no idea why so many people pick on blacksmithying as a craft supposedly nonviable in the near future. Most of the blacksmiths I've met make a decent living, and if they branch out into any of the specialties that produce non-decorative iron and steel products, they can do very well indeed for themselves. That will be all the more true in the future, when it'll be a lot harder to get metal in useful shapes from overseas. <br><br>Chris, you're more lenient than I am. I keep on coming back to the point that any kind of respect for the biosphere that supports all our lives demands that we stop pushing the costs of our lifestyles onto the future. Nuclear power is the ultimate example of pushing costs onto the future, and until somebody comes up with a working reactor that produces no radioactive waste with a half-life longer than the plant itself, and leaks no radionuclides into the biosphere, I consider nuclear power unacceptable on any terms. Really, the word "evil" is not too extreme. <br><br>Brad, by all means choose another metaphor if that one doesn't suit your fancy! <br><br>Cathy, excellent. Tackling the internal drives (such as clinging to routines) that keep so many people stuck in their current ruts is hard work, but it can have spectacular payoffs. <br><br>Hapibeli, best of luck with your plans! Five years from now there may not <i>be</i> much of a middle class to decide that you're nuts, so I suspect you'll be fine. <br><br>GHung, oh, I think we'll settle down to Third World status once the crisis passes. Mind you, getting from here to there is going to be a very rough road.<br><br>Lloyd, well put. To my mind, at least, there's no question that we're headed down the arc of decline and fall; the sole question is whether enough people catch on in time that we can make the curve less drastic than it has to be, and save some of the things that are worth saving. I think that's possible, but it's still very much an open question. <br><br>Joshua, that's a challenging request! Nobody alive today is an expert in navigating the decline and fall of a civilization; furthermore, situations vary so much from place to place and person to person that any such checklist would have to include a lot of if/then statements. (For example, if you live in Las Vegas -- or anywhere else where there isn't going to be a water supply once things wind down -- every other step you can take is predicated on moving somewhere else as fast as possible.) Still, I'll put some thought into it.<br><br><a href=#c7484384611909751126 title="comment permalink">5/9/11, 10:53 AM</a><br><br>

I'm in Denver for another week or so, and it's so dry here that the green grasses of spring--that aren't parts of yards, but wild places--last for maybe like 2 weeks before turning brown. It's actually more of a pretty golden color...something I'll miss. We have quite a local food movement, but also regular droughts. Our water supply comes from the mountains and that seems to be it, and it's also shared with everyone downstream. It almost never rains. I think a smaller population will be here for a long time, but they'll use extreme water preservation methods. I'm pretty sure this area didn't supported a large population before the industrial age. So I don't think I'm crazy in wanting to leave ASAP. Unfortunately I'm having trouble convincing my family and friends of this. <br><br>I think the one question that everyone my age on this blog is encountering is that of the price of land or an affordable house with decent room to grow food and homestead. I wonder just how affordable it can be in other parts of the country. I don't mind the idea of sharecropping, but I would like a little more security since we have children.

It's looking more and more like we won't have the latter three when the SHTF. At least, not in a way that could be intelligently organized. I suspect local communities and regions will largely be on their own in coping with this situation, which seems like to persist for decades. In fact, I think it's likely that this will be a major preoccupation of the next century, at least, and I don't see any silver bullets in the wings for effectively addressing the situation. Even encasement in concrete is a short term band aid, as we've seen with Chernobyl.<br><br>So it seems to me that one of the chief features of the deindustrial age will be ongoing waves of migration away from centers of radioactive contamination, as well as other centers of toxicity.<br><br>Thus, I think one of the criteria folks would be wise to consider is not simply geophysical facts such as rainfall in, say Las Vegas and Phoenix, but also insidious factors such as probable local or regional sources of lethal carcinogens, mutagens, teratogens. Not just nuclear plants, but superfund sites and government/military sites with nukes and other high concentrations of toxic materials. The US government - let us not forget - is the #1 polluter in the world.<br><br>What would be quite useful would be a map with all such sources plotted, along with suggested exclusion zones.

And where else but on a patio? However, a bicycle would not be, unless a work of art.<br><br>Our manufacturing has become very efficient and our society very wasteful. The food supply has been growing faster than the population. Scarcities of resources, and climate change,will change this. But can/will GM foods adapt our food sources fast enough? We have a lot of slack here - just switching from meat to veggies/grains/... would double the west's food supplies. Climate change may make more land available for agriculture in Canada and Siberia than it loses in Australia and the US. Change can be beneficial as well as detrimental.<br><br>Malthus predicted our demise 2 centuries ago - but progress has trampled his theories, and it hasn't stopped. <br><br>Is the ship sinking? Or is the ocean changing to mud, and new skills are needed on the new land? While I think it is always wise to live frugally and sustainably, this does not have to be a retreat to homespun wool. Rather, I think the environmental costs have to be added into the other costs, via taxes on carbon, on pollution, to gradualise society's transition to a more Conservative lifestyle.<br><br>Apartment living can become more sustainable too - in fact, you can magnify effects by convincing your neighbours. A roof garden? Or solar roof? A community garden nearby? Or a vertical farm? Community composting? Recycling? You don't have to be alone, but you do have to be persuasive. Cities allow critical masses to form and have effects. Perhaps organise to take over the local government? Or just to get some land set aside for community gardening to build skill levels. <br><br>Building a community, rather than pioneering alone, is much better. You have companionship, broader skills, more protection, and a more consolidated point of view. Communities can be far more effective surviving in difficult times than individuals and usually make wiser decisions than the average of individuals. <br><br>@Ward - why fewer computers in the future? Silicon is plentiful, and some scientists are even growing massively parallel computers using DNA. Computing will change, but never disappear. Yes, transportation will change. Diesel/steam boats may become nuclear or coal fired - we still have 400 years of coal at extrapolated consumption rates. So raw materials and skilled labour and machines can still be united.<br><br>@druid - nuclear wastes bad? Coal, tar sands, many other industries make things as toxic, forever, not with a half-life, and many orders of magnitude more of it. The small amount of nuclear waste generated, even if it supplied all our energy needs for the next millennium, would still fit in just one of a thousand mines. It's like condemning an automobile because of the rubber tracks it leaves or the air it disturbs. It's minuscule. <br><br>We yeast eat the sugar and shut down when it's gone. But to continue living the high life, we need more sugar. As long as we're in the barrel, no more sugar. Perhaps if we shared we could eke it out. <br><br>But what we yeast really need are legs or wings to take us to new barrels, new dough. Actually, yeast progeny do fly off in the breeze.<br><br>Sustainability and conserving are good and useful principles. But to survive another 200,000 years, I think we must dare to go beyond the barrel, to new planets, star systems, and beyond. <br><br>If we stay in the barrel, we only survive if something else we can eat wanders in. Otherwise we are, eventually, doomed.<br><br><a href=#c8284919028439889745 title="comment permalink">5/10/11, 10:17 PM</a><br><br>

I have largely given up on trying to convince anyone of PO, AGW, or any other pressing end of the current paradigm issue. I now find myself just in need of communion with those who are aware already. I know nobody in person who is aware. This makes for a very isolated existence. I have been a loner most of my life, but not a loner in a different paradigm. Now I feel the need to relate with people who get it for no other reason than to not feel insane for a short while. The dilemma I have is that I have a family and cannot simply pick up and move to where those people are. It has to be local, and that seems to be not possible. <br><br>One other thing I'd like to address is the request by Joshua for you to make a list. A writer for the automatic earth who also posts to his own blog recently posted this http://peakcomplexity.blogspot.com/2011/05/perturbational-path-of-human.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SimplePlanet+%28Simple+Planet%29<br><br>It's about perturbation and I found it very interesting and relevant to what you were saying.

So, for me, green wizardry holds a lot of promise because even someone who has been unemployed as long as I have, four years for me, and trying to make something of themselves, is given the impetus to remake themselves. <br>Heck, let's say the global peak oil problems never hit and things remain as they are far into the future. Let's even say that global warming isn't real (not that I believe this), but let's just say it for a hypothetical theory's sake. I still have a golden opportunity to learn skills, remake myself, and improve my life, my ecosystem and society at large through the little changes that my life makes through example, environmental impact (or especially, hopefully, lack thereof), and physical interaction with the world around me. There's virtually no downside to learning the skills that green wizardry brings to the table, but everything to lose if I don't have them (or my kid(s) don't have them) when they are needed. That's not a Pascal's Wager I'm willing to take. I'm willing to risk all the imaginal money in the world for a chance at living a life with real value.<br>In response to your assertion that maintaining BAU buys us more time, I deeply disagree. I see that the more that I buy into the status quo and perpetuate it, whether I buy a beater car or a coffee from a 7-11, the less time and attention I am giving to the problem at hand: these things are becoming obsolete. It behooves me to move beyond them, or provide the means to produce them myself. It takes valuable time and attention away from actually gaining skills with which to deal with a potential crisis. Waiting until a crisis hits to gain those skills, means, or products, means that crisis will hit that much harder. No emergency preparedness for regional, state, or federal planning I know of drops its members, untrained, into a crisis is happening if that can be avoided. <br>In terms of uses of time, energy, and tax money, nuclear is a net loser. It takes so long to even build a plant that the likely benefits will not be felt for some years off, whereas solar panels, wind, and geothermal methods of energy production are felt in the now, have the viable technology to make them long-term effective, and immediately usable in existent infrastructure. Why would I trade a shaky bet for a sure thing, especially when that shaky bet will produce a substance that is toxic, whereas the stable one produces no such toxins? You can keep using it, but I say "no" to any more use of it just as much as I say "no" to more of the status quo. <br>The problem with American society, at least, is that our economists, planners, and politicians, cannot see the value in subtraction. So long as we feed into the status quo, normal citizens won't either. I can live with a lot less, and I know it. Even on no income, I know this. So I eat less, I drive less, I do a lot of things a lot less. I live better on no income in America than most developing nation people probably do working their butt off in a factory. There's a lot of 'having less' that would have to happen before I <i>really</i> felt that.<br><br><a href=#c5794798536493231578 title="comment permalink">5/16/11, 1:42 AM</a><br><br>
