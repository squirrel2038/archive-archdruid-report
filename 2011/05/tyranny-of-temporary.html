For just short of a year now, my posts here have focused on exploring one extensive set of options for dealing with the crisis of industrial civilization – the toolkit that came to maturity in the organic gardening and appropriate technology movements of the Seventies, and has been more or less sitting on a shelf since that time, being roundly ignored even by those people who thought they were pursuing every available response to peak oil. The process of hauling those tools down off the shelf and handing them out isn’t quite finished yet, but before we go on to the last round of unpacking, I want to talk about another side of the social process that put them on the shelf in the first place.<br><br>That dimension of our predicament was pointed up by a commenter who responded to part of last week’s post by suggesting, among other things, that people would still be getting their food from supermarkets for long enough that anyone alive today doesn’t need to worry about other options. It’s not an example that gets brought up often; still, the same assumption that current ways of doing things will remain in place indefinitely is an important reason why so many otherwise prudent and intelligent people to ignore the signs that their lifestyle is getting ready to terminate itself with extreme prejudice. A hard look at the logic behind it is certainly in order.<br><br>Supermarkets, as it happens, make a good example. The first supermarket in America, Ralphs Grocery Store, opened for business in 1929 in Los Angeles, California. Until the boomtime that followed the Second World War, supermarkets were found only in a very few urban centers; most Americans bought meat from a nearby butcher shop, had milk delivered by a neighborhood dairy, and parceled out the rest of their food and sundries budget among other local shops, most of them independently owned and nearly all of them getting the bulk of their supplies from local and regional producers. <br><br>It took billions of barrels of cheap petroleum, the massive suburbanization of postwar America, the building of the National Defense Highway System, federal policies that tilted the playing field in favor of big producers and long-haul trucking firms, and decades of highly aggressive and dubiously legal monopolistic practices on the part of national chains, among other things, to steamroller the once diverse landscape of American food production and turn supermarkets selling national brands into the only option that’s still available to most Americans on grocery day. Only if those factors are ignored is it possible to think of supermarkets as the natural and inevitable form of a modern food distribution system, or to assume that it will remain frozen in place as all the factors that made it possible dissolve beneath incoming waves of change.<br><br>The same thing is true, doubled, quadrupled, and in spades, of the “global economy” that was so widely ballyhooed a decade or two ago. Its proponents liked to portray it as the unstoppable wave of a new and prosperous future, but it’s become increasingly clear that it was nothing of the kind. It was only economically feasible in the first place because the final blowoff of the age of cheap oil dropped fuel prices so low that transportation costs basically no longer mattered, and it was only politically feasible because the American middle class was quite willing to see the working class here and abroad sold down the river to force down the price of consumer goods, one of several short term gimmicks meant to prop up a facade of prosperity that was already visibly cracking.<br><br>It was inevitably temporary, too. The handful of Third World nations that figured out how to cash in on the process proceeded to use the influx of dollars to build their own industrial economies behind trade barriers identical to the ones America used a century earlier to do the same thing at Great Britain’s expense. Today they are busily outcompeting the United States for the fossil fuels and resources that made our lifestyles of the recent past possible in the first place. The countries that have prospered most from globalized free trade, in other words, are those that never allowed their own markets to be held hostage to foreign producers, and treated globalization as the temporary blip it was. Meanwhile the American middle class is discovering, to its considerable chagrin, that the same strategies of offshoring and disinvestment that gutted the working class in the 1970s and 1980s are now being turned on them, in an attempt to prop up the lifestyles of a far narrower circle that we may as well call the investor class. While globalism remains firmly in place in the investment world, as a result, the ability of American consumers to make themselves feel rich by profiting off the low cost of sweatshop labor overseas is going away as incomes evaporate and prices creep implacably upwards.<br><br>A third example of the same phenomenon is very much a live issue in the peak oil scene just now, and since the aftermath hasn’t shown up yet, it’s worth tracking. The figures for total liquid fuel production worldwide, which dropped after the housing crash, have risen with the recovery in oil prices and topped their 2008 record this year; a number of peak oil observers – <a href=http://www.energybulletin.net/stories/2011-05-17/looking-rear-view-mirror>here’s one example</a> – have argued on that basis that we may be able to count on a long-term plateau or even a successful transition to alternatives. Still, there’s a fly in the ointment, and it’s the way that total fuel production figures permit the double-counting of fuel.<br><br>Unlike conventional crude oil, after all, much alternative fuel production requires very large energy inputs, and nearly all of this comes from existing fossil fuels. It takes a great deal of diesel fuel to grow corn for ethanol production, for example, and a fair amount of natural gas or electricity (the latter mostly generated by coal or natural gas) to run the plants that turn the corn into ethanol. Oilseed production and refining for biodiesel is subject to similar constraints, while the Canadian tar sands that have received so much attention in recent years yield a usable crude substitute only with the help of prodigious amounts of natural gas. A meaningful measure of liquid fuels production should at least subtract the total amount of liquid fuels that has to be cycled back in to the process of producing more liquid fuels, and might reasonably subtract the value of nonliquid fuel energy consumed in the process of production, for much the same reason that a company’s balance sheet has to subtract expenses from income when it comes time to figure profits.<br><br>Does the current statistic for total fuel production do so? Surely you jest. Thus the energy content of a growing fraction of our available liquid fuel supply is being counted twice. Furthermore, the diversion of increasing amounts of natural gas and food crops into liquid fuel production functions as a way of pushing costs off the books of the fuel industry and onto other economic sectors; fuel prices in the industrial world, in effect, are among other things being subsidized at the expense of poor families in the Third World who have seen the price of grain and oil jump in recent months. The political and economic consequences of this sort of malign offshoring of costs are considerable, and have already begun to circle back around to the industria lworld. Here again, a temporary process – the desperate attempt to pad out dwindling oil reserves with anything and everything that comes to hand, no matter what the energy cost or wider impact – is being mistaken for an enduring support for business as usual.<br><br>This habit of treating temporary phenomena as permanent conditions has many roots, to be sure. America’s bizarre relationship with its own history, compounded of equal parts popular mythology, nostalgic fascination, and a conviction that the past has nothing to teach the present, has a very large role in it. The contemporary religion of progress, with its dogmatic insistence that history is a one-way street and that what we have now is better than anything the past had to offer even when the evidence points the other way, also plays a substantial role. Equally, the deeply troubled national conscience I’ve discussed in past posts had a lot to do with it; if you’ve sold your soul to the devil, in effect, it’s profoundly human to talk yourself into believing that what you got in exchange was worth the price.<br><br>Whatever the sources of the tyranny of the temporary that dominates so much of contemporary thinking, though, it’s a luxury we can’t afford at this point, and we’ll be able to afford it even less as the crisis of industrial civilization unfolds and the available options narrow. An example from a different corner of the deindustrial landscape may help clarify the possibilities that open up once temporary conditions are recognized as such, and those of us who are minded to think about the future start making plans and launching projects on a more sturdy basis.<br><br>The example I have in mind showed up the other day while I was rereading Farrington Daniels’ classic <i>Direct Use of the Sun’s Energy</i>. Published in 1964, it’s still among the best surveys of potential ways to use solar energy, and though the technology is a little dated by modern standards, that’s not necessarily a disadvantage – most of the methods Daniels discusses, unlike most current equivalents, are well within the reach of the sort of basement-workshop mad scientists I’ve suggested we need in droves just now. Notably, too, Daniels covers a range of technologies that seem to have dropped out of the conversation concerning solar energy these days, and one of them is solar thermoelectric power.<br><br>No doubt the retired engineers among my readers know all about the Seebeck effect and can skip the next paragraph. For the rest, thermoelectric power is an interesting bit of physics. Imagine a zigzag of metal in which, so to speak, all the zigs are all of one kind of metal (say, copper), all the zags are another (say, zinc), and the two metals join at the angles. If you apply heat to the angles on one side of the zigzag and cool the angles on the other side, electric current starts flowing through the zigzag, and if you solder wires to the two ends and connect them to something that uses electricity, you’re good to go. On a small scale, it’s a surprisingly robust effect; back in the 1940s and 1950s, Russia used to manufacture <a href=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2007/10/05/kerosene-lamp-powers-radio/ >sturdy little thermoelectric generators</a> that put the heat from a kerosene lamp on one side of the zigzag and the Siberian climate on the other. Those proved quite adequate to power the tube-based radio receivers standard at the time, which weren’t exactly abstemious in their power needs.<br><br>In Daniels’ time, a certain amount of tinkering had been done on solar thermoelectric power – plate 8 of his book shows a modestly sized parabolic reflector heating a thermoelectric rig and charging a car battery – and it turned out to be very useful for satellites, since the heat differential between a lump of hot radioactive metal and the chill of interplanetary space produces a nice steady current suitable for deep space probes. Its possibilities on an industrial scale never amounted to much, though, as it proved to be difficult to scale up to any significant degree, and of course as long as we can count on a steady supply of cheap abundant fossil fuels, solar thermoelectric power is a non-starter.<br><br>Look past the tyranny of the temporary, though, and the possibilities are fascinating. To say that a solar thermoelectric generator is a simple device understates the case considerably. Benjamin Franklin could have knocked one together in a spare afternoon while waiting for the next thunderstorm to blow in; for that matter, it would not have posed a significant challenge to a skilled craftsperson in ancient Egypt. All you need is the ability to work nonferrous metals and the very basic geometry skills needed to shape a parabolic dish reflector. Strictly speaking, the efficiency of heat-to-electricity conversion isn’t that high, but given a more meaningful definition of efficiency – for example, labor and resources input to electricity output – it leaves many other options in the dust, and its sustainability is hard to match; we’re talking, ultimately, about a technology that could conceivably power radio communication and the like for as long as our species endures.<br><br>There are other technologies that are equally obscured by the tyranny of the temporary, and equally worth developing and preserving once a wider view of the situation is taken into account. Some of those may come within reach surprisingly soon; a recent study from India, for example, has shown that solar water heating systems can <a href=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090309105021.htm>pay for themselves in two years</a> via savings on fuel costs and yield a substantial net gain thereafter; as energy prices begin their next major upward movement – something that’s likely to happen in a big way once the market starts to pay attention to the tremendous depletion rates of shale gas – that figure is likely to turn even more sharply in a favorable direction. Get over the habit of assuming that today’s temporary abundance of fossil fuel energy is a permanent condition, and it becomes much easier to spot the opportunities for constructive action that remain open, even this late in the game.<br><br>*********<br>I’m pleased to announce also that <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/ >New Society Publishers</a> has decided to offer my blog readers a freebie to celebrate the publication of my new book <i>The Wealth of Nature: Economics as if Survival Mattered</i>.

So a rising output of all liquids is seen as a sign that the peakers were wrong and will always be wrong. Meanwhile, the consumption side is creeping up remorselessly. No doubt, there will come a time when official statistics keep talking about rising demand, as economies round the world slip into depression, with no realisation that the only demand rising is the input to more and more unconventional sources.<br><br>Good grief, is zero-point energy still doing the rounds?

Based latterly as you say on complicated logistics of oil-fueled transport, and to a degree, refrigeration. <br>We always needed to import food in UK (more than 70% of food as calories in 1939 and not very different now).<br>If push came to shove we could temporarily live more on UK-produced cereals and legumes, supplemented by our own garden fruit and vegetables while orchards and market gardens were restored. A very different logistics scenario. But longer term is something else. We are best described as a set of vary large urban populations in a relatively small agriculture background. Can't see 'super markets' in that scenario myself.'Green markets' yes, granaries and town bakeries where the latter are also set up to cook most people's dinners, perhaps. I remember these things not so long ago in the Balkans and Greece, and even in my time in Edinburgh there were self-help laundries ('steamies')and sparkling clean civic places where I could get a hot bath. More economical of fuel and maintenance costs in densely packed urban environments, I guess. Solar hot water though would keep us going though under the roofs of latterday more widespread suburbia, even in Scotland.<br><br><a href=tyranny-of-temporary.html#c7792741352332720644 title="comment permalink">5/19/11, 3:57 AM</a><br><br>

Solar water heating isn't rocket science; any competent plumber could manufacture a working system given a few good tips, and those are included in the books I've listed. <br><br>Remnant, it's actually much simpler than EROEI, since it doesn't require a complete accounting of, say, the energy needed to manufacture the trucks that haul the raw materials to the factory that makes the drill bits! A simple subtraction of BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) consumed directly in producing liquid fuels and their immediate feedstocks would be enough to give a clear sense of what was actually going on. For ethanol, in other words, you simply need to subtract the diesel fuel usage needed to grow the corn that produces ethanol, and the BOE of the natural gas used in the ethanol plant; for tar sands, the energy used in mining the sands and the BOE of the natural gas burnt in processing, and so on. Even a broad per-barrel average would be enough. <br><br>Tracy, I'd drop 'em an email (using the contact info at the website) and ask. I know they take US dollars, for whatever that's worth. <br><br>Karen, thank you. Those local shops are likely to be lifesavers down the road a bit!<br><br>Andy, one of the interesting things is that an earlier form of mobility helped create such stores -- a lot of the trade that kept them open, I bet, was vacationers coming up to the Poconos in the days when vacations were about going someplace quiet and green, and doing as little as possible for a week or so. It takes a lot less fuel to do that than to fly to Mazatlan, and it's occurred to me that in the aftermath of the current wave of crises, when things settle into the next period of partial stabilization, we may see some of that again for a while. <br><br>August, that's very good to hear! Do you have a schematic anywhere online? It would be great to get more green wizards interested in low-tech radio. <br><br>Adrian, the short form is that I spent more than a decade trying to break into print writing science fiction, and failed. In the meantime, I'd been developing expertise in a couple of fields, and when I decided to try nonfiction<br>I discovered that I had something to say and could say it in a way that publishers liked. I placed my first book with its publisher via unsolicited submission -- I simply sent 'em a query following the guidelines on their website, and had an acceptance and a contract about six weeks later. <br><br>I also discovered that 80% of all would-be writers want to write fiction, while 80% of all books published are nonfiction, and so it's one heck of a lot easier to get published in nonfiction. You don't need an agent, if you focus on the small- to mid-sized publishers (which a beginning writer should); you just need to have a solid grasp of your subject matter and some fluency with the language. <br><br>Bears, exactly! The difference between a little electricity and no electricity is much greater than the difference between a little and a lot. As for solar water heating systems, I'm hoping that some smart young entrepreneur with a bit of an engineering background and an eye for the market will get around to launching a company to produce good cheap solar water heaters; most of what's available are Cadillac systems, and we need VWs. <br><br>Ventriloquist, granted, but he did say "<i>just</i> plant 1000 lbs.," you know. <br><br>Brad, it wasn't news to me, either, but a lot of people like to see footnotes, and that was a good convenient one.<br><br><a href=tyranny-of-temporary.html#c6051057738446152504 title="comment permalink">5/19/11, 8:13 AM</a><br><br>

Thermocouples make great thermometers (I am in the atmospheric sciences). Thermoelectric generators are beautiful in their simplicity. The Seebeck effect is a gift of nature.<br><br>In terms of oil data, there are many, many problems even outside of the double counting that you note. Few, if any of the charts we so often see contain error bars. Without error indicated, the presentations are not scientifically <i>rigorous</i>. Before any claims of a "peak" in the monthly data can be made, error has to be known. This is basic science. Without error indicated, the person presenting the data has no argument. Especially in a case where the new "peak" is only a tiny amount higher than previous upward excursions. The best one can probably say is that world oil extraction rates are still on plateau in the case of maximums that are very close in magnitude (e.g. 74.3 mbd vs. 74.6 mbd to pull numbers out of thin air), and even this claim, without error demonstrated, can not be made with a high degree of confidence.<br><br>My suspicion is that error in the monthly oil production figures is in the range of 2-4% (for 2 SD), if not higher (I think I am being generous here), and maybe a bit less for annual averages. This would mean that a difference of even a million barrels per day is not meaningful. There is also the question of bias in the measurement.<br><br>An actual determination of error for world oil extraction rates would be very difficult to do--maybe impossible as it would require a different and reliable measuring system outside the one(s) being used to make a good calibration check. Nevertheless, even with error determination quite difficult, it does not mean that error does not exist. On the contrary, error is present in all systems of measure. Error is inescapable. And in the complex and convoluted human world of oil extraction, which takes place in many different countries/cultures, it is a safe bet that error in the reported figures for extracted volumes is probably quite high.<br><br><a href=tyranny-of-temporary.html#c3544279549887506876 title="comment permalink">5/19/11, 11:40 AM</a><br><br>

The proliferation of satellite dishes may end up easing the coming transition, because an effective secondary (salvage) use for old satellite dishes is as a solar concentrator. They're already parabolic, they're robust, and will be readily available for quite some time, long after cable and satellite TV is history. They can be quite powerful, too, with the proper reflective covering, as evidenced by this video: <br><br>http://www.youtube.com/user/EricJacqmain<br><br>I suspect that such rigs will be instrumental in cooking, fire-starting, and water purification in the de-industrialized future, and in the short term, they utilize a readily available resource.

The desire to avoid being in a mentally depressed mindset. <br><br>I am thinking that there are two basic ways of doing that.

Once a financial crash spills over into the political sphere, the wealthy are among the very first up against the wall, and their assets are sitting ducks for confiscation by governments in need of ready cash. What happened to the Russian plutocrats at Putin's hands is a mild example.

I have a rather different suggestion to make about the reason why so many people -- well, "don't get it" is a mild way of putting it; it's rather more reminiscent of a seven-year-old scrunching up his eyes, plugging his ears with his fingers, and shouting "La, la, la, I can't hear you!"<br><br><a href=tyranny-of-temporary.html#c757559247800799346 title="comment permalink">5/19/11, 7:06 PM</a><br><br>

Apparently, they have all been booked solid for Memorial Day Weekend since either the first or last week of April (depending on who you ask). This is definitely ahead of normal. And there's a couple of dozen bookable sites per camp so we're talking 100-plus reserved sites for more than a month (and something like 50 of them RV hook-up equipped).<br><br>The private campgrounds are filling because of the overflow and the "camp where you will, at you're own risk, behave" land on the opposite side of the river from the official ones has had folks there since the snow melted in March (including one multi-generational family, by the looks of it.)<br><br>Anyway, if anything interesting develops that seems to pertain to the larger situation, I'll be sure to mention it. ;)<br><br>-As for hooking a thermoelectric generator up to a solar concentrator, well, tres elegance! Seems like that aspiring farm family of the 23rd century could hook up their "therm" (anticipating slang) to the solar concentrator in summer, and the rocket mass heater in winter. Kinda paints a nice picture actually. I'm gonna cross my fingers for reincarnation just to check it out, I'm thinking. ;)<br><br>I ran across this design for a solar concentrator after following the link to Open Source Ecology someone posted a few weeks back and then following a link from there. The makers are in India. In addition to being Open Source, the machine was specifically designed to be a) constructed of relatively easy to fabricate parts, and b) simple and easy to operate. The only tricky bit, apparently, is calculating the mirror adjustments.

I did go back for second look and reread them. I think you are more or less correct but what I am wondering is why are you correct. What underlying motivating factors are at play that sets the stage for this truism? <br><br>I am making the assumption that thru evolution, living things have been predisposed to having there behavior influenced by broad types of motivators. One of these is the strong desire to maintain our feel good neurotransmitter levels at the highest possible level. This seems to be what drives animals to struggle/fight for alpha status. Test the alpha of the herd and there you will find the highest levels of these feel good neurotransmitters. The animal at the low end of the pecking order will tend to have the lowest. <br><br>This is what I called feeding off a power trip. I think it is a basic need that is being met here and some people seem to think we are doomed because this cannot be undone. That this evolutionary inheritance manifest into a drive for the love of power, the justification to play win/lose games, and the ability to be in denial about obvious truths and that this will destroy us. <br><br>I believe that time is short and things seem bleak but disagree that all is lost. Could be I just want to believe that there is some hope but there does seem to be another modifier important in evolution that also can supply this inherent need for healthy levels of feel good neurotransmitters.<br><br>This basic meme comprises of the basic concept of cooperation. It is the drive to feed off the power of love, the knowledge of the wisdom of playing win/win games and the maturity to see obvious truths. <br><br><br>Sofistek,<br><br>Sure, we spend something like a billion dollars a day on advertizing in the US. The message for the most part is that you cannot allow yourself to be happy/content if you do not buy whatever is being sold. I agree with you to the point that I think it should be considered a form of child abuse/neglect for parents to allow there children to watch commercial tv. However, what I am concerned with is why does tv and the rest influence us the way it does.

We're in the post-literate society, whether we like it or not, and movies, television and video games have pushed people away from the written word. I heard one author compare the craft of writing fiction to ballet - it is a preserved art form for an audience of aesthetes rather than a mass entertainment the way it was in the eighteenth century. That's incredibly sad, but it's useless to wring our hands over it - you can't foce people to read. The publishing industry knows that the readers of fiction are principally women over 40 (the Oprah demographic), and most of what gets published seems to be targetted to them. Either that, or "beach thrillers" about the military, or lawyers, or the Vatican, or some such. It makes me wonder how any good fiction is published at all, and in truth, not much is. It seems the few "serious" fiction writers all live in New York City and have some sort of connection to the industry or academia, or have some sort of "shock" value.<br><br>The last literate society was in the 1960-1970s, and you can see the results in the quality of American fiction after that period. Prior to that time, writers like Norman Mailer, Hunter Thompson and John Updike were household names. They even appeared on talk shows. Can anyone imagine an author being in such a position today? Even the most popular authors have only dedicated fringe followers; they are more like indie rock groups than anything else. Non fiction books like <i>The Affluent Society</i> and <i>The Silent Spring</i> were widely debated and had a significant effect in the wider society. In our post-literate society, could any book have such an effect? Today, the majority of people get all their news from TV, which I think also does a good job of explaining some of the changes in the political climate since the 1970s as well. As Allan Dulles once put it, "Americans don't read." A post-literate society is easier to control and manipulate, and propaganda works much more effectively via TV or radio than in print, especially when every outlet is owned by a very small slice of corporate oligarchs. That also has a bearing on your current line of inquiry as to what changed after the 70s. I cannot help but note that much of the 70s consciousness was shaped by the books you so often reference here and have in your collection, while the consciousness of the 80s and beyond was molded by the media. What effect the Internet has on this dynamic is a subject for contemplation.<br><br>There is one bright light - there seems to be a renaissance in comic books (or graphic novels, if you prefer). I think much of the audience for science fiction that one would find in the 70's have migrated to comic books (see Boing Boing for examples). If I may be so presumptuous, perhaps I can recommend teaming with a talented artist to resurrect your stories in comic book form. I'm sure you're familiar with people like Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman, who produce highly-acclaimed and well-written fiction for a graphic format. With your perspective and wide variety of interests, this seems like a type of writing that you would be ideally suited for - I encourage you to give it some consideration.<br><br><a href=tyranny-of-temporary.html#c679085053527967715 title="comment permalink">5/20/11, 11:06 AM</a><br><br>

I remember when they built the Fred Meyer in our neighborhood. Everything you could possibly imagine under one roof. It was the greatest thing since sliced bread. At least twice a week, after dinner, my Dad would say to me and my brother, "Well, boys, why don't we go to Freddies and ... look around." <br><br>But I can't remember buying much there. I think Mom was uncomfortable with the bigness of the grocery section. So, we just kept patronizing the local grocery store. Also, at that time she didn't drive and the local was only a 4 block walk. We got most of our meat from a German butcher. <br><br>A lot of our dairy and produce came from my uncles small farm. His outside job was being one of those guys who delivered milk in bottles, as mentioned above.<br><br>One thing I did buy a lot of were paperback books. We were regular library users, but at that time, libraries kind of looked down their noses at all that pulp fiction. Science Fiction! There were racks and racks of it. And, Mad magazines and books. Which I totally credit for my skeptical and jaundice eye view of the world. <br><br>The Fred Meyer pretty much killed the local business district of Kenton. The drug store. The hardware store. Where I could remember seeing my first TV. Standing in the snow in my father's arms in a crowd of people, watching this thing through the window, at night.

But if the audience member comes to agree in any small part with anything the speaker states or does, then the audience member buy into some small part of everything -- including the existence of the need/enemy -- that the speaker posits.

The last book of his I read was <i>Consilience</i>, which I found embarrassingly shallow -- a classic example of what happens when a specialist tries to generalize without broadening his perspective. Still, to each his own!<br><br>Sofistek, I've suggested before that the "conditioning" is coevolved between the masses and the elites -- the elites learn that they can most easily hold onto their power, after all, by telling the masses what the masses want to hear; and as often as not the elites themselves get caught up in whatever fantasy pleases the masses most (they grow up watching the same media, remember). So it's as much that people like hearing what they already agree with as anything else!<br><br>Richard, remember that I've been messing with this stuff since the late 1970s. I'm aware of what's required for a solar hot water system; that doesn't justify a $25K minimum price. There will always be a place for Cadillac systems, to be sure, but there are a lot of options between a high end system and a black barrel on the roof, you know. For many people, a batch or drainback system might be the best bet; for people in the sun belt, a passive thermosiphon system (which costs about half as much as a closed-loop active system) is all they need...and I suspect that bright young entrepreneurs will be able to build closed-loop systems for a lot less than $25k, for that matter. <br><br>Jason, I don't work anything like Dee's schedule, but I do a couple of things that give me a bunch of extra time most people don't have. The most important is that I don't own a television, DVD player, iPod, or any of the other electronic noisemakers our society likes to use to stave off the dreadful experience of having quiet time to think. Right there, that gives me four to six hours a day more than most people in America have to play with. I also don't use a lot of "labor-saving" technologies, which one and all take more time to assemble, run, clean, put away, etc. than they save. I may do a post on that, but the key is simply that an uncluttered life means an uncluttered schedule, and more time to do what matters.<br><br><a href=tyranny-of-temporary.html#c1199979653060699926 title="comment permalink">5/21/11, 8:51 PM</a><br><br>

I walked into my local supermarket one night last month and there were NO bananas. None. Just a big empty gapping display where they usually are. Being a banana a day guy for years, for ticker health and to keep night leg cramps away, I was a bit panicked. But, more and more I try to think of alternatives to things I eat or use all the time. <br><br>For general health, I like a small hand full of walnuts, 4 tiny piece of really dark chocolate and some candied ginger every evening. Well, the walnuts and chocolate are just about priced out of my budget. I notice other things. Our cheap bread store (really good bread for 4 loaves for $6) used to have the least expensive hot mustard around. I noticed it jumped from $1.59 to $2.19. Long grain brown rice is still .98 a pound out of the bulk bins. Oats are still pretty cheap. I think supermarkets will be around for awhile (barring one of those pesky Black Swans) but I think it will be a scramble to get what you want (THINK YOU NEED.) due to habit or for health reasons. Specials and loss-leaders will become fewer and farther between.<br><br>On country crossroads. Where I'm hoping to live is a ways out of town. But where "my" future road takes off from the "old highway," there is an old cross-roads store, now a convenience store. But the old building is there. Less then 5 miles from my intended digs. An afternoons walk. And, right next door is an old Grange Hall. I don't know if it's still active, but it could be re-activated.

When it happens for real, it probably won't be quite so quick, but the effect will be the same. <br><br>Grrl, many thanks for the link!<br><br>Richard, I see where the misunderstanding got in. I was responding to Diotima, who was quoted $25K as a minimum price for a solar hot water system -- and that's not the first time I've seen that sort of Cadillac system presented as though it was the only game in town. I thought you were responding to that. $10K for an installed system, or $4K for a do it yourself, is pretty reasonable; if not Volkswagen, then perhaps Toyota. Even so, it ought to be possible to go lower than that for a passive thermosiphon system in areas that don't freeze, or batch systems for those who aren't going to use it year round. <br><br>Mark, of course. Engineers aren't that large a fraction of my audience -- though I'm pleased to see how many of 'em there are. <br><br>Lewis, the Grange is still active as an organization; do a little web surfing and you can find the state or national organizations online. Get in touch with them sometime, and ask about the local Grange; if it's still in existence, they'll be delighted to hear from somebody new who's interested. <br><br>Remnant, the interesting thing is that right now, whether or not PV is a net energy gain, it's a good idea. Why? Because it leverages energy costs between the present and the future. The energy that has to go into making and installing a PV panel goes into it now, while energy is relatively cheap and abundant, but a good deal of the energy that comes from the panel is available years from now, when energy will very likely be much scarcer and more expensive. (I discussed this at some length in <i>The Long Descent</i>) Especially on the home and local community scale, PV is a useful option; I'll be discussing that in more detail in an upcoming post.<br><br><a href=tyranny-of-temporary.html#c2385808499249036786 title="comment permalink">5/22/11, 8:46 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not at all sure what to recommend in terms of books on magic and the power of narrative; the problem there is that attitudes and presuppositions vary so widely that what one reader finds useful is guaranteed to make another's eyes cross, to borrow your phrase. Most of my writings on the subject are for practitioners, who have their own jargon and ways of talking about this stuff; the attempt to talk about magic with a more general audience has been made a few times in recent years, but rarely with much success, as three hundred years of hostile rhetoric, media stereotypes, and rampant misunderstandings get in the way. <br><br>Bill, if it's 1:2 with a 20 year lifespan, for a battery, that's still pretty good. <br><br>Apple Jack, many thanks!<br><br>Grrl, we are indeed.
