The tempest in a media teapot over the apocalyptic predictions of California radio evangelist Harold Camping, it seems to me, provides a useful glimpse into the state of the collective imagination here in America. Camping, for those of my readers who somehow managed to miss the flurry of news stories, announced some months ago that the Rapture – the sudden miraculous teleportation of every devout Christian from earth to Heaven, which plays a central role in one account of the end times that’s popular just now in American Protestant circles – was going to happen at 6 pm last Saturday.<br><br>Now it so happens that I spent a large part of the last year or so researching and writing a history of apocalyptic prophecies, so the trajectory traced by Camping and his followers through the modern zeitgeist came as no surprise. What seems worth noting, though, is the amount of attention given to this latest prediction. At any given time, it’s a safe bet that somebody is proclaiming the end of the world within the next year or so, but it’s very rare that such prophecies make the news. Admittedly, your run of the mill doomsday prophet doesn’t splash his prophecy on billboards across the United States, and Camping did that; one even found its way to the quiet Appalachian town where I live, though it attracted little more than laughter. Cumberland’s well stocked with churches, and they seem to be well attended, but the antics of radio evangelists are apparently not much to local taste.<br><br>Still, I suspect we’re going to see a lot more of this sort of thing. When times are good, the guy with the sandwich board reading THE END IS NIGH is easy to ignore. When times are bad, on the other hand, there’s a real temptation to buy into even dubious claims that some outside force is going to rescue you. When things are bad and getting worse, furthermore, and any inquiry into why they’re bad and getting worse points straight to choices that you’ve made and are not yet willing to unmake, the hope that someone or something other than yourself will save you from the consequences of your own actions can be one of the few comfortable ways to deal with the resulting cognitive dissonance.<br><br>Since most of the people in the industrial world right now are in that situation, it’s probably safe to assume that a bumper crop of doomsday prophecies will feature prominently in the near future. The flurry of mutually contradictory claims surrounding the supposed end of the Mayan calendar in 2012 is likely to play a large role here. It’s probably a waste of breath at this point to mention that the Mayan calendar doesn’t actually end in 2012, that Classic Mayan inscriptions contain precisely one offhand reference to that date, that the reference supports precisely none of the gaudy claims currently being circulated about it, and that plenty of other Mayan inscriptions include dates that fall decades, centuries, and millennia past 2012.<br><br>For that matter, I doubt many people care that the entire 2012 business was invented out of whole cloth by New Age mystics Terence McKenna and Jose Arguelles back in the 1980s, when the field of Mayan archeology was still cluttered with a great deal of nonsense the decipherment of Mayan hieroglyphics in the following decade tipped into the dumpster. For whatever reason, the collective conversation of our time has seized on 2012 as a convenient inkblot onto which fantasies of mass enlightenment and/or mass extermination can be projected at will. My guess is that as we get closer to December 21, 2012, the prophetic three-ring circus centering on that date will likely make Harold Camping green with envy.<br><br>Meanwhile, less futile responses to the crisis of industrial civilization are moving slowly inward from the fringes toward the cultural mainstream. Members of the peak oil community who track stories in the mainstream media have noted with some bemusement in recent months that the financial press has suddenly given up its habit of blithely dismissing peak oil as a nonissue. Even the Wall Street Journal, which not that long ago was a bastion of cornucopian insouciance, had a piece in yesterday’s issue talking nervously about the end of easily extracted oil reserves. Where the Wall Street Journal goes, the rest of the media generally follows; I think it’s fair to say that peak oil’s arrival as a cause célèbre in the cultural mainstream is very nearly in sight.<br><br>One of the best arguments for this last suggestion, ironically, is the recent explosion of comments in the peak oil blogosphere insisting that this can’t possibly happen. There’s an odd but understandable shift that happens in movements that start out on the outermost fringes of a culture, as the contemporary peak oil movement did. When they’re still comfortably settled in exile from the mainstream, such movements routinely churn out grand and sweeping proposals for worldwide change; it’s entirely acceptable to propose relocating the entire American population into lifeboat ecovillages, let’s say, or sinking half the world’s gross domestic product into a crash program to build solar power satellites, because nobody really expects to have to deal with the gritty details of putting their plans into effect.<br><br>Those movements that find themselves drawn inward from the fringes, though, routinely go through a sudden loss of nerve once it becomes clear that something might actually be done about whatever issue the movement is attempting to address. It’s not hard to understand why this should be so. Imagine for a moment, dear reader, that your phone rings, and the voice on the other end of the line belongs to your Congressperson. The government, he or she tells you, has belatedly realized that peak oil is the crisis you’ve always said it was; both parties are in a state of panic; a joint Congressional committee has just been formed, at the president’s urging, to figure out how to deal with it. Your Congressperson wants you to come to Washington and tell the committee what immediate, practical response the nation should make to the crisis. Could you face such a call without breaking into a cold sweat?<br><br>Now of course the chance that most of us will ever field such a phone call is pretty remote. If I were Richard Heinberg or Tom Whipple, mind you, I’d make sure I had a list of talking points ready, but as far as I know, no archdruid has ever been asked to speak to a Congressional committee, and I don’t expect to be the first. Still, the point remains the same even when it takes less dramatic form. As peak oil goes mainstream, those of us who have been studying and speaking about it for years are going to have to present meaningful, realistic plans for action. That’s a daunting prospect, and it goes a long way to explain the recent flurry of posts and comments in the peak oil blogosphere insisting that industrial society can’t possibly change its course, because extravagant consumption of energy and other resources is hardwired into our genes or our nervous systems, or enforced by the nature of human hierarchy, or what have you.<br><br>It requires only a fairly brief glance at history to show that this is quite simply nonsense. Plenty of human societies, from Old Kingdom Egypt straight through to Tokugawa-era Japan, have deliberately set aside growth-oriented policies for the sake of survival. Ancient Egypt bought itself three thousand years of cultural continuity; Japan maintained its independence in the face of the rapacious European empires of the time; neither of these societies was exactly free of political and economic elites with an interest in their own enrichment, you’ll notice, but they and other societies with the same burden have found the transition to a steady state worth pursuing. America threw aside its promising initial steps in that direction at the end of the 1970s; thirty years later, most of the easy options have already been foreclosed on, and the combined impact of the end of the age of cheap energy and the implosion of America’s overseas empire is going to make the next few years a very difficult time no matter what decisions get made. Still, there’s a great deal that can still be done even this late in the game.<br><br>Ironically, one of the changes that has most often been dismissed as completely out of reach – the suggestion that Americans can and should use a great deal less energy and resources – is one that shows the strongest signs of catching on. One of the more useful pieces of evidence for this shift is the defensive tone of <a href=http://tinyouroboros.wordpress.com/ >blogs like this one</a> that have taken to denouncing the idea. Nobody wastes time being publicly outraged by notions that their audiences would never think of accepting, you know. It was when the mainstream media began dismissing peak oil in heated language that I realized, and mentioned here, tht peak oil might just manage to go mainstream; the huffy tone of blogs rejecting out of hand the idea that people might actually decide to choose a radically simpler lifestyle, unburdened by most of the technological so-called conveniences that clutter up so many lives just now, is a good indicator that a movement toward drastically lower consumption is stirring in the deep places of our collective imagination.<br><br>When it comes right down to it, after all, today’s high-consumption, hyper-connected lifestyle is a fad, right up there with hula hoops and swallowing live goldfish. Thirty years ago, the thought that people would voluntarily put themselves at the beck and call of anybody who wanted to contact them, at all hours of the day and night, would have inspired a mix of horror and hilarity. Thirty years from now, those who now can’t imagine being offline for twenty-four hours at a stretch will look back on their current habits with much the same embarrassed amusement that you get from today’s fifty-something Republicans when they remember their long-haired, pot-smoking youth. It’s precisely in the waning phase of a fad that’s passed its pull date that its participants tend to get shrill and defensive toward those who have begun to drift away – or, perhaps, who never got involved at all.<br><br>All this implies, of course, that the strategy I’ve called L.E.S.S. -- Less Energy, Stuff, and Stimulation – could very well become fashionable in exactly the same way. If it catches on at all, it will inevitably pick up faddish dimensions; there will be those who devote their lives to various forms of conspicuous non-consumption, those who treat some particular austerity as a litmus test while neglecting broader principles, and so on. Those dubious habits existed in the Seventies appropriate-tech movement, to be sure, and for that matter the same sort of thing can be found in every social movement. Furthermore, to the extent that L.E.S.S. becomes a fad, it will have a limited shelf life – fads always do – and there will come a point when it stops being fashionable and some other trend takes its place. That, too, has happened with every other social movement you care to name.<br><br>I’m not at all sure that a fashion for austerity would be entirely a bad thing, though. Right now, unless my sense of the flow of events is completely off kilter, we’re moving into the second and probably much more serious phase of the crisis kicked off in 2008 by the implosion of the real estate bubble, which has been metastasizing ever since under the band-aid applied to it by the industrial nations’ print-and-pretend policies. In Europe, extremist parties are making hay off the political mainstream’s insistence that the only possible option is to load trillions of Euros of bad debt onto the backs of taxpayers and ordinary working people; in America, an even more vacuous political consensus is avoiding every significant issue we face; rising powers elsewhere are claiming a growing share of the world’s energy and resource base, largely at America’s expense; festering social strains and rising economic pressures here and abroad are moving toward the breaking point.<br><br>Exactly how the resulting mess will play out is a complicated question. Still, it seems like a pretty safe bet that a fashion for austerity, however faddish its surface forms might turn out to be, might be a very good thing to adopt and even to encourage. Even if it only lasts for a decade or two, that may be enough to help a lot of people weather the immediate impact of the crisis. Whatever fashions emerge in its wake, though, it’s safe to say that today’s fad for frantic consumption won’t be among them, for the simple reason that the resources that make that fad possible are running short. Whatever fads and fashions spring up in the aftermath of the approaching crisis will have to make do with a much smaller resource base.<br><br>A fashion for austerity may be temporary, in other words, but the austerity will endure. Responding to that latter will demand significant changes to each of our lives. It’s crucial here not to make the mistake (or, more precisely, one of the mistakes) that doomed the climate change movement – that is, the habit of treating the inevitable changes ahead of us as something that can be fobbed off on the rest of humanity through unequal treaties, or conjured into being by collective action that somehow never gets around to affecting one’s own lifestyle. We are all, every one of us, going to have to get by with less energy and less of the products of energy; we are all going to have to do things for ourselves that we’ve come to assume, often unthinkingly, that machines powered by cheap abundant energy will always do for us; we are all going to have to accept a great deal more in the way of discomfort and inconvenience than we do today.<br><br>Changes on the collective level, whether driven by fashion or enacted by the Congressional committee I imagined earlier in this post, aren’t going to prevent any of that. If they happen – and I think they can, although that possibility by no means guarantees that they will – their function will be to make it easier to adjust, to provide more options, more useful information, more incentives, more encouragement. It will still be up to each of us, as individuals, to make the hard changes that will have to be made – and to do so, if at all possible, before there’s no other choice, when there’s still the time and the opportunity to work through the learning curves of unfamiliar skills and be prepared to manage the crisis with some measure of grace. As Harold Camping’s followers learned the hard way this weekend, no outside force is going to rapture us away from the consequences of three centuries of mistaken faith in exponential growth, or the act of collective blindness thirty years ago that threw away our best chance at getting through this mess in good order. The world we’ve got is the world we’re going to have to live with, and it’s going to take a lot of work to make it livable.

I was speaking with some good friends of the older generation who belong to this church and I suggested that perhaps the term 'end times' could be looked at in the sense of not necessarily the end of the world, but the end of an age. <br><br>You have written very clearly about the decline of the Industrial Age and it is certainly an end time for life as we know it, not necessarily for all times, and it will not end suddenly, but changes will occur over time. I think that it is inevitable, as you point out, that this type of apocryphal thinking will only increase over the next several years and I concur that 2012 will bring a lot of focus to the subject.<br><br>What I have discovered in my numerous conversations with many of my conservative, religious friends is the need to re-frame the idea that we are not responsible for the mess we are in and God is going to whisk us away to the novel idea that perhaps God is not going to reach down and remove us from our messed up playpen, but that we will have to deal with the consequences of excesses. It seems our view of Source is as permissive as the modern day parent.<br><br>The point that I wish to add is that we live in a world where re-framing the discussion for a positive outcome is a much-needed skill. We tend to polarize our conversations on subjects of politics and religion and the solutions that could merge through diverse mindsets gets lost in arguments that divide instead of create new ideas. It seems that if we can focus on our shared future and the future of our children and grandchildren, we might make some headway. But we have to be able to work within our own sphere of influence where we understand the mindset and particular prejudices of folks. I believe it goes back to the idea of working within your own community, as you have pointed out so well. Being a bridge builder is an important post-industrial skill and one that folks who have awakened to the fact of industrial decline and to the need to do something might well adopt. A bridge builder has a foot on both ends of the subject and can speak to either side. A role that you have taken up with some bravery. Bravo! Who knows--a Druid in Congress would be a welcome change :)<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c6042197002535380379 title="comment permalink">5/25/11, 7:50 PM</a><br><br>

Exhausted by non-stop tweeting &amp; texting, many of us are probably ready for a little 'time-out'. More than a few of us might voluntarily step away from our frantic and consumptive lifestyles for rest and recuperation, with the assumption that we can always rejoin the contest at some later date. Some of us will be surprised to find that the game is eventually called on account of darkness and never resumes. Some of us will not be surprised.<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c8179765868155225903 title="comment permalink">5/25/11, 7:56 PM</a><br><br>

An earlier poster commented on focusing on your sphere of influence, and it is true that you will make the biggest impact with people who know and respect you. I feel I have had some influence on several friends, and at least gotten them thinking about why they go out and buy all this stuff...just by commenting on how happy I am without X, Y, or Z (television, cell phone, whatever). Or how gratifying it is to do things for myself, by hand, be it grinding coffee or digging post holes. <br><br>Granted, this is not the sort of austerity I think you are envisioning, but my point is that people are more likely to try something out, or challenge their thinking, if they have credible role models to look to. People who are already headed that direction need to speak up, stand up, and let themselves be seen...<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c6136847180037534958 title="comment permalink">5/25/11, 9:32 PM</a><br><br>

I never figured I'd be invited to join that club in the first place.<br><br>Do you have any thoughts about the vows of poverty of the various monastic orders? Christian and Buddhist monks and nuns have been doing as you suggested for centuries, but it takes a pretty strong religious belief to voluntarily give up the materialism that seems to be a basic part of the nature of human nature. I mean, if greed and envy and all the other sins were not so prominently a part of human behavior, it would not have been necessary for God to say, "Thou shall not..."<br><br>A small percentage of the population may voluntarily do with less in order to simplify their lives. A larger percentage will be forced to make do with less by economic reality. I suspect that most people will not go quietly, even if economic reality is biting them on the butt, so while some of us may be prepared for a more bucolic life style, most of us will be tempted to take up arms in order to protect what we've got (or to take what someone else has).<br><br>Recently, I got to thinking about why so many animal species (including Homer Sap) are territorial. The lower animals do not consciously think about things like resource depletion, but instinctively they want more for themselves because "more" usually means "enough" in an ecosystem where there is never "enough." <br><br>We humans CAN think about things like resource depletion, but we still have the same basic behaviors and instincts as the lower animals from whom we evolved, so there will always be competition for a sufficiently large piece of a shrinking pie.

American flag I found in the attic for a curtain. <br><br>Astonishingly - for the one-and-only time in my life - I was actually considered "cool".<br><br>But austerity was quickly overwhelmed by the dominant consumer culture; and then it was considered uncool to do anything but consume, consume, consume.<br><br>Today, however, austerity could easily return as a fashionable trend: after all, that's what the most knowledgable people have been doing for years - only now, they can prove that they were right all along.<br><br>For example, tens of millions of families who bought into "The Consumer Culture" have either lost their homes, or are upside-down on their mortgages, or - as housing values continue to fall - are about to go upside-down. <br><br>What was the best housing move that a family could have made five years ago? <br><br>To sell their over-sized, over-priced, over-mortgaged McMansion in that auto-dependent suburb, and then to downscale massively: to either rent - or even better - to buy an old, modest, beat-up house in a old, modest, beat-up, walkable neighborhood that was even cheaper to live in than renting.<br><br>Brutal economic reality is now beginning to turn the fringe-y movement of voluntary simplicity into a mass movement of involuntary poverty. <br><br>If downscaling could be made fashionable again - "Austerity: it's what all the coolest people are doing" - then it might help to cushion the psychological blow that many are now feeling, and many more are about to feel; and the social approval confered by trendiness might make it easier for people to move more aggressively in a "Less is More" direction.<br><br>So to move the trend along, let's not be afraid to say it: if you are now moving downscale, then you are hereby officially labeled "cool".<br><br>And if you are moving upscale, then you are hereby officially labeled "uncool".<br><br>Until the next trend comes along, of course. <br><br>But austerity should serve us well until then.<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c8416009322975326191 title="comment permalink">5/25/11, 10:22 PM</a><br><br>

But there is a slight problem. When austerity becomes govt policy, it's affects aren't evenly distributed.

It can be a positive, getting those most affected to take responsibility for learning new skills, becoming more cooperative amongst ourselves, and just generally experimenting with new ways to approach our socio-economic situation. Don't define yourself by what you can consume but what you can forge from the seemingly meagre resources at hand.

I trust they took these into account in their predictions? They're not the brightest sparks in the world committing to specifics - we even heard about those nutters over here.<br><br>After reading today's post I'm getting a mental image of you before a congressional committee addressing responses to peak oil. You'd probably scare them, by telling them what they need to hear and not what they want to hear!<br><br>I was also thinking about last weeks post and comments (apologies if this is a bit off topic). <br><br>Whenever people mention photovoltaic systems there always seems to be someone who mentions the EROEI (energy returned on energy invested) argument. It goes something like this: The energy produced by a photovoltaic panel will never exceed the energy used to produce, distribute and install that panel.<br><br>The argument annoys me because, people make that comment with a level of authority that is not backed up by any evidence. No one really knows how much energy is used to produce a solar panel and the argument fails to take into account the installation location of that panel.<br><br>What really annoys me though, is that the smugness in those comments displays a complete disconnect from reality.<br><br>The reason I state that there is a disconnect is because Oil is at the core of all of our energy systems renewable or otherwise. Oil is not produced, it is extracted. A real risk to energy production systems is that all mining and most transport systems require Oil. A good example is coal used to produce electricity. Sure the process of burning coal eventually produces electricity, but it's Oil that is used in the extraction and transport of that coal and no other energy source. <br><br>People simply forget this and I find their disconnect astounding.<br><br>Current renewable energy systems are not a perfect solution, because there simply is none. All systems are subject to atrophy and as such all will break down and require replacing eventually.<br><br>People forget that there is no perfect solution which is why using less is the correct approach to buffer yourself against any future shocks.<br><br>We also need to increase the resilience of our energy systems and to do this we require a diversity of energy production and distribution methods. The real unspoken risk is having a centralised generation and distribution network as eventually unless maintained, it will fall over. To maintain this requires Oil and the easy days are fast becoming over. <br><br>Please people, think about the above before bring up such rubbish arguments again.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c3995130732436715869 title="comment permalink">5/26/11, 12:56 AM</a><br><br>

The psychologist in me can't help but see the correlations with current notions about Addiction (and I am not the first to draw this connection). We are not just addicted to fossil fuels, or cheap energy, but also to our illusions: what you have called the myths of apocalypse and progress. The addict embraces denial in all its forms because the hard work of recovery is terrifying, and the skills required to succeed seem impossible to acquire. So, the addict convinces himself that the problem is not nearly as bad as it is, or that others are just as bad off in some other way, and just in denial, or that some unseen force (for which whose existence there is no evidence whatsoever) will swoop in and transform (or destroy) everything in the near future anyway, so recovery is futile, or that the universe is sending certain signs and clues that the addictive behavior is good or necessary or inevitable, and so forth. Nearly all addicts need to hit "Rock Bottom" before they admit that they have a problem and need help; interestingly, loss of a job tends to be a better motivator than loss of family, probably because it taps into our survival instincts in a way that divorce (or similar experiences) cannot. So, Western Industrial Civilization appears currently to be in the mode of an addict who has been embezzling from his employer, and is scrambling all day long to mess with the accounting books, taking increasingly dangerous financial risks, and working overtime to cover up past indiscretions and current crimes, to keep its "job" (something akin to controlling global affairs in order to maintain unsustainable lifestyles for its elite) for one more day. If the purpose of this blog is to conduct some sort of "intervention" BEFORE Rock Bottom happens (after the last intervention 35 years ago failed to stick), then I (assuming that our societal momentum is actually far MORE stubborn than a single addict's) struggle to be optimistic that the worst can be prevented. Trying, of course, is still the only option available.<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c3282202034172030548 title="comment permalink">5/26/11, 5:43 AM</a><br><br>

Good point about the “phone call from Congress” – it’s much harder to make realistic plans than to expound about how “people need to change”… I’d love to get a chance to formulate some national steps to take, but having no expertise and few initials after my name, it’s not likely. ;-) But one thing that those past cultures you cite didn’t have to fight is a powerful advertising force bent on getting people to buy! Yes, that force was “turned to the good” during WWI and II, to get folks to conserve and plant food – but what kind of disaster will it take to get them all on board now?? Aside from nationalizing all ad agencies, I can’t imagine what could be used to fight the insidious 24/7 brainwash that goes on in the US. I’m encouraged when I see websites of young people who are into recycling and reusing as fashion, and are learning the old handicrafts and are enthused about them – that’s super! But L.E.S.S. will not become a fad unless companies can make a profit on it.<br><br>One way to approach the idea of using less is to frame it as getting a new abundance – because trading all the consumer junk, hi-tech toys that spy on you and keep you onleash, and piles of ad-laden media that plug into your adrenal gland will get you an abundance of time, a slower, more serene pace, and the natural world and all its wonders. But again, the corporate world is a huge obstacle – in order to live life more simply, you must slow down – and if you work in the modern world, you can’t! Stepping off the consumer bandwagon is a lot like trying to step from fast treadmills to slower ones to slower ones… having a foot on each tread is the dangerous moment! Which is why, I think, many people just “jump” – go simple as fast as they can.

I found a vacuum packer at a flea market which included a <a href=http://www.csnstores.com/Foodsaver-T03-0006-01-FSV1028.html rel=nofollow>gizmo</a> for pulling a vacuum on canning jars. I've tried it on other jars I've saved, since I need my canning jars for, well, canning. This thing works on many jars I've saved: 46 oz. pickle jars, mayonaise jars, etc. I did a test on several types of jars, including canning jars (reusing last year's lids!) and all are holding a vacuum nicely after a couple of months. I plan to buy rice, beans, etc. in bulk and vacuum pack them in used jars. Adding O2 absorbers should add years to the storage life of dry goods, and I plan to use this system to pack dried herbs and fruits in the future.<br><br>The vacuum packer is a popular brand which retails for around $150, but the simple device for jars is available online through your nearby big box store (the one touted as the world's fourth largest economy or somesuch). About ten bucks! Hand powered vacuum pumps are available or could be easily constructed. Look for this system at yard sales, etc, as folks buy them, then discover the plastic bags are too expensive. I tried mine using a cheap 200 watt inverter: worked fine. <br><br>I packed over 2 pounds (about a kilo) of rice in a standard (46 oz) pickle jar.

I’m not saying that problems aren’t pressing – the present policy of our political leaders to rip the heart out of our economic infrastructure, or the wars threatening and happening, can hardly be seen in terms of diffidence. The fact that the Himalayas are not actually going to be melted down within 30 years, s I think was once claimed, or that scientists are more self-interested in getting big grants for themselves than they are in scientific accuracy, doesn’t take away the fact that climate change is happening – it’s been a constant with us, and sometimes in the history of the universe it can have a significant and occasionally dramatic effect on our way of living. The tsunami of a couple of yrs ago was a personal apocalypse for a lot of people.<br><br>But it’s the end of days scenario which leaves me very suspicious. It’s always been there. The Book of Revelation became the big justification for all sorts of weird activity. In the German Peasants war of 1525 (written about by Marx's associate Engels) the leader of the Zwickau miners, Thomas Muntzer, was inspired by Revelation, wth its tales of the end of days and the appearance of a Saviour on clouds to overthrow the ten horned beast of the princes. He told the miners that none would be killed by the bullets of the armies of the ruling princes because God had told him they would be immune. The miners marched very confidently to battle; the slaughter was apparently gut-wrenching (for most people, not for the German princes). We can give an anachronistic sardonic laugh at this foolishness, but it must have made sense to them – they walked into battle singing hymns. The sheer daftness of reactions by young people when faced with the power of the State in our own times has led to lethal consequences, and the blurring of a cool head by rhetoric and sloganising is quite alarming. <br><br>So, I am chary of end of days approaches. It’s usually more complex. The wolf will come, I’m sure – when I die, all this will end; the sun will eventually die and humanity will end; humanity may well hurry on the job, as may I under certain circumstances. But I am distrustful of scientists and other religious leaders when they talk of the imminent end of days. Things are worrying enough without having the sort of panic mobilisation which ends in a big bloodbath and/or disillusionment; worse you might win and get an Uncle Joe at the helm, caring about small children and little dogs, and no hesitation in murdering for the greater good..<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c447100486033484660 title="comment permalink">5/26/11, 8:09 AM</a><br><br>

Again, though, I'm not suggesting that any current government is going to change course -- just that they may do some things to make matters easier for those of us who do make that choice as individuals. <br><br>Sandy, my take is different. The narcotizing of the public is self-inflicted -- people are eager for the buzz in question. Of course the pushers profit mightily, as pushers always do, but I suggest that they're at least as much responding to a demand as creating one. <br><br>Julie, nicely put. You're quite correct, of course, that all of this can be framed in ways that can make sense within many different worldviews, including that of today's conservative Christians -- and it will be interesting to see, as cultural tides shift, whether the current stirrings in the direction of green evangelical Christianity catch on, as indeed they might. <br><br>Robo, that's my hope!<br><br>JJ, actually, that <i>is</i> the austerity I'm envisioning, or at least an important part of it, and you're quite right -- personal example will do more than any amount of verbiage. <br><br>Susan, one of the many values of vows of poverty is precisely that they provide a way out of struggles over scarce resources. That's why monasticism is the standard way for religions to deal with dark ages; a monastery following a strict vow of poverty isn't a worthwhile target for pillagers, so generally gets left alone. (It's the monasteries that lose sight of this that end up attracting Vikings.) We'll see that in the approaching Dark Ages, though it'll probably be a while. <br><br>Don, exactly!

For some decades evolutionary biologists assumed that competition was the primary 'shaping' force in evolution - a view which has been questioned and even upended by recent research which points to cooperation as fulfilling that primary role, with competition as the adjunct.<br><br>Our culture has exalted competition (a leftover of social Darwinism?), but I think if we think about it, nearly all of us quickly realize that cooperation plays a much larger role in our lives than competition.<br><br>So I think we do not have to redefine the human animal and its nature, but only the culture, in order to effectuate change.

Proponents of nuclear power who don’t simply dodge the issue of radioactive waste altogether treat this as a minor issue. It’s not a minor issue; it’s the most critical of half a dozen disastrous flaws in the shopworn 1950s-era fantasy of limitless nuclear power still being retailed by a minority among us. A nuclear fission reactor, any nuclear fission reactor, produces wastes so lethal they have to be isolated from the rest of existence for a quarter of a million years – that’s fifty times as long as all of recorded history, in case you were wondering. In theory, containing high-level nuclear waste is possible; in theory, it’s equally possible to drill for oil in deep waters without blowing your drilling platform and eleven men to kingdom come and flooding the Gulf of Mexico with tens of millions of gallons of crude oil.<br><br>In another piece, in regard to nuclear, JMG said:<br><br>Switching from one complex, centralized, environmentally destructive energy system based on nonrenewable and rapidly depleting resources, to another energy system that can be described in exactly the same terms, is not a useful step – especially when it would be perfectly possible to dispense with both by simply using less energy.<br><br>And way back when, EF Schumacher said:<br><br>No degree of prosperity could justify the accumulation of large amounts of highly toxic substances which nobody knows how to make safe and which remain an incalculable danger to the whole of creation for historical or even geological ages. To do such a thing is a transgression against life itself, a transgression infinitely more serious than any crime perpetrated by man. The idea that a civilization could sustain itself on such a transgression is an ethical, spiritual, and metaphysical monstrosity. It means conducting the economical affairs of man as if people did not matter at all. <br><br>The bottom line: the assertion that nuclear energy - any nuclear energy, including thorium/molten salt - can somehow be considered 'green' is simply, flat out inaccurate. <br><br>Furthermore, in an age of energy price volatility and attendant economic contraction, featuring debt-based fiat money and looming fiscal and currency crises, proposing a huge build-out for an energy-source replacement program which would span decades and require massive amounts of REAL capital (human, financial, etc) nowhere currently in evidence borders on fantasy. As David Horowicz has put it: the very ground under our feet (our systems of industrial production and the complex infrastructure they depend upon) is crumbling - so the notion that we could choose to erect an entirely new energy system atop this crumbling edifice while this is happening is to fundamentally misunderstand our current position.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c3753908493036129490 title="comment permalink">5/26/11, 9:43 AM</a><br><br>

Most people (including pro-solar environmentalists) I talk to have the idea that if the grid goes down, those with solar PV installs (in America, at least 95%+ of these are grid-tied and not off-grid capable) will be able to generate their own power, and it comes as quite a shock to them to learn otherwise.<br><br>The point is that solar PV, as currently deployed, cannot be considered 'decentralized' due to 100% dependency on the connection to the grid. Further, it seems likely that in the event of grid failure (total or partial), production of suitable batteries could fail as well, and conversions to off grid of existing grid-tied systems would then be negligible. <br><br>The point was made in the comment section of last week's post that solar PV makes sense because the manufacturing is happening in an era of cheap fossil energy, while those panels would be generating electricity for years into an era of expensive and/or unavailable fossil energy - but that may only be true for systems which are actually capable of storing what they generate.<br><br>Seems to me it might be useful to resurrect Ni-Fe battery fabrication techniques as a workshop project, in order to make use of all those 'junk' PV panels whose owners didn't have the foresight to plan for off-grid when they could have.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c4736908177246749952 title="comment permalink">5/26/11, 11:15 AM</a><br><br>

I used that opportunity to remind the ladies that they have skills and experience that the younger generation is in dire need of, even if they do not know it yet. <br><br>Growing, cooking from scratch, canning, sewing, knitting, spinning, even darning socks instead of throwing them out because of a small hole, all are skills that people struggling today need to know. I reminded them that they used to be part of the household economy until people decided to outsource those jobs to companies that produce TV dinners and disposable imports. <br><br>I admonished them to share those skills with children and grandchildren, and also to be willing to share those with the wives of a younger generation of Lodge members. <br><br>I believe it's a model that can be replicated in many places, not just fraternal lodges. We should learn form those who suffered though the austerity of the first few decades of last century if we want to get through the first few decades in this century.<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c8987009909220564104 title="comment permalink">5/26/11, 12:35 PM</a><br><br>

What I saw in Texas is that many are still living the same easy-energy life of fifteen years ago, mildly irritated by what it costs now to top off the tank of the Hummer and how much the yard service is charging to keep the grass tidy, while on the back side of life an increasing number of people, the more marginal, less rapacious or simply unlucky, are being cut off, turned into invisible unpersons and dropped out of a shrinking system.

The short form is that it makes every kind of sense for individuals to use PV panels for their own needs, and no sense at all to claim that a modern industrial society can run on PV. As for the US debt, America is bankrupt; the proceedings just haven't started yet. <br><br>tOm, it would be helpful if you'd address the topic of the post sometime, rather than simply repeating the same dubious claims. <br><br>Yourmindfire, thank you!

Of course simplicity is normally used these days as a sales pitch; the question is how long that'll be the case in an age of economic contraction. <br><br>Fleecenik, okay, you're on for the Senate Agriculture Committee!<br><br>Bob, that's a useful metaphor. I don't expect anything major to happen on a collective level before a good solid "rock bottom" experience comes our way, but on an individual, family, and community level, there's a lot more possibility -- and in the meantime, as the addict tries to bargain his way out of the real work of recovery, some of the steps he's likely to take may help on the individual level. <br><br>Archivist, thank you for the quote! Many human societies, in fact, make generosity rather than greed the key to social status. It's particularly common, interestingly enough, in the dark ages that follow the collapse of civilizations -- the highest praise given to any of the epic heroes of the European dark ages, for example, is that they were generous. <br><br>Remnant, we'll see.

See 'National Geographic Electronic Armageddon'. The super-dependence on the grid is their nemesis. I don’t have a date for the next severe CME but the EMP will happen with only a few days warning. <br><br>We won’t know the solar maximum except in the rear view mirror so the winter celebration in 2012 is as good a WAG as any. A massive CME may not occur for several more solar cycles but the important knowledge is “it will happen again“ so like the Green Wizard program, why not be somewhat prepared? <br><br>Here in the high desert north of Reno we, like others within a mile or so, have a well however we also have a solar/hand pump on the well. Water is the key to life here. It will not be easy but we can pressurize our house and maintain the outdoor garden and the high tunnel garden. We can also support some neighbors. So far so good. <br><br>The solar powered golf cart is in use and powers tools and welder. With careful use, it should last several more years. Solar ovens, rocket stove, hot water heater, LED lights, etc. will all provide some comfort. My wife and I are old but our place will provide some sort of leg up into a future of reduced consumption for our children and grandchildren. Of course right now the former are trying to make ends meet to keep up their consumption and the latter know that texting is more important than a garden.

But then, I think an entirely new non-space based platform as a "solution" to peak oil lies in the same realm. <br><br>A major problem with such suggestions, IMO, is the unspoken premise: that we need a "solution" which will enable BAU to continue. But that's how we got into this mess in the first place. <br><br>Another unexamined premise evident is that one can "solve" a complex predicament by focusing on a single component of it. Complex systems simply do not yield to those sorts of simplistic, analytical "solutions" - see these for details:<br><br>http://karlnorth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/systems-thinking-for-problem-solvers-4c.pdf<br><br>http://www.energybulletin.net/stories/2010-10-12/complexity-it’s-not-simple<br><br>Peak oil is one piece of a very big, very complex puzzle - we have peak fresh water, peak metals, peak top soil, etc. How would a bunch of satellites address these issues, let alone the other related issues like overpopulation and carrying capacity overshoot?? My guess would be that, if anything, they would be exacerbated. The Law of Unintended Consequences would have a field day.<br><br>Even if this idea were to be seriously entertained, it presupposes the availability of financial and energetic capital (in a time of economic and energetic contraction, note) AND the stability of existing industrial systems (which depend on those declining forms of capital merely to avoid entropic decay), not to mention political will that seems nowhere in evidence. You would need ALL of these, yet I see NONE of them available now or in the foreseeable future. <br><br>I mean, I'm all for slashing military expenditures around the globe to free up lotsa capital, but I don't fool myself that this is likely to happen. If anything, expect such expenditures to rise as the reality of peak oil takes tighter hold.<br><br>So in a sense, the technology would likely be the easy part. The socio-economic and political context in which the technology would need to be developed and deployed is what makes it an impossibility.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c759714444484744339 title="comment permalink">5/26/11, 2:38 PM</a><br><br>

I'm actually doing the proofs for <i>Apocalypse Not</i> right now; you'll have fodder for those conversations in plenty in September. <br><br>Shiva, I'll be suggesting some ideas in an upcoming post, but I'm far from an expert on the subject. I'll be interested to see the discussions. <br><br>Richard, one of the advantages I have here in Cumberland is that I can vote for Roscoe Bartlett -- and do. <br><br>Bill, well put. <br><br>Rev. David, er, you might want to take a moment, catch your breath, and read what I actually said, rather than jumping to conclusions and, if I may be frank, flying off the handle. I was speaking, as you'll see when you reread the post, of the sort of handwaving that used to go on in the peak oil blogosphere five and ten years ago -- and yes, there have been proposals for a space-based response to peak oil that would cost around the order of magnitude I indicated. <br><br>Mind you, everything I've read suggests that the estimates you've linked to are hopelessly unrealistic; there are critical issues of net energy and available resources here on earth (which have to be in place before any such project can happen) that are not being addressed, and as usual with vaporware technologies of this kind, nobody's talking about the risks, the downsides, and the statistically unavoidable disasters. <br><br>It's also not exactly irrelevant that the US is flat-out bankrupt and doesn't even have the funds to repair its current stock of bridges, so the sort of multitrillion-dollar project necessary to get even a modest level of electricity to earth from space is out of our reach; nor are the decision makers listening to the rest of your list of things "we have to" do. Thus I think it's considerably more useful to change our own lives, so that we can get by with the very modest energy resources available to us in the absence of fossil fuels, and work on preserving the best of the legacy of the last three centuries through the mess that's immediately ahead of us. <br><br>Harry, er, "Windows Club"? I think a spare letter got in there. That aside, how did they take it? <br><br>Lewis, oh, granted, but those of us who've been called idiots for years for suggesting that common sense applies to energy deserve at least a momentary smile. <br><br>Shark, "we" and "us" mean the people who are reading this blog, of course. <br><br>Matt and Jess, our property taxes are well under $1000 a year, so it's not a real challenge. Mind you, it's important to have some kind of income you can bring with you, or provide for yourself, because there are basically no jobs to be had -- the one really sharp limiting factor for most people.<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c5931625226913696445 title="comment permalink">5/26/11, 4:18 PM</a><br><br>

Cathy, you were very fortunate to have been able to buy a home outright! One of my goals has always been to avoid the "death pledge" as well. I feel like though there is a lot of interest in "simplicity" and "thrifting" and "homesteading/homemaking" right now, few people are doing some of the more radical steps--such as perhaps moving to a place where you can buy something very cheap--so I feel like this is very weird territory. It's also hard to experiment with two kids in tow. And the "bring your own job" thing also isn't very promising for us -- though my husband would just love to have his own kayak building business ... <br><br>Speaking of which, there was actually someone on this blog who commented a few weeks back that they had used their GI Bill to go to a year-long boatbuilding school, and my husband is considering that!

(I live in a low-income neighborhood in deindustrialized Rockford, IL, a city that has the fourth highest per-capita rate of violent assault in America. So I'm quite familiar with this threat - every single day. And night. Particularly at night.)<br><br>To minimize the damage, it would be helpful if we could keep people - particularly young people - thinking in a positive, productive manner while all of their dreams are being permanently dashed to pieces around them. <br><br>Not easy to do.<br><br>So I suggested that we start calling austerity "cool", so that people could keep at least some shred of their self-respect intact - that the fact that they were living an austere lifestyle was actually good for them personally, and helpful to society in general; and that they didn't have to be ashamed of it; and that it was really cool to do it - that they were ahead of the curve. <br><br>But if something is going to seem cool to them, then the people saying that it's cool must first be respected as being credible - and one of the things that credibility is based on is being right - not always being right (nobody is), but being substantially right about the most critical issues.<br><br>My point is that there are people who have been espousing a body of thought who have earned their credibility the hard way: not by always being right about everything, but by being substantially right about the most critical issues of our time; while a different group of people espousing a very different body of thought are in the process of losing their credibility - not by always being wrong, but by being substantially wrong about these same critical issues. <br><br>The Wars in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan: SUBSTANTIALLY WRONG<br><br>The bubbles (dot-com/housing/student loans) blown by the Federal Reserve: SUBSTANTIALLY WRONG<br><br>Devouring our fossil fuel patrimony with no adequate planning for when it's gone: SUBSTANTIALLY WRONG<br><br>As our system falls apart, people will be searching desperately for direction. The people at the top have failed them, so they are going to be looking elsewhere - and some of the characters they'll be looking towards are bad actors.<br><br>But if credible peers standing beside them are saying that it's cool to downscale, then maybe some of their energy can be channeled into purposes that are more beneficial to themselves, their families, and the larger society.<br><br>So I think that we both agree that the compassionate, charitable response of "a helping hand" is appropriate. <br><br>But my opinion is that part of giving people "a helping hand" is to help them to understand that there is a body of political/economic/environmental thought that is nothing more than muddled, unscientific, self-serving blather; that it is SUBSTANTIALLY WRONG; and that if they keep listening to those con artists, then their already-difficult life is just going to get even worse.<br><br>Examining ideas - and if necessary, discrediting useless ones - is a necessary part of establishing what is "cool" (i.e., what is personally and socially useful) as the 21st Century staggers on.<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c863708666224978721 title="comment permalink">5/26/11, 9:39 PM</a><br><br>

When I bought an abandoned farm house in Spain there was on the roof a lone Franco-era solar panel that had been producing a steady 40 watts for around 35 years. A family of geckos had made a nice home for themselves in the circuit box on the back but otherwise it was as good as new.<br><br>Of course, I added my own panels and bought an inverter and batteries and waved goodbye to the grid. On sunny days, which to be honest was most days, I used the power directly - using the washing machine and power tools then. The panels produced way too much energy for me to be able to store in the batteries anyway.<br><br>I considered getting a small wind turbine to keep the batteries topped up on cloudy days and at night time. We didn't have toasters, irons or aircon or any other energy gobblers, but this was hardly a major disadvantage. <br><br>When it was cloudy for a few days at a time the washing basket filled up and TV stayed off - but there was always enough for lights, my laptop and the stereo.<br><br>The bottom line is that we learned to adapt our energy needs to when energy was available, actually with very little inconvenience.<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c4374304018446163575 title="comment permalink">5/26/11, 11:36 PM</a><br><br>

Modern Americans do not grasp the fact that they see the world through the lens of myth, so deeply embedded is this tendency. It's like telling fish they must take a good hard look at the water in which they swim when the very concept of water-as-distinct-from-them is alien. Until people are able to distinguish the myth as something separate, and not just the way things are, they will not just be unwilling, but unable to perform such an analysis. And our current culture - social, economic, political - works actively to reinforce those myths because they benefit the status quo and threats to the status quo cannot be tolerated.<br><br>As I think JMG has suggested, at some point, the current set of myths will break down, diverge so spectacularly from reality that they will become untenable, and in the cognitive dissonance that ensues, new ways of seeing the world will be forged (and new status quo's will emerge, perhaps rapidly one after the other for some time), but there's no guarantee that those new ways will be any more in alignment with reality than the old ones were, though one can always hope. <br><br>I think it's likely that by the time that happens, we will be well past 'bingo point' and most folks will be blindly responding, tossed about by rapidly shifting political, economic and ecological/climatic conditions. <br><br>Those who have prepared in the ways we discuss here - especially in terms of establishing food, water and energy security while integrated into local communities - may be better able to weather such storms, though of course there are no guarantees.<br><br>However this turns out, we're in for a wild ride. :)<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c5423355666888187260 title="comment permalink">5/27/11, 6:39 AM</a><br><br>

Think the East India Company. In it's day, it was pretty powerful and yet it eventually came to an end."<br><br>Actually, I think this example helps to prove my point. The East India Company was arguably the first modern corporation, the progenitor which gave birth to modern corporatocracy. It's what set the stage. Thus far from being a counter-example to my argument, it is in fact the originating example which bolsters it.<br><br>For all the furor about corporations and their power today, I think it is instructive to understand that, prior to the East India Company and its ilk, corporations operated in a very different way. They were chartered often to perform some public good - build a hospital or bridge, that sort of thing. Once the project ended, the corporation did too, having fulfilled its charter.<br><br>It was Elizabeth 1 - i.e. the State - who recognized in corporations, in the East India Company, the possibilities for larceny...err, corporate profits - which could be funneled into the governmental treasury (royalty was always on the search for new sources of wealth, primarily so it could fight its wars). Once that principle had been firmly established and demonstrated, corporatism began to take root (helped along in particular by the Glorious Revolution in England in 1689, which set the stage for 'mercantilism' as State policy, a policy which the Founding Fathers of America sought to emulate), culminating in the kinds of shenanigans we see in our world today. <br><br>This is why I see it as irrational when many 'enlightened' modern folk perceive government as the protector from corporate evils. 'Twas the government which fostered those evils from the start and labored to perpetuate and enhance them thereafter.<br><br>Furthermore, modern giant corporations could not exist absent friend-government, which erects barriers to entry which keep smaller and nimbler entities from competing. This has become blatantly obvious in recent years in the agricultural sector. Just ask Joel Salatin. <br><br>For all that corporations crow about economies of scale, it is government regulation and legislation which protect them from the diseconomies of scale with which they necessarily go hand in hand. This is the mechanism which enables the 'mega' in mega-corporation.<br><br>You want to reduce the power of corporations to do ecological, economic and social harm? Then reduce the power of the State to protect them. It's like starving a tumor of its blood flow. Other approaches have proven ineffective, to say the least, and yet that is the one approach most people will not tolerate (due to the myth of government-as-protector).

His Timewave Zero theory was one of the main ingredients that came together in the 1980s to form the original version of the contemporary 2012 myth, so I don't think it's at all unfair to point out that he and Jose Arguelles, rather than ancient Mayan priests, were the original inventors of the idea that some apocalyptic event will happen in 2012. <br><br>Mind you, the Timewave Zero theory has done a very poor job of predicting levels of novelty between 1945 and the present; it's not exactly news that bright ideas that surface during drug trips, which is basically what the theory was, don't normally work well when applied to the unhallucinated world.

I never heard him say anything in particular would *happen* on that day (in terms of outward events), only that the date itself has some importance. <br><br>As you doubtlessly know from your 'review', his theory was that waves of history (novelty, in his terminology) were traveling backward in time from this 2012 date. His main concern was with the date, not what would come after it. It was clear, though, that he thought there was going to be an 'after.'His was not an 'end times' prediction so much as a prediction of a moment of human transition. Transition to what? He was not all that specific. I don't think he knew. <br><br>In fact, thanks to the magic of the internet, I see that he's on record (at approx 9:45) saying nothing will happen.

So far, the bursts of novelty predicted by the Timewave Zero theory haven't happened on schedule. We'll see about 2012 -- but one lesson a lot of us learned in the wake of the Sixties is that the ideas that seem so wonderfully meaningful when you're stoned out of your gourd don't generally hold up afterwards. <br><br>Todd, the only place McKenna has in my book is his role -- which was unintentional, to be sure -- in launching the current 2012 mythology. I'm aware that he made a variety of other predictions, but so have plenty of other people, and from my perspective, he's not that influential or interesting a figure. <br><br>As for my use of 1945 as a benchmark, well, anybody can go back over a few millennia of history that's already happened and cherrypick events to fit a system. The final cycle of McKenna's theory, from 1945 to 2012, contains predictions of novelty bursts that hadn't yet happened when the theory was presented. They didn't happen on schedule, a point that does raise some questions about the validity of the theory, you know. <br><br>The value of a theory of this kind is shown by its ability to make accurate predictions of events that haven't happened yet.

The reason for this is that they are an added layer of complexity in an already complex system. As such, they use far more energy (the one's I've seen anyway) than either a grid tied or stand alone inverter.<br><br>The higher levels of complexity also equate to a more expensive system and people usually install the solar PV system that they can afford and not the one that they can use.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c6721993465900436382 title="comment permalink">5/28/11, 2:14 AM</a><br><br>

Whether or not the Mayan's predicted anything for that date doesn't seem so relevant to me, so much as its potential as a self-fulfilling prophecy. As a cultural meme it has gained enough traction to warrant a Hollywood blockbuster. There will be a lot of people wondering what is going to happen that day. As you no doubt are aware, intention is a powerful force. If enough people around the world are focussed on love for one another and the planet, perhaps some critical mass can be achieved that will bring about a transformation of consciousness. So the veils of separation are lifted and it becomes clear that what we do to others, and to the world, we do to ourself. If there could be the same kind of coherence between humans as there is between the cells in our bodies, knowing we are all cells in Gaia's body, perhaps the challenge of adjusting to life without the fossil fuel fix will be easier. <br><br>As I understand it, jumps in biological organisation, for example from single to multi-cellular organisms, happened at crisis points. We are certainly in the midst of a crisis, the sixth mass extinction. Perhaps a significant proportion of humanity focusing their positive intention at one time can facilitate such a jump.<br><br>Or then again, perhaps not. Perhaps I'm just an old hippy with an addled brain! Either way, I will continue to disentangle my life from its dependence on the fossil-fuelled 'system'. On 21/12/2012 I will also prepare my ritual space and add my light to the collective awakening. <br><br>And maybe nothing will happen, in which case I will continue learning to live resiliently within my community.

When I was a boy in the '40s, I could see the Milky Way every clear night from my back yard (no more than an hour by car from Manhattan).

The flight took 12 hours, and we always flew at night. Once we got out of sight of Manhattan or San Francisco, most of the country was dark at night, with just a few lights in a few isolated houses, even when we flew over a city. The highways, no more than two lanes in each direction, were mostly empty at night, with at most one or two pairs of headlights visible anywhere on it.<br><br>Now, when you fly coast-to-coast, almost the entire country is lit up all night long, and the highways are wide rivers of flowing light. <br><br>On the ground, all but the brightest stars are invisible, as is the Milky Way.<br><br>Like you, we live without TV, without cell phones, with minimal exposure to electronic media, hardly ever setting foot in any big-box store. <br><br>But even that degree of isolation from our toxic culture is not enough fully to ease my soul.

The question that seems important to me is this: given that it's at least plausible that LESS and Green Wizardry could make for a better future, do we (a) get to work or (b) sit on our hands? <br><br>Rylan, that's certainly one step in the right direction. Still, it's worth remembering that no technology -- including the technology of exchange we call "money" -- is actually value free, and if the values built into a technology are destructive, it can be a worthwhile project to minimize your use of that technology, and find other ways (say, doing and making things yourself) to get what you need. <br><br>Lance, when I do a post about the problems with the internet, I can always count on some nethead wading in with a set of cliches that don't address the issues and thoroughly misstate the facts. I was wondering where this week's example was; thank you for not disappointing me. All that shale oil, to begin with? Look into the numbers; you'll find that it's almost entirely a matter of PR releases meant to sell stock (and boost GOP candidates). If you believe those, I'm sure I can find some old shares in Pets.com to sell you. <br><br>I lived in Seattle for many years and well remember the bubble of false security that federally subsidized electricity rates from BPA cast around energy issues there. Perhaps you can tell me how much of the transport system that gets you your food and other necessary supplies is powered by hydroelectricity, or how much of the electronic hardware that backs up your lifestyle is built, shipped, maintained and repaired with hydroelectricity, etc. <br><br>Finally -- aside from the ignorant bigotry in your last comment -- do you really think that nobody in all of history created a sophisticated urban civilization before the internet came around? If so, I'd encourage you to send back your college degree and ask for a full refund, as they clearly failed to teach you the things any educated person ought to know. Sheesh. <br><br>Grrl, most interesting. I haven't read Robinson in a long time -- I may have to find time for it. The one thing about the Amish, though, that tends to be neglected in current thinking is the powerful role that religion plays in making their lifestyle work.

It's the same phenomenon at work in Cathy's elderly neighbors; it's far easier for people to convince themselves that there's infinite energy out there somewhere than it is to grapple with the extent that all our fantasies about the future have been founded on a lie.<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c2084284753347247876 title="comment permalink">6/1/11, 12:24 PM</a><br><br>

I hope this in not in our future; seriously, it's not what you're advocating."<br><br>Our current civilization is no less slave powered that many in the past. Remember that slavery, historically, often was not what we think of when we recall the chattel slavery practiced in the American South.<br><br>For example, slaves in ancient Greece and Rome were, at various times, allowed to own property and even buy themselves out of slavery.<br><br>It looked, at least in some cases, a lot like indentured servitude - the slave would have a plot of land, and he would owe his owner a certain percentage, keeping the rest for himself and his family. There were even some laws protecting the slaves from arbitrary or vicious damages by their owners.<br><br>In other words, it was something like taxation operates today in America. And if you do not think taxation (including property taxes) is a form of slavery aka enforced servitude, then go back and take another look, after first taking off the cultural blinders. ;-)<br><br>The point I'm making is that 'slavery', like Autism, is a spectrum thing. Ask any new college grad who can't get a job in his or her degree field - but is carrying $50k or $100k or more in student loan debt, which even bankruptcy cannot vanquish. Debt slavery may be a far cry from chattel slavery, but it sure ain't the same as freedom. The really sad thing, IMO, is that so many of us volunteer for slavery in this country.<br><br>BTW, please do not get the idea that I am saying 'aw, slavery ain't so bad' - what I'm saying is that there are a lot more parallels between the modern American and the ancient slave than one would at first thought realize.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=fashion-for-austerity.html#c8702299169902241223 title="comment permalink">6/1/11, 12:37 PM</a><br><br>
