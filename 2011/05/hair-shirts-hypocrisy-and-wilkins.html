I’d like to go into a little more detail about the core theme of the last several posts, the proposal that using less – less energy from nonrenewable sources, that is, and less of everything made using energy from nonrenewable sources – needs to be central to any serious response to the predicament of our time. It’s both a more complicated and a more practical project than it may seem at first glance, and some of the comments I’ve fielded over the last week have pointed up some of the challenges involved in getting to work on it.<br><br>One of the problems with the project is that it sounds too much like the kind of fashionable faux-activism that was skewered a few years back in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ff-s14cAr4">a wickedly funny song</a> by the British singing group Fascinating Aida. I’m sure we’ve all met people who make quite a show of boycotting anything environmentally destructive on loudly proclaimed moral grounds, just so long as they can replace it without any actual change in their lifestyle or decrease in their comfort level. That’s not the sort of approach I have in mind, of course, but I’m also not suggesting that my readers put on a sustainably harvested hair shirt and retire to a Bat Conservation International-certified bat-safe cave in the mountains to offer up their sufferings in the hope of assuaging the wrath of Gaia.<br><br>America’s Puritan heritage being what it is, it’s not surprising that the idea of using less has at times been applied in both these unproductive ways, and rather more often been mistaken for them. Still, the point I tried to make in last week’s post is that under many circumstances, making yourself much less dependent on the resources provided by a failing system is far and away the most practical thing you can do. Those circumstances, I’d like to suggest, are very much in evidence right now.<br><br>Here’s an example. I field emails and comments a couple of times a week from people who are seriously troubled about the future. They see themselves as trapped in a system that’s already started to go to bits around them, and lacking the money and other resources that would be needed to make the preparations they’d have to make to weather the approaching crash. A good many of them are living in apartments with nowhere to garden and few options for energy retrofits, and they quite reasonably worry about what’s going to happen when access to energy becomes intermittent, food prices spike, and what now counts as a comfortable urban lifestyle begins the long downhill skid into the shantytown existence facing something like half of the American people within a few decades. They want to know what options I can suggest for them. <br><br>The core strategy for people in this position? Use much less, so that expenditures drop well below income, freeing up money to be used to get out of the current, unsustainable situation. Most Americans can cut their expenses by anything up to a third in short order by simply giving up the energy- and money-wasting habits of the consumer economy. That may involve moving to a smaller apartment with lower rent, fewer amenities, and a bus line close enough that you can get to work by public transit; it may involve not buying the new computer every two years, the plasma screen TV, and any number of other expensive toys many people think they have to have; it may involve learning to cook, eat, and enjoy rice and beans for dinner instead of picking up meals at the deli; it will likely involve plenty of other steps of the same kind. The payoff is that you get the extra money you need to learn the skills that will make sense in a deindustrial economy, and can save up a down payment for a fixer-upper house with good solar exposure, a backyard well suited for an organic garden, and a basement where you can get to work learning to brew good beer. For people in that position, using less now has nothing to do with hair shirts or hypocrisy; rather, it’s the entrance ticket to a better future.<br><br>More generally, it amazes me how many people seem to think they can downshift in a blink from a modern American lifestyle, with all its comforts and privileges, to the close-to-subsistence lifestyle most of us will be leading in the middle future. It’s reminiscent of those old-fashioned survivalists whose idea of being ready to feed themselves once the rubble stops bouncing is a nitrogen-packed tin of garden seeds, a random assortment of tools, and a manual on how to garden, which they read halfway through on a slow afternoon ten years ago. Those who adopted that approach have been very lucky that their doomsteads have never had to function as anything more serious than deer camps, because if they’d tried to feed themselves that way, death by starvation would have been the inevitable result. Growing food in an intensive organic garden is a skilled craft requiring several years of hard and careful work to master, and if you hope to rely on it for even a small part of your food, you need to get through the steep part of the learning curve as soon as possible.<br><br>The same thing is true of most of the other skills that are needed to live comfortably in hard times. If you don’t know how to do them, you’re going to make a lot of mistakes, and suffer a great deal more than you have to. The sooner you start that learning curve, the easier the curve will be, because you’ll still have the resources you need to pick up the pieces when your early efforts fall flat. If you wait until you have to live with less, you won’t have that cushion, and the potential downsides can be drastic. It’s entirely possible, for example, to live through summers south of the Mason-Dixon line without air conditioning; people did it for a very long time before air conditioners were first marketed in the boom times following the Second World War, after all. Still, it’s not simply a matter of gritting your teeth and sweating. It requires certain skills and, in most recently built houses, certain modifications to your home, and if the thermometer hits three digits when you haven’t yet installed the attic fan or figured out how to open a couple of windows at the right angle to catch the breeze and keep heat from building up, you could be risking heatstroke. Starting the learning curve now provides a margin of safety you’ll be glad to have.<br><br>Furthermore, most current talk about the impact of peak oil assumes that the end of the industrial age is a nice, cleanly marked point located conveniently off somewhere in the future, and that’s a potentially dangerous oversimplification just now. Those Americans who have run out of their 99 weeks of unemployment checks and become members of the new class of economic nonpersons, after all, have just been pushed out the exit doors of industrial society. For them, the end of the industrial age has arrived. That same eventuality could show up on any of our doorsteps with 99 weeks of warning, and quite possibly less. If that happens to you, will you be better prepared to meet it if you’ve been spending everything you earn and then some, in standard American middle class style, or if you’ve cut your expenses, cleared your debts, mastered the fine art of getting by with less, and learned the skills and bought the tools you’ll need for a backup profession or two? You tell me.<br><br>All this amounts to variations on a common theme, which is that the rules governing life in a stagnant or contracting economy are precisely the opposite of the rules governing life in an expanding one. In the growth economy of the recent past, it usually made sense to spend money freely and gamble that you could always get more, because the sheer fact of continued economic growth meant that more often than not, you were right. With the end of economic growth, the Micawber Principle – "annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six, result happiness; annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery" – once again comes into force. Most Americans haven’t yet grasped this or any other implication of the end of economic growth. For all of that, most Americans wouldn’t recognize Wilkins Micawber if W.C Fields rose from his crypt to reprise his sole (and brilliant) serious dramatic role on screen. Still, ignorance is not bliss; the consequences of the former of these blind spots, at least, are likely to include a horse doctor’s dose of economic misery.<br><br>So much for the practicality of using less now. The complexity deserves a few words as well, though partly that’s a matter of finding the right way to talk about the subject. Choosing a term can have remarkable consequences. The wife of a good friend of mine pointed out the other day, for example, that part of what tripped up climate change activism was the choice of the phrase "global warming" as a label for the problem the activists hoped to address. To most people, "global" sounds positive and "warming" even more so; the resulting phrase simply didn’t have the threat value to inspire a mass movement. She suggested the alternative moniker of "radiation entrapment" – a good description of what excess CO2 does in the atmosphere, you’ll notice, but also a a pair of words that have unsettling negative connotations of their own. If a politician insisted that radiation entrapment wasn’t a danger to anybody, can you imagine anyone within earshot thinking anything other than, "He’s lying"? I certainly can’t.<br><br>I don’t have anything so elegant to offer. What comes to mind at this point, rather, is an acronym – LESS – that stands for "Less Energy, Stuff, and Stimulation." In outline, that’s the strategy I’d like to propose for those who want to weave the green wizardry we’ve been discussing in these posts into a broader way of life; just as it’s a lot easier to heat a house with solar power when you’ve already got to work with insulation and weatherstripping, so that the house doesn’t leak heat from every wall and corner, it’s a lot easier to live a life in an age of decline when you’ve made sure your life isn’t leaking energy and other resources from every available orifice. That’s what the LESS strategy is meant to do; think of it as a way of weatherstripping your life. <br><br>The last part of the acronym, "stimulation," may seem surprising to my readers, but it’s a crucial part of the recipe. For the last thirty years and more, Americans have been pushing their nervous systems into continual overload with various kinds of stimulation, and I’ve come to think that this is another symptom of the deeply troubled national conscience discussed in recent Archdruid Report posts. A mind that’s constantly flooded with noise from television, video games, or what have you, is a mind that never has the time or space to think its own thoughts, and in a nation that’s trying not to notice that it’s sold its own grandchildren down the river, that’s probably the point of the exercise. Be that as it may, recovering the ability to think one’s own thoughts, to clear one’s mind of media-driven chatter, manufactured imagery, and all the other thoughtstopping clutter we use to numb ourselves to the increasingly unwelcome realities of life in a failing civilization, is an indispensable tool for surviving the challenges ahead, and one that I’ll be talking about at more length in a future post.<br><br>"Stuff" may seem a little less puzzling, but getting out from under the tyranny of excess ownership may be every bit as challenging for many Americans as shaking off the habit of stimulating the mind into a state not far removed from coma. As far as I know, ours is the only civilization in history in which storing personal possessions that won’t fit even in today’s gargantuan McMansions has become the basis for a significant economic sector. It’s a critical issue to confront, though, because our passion for what I’ve elsewhere termed prosthetic technologies – machines, that is, that are designed to do things that human beings are perfectly able to do for themselves – has built up habits of dependence that could easily, and literally, prove to be fatal if they’re not broken before demand destruction puts the machines and the power needed to run them out of reach. In an expanding civilization, your success is marked by what you have; in a declining one, your chances of survival may well be measured by what you can readily do without. That’s another point I’ll be expanding on in a later post.<br><br>"Energy," finally, may be the most obvious factor in the equation, but some of its aspects are far from obvious to most Americans today. A very large fraction of the energy that props up the American lifestyle, for example, gets used to manufacture, package, ship, retail, power, maintain, and dispose of the heap of consumer goods that people in this country commonly mistake for having a life. Another very large fraction, as just suggested, goes into technologies meant to keep human bodies and minds from doing things they’re perfectly able to do, and as often as not become unhealthy if they’re not allowed to do. For every watt-hour that can be saved by direct methods of the sort I’ve discussed in this blog already, there’s more than one – very often, many more than one – that can be saved by indirect methods such as buying used goods from local sources rather than new items from chain stores with intercontinental supply chains. That, too, is a point I’ll be developing in a post later on.<br><br>Still, the basic concept should be easy enough to grasp. The habit of living beyond our means is as much an individual problem as a collective one, and it’s a significant factor keeping many people stuck in a set of lifestyles that are as unsatisfactory as they are unsustainable. Freeing up the money, the time, and the resources to make the shift to a more sustainable way of life needs to be high on the agenda of anyone who’s seriously planning to deal with the cascading crises of the decades ahead of us, and using LESS may be the single most important and accessible tool for doing so.<br><br>********************<br><br>On a different note, I’m delighted to announce that my third and latest peak oil book, <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/W/The-Wealth-of-Nature>The Wealth of Nature: Economics as though Survival Mattered</a>, is hot off the press and available for purchase. Those of my readers who remember the series of posts a couple of years back on ecological economics (and why you can get better economic advice these days from a randomly chosen fortune cookie than from a professional economist) will find the themes from those posts explored at greater depth; those of my readers who are new to the journey we’re making together on this blog may find it useful, or at least interesting, to check out some of the basic concepts underlying the Green Wizardry project.

Then I thought for a bit. We took this approach from the day we met, when I was still in the Coast Guard and making a good wage, even with a quarter of it siphoned off to child support payments.<br><br>As a consequence, when I retired from the Service we owned 8 acres of land outright, and had $50K in the bank. We now have a well, septic, grid power (Hydro from Bonneville Power, 50 years ago the Pac NW traded salmon for cheap electricity), a small unfinished cabin, homebuilt yurt for a bedroom, a 3200 Sq ft. garden and orchard, a dozen fowl and a hive of honeybees.<br><br>My wife is a NW Ethnobotanist and is taking the Washington State Master Gardener's course.

The last two years I've been crabbing under sail in our little daysailor.<br><br>So, the archdruid's advice is sound. We did it pretty much the way he describes. We saved our money instead of spending it when we had a good income. We invested in land, tools and skills. We're not where we want to be yet, but we're pretty far down the road.<br><br>Glenn,<br>Marrowstone Island<br><br><a href=#c6164645140051947993 title="comment permalink">5/11/11, 8:17 PM</a><br><br>

Always examine thrift store finds for quality -- loose seams, tears, broken zippers, loose handles, etc --- and buy the good ones, not the clunkers, where possible --- or buy things you know you can repair, if their flaws are small and their basic condition good.<br><br>If you need to buy something at a regular store, go for quality, not for price. If you can spare $50 for a well-made pair of shoes, it'll last you much longer than five $10 pairs of cheapies that fall apart in two months.<br><br>If you can manage the time and have the necessary facilities (such as a working oven, or counter space for a crockpot) in your kitchen, learn to cook and bake from scratch, using dry beans, grains, flour, and common fruits and vegetables (apples, potatoes, onions, celery, carrots) as your base. Cookbooks from before about 1950 are full of recipes for good, cheap food made from mostly pretty cheap ingredients, not from spendy processed foods.<br><br>Eat foods that are in season; they're cheaper than imported out of season crops. Grapes in July or August are cheaper than grapes in February because in July or August they were probably grown in the US but in February they were shipped up from South America.<br><br>Learn to sew, knit, crochet, and repair clothing, including socks. If you can make, alter, and repair garments, you're one step ahead of most people. You can also keep your clothes going longer when you have those skills.<br><br>Learn to find other ways to be comfortable than spending energy. Turn off the computer and listen to the radio or cd player; it uses less electricity. In winter, layer your clothing and top it with a sweater; that helps you keep the heat down (a necessary survival skill if you want or need to prune your heat bills). Pile more blankets on the bed. Wear socks at night. In summer, open the windows from the top down to let heat out, and use small electric fans to direct cool breezes across your body. If it's really hot, dump some ice cubes into a pan or bowl and put that in front of the fan to make the breeze cooler. Make lemonade (from sugar and bottled lemon juice) and iced tea (from tea bags or bulk tea) instead of drinking soda pop; it's the same cost or cheaper, and better for you.<br><br>If you don't have a savings account, open one. Most banks will let you open one for an initial deposit of $100. Put money in it every single month if you can. Start small; put away $5 or $10 per week. Save your change, roll it, and deposit it in there for another boost. Every little bit helps, and baby steps add up. If you have something in savings, that gives you a bit of a cushion against emergencies or other problems.<br><br>Stuff like this is how our grandparents (and in my case, my parents) weathered the depression and spent the 1950s moving from poverty to affluence. Our time for affluence is past, but we can still get by better with less.<br><br><a href=#c7493068337927831923 title="comment permalink">5/11/11, 8:17 PM</a><br><br>

I imagine that those with the initiative and perseverance to make the sorts of necessary changes in their lives advocated by our host, and that enjoy for themselves and perhaps their children prospects for hanging around for more than a few more decades, may take exception to that attitude as the crises begin to manifest. They might even be so moved as to help some of the former cash in their chips a little early. The value of wisdom earned of experience is in the sharing. Teaching is a skill the more advanced in years might find useful to practice.<br><br><a href=#c4562033977979182858 title="comment permalink">5/11/11, 8:47 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avtb a_8c6021" id=c4280066773062715682></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/02128676983998762432 rel=nofollow>Luciddreams</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I was just thinking about an attic fan today. My wife essentially lost her business and income approximately a year ago. Luckily we see quality in frugality. It's been a slow process learning to grow our own food and live with less. We've had three years to learn these things and it's taken that long for everything to sink in and become real. I feel like the real work is just now starting for us, and yet when I reflect on the way we live now it's leaps and bounds beyond what the status quo is. Summer heat is a great, and current example. <br><br>I have been fighting turning on the AC tooth and nail lately. I live in the south. It was 80 degrees in my house when I woke up this morning (hence me thinking about the attic fan). We had to close the windows last night because of the thunderstorms. The wife and I sat down this morning and I posed the question: "At what inside the house temperature are we going to turn the AC on at?" We figured around 85. I know when that happens it's going to cost roughly 100 dollars a month if not more. I have a very old house. <br><br>Today it reached 82 in the house. All the windows were open and all of the fans were running and we had nothing but underwear and flip flops on. I don't have any discretionary income at this point. We ate a salad that was 80% leaf lettuce and spinach from the garden for dinner tonight with dressing that was made with local eggs (my chickens are only three weeks old). I think I'm going to talk to the wife about that attic fan in the morning. Maybe if we agree that we can handle 90 degrees in the house then we won't need the AC anymore. The AC is broken in both of our vehicles and we don't have the money to fix that either. It's starting to look like a blessing. <br><br>One thing about acclimatizing,the more you live in relatively harsh conditions, the less harsh those conditions become. One may even find oneself south of the mason dixin line living in a house that is 90 degrees and still happy. <br><br>About the stimulants. I have recently given up alcohol for an undetermined amount of time (currently two weeks sober). I've drank alcohol for the last 12 years. I also make cider and mead. Next I'm going to let the coffee go. I enjoy tea more anyways and that's just one more small way to save money. Coffee ain't cheap anymore, at least not good coffee. I'd rather drink compost tea than the manufactured, pre-ground, crap they pass as coffee at the grocery store anyways. <br><br>JMG, your contributions to where I'm at can't be overstated. I sincerely thank you.<br><br><a href=#c4280066773062715682 title="comment permalink">5/11/11, 8:59 PM</a><br><br>

I also think that two other aspects are equally, if not more, important: getting fit and strengthening your connection to other people in your community. <br><br>Being over 50, I found a book called _Younger Next Year_ a good motivator for getting fit. Of course, there are two parts: eating nutritionally (many people in the US really don't know how to do this) and getting proper exercise. The older you are, the longer it takes to recover lost ground. So it's never too early to get started. <br><br>Strengthening your connections to people who live nearby takes a long time. You have to spend quantity time to get quality time. It's important to get to know people who live nearby because we won't travel nearly as much in the future as we do now. When I commuted an hour each way to my all-consuming job, I knew very few people in the town in which I actually lived. That would be an unhelpful and possibly dangerous strategy for the coming hard times.<br><br>Getting fit and getting involved don't need to take much money. They do take time. Both of them take some energy, but you also get energy back from both. The future will require more physical labor and will have fewer medical and food options, so we'll all need to be as fit and healthy as possible. In chaotic times, it will be helpful to have a tribe of people who care about us close by for mutual aid and defense.<br><br>As far as cutting expenses, I read _Your Money or Your Life: Transforming Your Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial Independence_ a long time ago.

Another, I believe, is that he believes we can somehow design a new global society and economy.<br><br><a href=#c1935863409623227230 title="comment permalink">5/11/11, 11:52 PM</a><br><br>

As in “my Lexus hybrid 4wd is more sustainable than your Toyota Land Crusher.”<br>Lately, it seems to me that being sustainable is a little like being pregnant. You are or you aren’t.<br>For some years my wife and I have been trying to push our lives along that imaginary continuum, growing food, setting up community gardens, getting involved in the local permaculture group, proselytising to those friends who still will talk to us, etc. The consensus is that we’ve actually gotten pretty good at it, to the point that our home is being featured in Geoff Lawton’s new Urban Permaculture DVD (see <a href=http://www.ecofilms.com.au/2011/04/25/converting-a-swimming-pool-to-grow-fish/ rel=nofollow>here</a> and <a href=http://www.ecofilms.com.au/2011/04/26/pond-aquaponics/ rel=nofollow>here</a> for a couple of stories on our place, if you are interested).<br>But we’ve concluded that it still doesn’t cut it. While a good chunk of our veggies and protein can be produced in our own back yard, the city in which we live is fundamentally flawed. Our neighbours think we are freaks (even though, or perhaps because, over 200 people came to see our setup on National Permaculture Day a couple of weeks ago) and we think they’re freaks, which won’t help relations as they start to lose their highly paid banking jobs.<br>So we’re selling up. Moving three hours out of the city (by road, more like six hours by train, assuming passengers are ever carried on the track again) and trying to find out what really being sustainable means.<br>Now for the interesting bit – neither my wife nor I are twenty-something any more. Even thirty-something feels a bloody long time ago. For sure, going farming is way too much work for us to do on our own. Joel Salatin suggested that the best way forward for us is to go find someone who <b>is</b> twenty-something and team up. At the permaculture convergence last year we met loads of enthusiastic young’uns so we feel optimistic that this will actually work.<br>So to all you twenty-something apartment dwellers stuck out there, go out there and find an analogue of us - just as we are going out there to find an analogue of you - and together we can beat this.<br><br>Les<br><br><a href=#c1512813268799383167 title="comment permalink">5/11/11, 11:54 PM</a><br><br>

I spent some time in a room with a bunch of teens/20 somethings about a month ago and observed their total lack of ability to concentrate on anything other than their smart phones. In fact it almost seemed like the phones were controlling <i>them</i>, administering little 'treats' (such as calls, SMS's, tweets, Facebook status updates) every few seconds. Pavlov's dogs spring to mind.<br><br>But I think what many readers here worry about is the actual time-span of decline you are talking about in your blog and books. On the one hand you talk about the 'long decline' over a period of centuries, and on the other it seems like you are talking about sudden collapse that could happen at any minute. At least that's my impression. I know nobody has a crystal ball and that you espouse preparation as the best insurance against futures shocks, I'm just saying that I can understand the anxiety – especially if you're whole economic existence is hanging from a thread and all you can hear is the sound of scissors being sharpened.<br><br>Also, people living in rented apartments, nervously wondering how they are going to overcome their predicament might do well to look at things from another angle. In a way they might be the lucky ones – I read recently that 85% of home owners in Las Vegas are facing a negative equity situation – with a scary amount of others across the US in the same situation.

Your arguments are cogent, but I think overly focused on high-bandwidth frivolities like Netflix, porn, massively multiplayer online gaming, and so on. Those uses will die back or vanish, certainly. I agree that video and bookstores will tend to fill the gaps when Internet connectivity and bandwidth get expensive or unavailable. (And of course the gamers always have classic tabletop-style D&amp;D. :-)<br><br>However, such uses are not really the core utility of the Internet. Posts like this are a superb counterexample of the WWeb's true usefulness. The real content of this site, and greenwizards.org, and other such helpful projects, requires very little bandwidth, but the value of such posts and the ensuing discussions is very great for those of us who are not trying to die before things turn hard.<br><br>I suspect the Internet will shed characteristic bandwidth before it disconnects altogether. When that happens, The Archdruid Report will be largely unhindered, and will continue to provide the same sort of value.<br><br>I can easily live without the high-volume content (especially in light of your remarks about Stimulation) but it would be a grievous loss to become decoupled from the smart, high-quality intentional communities. I see the Internet as an irreplaceable lifeline in the near to medium term.<br><br>(Unrelated side note: your use of the term "steep" to refer to the difficult parts of a learning curve is in error. It's a very common error, driven by intuitive conflation with steep hills being hard to climb, but mathematically the steep parts of a learning curve are the easy, efficient ones.)<br><br><a href=#c3238161049136497326 title="comment permalink">5/12/11, 5:47 AM</a><br><br>

The one caution I'd offer is not to confuse fitness with current fashions in body type; it's quite possible, in particular, to be too thin -- to lack the fat reserves necessary to weather a period of fod scarcity or a serious illness. <br><br>Janne, I talked about him (and that essay) in last week's post. <br><br>Archivist, until there are individuals and families willing to make the changes that have to happen, it's a waste of time, and a distraction from the issues that matter, to talk about cities. Real change comes up from the roots. <br><br>Jason, I'm not sure why so many people seem confused about what I'm saying about the timescale of decline, as I've been saying the same thing for the last five years. We're in a long process of decline and fall, which will probably last one to three centuries, consisting of periods of severe crisis separated by periods of relative stability and partial recovery. One of those periods of crisis is breathing down our necks right now. It's not going to send us straight into the Dark Ages, but it's going to be a bear to live through, and those who don't take appropriate precautions may not live through it at all. Is that a bit clearer? <br><br>Das Monde, as I see it, cooperative schemes are important, but they're a second step. The first is to give individuals the tools they need to get their own lives moving in the right direction; as that happens, cooperative networks will evolve by themselves. <br><br>Kieran, thank you! By all means spread it around. <br><br>Ken, well, that's why I spent the first six months or so of Green Wizardry posts here talking about gardening! <br><br>Sixbears, true enough!

And I have found only a handful of posts and discussions on this topic on the internet, which however basically agree on that the bicycle will play an important role for several reasons, and in spite of the adverse effects of de-industrialization. Of course, it is related to the issue of repairing and recycling old bikes and the ways to keep them running without some presently easily obtaiable components.<br><br>I have discovered some studies saying the bicycle is one of the most ingenious human inventions and that its energy efficiency is hardly surpassed e.g. even by birds, which only confirmed my impression and passion for this thing. And I have been using my bike as a means of transportation since my childhood, - going to high school in my hometown, and now commuting each day in the capital where I live (10+10 km per day, ca. 160 m elevation difference, which keeps me fit), of course I heavily relied on it when studying in China in 2000-1.<br><br>It seems to me that learing how to repair a bike, especially in an improvising way, could be a skill needed in a not too distant future.

In 1972 Mischel put pre-schoolers in a room and put a marshmallow on the table in front of them. They were told they could eat it right away or, if they held off for ten minutes, they would get a second marshmallow. In addition to the pure entertainment value of watching 4-year-olds squirm around and employ dozens of goofy strategies to get through the time without caving, the study yielded significant results. Not only did those students able to delay gratification do better in certain measures used in follow-up studies (SAT scores, for one), but it is now generally understood that self-control is actually something that (just like gardening or home repair or weatherstripping) can be taught (Mary Karapetian Alvord has a great book on the subject for interested parents or practitioners). As our society has spent the past few decades trying to encourage the OPPOSITE, it appears that the limits to growth and the impending crises JMG has been discussing here will force us to re-learn these skills and make sure the next generation(s) have them in large doses. (That would probably also go a long way in reducing much of the behaviors that end up being labeled ADHD, as well.) I am no longer surprised by how accepting my children are when I tell them that, while we could afford to buy that DVD or computer game or toy, that we would prefer to spend our money on more important things. The parents who have been indulging their children and will be forced to stop abruptly will be in for a great deal of extra and unnecessary pain.<br><br><a href=#c1078031784016718670 title="comment permalink">5/12/11, 7:17 AM</a><br><br>

The air conditioner lowers the indoor dew point, by quite a bit. An air conditioner might only drop the air in the room from 84F/29C to 80F/27C, but it might have lowered the dew point from 72F/22C to 63F/17C, and that will make a huge difference to the comfort and fungal-unfriendliness in the room.<br><br>Using less does not necessarily mean abandoning air conditioning entirely, especially when you live in a really damp place. You can use LESS air conditioning. Small window units are actually not all that inefficient if you install them tightly in ways that do not compromise all the rest of your insulation and weatherstripping. With good insulation and vapor barriers, a small A/C can keep your sleeping/clothing storage area comfortable and dried out for MUCH MUCH less than $100/month. Conceivably the smaller units could be powered by a P/V or other small home generation system especially if you concentrate its use to the critical afternoon hours of maximum heat gain. Of course, like everything else, this only works if the space is well insulated. <br><br>Air conditioning (cooling and dehumidifying) is not an all-or-nothing thing. You can scale it back and limit how much of your space you apply it to without abandoning it completely, especially as you learn how to adapt your living space in total to being less A/C dependent. <br><br>About the cost of an attic fan -- I don't recall that mine cost even $100 to buy and install (work done by me, not by a hired electrician). I think it might have been a lot less than that. More labor, but not necessarily much more cost, if you need to modify your attic to increase the air outflow from it. Add an inexpensive home-made insulated door to cover it when it is not in use (to avoid making a big gaping thermal hole in your ceiling -- those aluminum louvered shutters that come with it let the heat right through) and you are good to go.<br><br><a href=#c1449086656567846906 title="comment permalink">5/12/11, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

There's also the amount of water in the air. For some reason the popular media weather people decided long ago to focus on relative humidity as the number they would promote for telling people how humid it is. This is not really a very useful number. It changes drastically during the course of the day even if the actual amount of moisture in the air stays constant, and it gives you very little indication of how damp it will be inside your house. If it is 40F/4C outside and 100% humidity, it is likely pretty dry inside your heated house. But if it is 90F/32C outside with 40% humidity, then it is likely rather damp inside your un-airconditioned house. In recent decades they have also started throwing around their fanciful "heat indices" or "feels-like" temperatures that supposedly combine the effects of heat and humidity. Sorry, but 90F/32C with high humidity does not "feel like" 104F/40C with no humidity. The two are drastically different, both in how they affect your own well being and in how they affect the regulation of heat and moisture in your house.<br><br>The number that people need to become familiar with is the dew point. This is a real, basic, meaningful measure of ABSOLUTE humidity. The weather people use it all over the place in their own work, but for some reason they think that their mass audience is too stupid to understand it so they rarely mention it to us and almost never highlight it. It's a very simple number -- it is the temperature that, if you cool the air, the water will begin to condense out as dew or fog. If the dew point is 50F/10C and you have a glass of water that is barely warmer than this, it will not "sweat." If the glass is slightly colder than this, it will "sweat." It does not depend on the air temperature; heat the air and the dew point does not change. Cool the air and it does not change until you get the air cooler than the dew point; then the water condenses out (as dew, frost, rain, snow, or fog), and the dew point drops to stay in synch with the temperature. It is physically impossible (in the real, wild atmosphere) for the dew point to be higher than the air temperature. <br><br>So.. the relevance of this babbling to living without air conditioning: In the southeastern U.S., summertime dewpoints are quite high. In the mid-south and southern Appalachians they tend to stay in the 60sF/16-20C, but close to the coast and in the deep south they can be up in the mid 70sF/25C. I have once or twice experienced dew points of 82F/28C, which is just beyond the design tolerances of the human body. In contrast, in drier places even when the temperature is very high the dew points are often quite low. In Arizona it might be 113F/45C, but the dew point is likely well under 50F/10C. And in general it is the dew point that determines how intolerable and damaging the sultry summer weather will be. With low dew points you can be comfortable with a breeze, some shade, and a glass of water. With high dew points that won't be enough. My own experience is that the boundary between these two conditions is dew points around the low 60sF/high teens C. Plus, high indoor dew points promote rampant mold growth. When we lived without air conditioning on the coast of South Carolina, anything leather left in the closet would rapidly turn green and fuzzy. This also contributes to respiratory problems and wood decay, on beyond just being inconvenient. <br><br>[continued below]<br><br><a href=#c2932589512249181407 title="comment permalink">5/12/11, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

I would love to make many more changes to my life much more quickly, but alas I have to accept that at 47 I have accumulated a number of attachment and obligations. I am a child of the empire. Other members of my family have expectations and visions of the future that differ a bit from where I have arrived at – my life is tied to theirs and I can but lead as best I can in the direction I think we should go. It's not that we see extremely different things, just perhaps a different level of urgency. <br><br>So I still work a steady job and commute 50 miles a day by car. I'd rather be home working on the garden and other projects at home, but I'm lucky to have it and we'd lose our home without it. Moving is not an acceptable option, so I enjoy our rural property and wonder if we will be able to hang on to it once the job inevitably goes away. But while the ties to the world that is failing force me into major compromises, that does not mean there is nothing I can do!<br><br>I'm doing the garden over yet again – the tiller has been parked for good and I'm double digging it by hand. I'm way late, but it does not matter because my goal now is to learn how, not to feed my family from it this year. As for other Green Wizard type projects, I know full well that I'll be disappointed by how little I get done this summer due to time pressures from work and other obligations and maintenance projects, but I will do what I can, focusing on those things with the greatest potential of return. <br><br>One thing that everyone should keep in mind is that the coming time of transition will be a period of chaos. There are no assurances on an individual level, and that same shantytown may await for any of us. You simply cannot predict how it will play out for you. That's why it's best to focus on skills and knowledge, backed by practice and experience. It's also where disnsensus comes in – for example, my wife may not fully agree with my vision of what is coming, but I could well imagine that her skills with animals and her ability to meet and connect with interesting people with relevant skills and knowledge may be more important than my skills with tools and (ultimately) gardening. <br><br>The point I guess is that you cannot dismiss those things you could do just because they won't be adequate, just because you won't be fully prepared (whatever that means) when you are done. Most of us have spent our lives up to now learning to live in the world that is fading, and we are not going to be able to compete with those who learn these skills from childhood. But here we are, this is our lot, and we may as well do what we can.<br><br><a href=#c5885586650109474472 title="comment permalink">5/12/11, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>

There weren't any of those corner bicycle repair experts anywhere nearby; there was no way I was walking the bike home to Jishuitan, and the cost of a taxi would have been more than the cost of a new bike. Not coincidentally, that was in the thoroughly developed and Westernised Financial Street area. On the other hand, in the old-fashioned area where I lived, there were repairmen every couple of streets. My chain once locked up while I was going around the Second Ring Road near Dongsishitiao, and I coasted to a halt right next to one of them, who had me on my way in a couple of minutes... Definitely a more civilzed way of living...<br><br><a href=#c241080272644217256 title="comment permalink">5/12/11, 11:37 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks for sharing it!<br><br>Chris, it's been my experience that a lot of the people who talk longingly about communities in the abstract have gone out of their way to avoid dealing with the actual communities they live in; the result is a lot of fantasy that has about as much in common with real life as romance fiction or porn have with actual relationships. <br><br>Sage, it's as crucial a part of my work, though it hasn't come up here very often. <br><br>Bob, of course self-discipline and the deliberate direction of will can be learned. A hundred years ago there were entire books on the subject -- I've got some -- packed full of exercises to strengthen the will the way that pumping iron strengthens your muscles. It might be worth blowing the dust off some of those practices. <br><br>Lei, that's a good point. I walk rather than biking, for a variety of reasons, but for those who like or can handle two-wheeled travel, it's a great choice -- and learning bike repair could be an excellent route to a future job. <br><br>ZZ, many thanks for the links!<br><br>Bill, many thanks for all this -- solid points, and highly useful for those of us still learning our way around hot and humid summers. <br><br>Adrian, it's an interesting detail of history that the modern Druid movement and the Quaker faith both emerged around the same time in around the same place -- that is, England around the beginning of the industrial revolution. I don't know of any direct connection, but there may be some shared intellectual heredity there. <br><br>Loveandlight, yes, I think there's a lot of that. It's also a futile attempt, by those people who are still clinging to their jobs and homes, to insist that they won't lose everything because the people who do, well, it's their own fault. Batwitted as it is, that kind of rationalization is all too common. <br><br>Julie, many thanks for sharing your story! I suspect it's a great help to those who are nerving themselves up to take the plunge that those already in the water are paddling around comfortably. ;-)<br><br>Twilight, exactly. You do what you can with the hand you've been dealt. I have to spend more hours at the keyboard, and fewer in my garden or workshop, than I'd prefer, because that's what keeps the mortgage paid -- so you're far from alone. <br><br>Nick, excellent. That kind of negotiation outside the mainstream economy is going to become a major element in survival strategies in the years ahead. Have you considered learning how to make cheese, by the way? <br><br>Lucid, that happened to a lot of members of that generation. Not sure how I dodged the bullet. <br><br>Guilherme, drop an email to info (at) newsociety (dot) com, and they can point you to Latin American distributors. <br><br>John, that's an excellent point. The old-fashioned seaside or lakeside or mountain cabin, to which every vacation was inevitably destined, has a lot going for it in the short term, and in the long term it might become a crucial fallback option. <br><br>Yupped, good for you! Getting involved in local community gardens might be a good option for the young apartment dwellers who've posted comments here, too.<br><br><a href=#c5122808086587537382 title="comment permalink">5/12/11, 11:42 AM</a><br><br>

They listen politely as I attempt to describe as eloquently as possible the need for resilience and curtailment to preserve the quality of life in our cities. However, they largely dismiss the need for LESS.<br><br>In spite of my description of issues like EROEI, scaling, sunk costs, etc. these bright, well-meaning folks genuinely believe that technology can 'save us' from having to contend with LESS.<br><br>Many seem confident that major US cities can undergo a gradual "Europeanization" process (ultimately using, as you've commonly noted, one third the oil that the US currently uses). They contend that undertaking large infrastructure projects including regional rail, urban streetcars, renewable energy, and smart meters can save us from LESS. Their argument seems to run: "if only the proper infrastructure projects were subsidized sufficiently, we could all live without having to give up MORE."<br><br>I remind them that European lifestyles aren't sustainable when one looks beyond mere land use considerations and factors in consumption patterns and the structural dependency of our economy on continued growth. That's pretty much where the conversation ends. <br><br>However, one thing occurred to me from your post this week which helps me understand this endemic anti-LESS sentiment. It's a take on Pascal's Wager that goes something like this: "a rational person should wager as though MORE exists, because living life accordingly has everything to gain, and nothing to lose." <br><br>Culturally, LESS is perceived as tantamount to throwing in the towel; that it's a necessary result of failure rather than a goal to be pursued. In other words, LESS will always be waiting for us, so why embrace it earlier than necessary? <br><br>If this is the train of thought that descent-savvy planners have to contend with, it may be a bumpy ride down the front half of this century.<br><br><a href=#c8181330204505582460 title="comment permalink">5/12/11, 12:43 PM</a><br><br>

My wife and I (plus our two children) have been growing vegetables in our backyard the past 3 years and have enjoyed not just what we grow, but the process of growing as well (Of everything that we grow I am amazed at how much better our broccoli tastes then even organic broccoli you can buy in a store). While we are far from self sufficient, my wife cans salmon that she and her mom catch, I butcher my own deer that we will eat over the winter/spring, and we freeze, can and dry some of our fruit and vegetables that we grow. <br><br>We haven't removed ourselves from technology (although we don't have cable TV), but our favourite spot to vacation is at a cabin we are looking after that is completely off the grid. We have there an 800 gallon water catchment system, we bring propane for a stove and fridge, and we bring our own drinking water. There is also next to no cell phone reception so there is truly no contact with the outside world. There are no roads nearby (only deer trails) and my two children think it is the best place in the world. I get up at first light early in the morning before everyone just to wander in the woods (sometimes with my dog if she feels up for it). I walk the deer trails and occasionally spot them along with many different types of bird. I try to learn a few different plants and bushes as I pass underneath the canopy of the massive alders and hemlock. The word 'magical' springs to mind. While on the walks I can feel all my stresses of my daily life (work) fade away.<br><br>Cheers,<br>BB<br><br><a href=#c4242686681758178186 title="comment permalink">5/12/11, 12:44 PM</a><br><br>

Making our 1960s ranch house more energy efficient, converting to a "working" kitchen, adding a woodstove, and putting in a garden are tops on the list of "fix-up" projects. I have also gotten hold of some used solar hot water equipment discarded from some neighbors.<br><br>While we didn't make the move to a rust-belt city and the housing market here still has a ways to fall, our mortgage payments now are less than our rent was, and we're still close to family. With luck, at least one of us will have a job at any given time, and our setup at this point means only one of us <i>needs</i> to work to make ends meet. While we're both working, we're putting money toward cutting our dependence on energy, food, and other resources that we don't provide ourselves.<br><br>Are we as prepared as we could be? No, but we're working on it one step at a time. Within two years, our half-acre of grass and juniper will be 80% converted to food production. We can bus to work, the farmers market, and the forest. I'm working on a stout recipe that's become popular, the chickens are coming next spring, and there are wild mushrooms on my way to work.

As that era sputters to a stop, consider the northeast quadrant of America: the Rust Belt.<br><br>Location: Look for a city under a quarter-million in population that is surrounded for at least 25 miles in all directions by fertile, rain-fed cropland so that the city can easily feed itself.<br><br>Location: Look for an older, walkable, mixed-use neighborhood towards the city center where the buildings are structurally sound, but rough around the edges because they haven't been maintained since the factory jobs started leaving in the 1970's.<br><br>There are many older neighborhoods in cities in the Rust Belt that meet this profile. <br><br>If you buy a beat-up, foreclosed house in a carefully-selected neighborhood in one of these Rust Belt cities, you may be able to:<br><br>Save Money: Prices in these neighborhoods are currently as crazy-low as the prices in 2007 Las Vegas were crazy-high. The current average home sale price in our ZIP code (61104 in Rockford, IL) is only $22,000. Within two blocks of our house, single-family homes have sold for $10,000, and a six-flat just sold for $20,000. These prices are much cheaper than renting. Sell crazy-high, buy crazy-low.<br><br>Learn Skills: These buildings usually need a lot of work. You can camp out inside the house while you learn to do roofing, plumbing, flooring, etc. (Our two-flat had no running water when my wife and I moved in, but plenty of roof leaks. We used rainwater for many months while I started rehabbing it.)<br><br>Learn the New Social Order: The informal black/gray market that will soon emerge is already present in an embryonic form in many of these neighborhoods (see Orlov and FerFAL). You'll get a headstart by learning now who "da playas R".<br><br>Gain Self-Respect: No one will laugh at you if you don't have a high-prestige/high-paying job. (Most of the people in these neighborhoods don't have "a real job"; many have never had "a real job"; and more than a few are utterly incapable of holding down anything that even resembles "a real job".) The reponsible neighbors will welcome you because you're improving the neighborhood by repairing your house.

I thought I'd mention two things that your comment made me think of:<br><br>1. There's a disconnect between what Internet researchers think of as the Internet and how others view it. Generally we think of it as the set of protocols that enable routing (e.g. <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol rel=nofollow>BGP</a>, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First rel=nofollow>OSPF</a>), data transport (e.g. <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol rel=nofollow>TCP</a>), internetworking (e.g. <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol rel=nofollow>IP</a>), etc. and the infrastructure over which these protocols run. In this view, the Internet is actually fairly resilient (though not in the long term).<br><br>2. The trend towards cloud-based services has made common-mode failures a bigger problem than in the past. Twenty years ago this blog and its comments would have been a moderated <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet rel=nofollow>Usenet</a> group, and because Usenet was decentralized it would have been more resilient to failure. Maybe we should / will revert to such systems in the years to come.<br><br><a href=#c937206488154920990 title="comment permalink">5/13/11, 5:22 PM</a><br><br>

Sara and I moved from the west coast to an old mill town in the north central Appalachians, and had no trouble settling in -- the local Freemasons welcomed me as a brother, Sara's teaching spinning classes at the local yarn store, etc. It's a good idea to bring an income with you -- there are very few jobs in most of the Rust Belt, and one of the things that can raise hackles is if the locals think you're there to take a job or two away from them and their neighbors -- but since I write for a living and Sara telecommutes, and we made sure the word got around, that wasn't a problem. <br><br>Kevin, I don't have any miracles to recommend but I do have a strategy. Obviously I don't know what kind of skills you have, but for most people, this is the last time to be devoting all your remaining resources to a job search. Several middle-aged to elderly couples have commented to this list in recent weeks that they'd happily take in a young person or two and give them a place to stay in exchange for farm labor. If you're not afraid of hard work and can check your ego at the door and learn, that may be the best option you've got just now. In your place, I'd certainly consider it.<br><br><a href=#c1559375869377645942 title="comment permalink">5/13/11, 5:27 PM</a><br><br>

Ideas which would have been just as valid on the rising tide of non-renewable consumption as in the ebb of industrialisation. However, one question which always rattles around my head when I take the time to read your blog is "what is the time scale?" <br><br>My expectations for the decline of industrial civilisation are (I believe) akin to yours. No dramatic armageddon or the like, just an increasing infeasibility of excessive energy consumption. However, I get the impression you see this impacting the biological necessities of life rather more rapidly than I believe will occur. For example, I would be a little surprised if, within the lifetimes of most of your readers, supermarkets do not retain their position as the primary hunting grounds in western countries. If you have already posted about the time scale of decline I would be fascinated to read what you wrote, if not I would be fascinated to read what you would write.<br><br>I am certain that dramatically reduced energy consumption is better for our mental and physical well being (plus it's fun to scrape out that extra nugget of non-consumption). However, I have not yet heard a convincing argument for it based on the urgency of preparing for a deindustrialised world. After all, will the shortages not come in dribs and drabs as they already do? After the first winter of feeling the financial sting of buying strawberries, will people not move on to oranges? If there is a good argument in this regard, I suspect you can wield it.<br><br><a href=#c8033248083512123447 title="comment permalink">5/14/11, 2:39 AM</a><br><br>

I agree with your sentiments, observations and advice, however, over here your concerns appear to not even be on the average persons radar.<br><br>Since the 1970's, I've seen our society change from carefree and egalitarian, to a more competitive and individualistic nation. <br><br>Over here our economic well being depends on two main industries: mining and agriculture. Both are heavily subsidised through the use of oil which is getting more expensive every year. As both are extractive industries in their current forms, they provide little to no long term prospects for the country. This is a taboo subject here.<br><br>How is it that people believe that the economy, their assets and their wages can keep growing year in year out?<br><br>You can see the cracks in the system increasing yearly. Our infrastructure does not match the size of our population, or is failing. You read articles in newspapers where people say they are doing it tough and when you read the details, they have a before tax income of $120,000! Why is our median house price for Melbourne (from today's newspaper) $705,000? How can people think spending $45,000 on a family car is cheap?<br><br>What's wrong with them?<br><br>Sometimes I feel like that there's a party going on and I didn't get an invite!<br><br>I've always worked hard on numerous fronts, pursued education, built up general skills and avoided debt. I've got plenty of mates, but I'm seriously lacking peers.<br><br>People are so caught up in their domestic situations that they never take the time to look around them at the changes that are occurring. As an outsider, it's like watching a slow motion car crash. I can see the social and financial pressures building around the people that I know and the impact it has on their lives, but I can't assist them in any way as they choose to tie themselves to the great carousel that is the system. The grip is tenacious and I can see that they'll hang on right up to the last second when there are no further options.<br><br>For food, I'm about 30% self sufficient, which should rapidly increase every season now. I've hit 100% for electricity, water and heating and have no hope ever of producing fuel for a vehicle. I'd drink or trade alcohol long before putting it into a vehicle.<br><br>The problem is that in undertaking this journey, I realise how deep in the poo as a society we are. Most people are in a dream, or they're asleep at the wheel and they are all to happy to let me know what they think which is that what I'm up to is mildly eccentric.<br><br>However at the same time, I often see people pointing at Cuba and saying, "they did it, so it must be 100% too easy". I don't believe that we can transition to organic agriculture and retain any semblance of a middle class, first world lifestyle, it's just not compatible. Few would even consider the ecological concepts such as carrying capacity and what it means to them and their families.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c4270330516667250059 title="comment permalink">5/14/11, 3:30 AM</a><br><br>

Each important datum should exist in all three forms, and each must be archived and maintained. So you need to periodically upgrade your local electronic form before it becomes obsolete or decays, and when you think Flikr might be on its way out you need to duplicate your cloud photos somewhere else. Preserving information always takes continuing work. The cloud can work to your advantage, but only if you are smart and cautious about it.<br><br>I have 35 years of field notes about all the birds I have tallied everywhere I have ever been.

I think people will be quite surprised and perplexed when things stop working. <br><br>One of the things I find interesting about the the world we've created around us is not only the complexity but also the level of abstraction involved. The actions that people take to use things like the internet are relatively simple and completely unrelated to types of things that are going on beneath the surface to make it work, nor to the level of complexity. You'd need a high level of specialist training in several areas to really understand it. I have only a basic understanding of the protocol complexity that barath was discussing, but I design electronic circuits and understand the complexity and vulnerability of the hardware. But from the user's point of view there's nary a hint of what is going on, and I wonder how often throughout history mankind has been able to create such systems of great hidden complexity. <br><br>The only other systems I can think of that have these characteristics are biological and ecological. I can learn to use the soil in my garden, but I don't really know what's going on in there, and when we mess with ecosystems we often find that seemingly small changes have large unintended results. Still, I think those systems, having evolved over very long times, are more resilient and self-correcting than something like the internet.<br><br><a href=#c2044638864281616196 title="comment permalink">5/14/11, 6:10 AM</a><br><br>

That's the reason I prefer <a href=http://ixquick.com/ rel=nofollow>Ixquick</a> for research. I rarely use Google unless I'm searching for an Icelandic word or phrase as part of my language learning process, and I want to take advantage of Google's translation service. Um, good luck to anyone who tries to interpret that data.

I've found I need to keep a tight reign on stimulation to feel mentally balanced. The easiest way for me to do this is to simply limit the number of electronic gadgets that I own. So I have four: a hand-cranked emergency AM/FM/weather radio with a built-in LED flashlight at my home, a second weather radio at my office, a CD player at my office which provides soft music during my client's massage sessions and yoga lessons, and one laptop computer (plus one back-up external hard drive, a pair of earbuds, and a printer that I share with my husband).<br><br>I don't have, and don't want: a television. A cell phone. An MP3 player. An e-book reader. A game console. A GPS. And probably a lot of other stuff that I don't even know about, as my exposure to advertising is happily rather limited. I also camp at at least once a year and completely unplug for several days. I have to.

As Douglas Adams wisely put it, though, the first rule is: 'Don't Panic'. Part of the issue may be this: you feel that no money = no options. I would suggest this mindset derives from our set of cultural myths revolving around money as the be all and end all (kind of ironic when you consider how wholly unsubstantial our fiat money system is).<br><br>You actually may have more resources than others who have more money. Your age, your social support network and family, your location, the time you have on your hands - all these and more may constitute resources you may be able to leverage.<br><br>I would also suggest the old adage that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Have you find a single step you *can* take? If so, have you taken it? In many sense, I think this is a journey which requires one to build confidence in oneself as one goes, and those small steps are quite important in this regard. Find something to do, and do it. Then find something else to do, and do that. And so on. You don't have to be able to map out a clear path to sustainability now - once you've started thinking and moving in that direction, the next steps may show themselves. <br><br>My scientifically minded Buddhist friends would tell you that taking a small step will kick off neurochemical changes associated with intention which then can begin to build momentum.<br><br>A good place to begin is to read past posts here if you have not (go back at least a year), and also to join the greenwizards.org site that JMG has set up. There are forums there in which you can interact with others in similar positions, ask questions, vent your frustrations, glean helpful info, etc.<br><br>Good luck, don't panic, and know at least that you are not alone!<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=#c2668205721044111241 title="comment permalink">5/14/11, 7:24 AM</a><br><br>

It was only when I became single again that I was really able to do it, and I am amazed and proud of how possible and pleasing a low-income lifestyle can be – there are tradeoffs, but they are worth it. In these uncertain times, it’s really good to know there’s a solid base that won’t disappear with the economy.<br><br><i>The same thing is true of most of the other skills that are needed to live comfortably in hard times. If you don’t know how to do them, you’re going to make a lot of mistakes, and suffer a great deal more than you have to.</i><br><br>I second and third this! I’m on my third year gardening in this plot, and even though I’ve gardened for two decades, there is a learning curve viz. this soil and this micro-climate, not to mention the types of seeds I’m choosing. My project this summer is to explore solar cooking and distilling (found what looks like a double-boiler w/tube out of top part – at Goodwill – looks like distiller to me) such that I can make some herbal tinctures and things. And today I’m off to a local plant sale to look for a few more herbs, some hop plants and bay laurel, as I work to get my homestead full of what I use regularly. It takes time; you can’t do it in one season. “Instant” is the old consumer mantra – it doesn’t work.<br><br><br><i>The last part of the acronym, "stimulation," may seem surprising to my readers, but it’s a crucial part of the recipe.</i><br><br>Yes!! I have found, by withdrawing from most modern media, and being very selective, that once the illusion of the ads wears off, the world looks really different. In the past three decades, I’ve watch ads slowly take over, creating a “Better Homes and Garden” mindset that is enslaving (that’s not too strong a word) most people such that they can’t see their modest homes &amp; lives as wonderful. Also, there was a post over at Oil Drum, <br>“The psychological roots of resource over-consumption”<br><a rel=nofollow>http://www.theoildrum.com/node/7901</a> that helps explain why the pull is so strong… not that it should be used as an excuse, but I find that knowing there is a hindbrain aspect to my craving stimulation, to my craving “fun” helps me know when to apply discipline, to “ride it out” until the craving passes rather than giving in (like not scratching an itch).<br><br>Oh, and the code word today was "dunfer" which sounds too close to "done for" - yikes!<br><br><a href=#c5365517431648543018 title="comment permalink">5/14/11, 7:44 AM</a><br><br>

With that said, it is not for the faint of heart! But, I think you are right on the money with your thoughts and predictions. <br><br>My husband and I have experienced an accelerated version of learning to do more with less as he is in the construction trades. After losing a major account two years ago, we quickly started selling equipment that was no longer keeping busy, our office, and our home. We eventually were able to downsize and the bonus is that we now have a home and two barns on seven acres that is paid for! We have dreams of converting one barn into a greenhouse, installing solar power, growing a huge garden, and become more self-sufficient.<br><br>It is a continual process to become more conscious and making decisions that are for the benefit and health of our earth and for each other. Living in Oregon, we already recycle and drive a green car, but there is ever so much more to learn and do. <br><br>It seems that once you start on this path, the more you realize how much more you could be doing or doing without.

Obviously electronic information is more susceptible to loss just due to it's complexity. The written word is definitely more resilient, but it's still at the mercy of fire and decay. About the most resilient would be something scratched into rock, but even that is subject to mother nature. After all, the great Mississippi River is apparently thinking about changing course presently. <br><br>I have thought about this before because I have kept a journal for the last 13 years electronically. I printed it one day for preservation purposes along with all of my writing. I also have all of that backed up by various electronic means and in various locations. But there are times when it is all in the same location...my house. My house could burn down and take all of that information with it. <br><br>The most resilient place to store information is in the human mind. Sage wisdom has been around for many millennium because it has been passed down orally and recorded in generations of the human mind. <br><br>The question comes to mind...if something is so transient than why is it so important? I suppose to be practical about this matter than it's relativity cannot be denied. Without this relativity than somethings permanence dictates it's importance. History is a record. Records can be changed just like in Orwell's "1984." After all, history is written by the winners. <br><br>So, my point is that what is truly important should reside in the human mind. That information is as resilient as you can find, and is subject to forces much greater than society and controlling agendas. Maybe this is why story telling is so important to humanity. The stories are coded with important information and wisdom<br><br><a href=#c1833728260584816442 title="comment permalink">5/14/11, 8:50 AM</a><br><br>

We rent the suburban house, and then (somewhat carefully!) invite others to live with us as roommates. It's been quite successful so far, as the rent and expenses are split between several people, so our cost of living is much lower than it was in our little apartment. We also now have workshop and basement space, and a yard where we are gradually building up a garden. <br>Another benefit (although many of our peers do not see it this way) is that it makes life richer by bringing more people into your life. We learn all sorts of things from the different people that we have shared the house with, including how to get along with people who are a little different to us.<br>This idea works for us right now.

So much depends on where you are living and to what extent the local infrastructure and people are resilient to shocks. For example, I was until recently living in Spain, and many of the people around me still had a full set of skills as if the latter half of the 20th century never happened. The region had no supermarkets, all the food was locally produced, people could still make their own baskets, clothes and have a good old knees up with rough home made wine. If the big box supermarket on the coast disappeared they wouldn't notice it! Contrast that with, say, Las Vegas and I'll think you see what I mean.<br><br>BTW in Britain we've already seen a few chain stores crash.

Our house here in Cumberland is in a transition zone between a more or less middle class neighborhood uphill to the east, a lower class neighborhood shading into one of the town's skid rows on the south, project housing to the west, and a poor neighborhood to the north. Cumberland doesn't attract a lot of immigrants, but other than that it's quite a mix. Still, everyone pretty much gets along, and we've had no trouble at all. <br><br>Carp, I'm pretty sure the problem with bees is multifactorial; in particular, the use of neonicotinoid pesticides plays a very large role in Colony Collapse Disorder. Still, the cell phones will go away in good time. <br><br>Mr. Mustard, I've heard all too many stories like that, and there isn't always anybody to pick up the pieces.<br><br>Honky, I've written about time scales at great length. The supermarket is a fairly recent phenomenon -- they were rare before the Second World War -- and will start to break down as soon as transport costs become high enough that they begin to lose market share to smaller and more nimble stores selling local products, which are starting to take shape within the farmers market movement right now. It's almost always a bad mistake to assume that the details of daily life will remain the same for more than a few decades; the kicker, for us, is that most of the changes we're facing will be in the direction of contraction and relocalization. <br><br>Chris, Australia is still a bubble economy.

To use one of your examples, the big box stores aren't going to close all at once; some of them are closing right now, others will linger for greater or lesser intervals, and by the time the last of them shut down, most people won't notice. Thus the time to start is now. We're already in the crisis, and there is very seriously no time to waste. <br><br>Twilight, that's a very useful point. The great thing about soil is that it maintains itself, given half a chance and some compost to do it with!<br><br>Jason, thank you for that!

As for the ad-world, I think of it as the pornography of materialism; the world shown by ads has the same resemblance to actual life as the world shown in pornography has to actual relationships. <br><br>Julie, thank you! It's a long strange trip, no question, but there are a lot of good things to be found on the way. <br><br>Lucid, bingo.

What an interesting time it is for all of us that we have chosen to be born here and now.

Less is a bit of an oxymoron, because the less, in reality, is actually more.<br><br>Part of our adventure here is in creating a homestead. I have always loved simple technologies and the simple beauty of homemade/handmade things and now we have the chance to fully develop and embrace this.

Smil points out that per capita energy usage in the US and Canada is about twice that in western Europe, yet Americans and Canadians aren't twice as well off as Europeans. Using less energy, Smil says, is pretty much the only workable strategy to reduce carbon emissions and climate change in the short term -- newfangled techno-fixes will simply take too long to build.<br><br>Smil doesn't say much about peak oil -- of course, in a contracting economy with falling energy supplies, the time it would take to build a new power grid, enough carbon sequestration capacity to matter, etc. goes from "decades" to "forget it". But Smil's point is still valid, and it's good to see someone advocating using less (or using LESS) in a fairly popular science magazine (i.e. not as widely distributed as _Discover_ or _Scientific American_, but still available on newsstands and bookstores). Most of the popular science mags these days seem to be cheerleaders for industry, or at least focus on the amazing new techno-fixes just around the corner -- it was good to see a more grounded, less romantic article.

Although an awareness of my environmental impact may play a part of why I live frugally, truthfully, it’s just the all-around practical thing to do and a great source of freedom and empowerment in my life.

My situation: I’m in my early thirties, and with the exception of one year (when I made slightly more), I have made<br>less than $15,000 dollars annually during all of my adult life so far. But because I’m frugal (don’t need/have a car, make most of my meals from scratch, and don’t buy things I don’t need), I have been able to save quite a bit (probably enough that I could survive six years without income if I had to…assuming currency keeps its value). I probably could easily buy a house with all cash in certain parts of the country too. Economically, I’m probably doing way better than the<br>$100,000-plus income household that’s living paycheck-to-paycheck,<br>deep in debt, and very dependent on the global economic system. Yet,<br>many people look at my lifestyle as not being “well-off.”<br><br>However, I still have a lot I need to work on in acquiring various new<br>skills, but thankfully, my lifestyle allows some time to make that possible. Your posts are encouraging me to keep doing more.<br><br>On the topic of low-cost travel, I highly recommend using the couchsurfing network (http://www.couchsurfing.org ) instead of spending a hundred or two dollars for a hotel room. There are close to three million people worldwide who are a part of it. I have both hosted a number of people, and I have also “couchsurfed” multiple times in other locations. It’s completely free, a way to use less<br>energy/resources (I suspect much of the hotel industry wastes a lot), and most of all, a great way to meet local people when you do need/want to travel.

I have thought for a long time that the change is more likely to be disruptive here simply because we have so much further to fall, being so much more addicted to oil.<br><br>Many of the systems used in Europe - e.g. the trains and barges you mention - are much more sensible from an energy perspective, and I'm inclined to agree with you that the effects will not be uniform across even the (over)'developed' nations.<br><br>Regarding complex systems, I think this essay does an admirable job of outlining the basics:<br><br>http://www.energybulletin.net/stories/2010-10-12/complexity-it’s-not-simple<br><br>That explanation goes a long way toward explaining why I see government agencies, at least here in the US, as being in way over their heads. Based on my understanding of history and political dynamics, I think the only types of entities capable of responding effectively to complex predicaments are those which spontaneously arise out of civil society - what today we think of as non-profits and NGOs. Bureaucracy is by its nature poorly suited to such tasks.<br><br>For more on that, I highly recommend Rebecca Solnit's 'A Paradise Built in Hell,' which reviews a century's worth of data from the field of disaster sociology and analyzes what actually happened on the ground after many of the world's most serious disasters - man-made and otherwise - of the last century.<br><br>Anyone wishing to read a solid, evidence-driven case for the capacity of ordinary people to come together and create effective, collective responses to calamity should read this book. I wish more in the peak oil community would read it, because it overturns - actually, disproves would be a better word - a lot of the conventional wisdom which I see every day in peak oil forums across the web.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=#c7429690755627589448 title="comment permalink">5/15/11, 3:26 PM</a><br><br>

If Blogger went into terminal collapse tomorrow, I could repost every post I've ever made the next day. <br><br>Honky, you might want to doublecheck where your food comes from -- last I read, Europe gets quite a bit of its fruits and vegetables from the Third World and most of its grain and other bulk products from various other continents. Some European countries could feed themselves in an emergency; some others would become charnel houses if they tried, given the mismatch between population and agricultural production. <br><br>Beneath, excellent -- both because you've done well, and because you know you need to do more. <br><br>Remnant, Solnit's book is well worth reading, but it's based on a subset of cases.

I wouldn't be too confident of being able to feed the population there without it. I'd recommend that you do a bit more research into this issue before declaring that most produce comes from within 200km's of your location.<br><br>It's pretty easy really. Have a look at all of the packaging for food in your own home and see where the origin of the products is. Not where it was packed, but where it was grown. Does it say local and imported ingredients as this is code words for imported?<br><br>The other thing that comes to mind for me is that relative to the rest of the Australian mainland, I have a short growing season. However, although the trees go deciduous over winter here and easily receive enough chilling hours to bear fruit, there's little snow, and plenty of other fruit and vegetables still grow. Mid winter, I'm still eating fresh greens (plus some citrus, mmm fresh lemons) grown outside in raised garden beds.<br><br>Now, I think about this and then try to imagine what it would be like in Europe with freezing winters, frozen ground and I can't imagine that you produce much fruit and vegetables out of growing season. Without having massive stores of food or preserves, how could you possibly think that all of your food is locally produced all year around.

With that said, I think overall your suggestions are poignant and relevant with regard to using less, eating less, and spending less. But we must remember, without consumption, there is less and less industry to go around to employ labor, which in turn will create more jobless people until equilibrium is reached. Moreover, I have questions to practicality of your suggestions with regard to setting up outside of town. A good portion of city dwellers will have to leave the city to find their “1 acre of land” (a metaphor, of course) to become sustainable, the question is, does the world have enough habitable; and more importantly, arable land for human development? What will come of the species of animals that currently occupy this land? Will cross country movement be deregulated? These are all off-the-top of my head questions, but they are relevant and should be considered when discussing these matters. <br><br>With more urban spread and development, natural resources (timber for homes among others) will be become more and more scarce until nature can renew its bounty. Also, will there be enough fresh water? This will be detrimental to survival as you well know. This also raises concerns over security, piracy, and bandits. This is a very difficult and complex topic to talk about and disseminate only in categorical measures and we must be careful how we pursue this as a society and we must think holistically when we make each step. I fear an inadequate plan could have far worse consequences for the living population (including the animals) if the developing system is not stress checked to take all into consideration.<br><br><a href=#c8841789864804743252 title="comment permalink">5/16/11, 5:16 AM</a><br><br>

They don't have to be as well built as roads for autos and trucks, but still, it is embedded energy, and some maintenance is required. But we will have "legacy" roads for a long time, and even after the pavement is converted to a series of chuckholes connected by gravel bicycles will be faster than walking and cheaper than a horse. <br><br>Kunstler and a few others of his ilk dismiss them after the first decade due to lack of spares or, more critically, tires and inner tubes. Between blacksmiths and home machinists spares need not be an issue. Real costs, measured in terms of man hours of your labour to effect repairs will increase, whether you make the parts yourself or barter/buy them from the smith/machinist (fabricator?) so bicycles will certainly become more expensive in real terms Tubes and tires are another matter. Currently they are made of petrouleum derived rubber in factories. Natural rubber needs to be imported from the tropics. I have wondered about substitutes made of pitch impregnated heavy fabric and or leather with tubes of animal intestine. No, I have not tried a working model! In Ashley's book of knots he describes using a loop of heavy rope or a large rope grommet as a temporary expedient fo a bike tire. There may be many ways if we think hard enough.<br><br>And yes, I am a regular cyclist. When I was 17 I spent almost a year cycling the length and breadth of what was then Western Europe.

This is from the feasta.org essay that Remnant linked to (thankyou by the way, I agree with your assessment of the essay, best I've seen in such a short report on the issues):<br><br>7.1 The De-Growth Delusion<br>Over the decades as the evidence mounted that infinite growth was not possible in a finite <br>world, the question was asked if we could live sustainably by reducing growth. It has <br>been noted since Epicuris and the Buddah, and buttressed by modern studies that beyond <br>a certain level of wealth, marginal increases do not make us more content. Why not live <br>with less and share our surplus with the destitute? In general we don‟t do this, not by a <br>long shot. Status anxiety, the sunk cost effect, personal/kin/tribal preferences and more <br>ensure that the issue is far more complex in actuality. <br>More recently a number of authors addressed the issue of peak oil and recognised that <br>economies must contract as oil availability declines<br>62,63<br> Would it not be wiser to do a .<br>planned de-growth or powerdown so as to avoid the worst economic shocks and ease the <br>transition by moving in the direction in which the wind is blowing anyway? <br>These studies and arguments generally leave the energy-economy relationship <br>unspecified, or assume the decline curve assumption.

I think I might have given the wrong impression with my comments about where food comes from. The majority of food travels much longer distances. This includes many ridiculous examples such as imported beef from Argentina which comes back on the boats that export beef to Argentina. The point that I was unsuccessfully trying to make, is that reducing the energy consumed by some percentage doesn't <i>necessarily</i> represent a complete societal change. I can very well imagine an increasing cost of high energy produce leading to decreasing volumes and increased use of more efficient foods. There is so much wanton energy consumption that reducing it incrementally without collapse must be possible. For example we could even eat all of our own beef! <br><br>I shall read through the suggested literature and then make the necessary adjustments to my thoughts again.<br><br><a href=#c1287416118055357304 title="comment permalink">5/16/11, 9:45 AM</a><br><br>

That doesn't involve any amount of sprawl -- quite the contrary, it's a matter of retrofitting existing housing and repurposing back yards and basements for other uses.

National and local governments have plenty of other options, right up to declaring martial law, confiscating and rationing food and fuel, and shooting looters on sight. Given that the US is a net food exporter and is still the third largest petroleum producer on the planet, a fast collapse could be stopped in its tracks by decisive action -- as, indeed, one was in 1933.

Among many other things, we have no idea what will or will not turn out to be sustainable over the very long term; all we can do is guess, and be ready to modify as needed. <br><br>Honky, that's another matter, of course.

Thanks for posting that. <br><br>Adrian, in the abstract I agree with you. The problem is that at this point, the vast majority of young people in America who go to college will leave it with a debt burden from which they will never recover financially.

I like the idea of defining sustainability by time frame -- that's a very helpful way of quantifying the issue. <br><br>Remnant, I got to hear Jeff's piece at ASPO; worth hearing, though I think he's wrong about some points. Still, the basic idea -- that the space currently occupied by the suburbs can be turned into something more useful -- is quite valid; until the 1950s and 1960s, most of what are now suburbs were truck farms, chicken farms, local dairies and the like, providing food for urbanites, and they very likely will turn back into those things in the decades ahead.<br><br><a href=#c3464541500729543525 title="comment permalink">5/16/11, 7:06 PM</a><br><br>

I take it to mean able to be sustained, with no conditional time phrase attached. As soon as that conditional phrase is attached, all that's being talked about is some temporary condition.

The economic nonpersons are starting to look more and more like Proles. From Wiki about Proles:<br><br>"In the novel, the society of Oceania is divided into 3 distinct classes: Inner Party, Outer Party, and proles (upper, middle, and lower classes, respectively). The proles constitute 85% of the population. They receive little education, work at jobs in which tough physical labour is the norm, live in poverty (but qualitatively richer than the Outer Party members with regard to certain freedoms inherent to their relative anonymity), and usually die by the age of sixty."<br><br>The CEO's of the corporatocracy and the politicians are the inner party, those of us still working are the outer party, and the economic nonpersons are the growing class of proles. I do believe that 1984 has already come to pass. Now it's about staying out of room #101. If you're going to continue working that is. Becoming a prole means no healthcare in a poisonous world. What kind of place is that to raise a family in? Yet Proles were the only hope for humanity in 1984. <br><br>I realize that pointing this out may be a disservice. However I feel that it is true. Which is why my denial has been fantasizing about fictions like "The World Made by Hand" as reality. I would rather live in that world than in the modern version of 1984. <br><br>I think the most important survival tool is getting your head firmly wrapped around reality.

Our public library director was struck in a downtown crosswalk just a few weeks ago. Both her wrists are broken. I'm glad she wasn't mangled any worse.

Drivers fail to notice pedestrians and cyclists simply because they're not expecting to see them. I like to think that will change as our numbers increase.

For the most part, I agree with you. What I was saying initially about bicycle effeciency referred to road infrastructure costs. It is fair to compare bikes straight across to cars or animal drawn vehicles. To compare the effeciency of bikes to animals such as fish or birds the cost(s) of the roads must be factored in. When you do so, I don't think _that_ particular comparison works out in the bikes favour.<br><br>But, we do not have the option of turning ourselves into birds and fish very soon ;) And bikes are the most effecient human transport ever.<br><br>The Victorians built bicycles with only steel, rubber and leather (starting to sound like a different forum for a moment). And while they invented asphalt roads, built many of gravel and stone first.<br><br>But they did use fossil fuel in their steel and rubber industries in the form of coal. So, our long term challenge (I'm with you on salvage for the next couple of decades) for bicycles in the ecotechnic future is producing steel and rubber without using fossil fuels at a price in terms of money or man hours that future organic farmers can afford.<br><br>Glenn,<br>Marrowstone Island<br><br><a href=#c838975498599736615 title="comment permalink">5/17/11, 7:07 AM</a><br><br>

I often think of JMG's notions about how we think with myths, and recognize the myth of a socially beneficent government that hobbles, IMO, most American's minds, in the face of much evidence that the government is no such thing, except around its edges from time to time.<br><br>Most peakists have no problem seeing through the myth of cornucopia, or the myth that humans are above and distinct from nature, both of which plague many in mainstream society and inhibit acceptance of peak oil, climate disruption, etc. <br><br>But myths about government-as-protector-and-helper seem to remain firmly in place across much of the environmental movement, including peak oil. If in fact government is not, as a general rule, teddy bear, but rather grizzly, then this has great potential to impact our efforts going forward in ways most are not thinking about.<br><br>Most people I know who have similar fears devolve into conspiracy thinking (truthers, chemtrails, HAARP mind control, etc - i.e. a shadowy cabal pulling all the puppet strings), which I do not (that's merely, IMO, an attempt to oversimplify things, and reduce anxiety by clinging to a false sense of certainty). <br><br>But I do think the levers of power are wrestled over and grasped by various elite factions to advance their pecuniary interests, which tend to be (though are not always) diametrically opposed to those of the average citizen (a truly brilliant, very scholarly analysis of this reality is Thomas Ferguson's 'Golden Rule: the Investment Theory of Party Competition'). But the outcome is effectively the same: growth of State power and attendant reduction in liberty and power among the citizenry (not that this is new, as Higgs' 'Crisis and Leviathan' shows). <br><br>And it's quite clear that the 'proles' are viewed as livestock or worse by those wielding those levers of power. I hardly think it could be clearer after the last few years that we exist for their benefit. We are a resource to be extracted. This, at least, is how it seems to me.<br><br>Without resorting to outright paranoia, I think it's important to discuss such concerns.

That's why I'm suggesting quantifying sustainability on a time-scale, because I think we are being hindered by this type of miscommunication.<br><br>When I say that you "focus on" an indefinitely sustainable technical society all I mean is that -it seems to me- when you discuss "sustainable society" that is what you mean, translated into my way of putting it.<br><br>As you write, you define sustainable society as one that will "not bring about its own demise". You leave out any indication of time scale which -to me- implies that you mean such a society would not self-destruct over an indefinite period.<br><br>I see sustainability differently. Similar to the vision that JMG details in The Ecotechnic Future. I see the indefinitely sustainable society as the "climax phase", akin to an old-growth forest here in Cascadia. But I also see other techno-social set-ups as sustainable within their own limited time scale, akin to the "seres" of various weeds, grasses, and shrubs, that inhabit a piece of the forest that has been disrupted before the trees can take back over.<br><br>For me the question of "is a sustainable society possible?" has been answered in the affirmative. Even if it is a society of hunter-gatherer bands employing stone, wood, grass, bone, sinew, and other wild materials for tools and living in caves and huts, SOME kind of Human Society is likely to last in some places on the globe as long as ANY medium-sized land-based omnivores can live anywhere at all.<br><br>I think more about the questions:<br><br>What sort of technics will societies have available to them tomorrow, next year, in a decade, in a century, in a millienium, etc.?<br><br>and,<br><br>How long can any of these possible technical societies be sustained in their various forms?<br><br>Which leads to:<br><br>What technics do we have available to us now? What will we likely have soon? What did we have before? Why don't we have it anymore? Can we recover it or adapt it to today's or tomorrow's needs? What amount of energy, skill, and complementary technics will be needed to maintain any of this? Can it be done and HOW can it be done?<br><br>And lastly:<br><br>Does any of this indicate that we can guide technical society and the transitions between types of such societies in any way on any scale (including just individual and family, a la Green Wizards)? If yes, what ways and scales would it be useful to work on first, second, third, etc.(i.e. if the project is a go, what is the work schedule)? <br><br>Do you recall our exchange a while back where I brought up the idea of "Simple Living Communities" supported in multiple ways by a broad groups of people who would only "dip their toe" in indefinitely sustainable living for the weekend or a vacation or whatever? I think that if such communities could be started, and if they could dedicate themselves to working out a sustainable system at increasing time-scales, then we would be taking a big step to answering your questions and mine.<br><br>-Matt<br><br><a href=#c6588805446453552985 title="comment permalink">5/17/11, 2:21 PM</a><br><br>

There's no other way to know -- thus a less rigorous definition would be useful. <br><br>Lucid, why is it that the sort of comment I made always seems to inspire Orwellian fantasies? That's as unnecessary as assuming that every collapse must be sudden and total. You might want to look up how the United States government under Franklin Roosevelt responded to a very serious economic collapse in the spring of 1933 as a counterexample. <br><br>Sofistek, yes, it's a way of striving for sustainability, but coupled with a recognition that there's no way to know whether you've got it or not until the passing years turn something up that you need to fix. It's rather like the logic of the scientific method: a scientific theory can never be proven, it just keeps on surviving attempts to disprove it. <br><br>Glenn, that's sensible enough -- and decent roads, on at least a small scale, can be built fairly easily. <br><br>Tracy, one of the reasons I've made a habit of living close in to downtown -- however big or small downtown happens to be -- is that the options for pedestrians tend to be better!<br><br>Remnant, I used to talk about it quite a bit when it was popular to insist on the inevitability of a fast and total crash. No, it doesn't amount to the imposition of a police state.

I've summarised to two points, just to capture the essentials: consuming any resource beyond its renewal rate is unsustainable, behaviour that degrades our habitat is unsustainable. Is there another explanation of sustainable, in which those axioms don't apply or in which there are further axioms that need to be followed? <br><br>So there is at least one aspect of a society that we can say is sustainable or not: its use of non-renewable resources, or resources that have a renewal rate measured in many human lifetimes. If the resource is consumed - i.e. it can't be reused in whole or in part, in the future - then a sustainable society can't make ongoing use of non-renewable resources. (By the way, I think a very low rate of consumption combined with recycling might enable the consumption of some non-renewable resources to be considered effectively sustainable.) The other aspects of sustainable living (consuming renewable resources and our behaviour's impact on the environment) are probably harder to determine and judgements and adjustments would have to be made on a continuous basis.<br><br>That still leaves me with no really clear idea of what a society that sticks to these axioms might look like.<br><br><a href=#c4301574012785987939 title="comment permalink">5/17/11, 10:05 PM</a><br><br>

I used to involve myself in various political forums of the libertarian persuasion, and the discussion here reminds me a bit of the debates (and often flame wars) between minarchists and anarchists. The point then, which may apply now, was that I realized we as a society are so far from either of those - living in a wholly Statist society - that the finer points of minimal-State vs no-State didn't really matter. Moving rapidly toward a less centralized, State-dominated society was something everyone pretty much agreed on, although the hard core anarchists had a very hard time with even agreeing on that much, so 'pure' was their vision. In fact, this sort of puritanism, if you will, was why the anarchist community officially rejected Murray Bookchin, the ecological pioneer, when he suggested that neighborhood assemblies in a participatory democratic mode should be the primary source of political power, and he felt this was in line with the tenets of classical anarchism.<br><br>In my view, this is an example of allowing the great to be the enemy of the good.<br><br>I think the same thing can be said here.

Further, I have entered into dialogue with folks that believe these things and I have concluded that, in every single instance, they either assume premises based on faith instead of evidence, or the logic which follows from their premises is flawed or faulty. In those cases, it seems pretty clear to me that the critical thinking needed to establish such beliefs as probable is lacking.<br><br>As for the shadowy cabal, I gave a source which does a terrific job of dismantling that case (Ferguson's book). <br><br>So what I am saying is simply that these beliefs appear to me - based on a fairly rigorous analysis IMO - amount to the result of magical thinking, and that a good solid logical case has not been made for them. They fail the tests of logic, and so I am comfortable rejecting them on that basis, unless and until a solid case is made.<br><br>It's similar to how I think about Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.<br><br>But, then you mentioned a 'banking cabal' - well, by definition, the Federal Reserve Bank is a banking *cartel*. That's not a matter of logic, but of fact. Is it a cabal? i.e. a 'secret group of plotters'? You could probably characterize it as such, inasmuch as many of its creators hid their identities on the way to the secret meeting at JP Morgan's island at which the Fed was planned. Sounds pretty cabalistic to me. Passes the smell test. Read 'The Creature from Jekyll Island' for more.<br><br>And what we now know about the modern day banking cartel - as exposed by Matt Taibbi and others - looks exceedingly cabalistic to me as well. A conspiracy to move debt off the backs of the banks and onto the backs of taxpayers seems to be exactly what happened. Again, this easily passes the smell test.<br><br>Overall, it's a matter of using logic properly and accounting for confirmation bias as best we can. The way I think of 'conspiracy theorists' is people who generally 1) start with conclusions and work their way back to premises, often making the logic 'fit' via fallacy and selectivity, and 2) do not account for confirmation bias.<br><br>I try to 1) start with premises, test those premises, then reason my way to a conclusion, and examine my reasoning for flaws, and 2) account for confirmation bias. But I'm human and am aware that my brain is susceptible to illogic and confirmation bias in subtle ways. So the main difference, as I see it, is that I do not claim to 'know' - I think in terms of levels of confidence or probability. As such I would never say 'the US government didn't blow up the Twin Towers' but rather, 'it seems very, very unlikely to me that the US government did so.'<br><br>So in this case, I am not so much dismissing something "out of hand" (i.e. without due consideration) as saying 'I've spent time and mental energy considering that possibility and I've come to the conclusion it's improbable and I'm moving on.'<br><br>Hope that answers your question. :)<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=#c2834921814822031418 title="comment permalink">5/18/11, 7:13 AM</a><br><br>

I live in a tiny apartment in the centre of Dublin. I have a well paid, secure as it gets, government job. Me and my partner are both in negative equity (2 separate properties) and may well remain so for the rest of our lives to be honest. There are no houses with more than postage stamp gardens within cycling distance of my job (at least none that i could afford to buy (if we did ever get out of neg eq) or rent). I could find somewhere on public transport routes but I've watched them here continuously hike prices and cut routes even before they started bailing out the banks. I can only imagine how much of a priority affordable public transport will be when/if we do default, which may well happen sooner rather than later, so i don't want to rely on it. <br><br>I'm paying off my small personal debt as fast as I can and have built up a nice library of useful books as recommended on this blog and elsewhere. My next project is learning soap making. I've grown things on my balcony for years. Can't get an allotment because there aren't any that i can get to during the week or without a car. I'd love to move out of the city and get my garden but I can't believe that it would be a good idea to ever quit my job, although given the state of Ireland i fully expect that decision to be made for me at some point. It's not just great money, I also really like the job and there's nowhere else that I can do it.

The world will end – for you – inevitably. In every case. And they all say you can’t take it with you. So – do you grab all the gusto no matter who you skewer in the process? Do you try to grab what you feel you deserve, again no matter who gets ripped off? This is a decision each person makes, consciously or unconsciously. <br><br>I respect your attempts to look for the most sustainable future, and yet, most of that is out of our hands (due to population, other people’s choices, etc.) Since there is no perfectly sustainable society, nor any way to negotiate with Death, how do you choose to live? Only you can make that decision for yourself. I have looked at my role models and have consciously chosen to reduce my participation in a consumer society, for many reasons. But my reasons might not be yours. Keep asking, keep observing, and you will find you have made many of these decisions as you continue to live. Maybe I’m giving too philosophical an answer to your concrete question, but at 55, I’ve realized all my best attempts have been like a tiny drop in a large ocean.<br><br><a href=#c4791102633047261587 title="comment permalink">5/18/11, 11:07 AM</a><br><br>

Further, we're talking about a permanent emergency, and one national/global in scope - so past responses to regional afflictions like earthquakes and hurricanes may not be analogous. <br><br>I don't find the notion that the goal of politicians is in fact to run society in an inexpensive and efficient way to be persuasive. The current set of powers-that-be in America are running our own society in a highly inefficient and expensive way, accruing ever more power to themselves in the process, and show no signs of backing off. This is in response to a national/global crisis, note. We are no longer the nation we were in 1933.<br><br>Of course, if you look at efficiency from the standpoint of efficient redistribution of wealth to those in the top of the pyramid, we're a veritable model of efficiency! This should make us think, IMO. I think that's how the 'algorithm' of our political system works, without any need for conscious 'conspiracies' to accomplish it.<br><br>In fact, across U.S. history, what one finds is not so much an accrual of power when facing crisis (manufactured as often as not), followed by a relinquishment of it, but rather a 'ratchet effect' whereby power is acquired, and then only a portion of it surrendered, repeated iteratively such that the net trend is always up. And in fact, this is what is compellingly argued in Higgs' 'Crisis and Leviathan.' <br><br>It is this pattern that concerns me. I could easily foresee, for example, nationalization, or 'Sovietization' of organic farms once the industrial ag system falters and a growing percentage of people go hungry - IF the current political system is still around by that point. From this perspective then, backyard gardens become even more crucial.<br><br>This is why I think dispelling political myths is as important as dispelling those in the ecological realm.<br><br>All that said, I am convinced that the only viable way forward to an individual or family remains: to use LESS, while building backyard gardens, building community, and adding new and potentially useful hand-skills to one's repertoire.<br><br>- Oz<br><br><a href=#c8526756024924876660 title="comment permalink">5/18/11, 11:35 AM</a><br><br>

Not a particularly happy time, though it gave me some stories. As you suggest, there'll always be taxes, so there'll always be taxmen of a kind.<br><br>As JMG has pointed out many times, you're not necessarily in a bad place; urban life is very energy-efficient, and Dublin has been a vibrant city since long before the oil age; I imagine it will be one long into the post-oil descent as well.<br><br>I think we in these forums can get over-fixated on the "growing our own food" concept. I'm starting to do it because I live in a semi-rural area with access to a large garden. You don't have such access, so your balcony is the best you can do. <br><br>Instead, consider pre-oil society. Think about the ways in which people made a living. Do any of these appeal to you? Peasant farmer isn't my number one choice, not by a long shot. That's why I'm training up in healthcare techniques that don't use pharmaceuticals. Read up on the history of Dublin: even those Viking Jarls had specialised tax collectors, and I bet those guys didn't grow their own food. Soap-making is well and good, as long as it's something you could enjoy doing to earn a living, and you know what your supply chain would be.

The Oil Drum article mentions, but glosses over, the fact that a severe recession (that may not really be over) has had an impact. JMG has mentioned double counting, also. However, with the world population growing at about 70 million per year and countries desperate to get economic growth moving again, even a plateau, never mind gentle decline, is a huge impediment to business as usual. And if the attempt at growth starts to tear society apart, oil declines may be punctuated by sudden lost production, i.e. it may not be a steady decline but a ragged decline.<br><br>Jason,<br><br>Thanks for the link. I haven't read Ostrom. Though it doesn't sound like what I'm after, it looks like an interesting read and I've added it to my wishlist. In looking for it on a local book site, I also came across, <i> <br>Sustainability or Collapse?: An Integrated History and Future of People on Earth (Dahlem Workshop Reports)</i>, which looks like it might cover some of the arguments here.

To be honest, I can't see myself turning my back on all I've been trying to do and I do think it's both the morally right thing to do and the only real response to the predicament the human race is now in. However, there are still plenty of moments when I want to throw in the towel and there's still a slight chance that I could do so, if someone could convince me that sustainability is unachievable. Luckily, or not, my conviction that it is possible is still quite strong.<br><br><a href=#c8737995333233258079 title="comment permalink">5/18/11, 4:25 PM</a><br><br>
