I walk half a mile through a chill autumn morning to the bleak little cinderblock building that serves the old mill town where I live as a train station. Wednesdays aren’t usually busy, but close to a dozen other passengers are waitinge before the train pulls up. I climb on board, stash my duffel bag above my seat, get my ticket punched, and then head forward to the lounge car. By the time we roll past Oldtown, where the Shawnee once had a major village, I’m perched at a downstairs table with a cup of tea, some Latin reference books, and the draft translation of a Renaissance handbook on the art of memory, proving (if there was any lingering doubt) that there are non-computer geeks as well.<br><br>The train rolls to a halt in Washington a little after noon, ahead of schedule. I shoulder my duffel and head through milling crowds into the cavernous magnificence of Union Station, then back out into bright sunlight. A few minutes later I’ve reached the hotel. It’s one of those grim concrete-and-steel excrescences that justify the claim that Americans have their sense of proportion surgically removed at birth. Not long afterward I’m stepping into the faux-comfy bleakness of the generic hotel room I’ll be sharing for four nights with someone I’ve never met.<br><br>I have a few hours to kill—enough time to unpack, visit the hotel fitness center for a good long t’ai chi practice, shower, and replace traveling clothes with something that blends in a bit more with my current surroundings. Later I’ll be meeting a friend for dinner, and later still there’ll be a reception. I check the paper copy of my script, make sure the thumb drive with the PowerPoint half of the presentation is in a convenient place. I’m here for work, as an attendee and presenter at the seventh annual conference of ASPO-USA, the American branch of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil.<br><br><div style="text-align: center">*********<br></div><br>Meanwhile, a few thousand miles to the east, the economic system of a continent is coming apart at the seams. During the boom times now fading in history’s rearview mirror, the nation of Greece borrowed heavily to pay its bills, and found no shortage of banks willing to ante up the funds. Now that boom has given way to bust, Greece can’t meet its payments. In the ordinary way of things, Greece would simply default on its debt, and the banks would suffer from what economists call “market discipline;” that is to say, they would take massive losses, and some would go under.<br><br>The first commandment of modern high finance, though, is that investors must be protected from the consequences of even their most stupid decisions. Instead of defaulting, accordingly, Greece has been pressured by the rest of Europe to accept one round of massive budget cuts after another, in exchange for just enough money to keep default at bay a little longer. The latest arrangement brokered by the French and German governments includes cuts so sweeping that Greece’s prime minister George Papandreou, returning home, decides to put the matter to a popular referendum.<br><br>It seems reasonable enough that in a democratic nation—which Greece is, at least in theory—the people ought to have at least some say in any arrangement so burdensome. This logic does not impress the <a href=http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2011/1106/Eurozone-A-new-politburo-forms>unelected junta</a> that effectively runs the European Union these days. By the time the ASPO conference is over, Papandreou is forced to retract his proposal, and is on his way out of a job. Meanwhile, European banks <a href=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/nov/08/europe-banks-retreat-into-mini-crunch>are dumping government bonds</a> as fast as they can, Italy is in increasing trouble, and <a href=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8875444/France-cuts-frantically-as-Italy-nears-debt-spiral.html>France is probably next</a>.<br><br><div style="text-align: center">*********<br></div><br>Thursday morning, after an early breakfast, I head up the street to the US Capitol. The opening session will be held at the, or more likely a, Capitol auditorium. This is part of a maze of underground rooms beneath the plaza in front of the Capitol; we file through an airport-style security checkpoint, follow a guide through spaces that would not seem out of place in a midrange hotel in Pittsburgh, and end up taking seats in what looks unnervingly like a pricey suburban movie house.<br><br>Conferences, I have learned, follow one of two models, which might be called the Chautauqua model and the circus model. The Chatauqua model—does anyone these days remember the old Chatauqua shows? Communities across nineteenth-century America built large meeting halls and brought in lecturers to speak in them. Every week or so, outside of planting and harvest time, you could count on an evening lecture at the Chautaqua hall on any subject you cared to imagine; after some entertainment and a bit of speechifying, the lecturer would spend an hour or two talking about Arctic exploration or electricity or, well, just about anything, followed by a lively question and answer session.<br><br>Conferences on the Chautauqua model follow a similar pattern. Individual speakers get 90 minute slots, an hour to talk and half an hour to field questions, so there’s ample time to get into details and engage the audience. Conferences on the circus model, on the other hand, have panels of speakers with fifteen or twenty minutes each, and maybe a few questions at the very end; the man on the flying trapeze gets his fifteen minutes of fame, and then it’s on to the clowns or the dancing bears; the famous names are under the big tent, while lesser performers are sideshow acts. Most conferences I attend outside the peak oil world follow the Chautauqua model, but ASPO follows the circus model.<br><br>In the Capitol auditorium, of course, we’re all in the big tent. ASPO’s ringmaster—er, executive director—and the head of the board say a few words, so do the two Congressmen who’ve taken the time to show up, and then it’s on to the major names. Chris Skrebowski, former editor of one of the oil industry’s main trade publications; William Catton Jr., whose 1980 book <i>Overshoot</i> is still far ahead of most other publications on the subject; Jeff Rubin, former chief economist for Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce—that’s the first lineup. Skrebowski is precise, Catton measured and thoughtful, Rubin breezy; he sounds a bit like an aging California surfer, which makes an odd fit with his message, which is basically that in the absence of cheap fossil fuels, the global economy is screwed.<br><br>There’s a break, and then the next lineup follows—Richard Heinberg, Chris Martenson, Angelina Galiteva, Roger Bezdek. It’s all pretty much variations on a common theme. The next to last is an exception; she’s a California bureaucrat who insists airily that there’s nothing to worry about because alternative energy can easily pick up the slack. She gets asked at the end about the huge and arguably unavailable volumes of rare earth elements and other scarce resources a major buildout of alternative energy tech would require, and evades the question with practiced ease.<br><br>That’s how the rest of the day goes. There are some memorable talks, but those who read the peak oil blogosphere have already heard most of it. A fair number of people skip one or more panels and head for the lobby or the bar, where the real action generally seems to be.<br><br><div style="text-align: center">*********<br></div><br>Meanwhile, a few hundred miles north, <a href=http://fritztucker.blogspot.com/2011/11/american-autumn-pt-3.html>uncomfortable news</a> is beginning to filter back from the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) protest in New York City. Despite the loud rhetoric of participatory democracy, control of the half million dollars or so of money donated to the protest has been eased into the hands of an unelected committee. Those pushing this arrangement insist that this is because OWS can’t make decisions effectively; this claim is all the more curious in that some of these same people are among those who pushed OWS to adopt the consensus system that’s preventing it from making decisions effectively.<br><br>Those of us who are familiar with the professionalization of dissent in recent decades have seen the same process at work countless times. Call it coercive consensus: the manipulation of the forms of consensus to enable a faction with an agenda to take control of a large but unfocused movement. It’s become the standard model for organizing a protest on the American left these days, and is a core reason why the American left has accomplished so little in the decades since that model came into fashion.<br><br>The justification for consensus you usually hear these days is that consensus prevents the majority from dominating a minority. This is true since, as <a href=http://libcom.org/library/consensus-its-discontents>a handful of activists</a> have pointed out, consensus allows a minority to dominate the majority. Given standard democratic methods, a gathering of people with common concerns can choose its leaders, set its agenda, make decisions the majority supports, prevent those decisions from being endlessly reconsidered, and get things done. Coercive consensus stymies all these; it’s all but impossible for a consensus-run group to remove even the most manipulative moderator, stop a power grab, or make a decision that won’t be revisited any time it suits the controlling minority to do so.<br><br>By the time the ASPO conference is over, the first whispers of these difficulties have started to spread through the peak oil scene. What will happen in the months to come is anyone’s guess, but promising movements time and time again have been hijacked by such methods and reduced to irrelevance.<br><br><div style="text-align: center">*********<br></div><br>My roommate is Guy Dauncey, an environmental activist from British Columbia. Attendees who learn that the two of us are sharing a room go wide-eyed and start to giggle, because the ASPO staff would have had a hard time finding two speakers whose ideas are further apart. Guy believes that a green and prosperous world with abundant alternative energy is within our grasp. Still, he’s a likeable man, and we easily find other subjects to talk about when we’re not either asleep or busy at the conference.<br><br>We are both presenting on Friday, and the big top is hopping all morning; Guy’s slot comes in a plenary session on alternative energy right before lunch. His presentation blends enthusiastic claims about solar power with Teilhard de Chardin evolutionary mysticism and an insistence that people like me, who suggest that the hard realities of our situation predict a much less genial future for which we need to get ready, are among the main obstacles to bringing his happy future world into being. It’s hardly the first time this argument has been directed my way; I don’t take it any more personally than he takes my jab, later on, at grandiose projects drawn up without reference to the limits of the real world.<br><br>After lunch and a rambling speech by eco-farming proponent Wes Jackson, it’s sideshow time, and my session gets under way. It’s on local and community responses to peak oil; that wasn’t what I’d planned to speak about, but the ASPO staff assign speakers to panels by a logic all their own. For all that, it‘s a good panel. Aaron Newton talks about his experience coordinating a local farming program in the rural South. Peter Kilde presents the findings of a task force trying to help poor people and the organizations that serve them get ready for the end of the age of cheap energy. I sketch out the lessons of the 1970s energy crisis for the present. Naomi Davis, an African-American community organizer, comes last, and steals the show with a report on her program to reinvent Chicago neighborhoods as self-supporting and self-governing urban villages. It’s the one really innovative thing I encounter in any of the panels, and deserves the enthusiastic applause it gets.<br><br>That evening is Speakers’ Dinner, and a bona fide fanboy moment for me. William Catton is there, of course, and I nervously approach him, say a little about how much <i>Overshoot</i> meant to me, and ask if he’d likea copy of my latest peak oil book, <i>The Wealth of Nature</i>. He graciously accepts, and then flummoxes me completely by offering me a copy of his new book <i>Bottleneck</i>. We talk for around a quarter of an hour. I do my best not to act like a 14-year-old <i>Twilight</i> fan who meets the actor that plays the sparkly vampire, but that’s basically how I feel the whole time; few books influenced me as powerfully as <i>Overshoot</i>, and anyone familiar with Catton’s ideas can find them easily enough right down at the foundations of most of mine.<br><br><div style="text-align: center">*********<br></div><br>Meanwhile, in the south of France, the much-ballyhooed G-20 summit meeting is lurching toward what even the mainstream media admit is complete failure. The financial crisis in Europe is <a href=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,796280,00.html>the focus of discussion</a>, but nobody seems to be able to come up with any response to the widening spiral of trouble. Reports claim that US officials are pressuring Europe to flood the markets with freshly printed euros; the dire implications of such a step are clearly of less interest to the Obama administration than the impact of a Eurozone fiscal collapse on the American economy, and thus on Obama’s fading reelection prospects.<br><br>Meanwhile another head of state, China’s Hu Jintao, has quietly taken center stage. It has been a little over a decade since the old G-7, the exclusive club of core industrial economies, was forced to open its doors to a baker’s dozen of rising powers This time, Hu moves and speaks with the assurance proper to the leader of the world’s next great power. It doesn’t hurt that 200 miles overhead, the Chinese space program has <a href=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8872196/Chinas-huge-leap-forward-into-space-threatens-US-ascendancy-over-heavens.html>pulled off another impressive feat</a>, docking an unmanned Shenzhou space capsule with Tiangong 1, China’s equivalent to Skylab and Mir and the next step in the Chinese march into space.<br><br>The European press spends the days before the G-20 meeting feverishly speculating about the hope that China might bail Europe out of its widening crisis. Nothing of the kind happens, of course; the Chinese would be fools to accept that role this early in the game, and they are anything but. If a bailout offer comes from China at all, it will be much later, when European leaders are desperate enough to accept help on almost any terms, and it will come with a hefty price tag of China’s choosing. By the time the ASPO conference is over, Europe’s heads of state are heading home to a cheerless welcome.<br><br><div style="text-align: center">*********<br></div><br>For an imperial capital, Washington DC is surprisingly pedestrian-friendly, and I have no problem making my way Sunday afternoon to a lunch appointment with friends. Saturday was anticlimax; I was on two panels for which apparently nobody did any planning or preparation at all, and which proceeded to ramble aimlessly for their alloted time. Thereafter everything more or less ground to a halt, except for conversations among those who weren’t leaving quite yet.<br><br>I head through Chinatown, thinking of conversations over the days just past. I’ve had long talks about the prospects for sail transport, rail lines, and streetcars, with people who know these technologies inside and out; I’ve spent time with some old friends and several new ones, met more of the regular readers of <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, and been asked for advice by younger attendees who, I’m startled and then amused to notice, seem to approach me with pretty much the same diffidence I felt approaching William Catton. It’s more than that, though: this is as close as we have just now to a gathering of the tribe.<br><br>There’s a passage from Hermann Hesse’s novel <i>Demian</i> that is on my mind as I walk the streets of this city of faltering empire in this bright November sunlight. Emil Sinclair, the narrator, has come to recognize himself as one of a diffuse and disparate group—call it a circle, an order, a tribe—marked by something half-seen and half spiritual that can be glimpsed in the faces of those who share it. What unites them is not an ideology or an organization, but an orientation toward time, toward the future. The unmarked people around them live their lives in relation to the world as it is, but the ones who wear the mark in their faces are oriented toward a world that does not yet exist.<br><br>The friends I meet for lunch have the mark in their faces, and we spend a pleasant couple of hours over burgers and tall glasses of craft beer, talking about beekeeping and brewing and other useful skills for the aftermath of the age of cheap abundant energy. Not long after I’m climbing aboard the train that will take me back home. As the Washington suburbs roll by, I get another cup of tea, but the translation will have to wait for another time; I get out my reading glasses and settle down to read my signed copy of <i>Bottleneck</i>. I am still reading it when the train arrives at my station three hours later. While I have been away, humanity has extracted another 378,000,000 barrels of crude oil, 56,2500,000 tons of coal, and 36,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas out of the planet’s steadily depleting reserves.

So we have now completed a story which takes place just on the other side of the "Peak", when people are starting to realize that something big is wrong, but not many people understand just what it is. It could be five years from now, it might be last week. <br><br>We intend to continue the story for quite awhile, but for purposes of the Archdruid's call for fiction, our entry is what appears on the site right now: a Prelude, plus Chapters 1-3. Counting some words inside the artwork, this is about 6000 words.<br><br>We will supply a mailing address to you, JMG, in a mail to your blog contact e-mail.<br><br>We hope you all enjoy our illustrated tale. Thanks to JMG for the opportunity! Now that we have finished frantically cranking out 6000 words, we look forward to reading the other entries!<br><br><a href=gathering-of-tribe.html#c619737332792005318 title="comment permalink">11/9/11, 8:06 PM</a><br><br>

It was my third ASPO USA Conference. I thoroughly enjoyed it but I share you feelings that it is too rushed with short presentations and loses strength as a result. I may skip it next year unless world events convince me to go back once more.<br><br>I am not convinced that moving ASPO headquarters and meetings to Washington is of that much value. The political class is not going to ever address anything that goes beyond the next election and our best responses are going to be at the local and family level. <br><br>Looking forward to your future posts.<br><br><a href=gathering-of-tribe.html#c1786518250733623929 title="comment permalink">11/9/11, 8:25 PM</a><br><br>

While I like your usual deep essays, this weekend journal was so much more interesting because of the personal touches. Perhaps you could at some future time write a post around a more typical week at home.<br><br>I followed the ASPO conference from afar via The Oil Drum and Energy Bulletin, also the Europeans and to a lesser degree the Occupy shenanigans. <br><br>Meanwhile, I made a substantial investment in a welded steel broadfork, FedExed from the West Coast to my house in Nebraska. I tried it out today and it was as useful in deep aeration as advertised.

Where we're going is kind of remote; there's some motivation to bring along whatever we expect to "need", i.e. make good use of. So we've been exposed to the full-on roaring engine of the consumer culture, the endless procession of little (and big) car-capsules to giant parking lots to collect more and more of China's obscene overproduction. A scene we generally avoid. <br><br>It's kind of depressing on the whole, because most of the goods are cheap and shoddy. All the furniture we bought was used and several years old, from thrift stores and craigslist and so on; we did look at some new stuff, even though we can't afford it -- but our conclusion was "Who'd want it anyway?" Even when pricey it's kind of ugly and basically cr*p -- substantiation, as if one needed it, for JMG's earlier riff on resource scarcity being expressed as a continuous downgrading of quality in mfrd goods.<br><br>The other thing it was, is deeply unsettlingly terrifying. Costco is terrifying. So is Home De(s)pot, Rona, Canadian Tire, Sears, Zellers, all the big chains. It is downright scary, the giant floor-to-ceiling warehouses absolutely stuffed with Stuff. Sensory overload of sheer Product. The manic mobs of shoppers. The giant SUVs and monster trucks jockeying for the closest parking spaces (I perversely park at the distant perimeter).<br><br>You can hear Ross Perot's "great sucking sound", but it's the last sweet crude on Earth being slurped up through a big fat straw. And ugh, dammit, we're (for the nonce) part of it! Last week we also consumed our share of those millions of bbl of oil and so on. And I exercised those comparison shopping skills that we were all taught from childhood on, marched around in retail spaces like I was born there -- yuck! Most of us from the affluent cores know our way by instinct around Big Retail. It's "our habitat", and that's sickening when I stop to think about it, that 90 pct of us don't know one mushroom from another and can't find our way around a provincial park without trail maps, yet we know where to find the tool department in any bigbox. The rituals and geographical conventions of retail are so familiar, almost comforting in a way, like that first nice warm shot of booze... [shudder]<br><br>All I can say is that we're trying to stop, or at least to taper off, before the supply dries up and withdrawal kicks in for real. But those last couple of lines of your journal resonated so strongly for me. It's scary, incredible, mindboggling to witness the energy being squandered, 24x7x365, and the efforts being made all around to encourage *more* squandering, more spending, more buying, Moremoremore. Like there's no tomorrow. It beggars description. "Dear god, this cannot end well," have I got the quotation right?<br><br><a href=gathering-of-tribe.html#c9155208905736400087 title="comment permalink">11/9/11, 9:51 PM</a><br><br>

Nice to have some unexpected change in MO every once in a while. <br><br>I finished reading "The Glass Bead Game" recently. It has been on the shelf above my desk along with about 20 other books that have all been patiently waiting to be read. It's been there for a while. I started reading it a few years ago but quit 100 pages in because I wasn't ready for it. So thanks, I finished it because of your suggestion (started from page 1). It's now sitting next to "Beneath the Wheel," and "The Journey to the East," where it belongs. I've read Damien,and Siddhartha but they seem to be missing from my collection? They must be just among the many I have loaned out never to see again.<br><br>I must say that "The Three Lives" from Joseph Knecht's Posthumous Writings at the end of the novel were what I enjoyed the most. I can see parallels with Hesse in your own written thoughts. He's always been one of the most influential authors for me. It all started my junior year of high school when I read "Siddhartha," I had no idea who the Buddha was at the time, nor Hesse.<br><br>Lastly, I recently read "Apocalypse Not." Thank you for writing it. It really resonated with me and once again, thanks to you, assisted me beyond some things I had been stuck on. I read it straight through without stopping...I couldn't stop. I read "Galactic Alignment" several years ago and was unable to find the flaw in it. So thanks for settin' me straight. Your work is invaluable. Apocalypse Not. A riff on Apocalypse Now? My blog is Epiphany Now. <br><br>I hope I don't sound like a Twilight Fan, but then you are what the Author of Bottleneck is to you to me. I suppose it comes with the territory.

I am involved with Quakers and familiar with consensus because that language is used in a secular context to describe what Quakers often do in decision-making; and because I have encountered professional activists through mutual interests. Julia Cameron has written that good criticism feels like a relief, and your comments have had that effect on me. <br>I am interested in how my church can make good (better!) decisions, particularly in the weak areas you point out. Belonging in community locally has something of the challenges of marriage in it - perhaps in contrast the oil age offered an enticing illusion of escape from interdependence, and the necessity for confronting the consequences of our decisions and actions? I have been meditating for a while now on a reflection from <a href=../../2010/01/this-presupposition-of-passivity.html rel=nofollow>a point you wrote about previously</a> - what might a healthy, explicit, principle of authority look like in some of the groups I am part of? I'd be interested to hear more of your thoughts on that, if it fits into your plan for a future series of posts.<br>As I understand it from my christian language, the principle of authority would be "The Holy Spirit"; &amp; a "seasoned Friend", in Quaker terms, - someone who has done a lot of their own work with God - might have an increased chance of expressing it? Perhaps the more explicit we can be in a group about how we understand that, the better we can be accountable to it, and hence functional in carrying out the great changes required of us.<br><br><a href=gathering-of-tribe.html#c196632069151172325 title="comment permalink">11/9/11, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

They are the ones that aren't conforming to societies norms. The cool kids are well and truly stuck in their play pens and thinking about the next status symbol they're trying to attain - with no end in sight.<br><br>Access to half a million or so dollars with no strings attached is too much of a temptation for some I fear. Perhaps also the organisational situation developing with the occupy movement is a reflection of your own society and its organisation? I'd also suggest if this is happening then they are lost before they have even started. I remember that the Sea Shepherd captain (much respect) complained about a similar thing with Greenpeace.<br><br>It is a strange state of affairs when gardening with open pollinated heirloom vegetables is considered to be a subversive activity!<br><br>I've come across quite a few people (males mostly) who state that the movie "Ferris Buellers Day Off" is their favourite film. It's an escape fantasy, but it's also very telling about societies desires.<br><br>In the exact same way and in a strange coincidence at about the same time, the whole departure from reality that was the whole Morning in America thing was also an escape fantasy, and therein lies its appeal for the masses.<br><br>However, it was funded on debt. Someone had to pay and it was collectively decided that it would be the future generations. Yes, you are all responsible for selling them off and continuing to do so.<br><br>The difficulty with debt is that it doesn't go away without major societal difficulties. But at some point if the charade is kept up the ability to service that debt exceeds the income of that household. What happens then is beyond me.<br><br>PS: I'm a fan of microbreweries. You never know what amazing tastes you'll end up with. They're not all good, but some are pure genius!<br><br>PPS: I'd like to see how long the lovely lady who was suggesting that renewables in California had a big future would be able to live in my house!

The title of your post outweighs the disappointing, if unsurprising, report on ASPO. The hard work today is not in building the future, but preparing a culture that can handle this fundamental shift in expectations and experiences. That to me seems to be the most important work of the peak oil tribe broadly conceived. <br><br>It doesn't really matter if someone in that tribe promotes non-sense ideas about green technology and renewable energy.

Mir was a multi-module space station very similar in plan and complexity to the current International Space Station. Skylab and Tiagong 1 were/are both monobloc stations; the Soviet equivalent would be the 70s-era Salyut program.<br><br>http://www.astronautix.com/project/salyut.htm<br><br><a href=gathering-of-tribe.html#c1484081852293538037 title="comment permalink">11/10/11, 11:12 AM</a><br><br>

Consensus can work, but it can also be abused, and the coercive consensus I've discussed is what happens when it's turned into a systematic method of exercising unearned authority over other people.

To phrase it somewhat more more basely, why has it become associated with hippies? (I know, but it's the perception). I mean, it's fundamentally a scientific issue, is it not? What does that mean? Why should a topic that should be hard science become an attractor of such a diverse group of people, including some with no scientific expertise and social grudges (I'm thiking of folks like Mike Ruppert here). I'll answer my own question:<br><br>Criticisms of industrialism go back to it's very beginnings, from Blake's satanic mills, to Tolkien's scouring of the Shire. The criticisms of what industrialism unleashed have become all the more pointed as the system is becoming more and more dysfunctional and oppressive. What Peak Oil proposes is that all of this may be undone by removing the central fuel that makes it all possible, depriving it of oxygen, as it were. I think there is as much hope as science in the movement. People upset with the social order and want something else hope this is the opportunity to get it. For better or worse, modern society has been built on cheap energy, and that includes all the ugly parts. For people who don't like the ugly parts, Peak Oil seems to offer deliverance.<br><br>Which is not to say that A non-scientific perspective is not valuable. Indeed, it is essential. One of the reasons I like this blog is it brings a humanities perspective to the discussions of resource scarcity, e.g. history, economics and philosophy, which is so often missing. I suspect the people who see a painless transformation to a glorious and fair post-carbon economy ahead (such as your erstwhile roommate) know a lot about technology but little about history or human nature. That's also a criticism of Singularity prophets - they know a lot about technology, and think society should work as simply and elegantly as the machines they build. Not so. Look at the utopian dreaming the car engendered versus the reality for a demonstration of that. If pure technology were the only limitation, we <i>would</i> have houses on the moon. I'm sure you've reminded people that the Ancient Greeks had the capacity to build steam engines, but they didn't because they had plenty of slaves.<br><br>P.S. For those not familiar with it: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy rel=nofollow>The Iron Law of Oligarchy</a><br><br>P.P.S. I've heard in some interviews that J.H. Kunstler's forthcoming book is to be entitled "Too Much Magic." I don't know if your recent columns have been in response to that or merely a coincidence, but you may want to school him on what magic really is, or convince him to change the title.

Organizing a group to get something done is a talent that not everyone has. Those who have it can make it work to everyone's benefit by being near the top of a hierarchy, where organizing the work makes it easier for those lower down to do their jobs.

The local gas station has no diesel at all and no idea when they will have it, and I'm way out in the country so it's not like we can go to the next station down the way and see if they have anything. There's gasoline, but I'm driving the diesel truck while my husband is away working (ironically, in the oil field, where he is modifying his usual routine in order to save some of the diesel they burn so profligately while drilling for natural gas). The shortage is not expected to ease off for another month or so, and I suspect things will get rather interesting in the meantime.

It occured to me that the latter reflects the hyper-complex, bloated, plodding society we've become; the former, the leaner, more efficient society we perhaps could have chosen - not trying to be all things to all people. Free and open source is nice as well. While it's a bit buggy, I'm adjusting well (I used to be a unix/OS2 guy), I like the plethora of open source apps available, and that there wasn't a bunch of useless junk pre-installed. With Windows, I found myself always trying to de-complexify the system, getting unneeded "infrastructure" out of the way. With Umbuntu I'm adding just the carefully selected tools as needed, trying to preserve the capable but minimalist nature of the system. <br><br>The mITX platform I'm using is designed to be "ultra durable", using more copper to dissipate heat, and the tiny case it fits in is an antithesis to the giant, power hungry gaming boxes of today; sort of a laptop in a box. Not needing the portability of a laptop or tablet, and tired of trying to dispose of (not so) old, unrepairable laptops, I feel this idea of an efficient, upgradable, tiny system has merit. The power supply I'm using is a 95 watt, 12(6-34) VDC direct, used in <a href=http://store.mp3car.com/M3_ATX_HV_95_Watt_Smart_Automotive_Power_Supply_p/pwr-035.htm rel=nofollow>"carputers"</a>, and the little touchscreen monitor is designed for automotive use (12 volt as well), found at a swap meet. <br><br>I know this stuff is a bit off-topic; just thought it could be useful to those trying to cope with the power-down thing while maintaining certain advantages/capabilities. I hate aquiring things that I have no hope of repairing myself and that have a limited lifespan built in. I'm focussing on stuff that runs on 12 volt DC (my shortwave, LED lighting, even my dog clippers) as it is a well-tested, low power standard, batteries will likely be available, and it is compatable with PV.<br><br><a href=gathering-of-tribe.html#c6942286844497494895 title="comment permalink">11/11/11, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

It sounds like you enjoyed DC. I have lived here for the past 6 years as a member of the Ohio economic diaspora. In that time I have met a lot of nice people from all over. The only knock I'll give it is a lack of neighborliness due to the quick turnover of residents. But no place is perfect!<br><br>I particularly enjoyed your description of the 'loose circle' of folks who are peak-oil aware. The impending difficulties of our collective future permeate my every thought. It has become part of who I am. Nowadays, I occasionally recognize it in others, too. As you say, it manifests itself as 'something half-seen and half spiritual that can be glimpsed in the faces of those who share it.' It gives credence to the saying that 'it takes one to know one.' <br><br>I cracked up when you described meeting William Catton in person. I would react similarly - 'Overshoot' was very influential on me too. Having said that, I'd probably go all 'fanboy' on you too; your books are just as influential on my generation as his were on yours. <br><br>Finally - as an urban planner myself, I'm encouraged by Naomi Davis's work as you describe it.

Another potential problem is that the movement might get highjacked by what I call "anarcho-kiddies", who are basically the loud-mouthed, miserably-alienated, nihilistic bullies on the very far left. Anyone who has been to a few left-oriented demonstrations will recognize them as the adenoidal young people who wear bandana-kerchiefs over the lower part of their faces along with other "radical-chic" affectations. That there has been an awful lot of theft occuring at the main camp in New York City doesn't help create an effective, cohesive movement, either.<br><br><a href=gathering-of-tribe.html#c5873509611691652834 title="comment permalink">11/11/11, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

Anyway, in January 2011 it got so bad that Mark Demoss eventually had to give up the civility project, because not enough people could agree on something as obvious as being a decent human being.<br><br>In other words, instead of insisting on politeness getting you called a curmudgeon or old-timer or fuddy-duddy like THIS guy is sometimes called:<br><br>http://www.fredoneverything.net/Manners.shtml<br><br>you actually get called childish in this country if you call someone out on rude and childish behavior. And the fact that we have a political segment in this country that teaches that consideration for others in your actions and in your words is somehow "thought control" and "against free speech" has resulted in a population that swarms in front of subway doors instead of letting riders get off, or talks loudly on cell phones in art museums, or political debates that are nothing more than angry name-calling that then call YOU names if you try to do the "real adult" thing and tell them both to cut it out.<br><br>It's kind of a "reversal of reality," in other words, and I thought you might find that hilarious.<br><br>Keep writing, sir!

As one link in my personal chain of displacement from a precarious perch in the tertiary economy, I'm living more or less temporarily in a highrise rental building on a small East River isle off Manhattan. Here, my daydreams of building a Vermont redoubt play second fiddle to new ones, in which I leave a copy of Wealth of Nature at each renter's doorsill, with a card inside inviting all to join me in working as a community toward replacing the rooftop chaise lounges with a victory garden. This would then become a first step toward green wizarding the building, its ownership, renters, staff and this little corner of the world. As my paper "wealth" quickly evaporated in these early stages of the tertiary economy's collapse, I can't finance the undertaking and of course wouldn't want to take liberties with your work product, so am asking if the idea sits right with you generally and if you have any ideas as to how I might source copies affordably to that end.

I have yet to meet a person who does not airily dismiss it all with a wave of the hand and a joke - usually along the lines of 'lazy Greeks/Italians/Spanish' or similar. The consensus seems to be that 'they' will sort it out sooner or later. We'll see.<br><br>It's great to hear reports from the ASPO conference. I would dearly love to attend one day, but it doesn't seem very likely. In any case, I'm one of those people who finds it easier to digest information and messages in written form without having to hear it from the horse's mouth. Still, it would be good to hang out with a few like-minded people for a while! <br><br>On a side note - I also follow Philip Carr-Gomm's blog and have read several of his books. In fact, I have downloaded the course materials for the course in Druidry from the BDO and will start shortly on my path. I've never been a religious person but this somehow feels right and I've run out of reasons for *not* doing it.

I’ll never get to one, so it’s good to hear about. Sounds like a lot of the conferences I’ve been to in other fields. :-}<br><br>Yesterday I went to a “Fill Your Pantry” day in a nearby small town, where many of the local small farms brought their root veggies, dried beans, local meats and fresh-milled grain to sell! There was a chance to pre-order, so picking up the several pounds of food that I ordered was pretty easy. And it was just wonderful to know there are food options relatively nearby!! (For those of you in Oregon, it’s the Ten Rivers Food Web). The apple cider was scrumptious, the heirlooms beans all tempted me (yum! soup!); I got potatoes, garlic, oats, barley, chicken… a wonderful day! And got to visit with a friend who is also working on a homestead (hers is much bigger and more efficient, but she has a strong, organized partner) – just to be able to talk post-peak with someone is great. And now I’ll stash away my purchases and feel more detached from the economic writhings, knowing I have enough food for at least the next six months.<br><br><a href=gathering-of-tribe.html#c7965214509880298807 title="comment permalink">11/13/11, 8:20 AM</a><br><br>

Emil Sinclair, the narrator, has come to recognize himself as one of a diffuse and disparate group—call it a circle, an order, a tribe—marked by something half-seen and half spiritual that can be glimpsed in the faces of those who share it. What unites them is not an ideology or an organization, but an orientation toward time, toward the future. The unmarked people around them live their lives in relation to the world as it is, but the ones who wear the mark in their faces are oriented toward a world that does not yet exist."<br><br>~ struck me as very resonant of the feeling in the Dark Mountain / Uncivilisation movement/scene in the UK.<br><br><a href=gathering-of-tribe.html#c1836259573459589373 title="comment permalink">11/13/11, 2:31 PM</a><br><br>

The scientific questions around peak oil are old hat; the reasons that there's so much resistance to dealing with what is ultimately a matter of common sense (a finite resource can't be produced at an endlessly accelerating rate indefinitely!) are cultural, pasychological and (let's whisper it) spiritual.

All those grand plans for a massive buildout of green technologies miss the fact that such a buildout has to be economically feasible, and not just as a way of cashing in on government tax credits; as the economies of the industrial world go into permanent decline, as they are, the economics will become ever more of a problem. That's another reason why the green wizard approach makes a lot of sense just now. Thanks for posting the blogs!<br><br>Sophie, thanks for the link! It was indeed; I wonder how many Americans are aware that the American settlement of the dryland West has failed, and the nearest available society with the population and cultural vitality to do the job is moving in to replace it. <br><br>Cherokee, we're waiting on a new power supply, but I've got a loaner for the time being. Yes, I use old computers; it's more a matter of salvage than anything else -- since I don't need anything but word processing and basic internet access, it makes more sense to keep an old machine out of the landfills and save the resource costs of building a new one, and I can get a very nice machine that will do everything I need for a small fraction of what a new one would cost me. As for smart phones -- you know, I remember people talking about the idea of a portable phone you could carry in your pocket, back when that was just a fantasy, and my reaction even then was "why would I want to be at everybody's beck and call all the time?"

I have a question also. Pretty speculative but I hope not too dumb. It's about China and what they might bargain for in exchange for bailout assistance in the current economic crisis. <br><br>It just seems that investing money in the current system is not in China's interest. That funding an oligarchic management of a system so unequal will not favor China's ability to supply an expanding array of goods. For that they need more western money in more hands. Might they actually require taxes on the investor class, or other devices to promote the distribution of wealth to a broader base of consumers? Might they require that the yuan be made an alternate reserve currency ?<br><br>It's a fascinating question anyway and I 'd love to hear some tentative thoughts.<br><br><a href=gathering-of-tribe.html#c6803567817396281535 title="comment permalink">11/15/11, 8:07 PM</a><br><br>

I haven't owned a television since 1984, and I'm not an activist. <br><br>Joseph, my guess is that it will be nothing so modest. The Chinese have been establishing naval bases along the Indian Ocean littoral in classic Alfred Thayer Mahan style, laying the foundations for a future blue water navy, and in general preparing to become a superrpower with global reach. What exactly they demand will depend very much on the situation and their own needs at the time, but I'd expect serious technology transfer, permanent military bases on islands owned by EU nations, and backing from European nations in international disputes to be high on the list, just for starters. <br><br>Rich, I discussed it a while back <a href=../../2007/06/vlkerwanderung.html rel=nofollow>in a post here</a>, but you're doubtless right -- in the upcoming series on the twilight of American empire, something of the sort needs to be included.<br><br><a href=gathering-of-tribe.html#c2626321157032884529 title="comment permalink">11/15/11, 9:03 PM</a><br><br>

It's entirely common for the same four or five people to ride an elevator up to their homes together in silence, day after month after year, and never learn each others' names. <br><br>In that context (and honestly in most any setting within the range of the corporatocracy's media-enforced consumer cult, which is to say all of civilization), inviting a neighbor (or several) for beers and then, assuming that gesture alone doesn't mark the inviter as an oddball, taking the outing as an opportunity to (however gently) enlighten them about the energy decline of civilization, seems, well, a bit optimistic. They'll be expecting talk about sports, or something of that nature, and their defenses against reality will be up as usual, no?<br><br>There's a call, it seems to me, for a gesture both more compellingly noticeable (because it departs from the mundane contexts and conventions people sleepwalk through all day long) and more well-formed (in that it articulates with a reasonable degree of completeness the case for waking up) than a casual chat over beers.<br><br>After all, aren't we 30 years behind schedule?<br><br>That said, of course I'll stand down, keep my head down and keep reading. I'm one of your readers who still hasn't necessarily quite gotten the hang of "magic" as a consciousness-raising resource, so maybe I'll re-read your relevant posts and see if I can come to a better understanding.

That is the text search field or dialog box in your browser, that searches for matching text on the current page. (Not to be confused with any Web search function that searches for different pages.) Control-F will usually jump directly to that field or dialog. JMG references each commenter by name in each reply, so search that name to find the comment being replied to. Control-G to jump to the next match, for common names, or when there are multiple back and forth exchanges with the same commenter.<br><br>I'd say, to the credit of the frequent commenters here, that if you're not reading all the comments you're missing a lot. Some of the most interesting ones might have only something like "I agree" or "Thanks for the link" as JMG's reply.

The Aleut spoke lovingly of how when he was little the adults in his village all affirmed his as he went by ... as if either this was rare, or as if he'd gulped down the Self-Esteem culture* whole.
