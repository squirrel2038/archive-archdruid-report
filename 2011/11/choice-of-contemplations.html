Last week’s post on the problematic nature of binary thinking went out of its way to sidestep the most explosive of the binaries in contemporary industrial culture. That was a necessary evasion; those of my readers who are following the argument I’ve been developing over most of the last two months have now had a week to mull over the point I’ve raised in that post, to consider its pitfalls and possibilities, and to get ready for a hard look the most sacrosanct binary of our time: the binary between society as it is and society as we want it to become.<br><br>That’s become a hot issue in the news of late, and a significant part of that unfolds from the presence of the Occupy protests in various downtowns. There’s a complex magical context to that fact. The vast majority of Americans these days believe that something has gone very wrong with their country, but there’s nothing like a national consensus about what has gone wrong, much less how to fix it. By chance or design, the Occupy movement has capitalized on this by refusing to be pinned down to specific demands or specific critiques, mounting a protest in which protest itself is the central content. Tactically speaking, this is brilliant; it’s created a movement that anyone with a grievance can join.<br><br>The movement has also displayed a deft hand at the sort of binary thaumaturgy we discussed last week. Over the last few months, it has capably promoted a narrative in which it claims to speak for 99% of Americans while assigning its opponents the remainder. This is a difficult trick for what is, after all, a tiny protest movement supported by a minority of Americans, but I can’t think of an example since Lenin redefined his little revolutionary faction as “the Majority”—that’s what <i>bolshevik</i> means in Russian—where it has been carried off with such aplomb.<br><br>As this example may suggest, I’m of two minds about the Occupy phenomenon. If it follows the trajectory mapped out in a recent press release, holds a national convention next July to set out its demands, and forms a third party when those demands aren’t met, American politics could undergo a seismic shift. A successful third party in America rarely remains a third party for long; in 1860, when the Republicans first took the White House, the Whig party imploded and a political landscape that had been fixed in place since the republic’s early decades changed forever. That could happen again, and if it does, it’s probably the Democratic Party’s turn to land face first in history’s compost heap; after three decades pushing policies that could uncharitably but accurately be described as GOP Lite, the Dems are practically defenseless against a strong challenge from further to the left.<br><br>Such a challenge might work out well, or it might not. If the movement turns away from the options for change that our constitution provides, though, things become much harder to anticipate, and some of the possible outcomes are very ugly indeed. Mass protest movements, as anyone who’s followed current events knows well, are quite capable of destabilizing a nation, but what comes into being in their wake is a complete crapshoot. It’s never safe to assume that the character of the protests will be reflected in the system they put into power; both the French and Russian revolutions began with lively participatory democracy, and ended in the Terror and the gulags. There’s no certainty that successful mass protest in America will go the same way—but it’s critical for all concerned to realize that it could.<br><br>That brings us back in turn to the binary I mentioned above. I sincerely doubt that there’s anyone in America today who doesn’t cherish the thought that if only the right political changes were made, the world would be a much better place. I have such thoughts fairly often, though they’re tempered in my case by the wry realization that the changes I’d most like to see, if put to a popular ballot, would probably not get a single favorable vote other than mine. Daydream politics of this sort are now and then helpful, since that’s one of the ways that people come up with the currently unthinkable notions that will dominate serious politics fifty years from now, but in times of severe social stress they can feed into the sort of unwelcome consequences I’ve outlined above.<br><br>The structure of binary logic plays a large role in this. Remember that the binary reaction is meant to produce snap judgments in stressful situations, and it has no gray areas at all; a distant bit of color in a tree is either food or it’s not, the snap of a twig breaking in the forest behind you is either a predator or it’s not, and our australopithecine ancestors didn’t normally have to cope with things that were partly food and partly a predator, and might turn into one or the other depending on how a set of complex processes went. They also didn’t, as far as we know, have to deal with other australopithecines trying to convince them that food was predators and predators were food.<br><br>Part of the human predicament is that we do have to deal with such complex choices, where one thing can be an object of desire and an object of fear at the same time; we have to do that with a nervous system that still has most of its australopithecine reactions hardwired into place; and we have to deal with the fact that other people are trying to manipulate us against our best interests using those reactions. Politics is only one of the arenas where this is a major issue, to be sure, but the level of stress in politics is very often higher than elsewhere, and it’s thus far from rare for people who make nuanced judgments in other contexts to fall into extreme binary thinking when it comes to politics.<br><br>This is where we get the conviction, which is limited to the fringes in ordinary times but spreads rapidly into the mass of the population in times of extreme social stress, that the existing order of society is the worst possible state of affairs, and that any change to it must therefore be a change for the better. This is binary logic in its purest form: the existing order is bad, therefore whatever replaces the existing order must be good; since the existing order is bad, it’s equated with every other bad thing, even <a href=../../2007/11/fascism-feudalism-and-future.html>those that contradict each other</a>, while whatever is to replace the existing order, since it’s good, can’t be bad in any sense. Add in white-hot emotions on all sides of the equation, and you get today’s fringe politics—and quite possibly the mainstream politics of tomorrow.<br><br>Still, the binary reaction isn’t the only factor at work Another bit of practical psychology that’s been used by operative mages for a very long time also comes into play, especially when the politics of an age are more intently focused on denouncing the existing order than in offering a coherent alternative to it. You’ll find this principle expressed in different ways in magical traditions, but the phrasing I first learned is to my mind the one that expresses it best: <i>what you contemplate, you imitate</i>.<br><br>It’s important to realize, before we go on, that this phrase means no more than it says, which is simply that the more attention you focus on something, the more likely you are to imitate it. In particular, it doesn’t mean that you can get anything you want simply by wanting it badly enough, or concentrating on it long enough; your own thoughts, words, and actions will be shaped by whatever most often fills the center of your attention, but if imitating whatever fills the center of your attention won’t get you what you want, the effect isn’t going to help you. Contemplating a new toaster oven, in other words, won’t get you one, it’ll simply make you imitate one—which is not exactly a useful thing under most conditions. If what you want to accomplish can be done by changing your thoughts, words, and actions, on the other hand, contemplation on carefully chosen subjects can accomplish a great deal; this is one of the major working tools of magic.<br><br>Like the binary reaction, the contemplation reaction has roots reaching deep into our evolutionary history. One of the reasons that mammals have been the dominant land animals on this planet for the last fifty million years or so is that they evolved the trick of supplementing inherited behavioral patterns with learned ones picked up early in life from one or both parents. Watch kittens learning how to hunt from their mother, and you’re seeing one of the foundations of mammalian dominance; the kittens watch every move intently, and then imitate therepertoire of motions in play. Rinse and repeat, and your kittens have a set of behaviors that are nicely adapted to local conditions. Primates do this even more than other mammals; there’s a reason we all know the phrase "monkey see, monkey do."<br><br>Every religious tradition that’s been around long enough to put together a decent collection of magical technique uses the resulting reaction to the hilt. Visit an old-fashioned Catholic or Orthodox church, a Hindu temple, a Tibetan Buddhist monastery, or what have you, and you’ll find yourself surrounded by a wealth of imagery, designed and created according to precise patterns handed down by tradition, inviting you to contemplation. In religions such as Islam and Judaism, which reject representational images, exactly the same effect is produced by the words of sacred texts that are in many places ablaze with vivid verbal imagery.<br><br>A Buddhist burning incense before an image of a bodhisattva, a Christian prayerfully studying the narratives of the Bible, or for that matter a Druid standing with arms outstretched in the midst of circle of trees in the rain, taking part in the dance of the natural world, are all contemplating that which they hope, in their own way, to imitate. All three, and their equivalents in other traditions, are aware of the other side of the balance; the Buddhist affirms the reality of suffering, the Christian likely considers original sin as a fact of existence, the Druid knows full well that the dance of nature also includes pain and death, but the devotional and meditative practices of these and other faiths carefully balance such reflections with a more sustained contemplation of exactly those things the believer seeks to imitate.<br><br>Still, the intellectual assent and emotional exaltation of the worshipper in the presence of the holy are not required to give the effect we’re discussing its power. The contemplation effect is remarkably independent of the other activities of the mind, and in particular, it works regardless of the thoughts and feelings you associate with the object of contemplation. One of the more bitterly ironic narratives in recent American history shows this independence in action.<br><br>When the neoconservative movement burst on the American scene in the last years of the 20th century, some thinkers in the older and more, well, conservative ends of the American right noted with a good deal of disquiet that the "neocons" had very little in common with conservatism in any historically meaningful sense of that word. In the Anglo-American world, conservatism had its genesis in the writings of Edmund Burke (1729-1797), who argued for an organic concept of society, and saw social and political structures as phenomena evolving over time in response to the needs and possibilities of the real world. Burke objected, not to social change—he was a passionate supporter of the American Revolution, for instance—but to the notion, popular among revolutionary ideologues of his time (and of course since then as well), that it was possible to construct a perfect society according to somebody’s abstract plan, and existing social structures should therefore be overthrown so that this could be done.<br><br>By and large, Burke’s stance was the intellectual driving force behind Anglo-American conservatism from Burke’s own time until the late twentieth century, though of course—politics being what they are—it was no more exempt from being used as rhetorical camouflage for various crassly selfish projects than were the competing ideas on the other end of the political spectrum. Still, beginning in the 1920s, a radically different sense of what conservatism ought to be took shape on the fringes of the right wing in America and elsewhere, and moved slowly inward over the decades that followed. The rise to power of the neoconservatives in 2000 marked the completion of this trajectory.<br><br>This new version of conservatism stood in flat contradiction to Burke and the entire tradition descended from him. It postulated that a perfect society could indeed be brought into being, by following a set of ideological prescriptions set out by Ayn Rand and detailed by an assortment of economists, political scientists, and philosophers, of whom Leo Strauss was the most influential. It called for a grand crusade that would not only make over the United States in the image of its ideal, but spread the same system around the world by any means necessary. It argued that bourgeois sentimentality about human rights and the rule of law should not stand in the way of the glorious capitalist revolution, and went on to create a familiar landscape of prison camps, torture, and aggressive war waged under dubious pretexts. Neoconservatism, in other words, was not conservatism at all; it was to Communism precisely what Satanism is to Christianity, a straightforward inversion that adopted nearly every detail of the Third International’s philosophy, rhetoric and practice and simply reversed some of the value judgments.<br><br>The magical principle we’ve just discussed explains this bizarre bit of ideological transformation. The main figures in the neoconservative movement entered public life in one or another of the panics over Communism that swept through the American right every decade or so from 1919 until just before the Soviet Union’s collapse. Like most political panics, these focused obsessively on the feared and hated Other, and a glance back through the biographies of prominent figures in neoconservatism shows plenty of involvement in that pastime. The result of this fixation of attention was utterly predictable to anyone with a grasp of magical theory: what the "neocons" contemplated, they imitated.<br><br>The same process can be seen in action all through the culture of denuciation that has replaced civil discourse in so much of contemporary life. From the evangelical preachers whose spluttering polemics about homosexuality provide an interesting counterpoint to their propensity for being caught in compromising positions with their boyfriends, to the militant atheists whose hostility toward religion is neatly matched by their eagerness to match the intolerance and self-righteousness of its least impressive forms, today’s society is well stocked with object lessons relating to this branch of magical philosophy. Still, such reflections are less important just now than the issues raised at the beginning of this essay.<br><br>The decision on the part of the Occupy movement to create a protest with protest itself as its only fixed content was, as I suggested earlier, a brilliant tactical stroke. What makes for good tactics, though, may not be equally wise as strategy. If the movement proceeds along the lines mentioned already, moving to the formulation of demands and then to the pursuit of active political goals, it has a good chance of dodging the inherent strategic weaknesses of its tactical choice. The longer it tries to avoid formulating its own coherent vision, though, the more likely it is to find itself following out the implications of someone else’s vision. That may happen by way of the contemplation effect—there’s a reason why revolutions so often end up installing governments all but identical to the ones they overthrow—or by way of any of several other modes of derailment; as history shows, a movement of the kind we’re discussing can run off the rails in any of a remarkable number of ways.<br><br>Of course, the peak oil movement is at least as vulnerable to deflection along these same lines. From its beginning, a great many people in that latter movement have focused attention on visions of a very troubled future. That focus was reasonable and indeed inevitable, especially early on; over the last three centuries, and more particularly over the last three decades, modern industrial civilization has backed itself into a very tight corner, and that reality needs to be recognized; trying to imitate a fantasy of sustainable growth by contemplating it, while refusing to recognize the hard material constraints that make it a fantasy, is exactly the kind of confusion between what magic can do and what technology can do that occupied <a href=../../2011/09/clarkes-fallacy.html>an earlier post in this series</a>. Again, contemplating a toaster oven won’t get you one; it’ll just make you more prone to overheat and burn the toast.<br><br>Yet it’s important to balance the recognition of inflexible planetary limits with a clear sense of the way human consciousness responds to such reflections, and to avoid the pitfalls that come from spending too much time contemplating what you don’t want to imitate. There are any number of ways to attain the necessary balance; those of my readers who follow religious, spiritual, or magical traditions have ample resources; those who don’t may find the regular contemplation of nature and natural systems to be an effective response; and of course one of the many reasons why I’ve encouraged readers who are interested in pursuing the "green wizardry" advocated in these posts to collect books and other information sources from the appropriate-tech movement of the 70s is that these tend to be stocked with colorful visions of the future we could have had—and even though that future is water under the micro-hydro turbine at this point, imitating it is by no means a useless strategy even this late in the game.<br><br>One way or another, though, what you contemplate, you imitate. Choose your contemplations well.<br><br>************<br>There are two details I should mention here for the benefit of readers. First, by the time this post goes up I will be at this year’s ASPO-USA conference in Washington DC; I’ve arranged to have comments put through, but won’t be responding to them until I get back.<br><br>Second, the anthology of science fiction short stories about a post-peak oil future, which I proposed <a href=../../2011/09/invasion-of-space-bats.html>in a post a little while back</a>, has taken a major step toward realization; after talking to a couple of publishers, I have one that’s interested. I’d like to ask everyone who has a story in the works, but hasn’t yet submitted it, to get it up on the internet and post a link to it in the comments to this post by November 10. Yes, that’s a firm deadline.<br><br>I’d also like to ask everybody who’s submitted a story to get me your real name, email address, and mailing address, so I can get in touch with you if your story is selected for the anthology. The easy way to do that is to submit a comment to this post with that info, and a note asking me not to put it through. I’ll copy down the info and delete the post. <br><br>I’ve received upwards of fifty stories so far, by the way, ranging from quite readable to stunningly good, and it’s going to take some hard work to winnow the selection down to the 12 or 14 stories that will go into the anthology. Many thanks to all for your submissions, and I hope that even those of you whose stories aren’t selected gain something from the experience.

As you say – one needs to find the balance between being aware of something and obsessing about it. I don’t find it easy at all. :-}<br><br>A few comments on your comments:<br><i>…it’s created a movement that anyone with a grievance can join.</i><br>Except neo-Nazi’s, apparently… one of them showed up today at Occupy Phoenix and it was explained to him that they didn’t share his complaints about the world.<br><br><i>Mass protest movements, as anyone who’s followed current events knows well, are quite capable of destabilizing a nation, but what comes into being in their wake is a complete crapshoot.</i><br>There is an excellent 5 hour movie called the French Revolution on YouTube:<br><br><a rel=nofollow>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yomegiBBrzw</a><br>which does bear a frightening similarity to current events. A sobering history to watch! Anyone who thinks they can start up a mob and control subsequent events is crazy.

I can certainly see it happening in political campaigning, too. Avoid all mention of the other side, and especially any fringe sides, to keep them out of your prospective voters' minds.<br><br>But two more practical extensions I can think of these:<br><br>Firstly, the idea speaks to the value of role models, or at least proof of concept, particularly in something like green wizardry. By canning, or growing your own vegetables, or travelling by bicycle when 80-90% of everyone else is using a car, you start people contemplating these as options, where before they tuned them out as irrelevant or impossible.<br><br>Secondly, it carries a warning and perhaps suggestions for dealing with opposing points of view. To be able to engage in meaningful debate with someone, you have to spend some time contemplating their ideas. The warning would be that spending too long doing so might slant you towards those ideas in your thinking, when you might have good rational reasons not to. The suggestion for dealing with this would be to balance any time spent contemplating views you oppose and which are contentious by spending more time contemplating something completely neutral, or closer to what you would like yourself to be.<br><br>This also ties in with the stress-binary thinking relationship. By contemplating relaxing, positive ideas or things, you reduce your stress, as well as your vulnerability to falling into false binaries.<br><br>Thank-you for a very thought-provoking post.

This could be age or cynicism though.<br><br>Over the past decade or so, I've been coming to the conclusion that people are far more base than I'd previously given credit for their motivations. If people don't fall into the behaviour categories of greedy, lazy or self-interested I'm reasonably surprised and also pleased.<br><br>You have also neatly explained the phenomena of why when one party follows another into government it seems to be more of the same. The differences are minute unless they have the power to pursue their ideological wheelbarrows and then it is usually their undoing. <br><br>A nice quote for everyone: "Oppositions don't win elections, governments lose them."<br><br>Also explained was the tendency of opposition parties to spout objectionable rhetoric rather than coherent policies. It all makes sense.<br><br>The Third International policies - which I had to look up - sound not that dissimilar from a dictatorship. The perfect society is a myth - this is why so many multiple occupancies fail.<br><br>Also "the Druid knows full well that the dance of nature also includes pain and death". The organic gardener also knows this to be true. Yes, I contemplate nature as an antidote to contemporary thinking.

To read the thread of your logic, you begin by citing historic examples of (r)evolutions that only gave rise to installation of different-but-same regimes. Then you tie those outcomes to improper contemplation as having primary influence on outcome. THEN you get around to mentioning resource mgmt as a factor. Case in point, resource mgmgt is currently done using thaumaturgy, while the effort to evolve is employing theurgy. Previous efforts have not fallen short due to use of theurgy. They've fallen short because thaumaturgy wasn't transformed at the base. It's one thing to have slight of hand, only joking duplicity as a source of entertainment. It is quite another to have such duplicity as a core heuristic undermining natural theurgy. btw, the 'fringe' is instrumental as to the next formulation of thaumaturgy, and it's not just hollow contemplation if the fringe knows of such contemplations as part of their current reality. Shared along theurgic channels, is an inoculation, used proactively. Threads of possibility extend out for one and all. Think of the cascading effects if, for example, a (r)evolution were to be initiated at the same time as the introduction of free energy. The percent chance of plus ca change... outcome would be significantly diminished. Theurgy is about true paradigm change. Thaumaturgy rearranges deck chairs.<br><br><a href=choice-of-contemplations.html#c837532134186673856 title="comment permalink">11/3/11, 6:00 AM</a><br><br>

Our concious is littered with the constructs, habits, heuristics, or frameworks that we acquire from whatever we study or acculturate ourselves to. That is to say that our conciousness is not what or the way that we think or what seems to make sense, those are the ingrained habits or patterns that exist and our bounded within our conciousness. A clunky analogy, but appropriate given the medium we are communicating through, is the computer. The computer is conciousness, the programs that are installed on it, including the operating system, are the constructs of conciousness. You could equate the programs and operating systems to the individuals culture, education, and social norms. You refract the world through those constructs, or rather, you first map what you observe through the familiarity of these constructs to understand it. Whatever is unfamiliar is commonly reinterpreted through the familiar, where it cannot be, it is ignored as irrelevant, or considered trivial or boring. That dos not make it so, and its why we often miss important information that in retrospect was staring us in the face. <br><br>So choose well what is familiar to you, and make sure that nothing is so singularly familiar that it appears to explain everything. And keep in mind that just because something seems very familiar, you may be ignoring some crucial difference in the circumstances for the reason that you did not see it before, or worse, because it has been misintrepreted before and you are reenforcing that misintrepretation now. Its more likely than not that if some master ideology appears to explain everything, then you have really more likely to have trained yourself to have cognitive tunnel vision. Maybe things are usually close enough not to matter, but maybe not. Its not enough to double check your vision with others, because they may have the same tunnel vision as you, thats the effect of sharing culture.<br><br>To compound matters, we are hard wired to seek cognitive tunnel vision in our binary stimuli-response evolutionary past, where snap judgments and instant responses are necessary. As social animals, with perhaps the most highly evolved social abilities of all animals, we are also hard wired to adopt and learn from others their knowledge along these lines because its more effecient to get the information from others than having to learn the same sorting/response information independantly.<br><br><a href=choice-of-contemplations.html#c2061160221207466234 title="comment permalink">11/3/11, 6:52 AM</a><br><br>

It is true that many of the intellectuals in the neocon movement were students or students of students of Strauss. It is also true that many Nazis were ardent readers of Nietzsche and that Alcibiades was a known associate of Socrates. But a philosopher should not be held accountable for the actions of his students.<br><br>The general goal of Strauss' thinking seems to me highly compatible with the direction of your own thinking JMG. His specialization, political philosophy, properly understood is precisely aimed at the difference between theurgy and thaumaturgy you have described in these posts. Practically he emphasized the subordination of social science to philosophy and the politically moderating affect of philosophical wisdom. His essential ambition was to resurrect the validity of classical philosophy in the face of an academic culture dominated by illusions of progress in the arts and sciences.<br><br>Many of his students suffered from a common but fatal error of philosophy: they believed themselves to be wise.<br><br>I wrote because it would be regretable if one of your readers passed by a used copy of Strauss on the basis of your remarks.

Could it be by contemplating their enemies so deeply and fervidly they lose something of themselves in the process?<br><br>I recently had an online 'discussion' with one of them who was promoting his new book of epiphanic cornucopian fantasies. I merely pointed out that his newfound belief that GMO technology could sustain 10 billion people had more holes in it than a Swiss cheese.

It's akin to the <i>via negativa</i> of philosophy in the Western world, which was quite popular in the Middle Ages, as though to say, "not this, not this, not this, not this either, nor this other thing," until everything but one thing is gone. What reality shows like <b>Survivor</b> have done, though, is not given the last one standing a chance to also be "voted off," which the <i>via negativa</i> always does. It's only when everything is gone that was under consideration that one can begin to really evaluate the 'real remainders'.<br><br>This past week, I had a conversation in the warmth and light of a rare mid-autumn mid-day without students. I've had no school for four days due to this Octoblizzard or Snowvember that knocked out power lines all over Connecticut and left school and home without power. A large number of my contemplations originally revolved around heat and light. Once I realized I wasn't getting them back any time soon, I stopped worrying about that, and started thinking about food and neighbors. As a result, I met a good many of my neighbors over backyard barbecues and impromptu lunches in the cold, as we got used to wearing our gloves and hats at the kitchen table. I made two grocery trips to towns that had working supermarkets, to bring back food for me and some of my neighbors.<br><br>Anyway, this conversation on the porch: one woman said she really wanted to go down and join the protestors on Occupy Wall Street, but something prevented her. When I and my neighbors asked her what was on her mind, it became clear that she didn't fear violence, and she didn't fear being injured. She feared <i>being used</i>. She was able to see, as clearly as this post made me see (and as I saw when she articulated it), that she'd felt conned into taking student loans she now couldn't afford, and conned into taking a series of bad paying jobs that left her with no money to start her own business, and conned into giving up her dreams of being a nurse practitioner for something 'more practical' because it would pay someone else's bill on her mental training. The idea that her energy — her money, her time, her devotion to THE CAUSE — would only serve to put a different set of frauds in charge, galled her tremendously. "It's much better to be here, talking to my neighbors, figuring out what to do the next time the power goes off," she said. Which is what we did.<br><br>Another person on the porch had chosen to come back to his cold, dark apartment because he'd gone to a friend's house for heat and light and warmth... only to discover that his friends were using their time off from work, and the blessings of available energy, to play multi-player video games and watch hours of weird TV. "One of the folks there," he said, "has a nearly-failing business, and is about to have his house foreclosed on, maybe; but it's easier for him to use his leadership and management skills in an invented digital world to use a graphical interface to shift random numbers around in a spreadsheet and a database." He came home. His food and apartment was cold, but his mind was on fire.<br><br>So I think that some people are waking up to the problems of duality, and are choosing to contemplate different endings here. I'm meeting more such people, at least, and the conversations in physical space are clearly helping us get our act together for organizing real change, locally. Building our Guild, I guess. :-)<br><br><a href=choice-of-contemplations.html#c914842005901438137 title="comment permalink">11/3/11, 3:18 PM</a><br><br>

It was rather agonizing though. My husband took a philosophy class his first year in college (way back when) and we have had many discussions on the virtues of 'circular reasoning' as I call it :)<br><br>I all seriousness though, I think it (philosophy) should be a required course, for the simple reason that it requires one to evaluate one's prejudices absorbed throughout childhood that one doesn't even realize one has. Challenging them is something else again, but at least becoming aware of them is a good place to start. <br><br>JMG, I think that OWS has a much wider support amongst the general population than you realize. At least among working and school aged people. I would venture to guess for the most part, though, that they are like me - I have too much to lose at this point to take a chance on getting arrested. It would put my license at risk, regardless of whether any charge was upheld. No license = no job = immanent homelessness. Yuck.

The goal is to surround territory, not to "kill" your opponent, though you might kill your<br>opponent's stones in the process of acquiring territory.<br><br>When I first started playing, I would aggressively attack my opponent by always playing directly beside her moves. She would calmy develop away from my attacks. I would continue the push, and I would end up surrounded and defeated, similar<br>to the way that Napoleon lost when he attacked the Russians. The Russians strategically retreated, thereby allowing Napoleon to overextend himself and<br>suffer the consequences. <br><br>I gradually learned to develop away from my opponent's strength, rather than playing into it. In this way, which to me is a paradox, I would be able<br>to eventually herd my opponent into my strong positions. <br><br>I think that "what you contemplate, you imitate" can also be understood along <br>these lines: the harder you push against something, the harder it pushes back.<br><br>In Go, when you play a stone directly beside your opponent's stone, it is called<br>an attaching move. The interesting thing is that attaching moves end up <br>making your opponent's position stronger because they will almost definitely play another stone beside theirs, which prompts you to do the same, and so on.<br><br>What you should try to do instead is build your own positions of strength so that as your opponent expands, her position becomes constricted by your own <br>strength. She has to work harder and harder to keep her stones alive, and your passive forces win out.<br><br>In some way, to me, this sums up most of what the Archdruid advocates: change your own life first.

Etc.<br><br>The temptation is to try to push against your own culture; however, as many a visionary has learned, culture pushes back. Hard.<br><br>Even in terms of your own friends, it is far more productive to let your own positions of strength serve as an example rather than try to use logic to <br>convince people to change their ways.

So I deduce magic has a finite endpoint. This past week I read the bankers don't care if the buildings collapse and the bank names go away, as long as the hallucinated wealth is in the private Swiss bank accounts of the bank CEOs and their top 500 executives. <br><br>Another magic aspect: Occupy Wall Street's m'organization, if I can coin a term, will be interesting watch as the summer political conventions are conducted, then the proposed 04Jul2012 convention, and then the Nov 2012 election. It's interesting to think about magic versus navigation.<br><br><a href=choice-of-contemplations.html#c695660922659343738 title="comment permalink">11/5/11, 1:41 PM</a><br><br>

Consensus has objectives, rules and procedures that are different from Robert's Rules of Order or any other system for achieving majority rule. For people accustomed to majority rule decision making, learning how to achieve consensus is not entirely intuitive. It requires training and practice.<br><br>Leadership of a political or protest movement by an organized vanguard has the disadvantages of any authoritarian system, but direct democracy of the town meeting variety also doesn't work well in large groups of people who come and go and don't know each other well. It's easily hijacked by cabals.<br><br>True consensus differs from majority rule in that it requires that every single person's concerns be listened to and taken into account before a decision is reached. The decision does not have to make everyone happy, but it has to be a solution that everyone can live with. In pure consensus, even a single person can block a decision that everyone else supports. Consequently, consensus process in large, diverse groups sometimes incorporates modifications to prevent a single holdout or a small group from deliberately torpedoing any action whatsoever. The 11 1/2% rule that you cite sounds like such a modification.<br><br>Consensus process, even when expertly employed, moves slowly, but it has the potential to arrive at more creative solutions than majority rule. For a grassroots social movement, it also has the great advantage that once a decision has been reached, everyone who participated buys into the decision; there are no disgruntled factions waiting for an opportunity to undo it.<br><br><a href=choice-of-contemplations.html#c42762460371758191 title="comment permalink">11/7/11, 1:56 PM</a><br><br>

It's a complicated issue. <br><br>Mouser, nicely put. Thaumaturgy doesn't just rearrange the deck chairs, though -- it determines who gets a chair and who sits on the bare deck. <br><br>Justin, very good. Yes, you're getting it. <br><br>Grrl, "what you resist, persists" is partly the contemplation effect, partly one of the other dimensions of binary thinking -- we'll get to that in a bit. Thanks for the link to Brin's blog; I tend to avoid it for reasons that will probably be obvious, but I'll have a look. <br><br>Maria, excellent! Yes, all this stuff can and should be used in personal as well as social settings; most teachers of magic start with the personal dimension, because it's usually easier to see the connections coming together there first. <br><br>Jason, now that's a fascinating point! I don't know much about the history of transvestism in Western society; it might be an interesting project to trace that, and relate it to trends in the visual arts. <br><br>Redoak, I'd find your argument a bit more convincing if most of the Nazis had actually been personal students of Nietzsche! Still, I appreciate the counterpoint; I haven't taken the time to read any significant amount of Strauss' work, and will have to remedy that. <br><br>Adrian, imitating Bach sonatas seems like a good idea to me!<br><br>Justin, excellent! You get tonight's gold star. <br><br>Jason, the sheer blind fury with which cornucopians so often respond to reasonable questions about their fantasies is the best piece of evidence I can think of that they know, on some level, that they're shoveling smoke. People who are truly confident of their beliefs do not go into a Donald Duck frenzy when those beliefs are questioned. <br><br>Joel, that makes perfect sense; as I've mentioned before, the current GOP platform is exactly parallel with the social views presented by Anton Szandor LaVey in <i>The Satanic Bible</i>. It astonishes me that more Christians haven't noticed the complete antithesis between that platform and the teachings of their own founder. <br><br>Ozark, if I understand correctly, it will take a Constitutional amendment to change the current US voting system on the national level. That can be done -- the Progressive movement managed changes at least as profound a century ago -- but it'll involve a lot of work. If you feel strongly about it, I'd encourage you to get involved in the effort.<br><br><a href=choice-of-contemplations.html#c2438424157171107306 title="comment permalink">11/7/11, 7:47 PM</a><br><br>

More on this soon. <br><br>Deborah, well, de gustibus non disputandum est, but throwing out the TV altogether seems like a better plan to me. <br><br>Mark, excellent. Yes, that particular handbook of political theory (etc.) was central to one phase of my training, and ternary thinking does indeed relate to the Principle of Polarization -- also, as you figure out how to work it, to the whole panoply of methods of mental alchemy.

As for my books on the subject, they're written for practitioners rather than the general public; you might find my book <a href="http://redwheelweiser.com/detail.html?id=9781578633975" rel=nofollow>The Druid Magic Handbook</a> a little more accessible than most. The book on the magical dimensions of peak oil I'm currently preparing to write will be more along the lines of what's been discussed here, but I'm not sure it will be for the general public; I'm more interested in providing insights to green wizards and others who are facing up to the crisis of our age. <br><br>Thomas, one of the best magical theorists of the 20th century, Dion Fortune, used to say that you win in magical combat the way a First World War air ace won in his own more physical combat, by rising above the opponent. That's a challenging postulate, but it works. <br><br>Lewis, when you recognize that what's upsetting you is your own projection of your shadow onto the other person, to use Jungian terms, you gain a great deal of freedom you didn't previously have. That's not quite what I was talking about, but it's equally important. <br><br>Gary, well, we'll see. Let's see how they deal with internal decision making -- in practice, not in theory (or propaganda). <br><br>Jeffrey, well, I hope they outgrow it. <br><br>Kieran, there are plenty of things you do <i>not</i> mention on American media. I sometimes wonder if when the Soviet Union fell, the staff of <i>Pravda</i> got snapped up by US media firms; our media these days bears a weird similarity to the official Soviet media back in the day. <br><br>Foxy, I'll check it out when time permits.<br><br><a href=choice-of-contemplations.html#c6443312853105378409 title="comment permalink">11/7/11, 8:29 PM</a><br><br>

I'll probbly have to talk about Hitler in more detail one of these days, since he's such a good example of how to fail by trying to make magic do what it's not able to do -- and thank goodness for that!

That's what I was beginning to hear and, to be frank, what I expected -- that the OWS thing would fall into the hands of professional activists, who are proceeding to use the standard tools of manipulative pseudoconsensus to get control of the money and organizational framework and use it for their own, not particularly impressive purposes. If that goes unchallenged, the whole thing will end with a whimper. <br><br>Rainbow, Greek democracy and the Roman republic both ended messily, and people still used them as a model for -- well, among other things, our constitution.

I'm quite familiar with consensus methods, and avoid them wherever possible; far more often than not, in practice, they serve as a mechanism by which a small and unelected group skilled at manipulating process controls the less sophisticated majority.

Water causes so much damage, it’s just amazing. I’m in a cool temperate environment, but the water cycle here is just getting stranger by the year.<br><br>Over autumn and winter, it will drizzle and you may get 10mm of rain over a period of 6 hours. No drama’s, it’s wet, but everything is gentle and it doesn’t challenge your infrastructure. This is normal.<br><br>Not so over spring and summer as it’s a whole different story. 10mm can fall in under 10 minutes. The most I’ve seen so far is 100mm in a day. The amount of damage that this can cause is huge given I’m on the side of a dormant volcano and I have to keep upgrading the infrastructure to cope with these storms which are happening more frequently as well as try to capture as much of this water in the soil as possible (which is the key to it all really ). It is a bit of a juggling act. <br><br>The vegie beds are now all no dig beds which seem to do OK in these conditions.

Still, I should have something of interest this evening. <br><br>Grrl, a very traditional application of the principle! Deities sharing altars is nothing new, though -- it's standard practice in most polytheist faiths (and the juxtapositions on my home altar would probably give quite a few people conniption fits, for that matter). <br><br>Ceworthe, duly noted. By all means use whatever label fits your own experience best. <br><br>Cherokee, when all else fails, to borrow a thought from Voltaire, you can always cultivate your garden. That's especially worth considering when a lot of things are on the brink of failure. <br><br>Jess, I've seen a few critiques of consensus online -- <a href=http://libcom.org/library/consensus-its-discontents rel=nofollow>here</a>, <a href=http://www.diemer.ca/Docs/Diemer-OneVoteforDemocracy.htm rel=nofollow>here</a>, and <a href=http://www.autonomous-legion.org/2011/10/another-critique-of-centralized-consensus-the-tyranny-of-consensus-by-m-treloar/ rel=nofollow>here</a> are examples -- and I have yet to see much of anything discussing the deliberate use of coercive consensus as a means of domination. It's a subject that badly needs a thorough study. <br><br>Cherokee, the reaason Texas has low housing prices and you've got high ones is that our housing bubble has popped and yours hasn't yet. When it does, and it will, expect a lot of current rhetoric to look very remarkably foolish.<br><br>Carp, I'm speechless.<br><br><a href=choice-of-contemplations.html#c4024027336142800544 title="comment permalink">11/9/11, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

It ties into a lot of what my posts were trying to say.<br><br>Modern Republicans have a strong "life isn't fair and you should NEVER DO ANYTHING AT ALL to make it fair" mentality that absolves them of all responsibility for their part in contributing to the mess. It mindlessly excuses PREVENTABLE (if the public cared) social trends like the closing of public libraries and fire departments, etc.<br><br>It's the primary reason why Americans can't seem to do anything about creeping anti-intellectualism and social Darwinism. Ralph Nader once remarked that we're almost as passively "democratic" as Bangladesh.<br><br>They live in an "eternal present" to paraphrase John Taylor Gatto, rather than remembering what 5,000 of our ancestors dating back to the epic of Gilgamesh spilled blood for, and can't understand that if you just passively sit back when bad things happen, doing absolutely nothing at all, problems usually get even worse.<br><br>Do you understand what I'm trying to say, JMG? I have Asperger's Syndrome like you so I don't always express myself properly.<br><br><a href=choice-of-contemplations.html#c5150073394642514967 title="comment permalink">11/9/11, 10:43 AM</a><br><br>
