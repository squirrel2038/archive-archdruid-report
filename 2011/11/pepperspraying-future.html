A whiff of pepper spray rising from a suburban big box store, a breathtakingly absurd comment by an American politician, a breathtakingly cynical statement from a Canadian minister: three scraps of data sent whirling down the wind unnoticed by most of today’s disinformation society, which are also three clues to the exceptionally unwelcome future the industrial world is making for itself. Let’s take them one at a time, in reverse order.<br><br>On Monday, as a new round of climate change talks got under way in Durban, Canadian environment minister Peter Kent <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15930562>confirmed earlier media reports</a> that Canada will refuse to accept any further cuts in its carbon dioxide output under the Kyoto treaty. Since Canada is one of only two countries on Earth that uses more energy per capita than the United States—an impressive feat, really, when you think about it—you might be tempted to believe that there was room for some modest cuts, but that notion is nowhere in Kent’s view of the universe. Those same media reports claimed that Canada was preparing to extract itself from the Kyoto treaty altogether; Kent dodged that question, but as Bob Dylan sang a good long time ago, you don’t need to be a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing.<br><br>The week before, in a debate among candidates for the GOP’s presidential nomination, Newt Gingrich responded to a question about oil supplies by insisting that the United States could easily increase its oil production by four million barrels a day next year, if only those dratted environmentalists in the other party weren’t getting in the way. This absurd claim was quickly and efficiently refuteded by several peak oil writers—<a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/node/8646>Art Berman’s essay</a> over on the Oil Drum is a good example—but outside the peak oil blogosphere, nobody blinked. Never mind that the entire United States only produces 5.9 million barrels a day, that it took twenty years for the Alaska North Slope fields (peak production, 2 million barrels per day) to go from discovery to maximum output, or that the United States has been explored for oil more thoroughly than any other piece of real estate on the planet; the pundits and the public alike nodded and went on to the next question, as though a serious contender for the position of most powerful human being on the planet hadn’t just gone on record claiming that two plus two is whatever you want it to be.<br><br>All of which brings us inevitably to a Los Angeles suburb on Thanksgiving, where a woman seems to have peppersprayed her fellow shoppers to get a video game console to put under her Christmas tree.<br><br>To be fair, the situation seems to have been a bit more complex than that sounds at first hearing. If you’re still thinking of Thanksgiving Day in America in terms of lavish turkey dinners and visits from relatives, think again. Nowadays it serves mostly to mark the beginning of the year’s big shopping season, and stores on the cutting edge of American marketing open their doors Thanksgiving night to give shoppers their first shot at whatever overpriced gewgaws the media has decreed will be the hot item this year. The store where the pepper spray incident happened was one of these. There, the mob that formed, waiting for the sale to start, turned unruly; there was apparently shoving and shouting, and then the pepper spray came out. According to witnesses, the woman who used it incapacitated enough of the competition to get to one of the video game consoles that were the center of the agitation, hurried off with it to a checkstand, bought the console and got away. Twenty people, some of them children, needed treatment by medics at the scene.<br><br>A fair amount of self-important clucking in the American media followed the incident, though I don’t think anyone quite had the bad taste to point out that at least this year nobody was trampled to death by mobs of shoppers—yes, this happens every few years. Stephen Colbert, as usual, landed one in the bull’s-eye by pointing out that <a href=http://www.thewrap.com/tv/article/stephen-colbert-black-friday-pepper-spray-america-back-video-33136>the incident would make a great video game</a>. He’s right enough that I wouldn’t be the least surprised if <i>Black Friday</i>, in which shoppers punch, spray, stab, and shoot each other to get choice gifts for Christmas, turns out to be the hot new video game sensation next year, and no doubt inspires pepper sprayings and tramplings of its own.<br><br>What all these three news stories have in common is that they display an attitude—it could as well be described as a belief, or even a religion—that treats the satisfaction of short term cravings for material goods as the only thing that really matters. The shopper with her pepper spray, the politician with his absurd claim, and the government with its blind disregard for national survival, each acted as though <i>getting the stuff</i> is all that matters, and any obstacle in the way—whether the obstacle was other shoppers, the laws of physics and geology, or the fate of Canada’s future generations—was an irrelevance to be brushed aside by any available means.<br><br>In recent years, there’s been a fair amount of intellectual effort devoted to the attempt to prove that this is inevitably how human beings will act, and this effort has had an influence well beyond the borders of, say, cognitive neuroscience. Glance over anything the peak oil blogosphere has to say about the absurdity of today’s public policies on energy, the environment, or the economy, for example, and it’s a safe bet that somebody will post a comment insisting that this is how human beings always behave. In point of historical fact, though, this is far from true. The popularity of the monastic life across so many cultures and centuries is hard to square with such claims; it has not been uncommon for anything up to ten per cent of the population of some countries and times to embrace lives of poverty, celibacy and discipline in a monastic setting. Clearly, whatever drives push our species in the direction of the satisfaction of short term cravings are not quite as omnipotent as they’ve been made out to be.<br><br>More to the point, those of us who had the chance to get to know people of the generation that came of age in the Great Depression have a solid counterexample to mind. A great many Americans who lived through that long ordeal came out of the experience with a set of attitudes toward material goods that were radically different from the ones we’ve just been discussing. They were, to judge by the examples I had the chance to know, as materialistic as any other American generation has ever been, but the shadow of 1929 lay permanently across any notion that pursuing short term gains at the cost of long term disaster could possibly be a good idea. It’s not accidental that the gutting of regulations on banks that made the current economic debacle possible did not happen until the generation that had witnessed 1929 had passed from public life—nor that it was the generation of the Baby Boom, the first to grow up after depression and war had definitively given way to Pax Americana, that first put today’s culture of short term satisfaction into overdrive.<br><br>The behavior of a society, in other words, has at least as much to do with its recent experience of the world as it does with the deeper but more diffuse influence of the biological drives its members share with the rest of the species. Ironically, Gingrich’s response in the presidential debate pointed this up, though I suspect he himself will be the last person on the planet to realize this. He insisted that just as the United States was able to crush the Axis powers in the Second World War, a mobilization on a similar scale guided by the same optimism and can-do attitude could overwhelm any conceivable petroleum shortage and crash the price of oil. It’s a common metaphor—how many times have people in the peak oil scene, for example, called for a new Manhattan Project?—but in the present context it’s hopelessly misleading.<br><br>The Second World War, if anything, is a textbook case in what happens when optimism and a can-do attitude runs up against the hard facts of thermodynamics. All things considered, the Axis powers had better generalship, more disciplined military forces, and a much keener grasp of the possibilities of mechanized warfare than the Allies had at first, and Germany, at least, was ahead of the Allies in advanced military technology all the way through the war. What they did not have was secure access to fuel—and lacking that, they lost. Russia’s Baku oilfields and the immense US petroleum deposits in Texas and elsewhere more than made up the difference, providing the Allies with practically limitless supplies of energy, and thus of troops, weapons, mobility, and everything else that makes for victory in war. Having those things, they won.<br><br>It’s all the more ironic in that a similar struggle had a similar result on Gingrich’s home turf a century and a half ago. No one can possibly accuse the Confederacy of a shortage of optimism or can-do attitude, and the chief Confederate generals were incomparably better than their Union rivals. What those same Union generals finally figured out, though, was that the North’s larger population and vastly greater economic base meant that generalship didn’t matter; the North simply had to force the South into one meatgrinder battle after another, because even if the Union losses were larger, they could be replaced and the South’s could not. Appomattox followed in due order.<br><br>One of the points that needs to be drawn from these examples, and the many others like them, is that optimism and a can-do attitude are in large part effects rather than causes; or, to put matters a little differently, they are relevant to certain circumstances and not to others. In the twentieth century, a nation with abundant supplies of coal, oil, and iron ore could well afford boundless optimism, and got along better with boundless optimism than without it, because the resource base was there to back up that optimism and give it muscles—and, when necessary, teeth. A nation that lacks such resources but still sets out to act on the basis of boundless optimism, on the other hand, risks ending up in roughly the same condition as the American South in 1865 or Germany and Japan in 1945. Such a nation needs to foster entirely different qualities than the ones just mentioned: circumspection, patience, and a keen sense of the downside risks of any opportunity come to mind. Equipped with these, it’s possible for a nation with few resources to distract, dissuade, and ultimately outlast its potential enemies. That’s the secret of Switzerland’s survival, to cite one example among many.<br><br>The wild card in these calculations comes into play when shifts in technology, on the one hand, or the depletion of nonrenewable resources on the other, changes the status of a nation faster than its internal cultural shifts can adapt. Britain’s history is a case in point. Britain’s empire happened to come of age just as the Industrial Revolution was dawning, and coal—of which Britain had huge and easily accessible deposits—was the essential fuel of that revolution, powering the steam engines and (in the form of coke) the iron and steel foundries that were essential to economic and military power in the 18th and 19th centuries. With the dawn of the 20th century, though, petroleum—far more energy-rich than even the best anthracite coal, and irreplaceable as fuel for gasoline and diesel engines, which were busy putting coal-fired steam power out of business—elbowed coal out of the way. Britain had next to no petroleum supplies of her own, since the offshore drilling techniques that made the North Sea fields accessible were still decades in the future.<br><br>The result was a tremendous new range of vulnerabilities that next to nobody noticed in time. Twice in twenty-five years, accordingly, Britain blundered into a land war in Europe and found itself abruptly scrambling for survival. In both cases, it had to turn to its erstwhile colony, the United States, to bail it out, and the price tag on those bailouts finally included Britain’s empire and its status as a major world power. (There were several other countries just as eager as we were to buy Britain’s empire and status, but—well, basically, we peppersprayed them and left the store with our prize.) Optimism and a can-do attitude counted for very little, for example, when German submarines could throw a noose around the British islands that Britain alone couldn’t break.<br><br>The end of the age of petroleum promises another set of upsets on the same scale, but this time it’s not because some more convenient and concentrated resource has suddenly come on the scene. It’s because the world’s production of conventional petroleum peaked in 2005 and has been declining ever since. A desperate scramble to fill the resulting gap with what appear on the charts as "other liquids"—ethanol, biodiesel, tar sand extracts, you name it, if it can be poured into a fuel tank and burnt, it gets counted—has filled in the gap, at least for now, but all these "other liquids" require much more energy to produce than ordinary petroleum does, and of course those energy inputs aren’t accounted for in the totals. Thus, on paper, we’ve been chugging along a bumpy plateau for six years now, while in the real world—because of the rising energy inputs demanded by the "other liquids"—the supply of fuel available to do anything other than produce more fuel has been steadily sliding.<br><br>The problem we face right now is that it’s only been a few short years since world petroleum production was expanding, and next to nobody has begun to think through the implications of the shift. Neither the United States nor anybody else has the vast supplies of energy and other raw materials that would be needed to back up the confident, brash optimism of an earlier day, and yet we still cling to the notion that those attitudes are the appropriate response to any crisis, because that’s the approach we know. Patience, prudence, hard realism, the cold-eyed assessment of potential risks—those are foreign concepts to the leaders and the populace alike in most of the world’s industrial nations, and especially so here in America, where the cult of enthusiastic optimism has been welded solidy in place since before the birth of the Republic. It has always worked before, and most Americans at every point on the socioeconomic spectrum are firmly convinced that it will work again.<br><br>But it will not work again, because the resources that would allow it to work again no longer exist.<br><br>That is why, dear reader, if you happen to live for another few decades, and have the chance to look back from that vantage point on the years just ahead of us, you are likely to see those years littered with the scraps of any number of grandiose plans meant to overcome the rising spiral of crises taking shape around us right now. None of them will have worked, because none of them will deal with the driving force behind that spiral of crisis—the hard fact that we’ve exhausted most of the easily extracted, highly concentrated energy sources on this planet, and are going to have to downscale our expectations and our collective sense of entitlement to fit within the narrower and more burdensome limits that dependence on renewable energy sources will impose on us. Quite the contrary; every one of these projects will start from the assumption that optimism and a can-do attitude can overcome those limits—and the tighter the limits press and the more obvious it becomes that the limits aren’t budging, the more passionate the claims that one more heroic effort will defeat them once and for all.<br><br>Those claims will come from every point on the political spectrum, and will wrap themselves in every conceivable scrap of rhetoric that comes to hand. Before all this is over, I expect to see people who now call themselves environmentalists advocating for the stripmining of our national parks—in an environmentally sensitive manner, to be sure. We’ve already seen erstwhile environmentalists such as Stewart Brand and George Monbiot championing nuclear power; how poisoning the biosphere with radioactive waste makes more sense than flooding the atmosphere with carbon dioxide may well puzzle you as much as it does me, but straining at greenhouse gnats and swallowing nuclear camels is apparently a job requirement in their field these days.<br><br>What neither the pundits nor the politicians nor ordinary people are willing to consider, in turn, is the one option that offers a meaningful way forward: learning the old and necessary lesson that our desires need to be held within the bounds that the universe provides for us, and that long term goals and values need to trump short term cravings, especially where material goods are concerned. We can no longer afford the sort of attitude that insists that it’s okay to pepperspray our fellow shoppers to get that brand new video game console, or pepperspray the laws of physics and geology to get that extra four million barrels a day of oil (or, more precisely, to get the presidency by pretending we can get that extra four million barrels a day of oil), or pepperspray Canada’s grandchildren to get the right set of pretty figures on the national balance of trade and federal budget. Still, for the foreseeable future, pepperspray will be popular in the corridors of power and the corner tavern alike, and it will take a certain number of unnecessary disasters before that ends and people in the industrial world begin to come to terms with the new reality.<br><br>This, finally, is why I’ve spent the last year and a half passing on what I learned, decades ago, of the do-it-yourself green wizardry of the Seventies, and why I’ve supplemented that over the last two months with some of the basic elements of magic—the art and science of causing change in consciousness in accordance with will—which I also began to learn in the Seventies, and which had rather more than a nodding acquaintance in those days with the movements focused on appropriate technology, organic gardening, and the rest of it. During the years immediately ahead of us, unless I’m very much mistaken, the political, economic, and cultural institutions of the industrial world can be counted on to do just about anything other than a meaningful response to the crisis of our age, and any meaningful response that does happen is going to have to come from individuals, families, and community groups.<br><br>During those same years, I suspect, every available effort will be made to convince as many people as possible that the nonsolutions on offer are actually meaningful responses, and the things that might actually help—using less, conserving more, and downscaling our burden on the planet—are unthinkable. That’s the sort of thing that happens when the world changes, and structures and institutions adapted to an old reality turn out to be hopelessly unworkable in the new one. Next week we’ll talk about what might follow that period, and wrap up the discussion of green wizardry and magic alike for the time being.<br><br>*****<br><br>Those of my readers who enjoy modern dance and are interested in supporting what, as far as I know, is the world's first peak oil-related dance performance may be interested to know that choreographer Valerie Green and her dance troupe, Dance Entropy, are seeking sponsors and donors for their upcoming piece <a href=http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/project/rise_fall_inexplicable_space>Rise and Fall</a>, which is based in part on my book <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/L/The-Long-Descent>The Long Descent</a>. It's a worthy cause, and certainly has more to recommend it than dodging pepper spray in a big box store...

<div class="avt a_b6373a" id=c1033426721404264489></div><b><a href=http://ofthehands.com/ rel=nofollow>ofthehands.com</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Pepper spray certainly does seem to be the antidote-du-jour for all kinds of contemporary nuisances. How appropriate that it showed up on Black Friday.<br><br>Your mentioning, JMG, of the advocating of nuclear power by certain environmentalists reminded me of a small revelatory moment I had not that long ago when reading Chris Clarke's blog post about <a href=http://faultline.org/site/item/why_im_not_voting_for_obama_in_2012/ rel=nofollow>why he wasn't voting for Obama in 2012</a>. In railing against Obama's environmental record, he noted the eagerness to give away untold acres of public land--desert, largely--to banks and energy companies to build massive solar plants. Which would, of course, murder those tracts of land and wreak havoc on those desert ecosystems. I was a bit embarrassed to have never thought through this inevitable outcome of massive solar plants--even though, at that point, I had already realized the folly of my early peak-oil dreams of an industrial future run on solar and wind.<br><br>This just seems to reinforce your call for circumspection in these times. The sense of entitlement in our society absolutely astounds me--and I mean that in the sense that, in keeping with one of the themes of your posts, so few people can seem even to comprehend a society organized in a far different manner and consuming far less. This entitlement seems to be how we get to well-meaning people proclaiming that it's some kind of human right for everyone to have their own computer (or internet device) through which they can connect to a vast, energy-devouring network of information. Which seems to me to be one more indication that we've seriously distorted our view of what is and is not a human right. (Or perhaps that we've taken a certain broadly-applicable idea--access to information or knowledge--and confused it with something very modern and specific--the internet, in this case.)<br><br>Of course, considering I'm writing that while on one of those aforementioned computer--and nursing a Fort George Cavatica Stout, to boot, while sitting in a heated house in Portland--well, the irony is thick. Perhaps that's one of the reasons monasteries have been so common and consistently popular: because people like me find themselves coming to realizations about all the ways in which their lives, cultures and societies fail to make sense and then find themselves trying to figure out how to change their own behavior to something more sensible while still having to live in said culture and society. It's a tricky proposition and one I continue to struggle with. I'm thankful to have this blog as one voice of guidance in that struggle.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=#c1033426721404264489 title="comment permalink">11/30/11, 9:59 PM</a><br><br>

It's very interesting to see just how out of touch anyone post 29 crash is with the consequences of reality slapping you round the face a bit.<br><br>I tried to capture some essence of this in yet another short story inspired by your space bats - (here: http://thepeakoilpoet.blogspot.com/2011/11/land-of-skinny-people.html) but instantly met with aggressive denials by some readers.<br><br><br>Along the path of the last few posts from you and the effect they have had on me i have started to wonder about you. I sometimes get the feeling that in a way i might describe you as someone who is offering a rescue pattern to the disenfranchised Christians of the world. The Christian faith, unlike Buddhism and Judaism and even Islam seems to have had so much of its foundation doctrine shot to hell that millions of people who i would call Christian by background or osmosis are struggling with a faith they can use as a foundation for negotiating every day life. Along comes JMG with something akin to a whole belief system well forged by years of reflection and study on top of obvious practical experience. It is there for the taking. It's not a free ride and the effort invested then becomes part of the emotional commitment that leads to a faith.<br><br>That line of thought has led me a few times to wonder how you personally would feel about it being suddenly picked up by your acolytes and becoming something bigger than you and unstoppable - like many religions have started.<br><br>How do you feel about that?<br><br>pop<br><br><a href=#c6880047336926015426 title="comment permalink">11/30/11, 10:02 PM</a><br><br>

However there will be a lot of weeping and wailing and I've no doubt a few suicides by those who finally realize that the only way for our standard of living to go is down.

I must say that in the last few weeks this trait, long visible just under the surface, has become shockingly bald faced. <br><br>Even as people throw their support into plans discongruent with reality, I often suspect that they, at some ineffable level, feel this tension, this plot hole. I would say that has been my experience in my own life when ever I found my narratives the world showing plot holes. But in a more panicked situation, where I didn't have the luxury of going in my back yard and pacing for a few hours until my narrative changed, without the habit of always trying to modify and undercut my story of things, where plot holes become wonderful clues for potential changes, in a more panicked situation it would feel very natural to rush down a dead end. So, if the current dead end to shot the messenger, as seems to be the case in some of the other peppery spray incidents of recent news, continues it will cripple a lot efforts to do good. There is, in the people I know, a resistance to confront the facts; the resistance seems stronger in the public figures of power.<br><br>I suspect that there are many figures in positions of power that are as able to see the writing on the wall as any of us (though likely in better resolution thanks to access to restricted information,) but if there are they are keeping quite about it. Even if you have a powerful political station or great wealth, what could you do? Even a powerful well informed group might find it difficult to have any control over the way things play out on a grand stage.<br><br>But for us, each of us with our own set of limited resources, we have to work with in our limits, try to create safe territories (not necessarily literal territories) of what ever scale is within grasp. Work together to create these places when appropriate, and go solo when we have to. Living as the mortals we are, with limited the resources and understanding we have. So be on the look out for people worth knowing, needing help, and able to help[you or others]. These human networks are the (comparatively) safe territories we will have to create and live with; be they rural communities, urban groups, tribes, regional resource shares, coops, or even widely spread information sharing networks.<br><br><a href=#c292664430382334253 title="comment permalink">11/30/11, 10:59 PM</a><br><br>

To my mind, the salient question is “What kind of person would want to be in a position of political power, and willingly engage in the posturing, subterfuge, compromising and mudslinging that are inevitably required in achieving that power?” The characteristics that spring to mind are “power-hungry”, “control freak”, “narcissist”, “sociopath” and “megalomaniac”. <br><br>If, generally speaking, this is the quality of person whom we elect to make decisions and act on behalf of ourselves, our children and their children, is it any wonder that our leaders decide and act in the irrational, short-sighted and self-serving ways that they do? <br><br>Even if leaders start out with mostly noble intentions, or the position of power is thrust upon them, the idiom, “power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely” so often proves true. Of course there are exceptions, recent examples being Ex-President Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi and, it goes without saying, a certain Grand Archdruid! <br><br>Warren<br><br><a href=#c2023358183649898175 title="comment permalink">11/30/11, 11:29 PM</a><br><br>

My dad sent me an email claiming that the Sierra Club was keeping us from realizing 5 million barrels of oil a day. I finally got pissed off enough to do 45 minutes of research and told him, with references in scholarly geological papers:<br><br>- Geologist have written about this since the mid-70s.<br>- It still doesn't make any economic sense, as it's too difficult to access.<br>- It would take at least 5 and probably more like 10 or so years to ramp up significant production.<br>- Even at its peak, 15 or 20 years out, it would only produce 2 million bpd at best.<br>- I'm on the Executive Committee of my local Sierra Club and have never heard of any campaigns to stop such a thing.<br>- And finally, that he's probably the person most responsible for my critical thinking and I wish he'd use his own before sending such tripe.<br><br>One other thing that I think counts in a "long descent" is that the US has a lot of slack to take up. European and other industrialized societies use, what, 3/4ths less energy per capita? That's the slack we could let go without even feeling it. I'm almost 45 and was quite comfortable in the '70s with our energy consumption - including some weirdo parents-of-friends who were working on the Small Is Beautiful ideas - and so could very easily stomach sliding back to that.<br><br>Finally, the main impetus to my environmental awareness is that I come from a centuries-long line of cheapskates!

In Europe we have a kind of ‘might be able to do’ attitude, which can often frustrate Americans (and most MBAs) as they equate it with sullenness and even laziness. Last week I went for a beer with a friend of mine from Chicago and, pretty soon, he got onto the topic of the perceived lack of drive here in Denmark. <br><br>What frustrated him most was the Danish phrase ‘Sådan er det det bare’ which roughly translates as ‘that’s just the way things are’. My friend admitted that the oft-used phrase made his blood boil and said Americans were hard-wired to reject such notions of limits (albeit in less polite words).<br><br>But I don’t think phrases like this are unique to Europe (in Britain we say ‘Mustn’t grumble’ with an accompanying shrug) – in much of the East they say ‘yes’ when they mean ‘no’ and in India they wiggle their heads from side to side. You even have your own one in the US in ‘that’s just the way the cookie crumbles’. All of these phrases and gestures, it seems to me, imply some kind of inherent acceptance that may as well be paraphrased as ‘I am saying that it might be possible within the limits that unavoidable outside forces permit it’ … which could be a bit of a mouthful!<br><br>Another thoughtful post!

Earlier this year I ran a series of adult Sunday school classes on the theme, “Cuthbert: The Saint and His Times”. My ostensible purpose was to describe the life and circumstances of this man who gave his name to our church. But my second reason for running the classes was to think through how men such as Cuthbert (634-687) managed the transition from a time of relative plenty and order (the Roman Empire) through what we now call the Dark Ages to the glories of the High Middle Ages (around 1100). <br><br>The transition of his time was not associated with a decline in sources of low entropy energy such as we are facing now. Nevertheless, what they did and how they did it may bear some useful lessons for us. <br><br>Some conclusions that I came to are as follows:<br><br>1. Cuthbert and many of the leaders like him took monastic vows (poverty, obedience, chastity). In those days everyone lived a very basic and limited life style, but Cuthbert and leaders like him went beyond that. For example, it was common for them to fast during the day time, and to have just one light meal in the evening.<br>2. Their monasticism was not one of isolation; they were very much involved in society. Cuthbert himself was a bishop, and he worked closely with society’s secular leaders. <br>3. They were deeply committed men of faith: their religious beliefs were front and center.<br>4. The people of that time had no reason to anticipate a better material life; they rested their hope in their faith and a life after death.<br>5. Although they were living in what we would call a time of transition, there is no indication that they saw it that way. They lived in the moment.<br>6. Theirs was a time of decentralization and deurbanization. Authority rested with local war lords rather than national governments.<br><br>Moreover, the more I read about this man the more I felt that our use of terms such as “The Dark Ages” is rather patronizing. Any society that can produce the Lindisfarne Gospels is not totally dark. (Similarly, the people of the “Middle Ages” didn’t realize that they were in the middle of anything). <br><br>Regarding your comment, “optimism and a can-do attitude are in large part effects rather than causes”, I think that a can-do/positive attitude is important (see my comments to do with Cuthbert), but that attitude must, of course, be rooted in reality. Like you, I attended ASPO-USA this year. One of my take-aways from that meeting was that we need can-do leaders such as Cuthbert to help define and create the post Peak Oil world. I believe that some of that leadership can come from engineers and technologists – people who fully understand the Second Law and who readily pick up rate concepts such as EROEI. With that thought in mind, I have started a series of posts of the topic of “Peak Engineering”.<br><br>Finally, Mr. Gingrich really does need to give some credit to the Russians, the British, the Chinese and many other nations for defeating the Axis powers. It was a team effort.<br><br><a href=#c4310848023977945208 title="comment permalink">12/1/11, 12:46 AM</a><br><br>

Judging from the excellent comments here, I'd say you still get a high enough intellectual EROEI to keep the project going strong for some time yet.<br>I became an occasional Archdruid reader in college back in 06, and have been a religious reader for the past two years or so, eagerly looking forward to your blog with the same zeal that I had with the latest installment of R.L.

Your fascination with and knowledge of history, sci-fi, and esotericism remind me that it's OK to let your Freak Flag fly.

I hope you still have a bit more spare production capacity to squeeze out during these very interesting next few decades.<br><br>I'd like you to know that your writing has had a profound impact on me, some of my friends, and apparently many of your readers. You've gotten this self-avowed libertarian-socialist to study the life and ideas of Edmund Burke, for crying out loud. That, and to make an honest effort to improve myself, to regularly practice mindfulness and meditation, and to circumscribe my desires and keep my passions in due bounds with all humankind. <br>This evening I'm taking a big step forward in that effort, and it wouldn't have happened without your virtual initiation and subtle magic.

I was born at the tail end of the depression. In some sense, the depression for our family never ended because my father was in poor health. He rode the rails as a young man. When I asked him about work during the depression, he said 'there was always farm work, but who wanted to do that?' My translation: 'I grew up in town and my family was above farm work'. When he inevitably lost a job during the late 40s and 50s, his first reaction was to go out and buy a luxury item we could not afford--using the last of our savings. My translation: 'I am still somebody!'. <br><br>So what WAS different during the depression and the first decades of the postwar years? Institutions were conservative with money. One of my first jobs was sweeping the floor in a Savings and Loan. I was paid a dollar. The manager of the office asked me what I was going to do with my money. I didn't know. He said I should always save ten percent, and he opened a savings account for me with my dime. The manager explained to me that 'we don't gamble in the stock market with your money, we put it into good farmland, which will always be valuable'. <br><br>I remember 1955 when it became possible to buy a car on credit. A boyhood friend's father owned a car dealership. He was very much opposed to selling cars on credit, but when sales increased by double digits that year, he swallowed his misgivings.<br><br>Two days ago all the Central Banks in the developed world banded together to send a message that the Big Banks will not be allowed to fail. They will give the banks enough of the taxpayers money to get them through so that they never have to pay for their mistakes. And a message to all those gambling that Bank of America and the like will go bankrupt was clear: 'We will print more money to save the bank than you have to gamble against it'. And stocks rose strongly because the Central Banks had reaffirmed the primacy of corporations against taxpayers.<br><br>So what do I make of all this? First, everything I heard from my parents generation says that they were, as you say, materialistic. Women, when they gathered for conversation, would openly talk about whether Sally or Mary had made a good catch or a bad catch--which was defined in some mix of character and money. More money could definitely offset a few character flaws. Second, humans are seldom capable of following purely rational strategies. We are overly swayed by things like status and the urge to instant gratification. Third, corporations ARE capable of following purely rational strategies. Exxon doesn't spend a lot of time agonizing about Peak Oil. They steadfastly focus on making piles of money. Peak Oil offers opportunities to make piles of money. Fourth, corporations have learned an immense amount about manipulating materials and advertising to take advantage of the innate predispositions of humans. For example, I read some flavorings expert's opinion that children's 'strawberry flavor' should have a strong bubblegum component. Actually feeding children strawberries is nowhere on the corporate agenda. Fifth, corporations have learned to bend governments to their will. It is no accident that a bankrupt corporation just walks away from their debts, like American Airlines, but a bankrupt 20 something with student loans can never walk away from them. And it is no accident that Obama's latest plan to save the underwater homeowner involves changing the debt from something guaranteed by the house to a debt in perpetuity which can only be lifted by death or payment.<br><br>The sum of all those observations is that the individual human is mostly quite a weak person, while the corporations are ruthlessly rational and also quite skilled in the manipulation of humans and governments. Therefore, with the exception of those smart enough to read your blog, the corporations will get what they want to the ultimate detriment of the humans.<br><br>Don Stewart<br><br><a href=#c3073311084269663846 title="comment permalink">12/1/11, 5:28 AM</a><br><br>

I've been reading your stuff for about 1 1/2 years now, starting with The Ecotechnic Future. You've had and I'm sure will continue to have a big influence on me and my thinking. I also read The Long Descent, it's within arm's reach as I type this. I'm also immensely enjoying Star's Reach and looking forward to when I have enough money to shovel a small bit more in your general direction. <br><br>I've also been influenced a fair bit by another author that I become aware of about a year ago, Derrick Jensen. I'm curious about what you think of him. I listened to the long video on Youtube of you talking on Coast to Coast last week about Apocalypse Not. You said something to the effect that you're not at all impressed with Derrick Jensen. I'm not sure what to think of Derrick Jensen myself and would appreciate whatever clarity you can bring to my understanding of his ideas. I ask because, although I find myself agreeing with much of what he writes, I'm left feeling somewhat uneasy with it all. I actually went through the exhausting process of being accepted to the forum named after him, which has added a fair bit to my disillusionment with his thinking. Would it be fair to say that he's practicing thaumaturgy by shocking people with alternating images of beauty and ugliness? Or would it be fair to say that he's limiting his understanding of society by always only seeing it as stratified, and in the meantime shifting blame to those higher up in the hierarchy? These both seem fair enough but I still don't feel like I can quite put my finger on it.<br><br>I'm sorry if I might be putting you in any kind of awkward position by essentially asking you to talk smack about another author who obviously has an at least partially overlapping readership. I trust that you will respond to this question as you see fit. Thank you. And thanks again for all your work!<br><br><a href=#c132273642119644895 title="comment permalink">12/1/11, 6:13 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, it's all too easy to turn solar power into yet another massive, centralized industrial project in the service of collective fantasies of entitlement; the one drawback is that sunlight is so diffuse that it's not really going to be economically viable, except as a way of vacuuming up federal subsidies. Homescale solar for space heat, hot water, and the like, on the other hand, is perfectly viable, but it won't support the lifestyles we think we're owed by the cosmos. As for rights, well, we'll get into that down the road a bit. <br><br>Poet, well, I'm glad to say I have a surefire preventive for becoming the focus of a mass movement. I expect people who work with me to do exactly that: work. I've found as a teacher of magic, for example, that roughly 19 out of 20 people who come to me claiming they want to be personal students aren't willing to put in the half an hour a day or so of meditation and ritual that magical training requires; when I make it clear that that's the one nonnegotiable requirement, they vanish. I hope to see green wizardry grow the same way -- if you get into it, you're committing yourself to actual work, not just sitting around and talking about how cool a backyard garden and solar water heating are. <br><br>I suspect that this is also what's going on with a lot of the people you've called "disenfranchised Christians." Actually following the teachings of Christ is one heck of a lot of hard work, which is why so many people who call themselves Christians prefer to sit on their backsides listening to Rush Limbaugh and waiting for the Rapture. I doubt they'd be any more interested in the hard work of the path I follow!<br><br>Carlos, not at all. I'm just wrapping up the most recent series of posts.

Here in Europe that is the first image coming to mind when we evoke medieval monastic life, so a bit of putting in perspective might be necessary here.<br><br> Besides it has occured to me that the decline of industrial production in Europe has left a magical void - a mental universe of classes, structured around factories, big companies and unions, blue-collar life and activities, but also ideologies and politics - a void which had to be filled by something else. Today's post gives me one element of answer as to what exactly has filled this void. The seasonal frenzies on Christmas decorations is certainly one very strong magical ritual related to our materialistic view of things We will see what else will replace materialism once it becomes a worldview too expensive for us to maintain.<br><br><a href=#c7725505874686181224 title="comment permalink">12/1/11, 6:32 AM</a><br><br>

Like your other readers, I hope you're not planning on stopping any time soon — though I know that you have other pressing demands on your writing schedule...<br><br>I think it's interesting how many of your readers bring up the life of monasticism this week, and how many wish to retreat from the cities to a life in the country. The best one is @ChemEng's discussion of Cuthbert, though (who sounds much like a Druid who made it through the conversion with his training intact). <br><br>As a practicing druid(-candidate) and 'magician', I'd like to remind readers that the word Monk actually comes from the Greek word <i>monachos</i> meaning 'solitary one'. One doesn't have to take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience to live the life of a hermit — one just has to bow out of certain parts of the rat race of modern culture, as the Egyptian Fathers (and Mothers!) did, and as Benedict and Cuthbert did...<br><br>Increasingly, my life looks like that: I get up early to do some yoga and ritual work, do some <i>lectio divina</i> (deliberate, conscious reading), and then go to work. In the afternoon and evening, I usually eat a meal alone or with friends, and avoid music, television, and movies (I was persuaded to go to the Muppet Movie, and I enjoyed it — but I also spent two days afterwards driving the music from the film out of my head... brain worms, all brain worms!) <br><br>I hope that not all the monks retreat to the wilderness, though. I thought long and hard about where to move two years ago, and I chose a small city in the upper northeast — 30,000 people, some open farmland nearby, access to rivers suited for industry and transportation, and lots of local timber. It's too close to a nuclear power plant, of course, and too close to the submarine base in Groton, and... and...<br><br>Perfect? No, not by a long shot. But this state is my home, and it is where I'm choosing to make a difference right now — as a teacher of young people, and as a druid(-candidate), and as a <i>monachos urbanus</i>, a city hermit.<br><br>Remember that the cities will be as much in need of good examples as your wilderness hideyholes, please.<br><br><a href=#c8332959296633479546 title="comment permalink">12/1/11, 8:03 AM</a><br><br>

Last summer I read Ponting's A GREEN HISTORY OF THE WORLD. It seems like business as usual for a civilization in decline to be unable to respond to its mounting challenges. A few years back I was part of a peak oil group and after a very short time it became apparent we were preaching to the choir and not reaching a broader audience. Individual action, as you advocate, is just about the only game in town at this point.

(And actions as well.) <br><br>I loved the way you tied three seemingly disparate events into a theme that in some parts speaks to the blatant materialism that pervades western culture. I had the good fortune to stumble across a related article on "Of Two Minds" where the author, Zeus Yiamouyiannis, speaks in the 2nd part of his articles on debt forgiveness to the generational nature of the current Materialism bent, and speaks of his observation that the newest adult generational group appears to be eschewing joy of materialism for joy of experiential living through social contacts. I hope this new generation whether implicitly or explicitly understands that there is no way for humankind to sustain BAU of the current generation. (Which implicitly sates that I've kind of given up on my (boomer) generation making that leap.)<br><br>On Gingrich's statement - Over the last few years I've observed that the modus operandi of politicos is to get before the camera/interview and throw out whatever bald-faced lie or grandiose statement that gets the tickle-the-base reaction because retractions and refutations seldom occur in the base's limelight. <br><br>Finally, I find myself in the disenfranchised Christianity camp. My reading and understanding of the words of Jesus don't mesh with the actions and words of those who stand tall on their bibles and try to mold us into their concept of morality. I find myself fascinated by your writings about magic and have bubbling around in my head vague notions that perhaps Jesus was a master practitioner of "magic" as you have described magic in your writings. I find myself wondering if there's a way to use the tools of magic as you describe them to deepen my studies and understanding of Jesus teachings. Personally, I would love to learn more from you about the tools of magic in the context as tools to improve my critical thinking about God, the world, and how to change how I live my life.

At the same time, this <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15964306 rel=nofollow>fairly deep economic analysis from the BBC</a> points out that the most optimistic projections show the current "economic downturn" lasting until 2014, and being about equivalent to the 1930-33 depression (shallower, but longer). And those are the best projections, assuming heavy austerity measures (which the public aren't buying), and no further international economic shocks. The result has been that even the relatively far left Liberal Democrats have announced that they will be willing to accept even stronger austerity measures than they have in the past (in their coalition with the right-wing Conservatives).<br><br>Meanwhile, on the topic of climate change, I came across a fascinating article in the local newspaper from my home town (which happens to lie 80km = 50 miles from Durban). The article talks about the traditional Zulu calendar, which is lunar rather than solar, with about 13 months of 28 days each in a year, each named after a natural event corresponding roughly with that time (the return of the yellow-billed kite, the appearance of the first shoots, the lighting of the Winter fires). The <a href="http://www.witness.co.za/index.php?showcontent&amp;global%5B_id%5D=72522" rel=nofollow>article points out that at least some of these are falling out of correspondence with the natural world as the climate changes</a> -- the month of uNhlaba was named for an aloe (inhlaba) that bloomed around April-May.

Your work here for example has in the past seemed such a Herculean effort that few, and much the less myself, could reasonably aspire to like accomplishment. Indeed, as I moved beyond the simple gratification of a weekly confirmation of a shared view and began to learn, I became increasingly concerned that the time committed was inappropriate, competing with the very wizardly labors necessary to establish resiliency. The short story contest was the tipping point. I've not read a single submission, yet, let alone written anything. Thus was a change of consciousness effected, a reordering of priorities, from study to practice. That the invitation to spend yet more time at the keyboard willed me to just the opposite was illuminating. I can always write a story, or read, this blog for example. That option does not disappear. But if I don't get my butt outside and dig the potatoes, they will. Neither activity need be difficult, or hard work. <br><br>What I have come finally to understand is that what is difficult initially, is making a decision from among reasonable options without inadvertently precluding too many of them.

Carl Jung used to comment that when he asked a patient to describe the worst characteristics of the people who bothered him most, the patient inevitably described his own worst characteristics. Nowadays it's very popular to use politicians and the like as convenient inkblots onto which to project our own hunger for power, megalomania, and so on, but that's the same sort of scapegoat logic Jung had to confront in his patients -- and until they got past that, and realized that they were projecting their own bad habits onto a hated Other, the patients remained stuck in their problems. <br><br>Sam, excellent.

I've been hoping to see more people get into this sort of commentary with reference to where they live. <br><br>Cherokee, bingo. I've long thought that the sort of easy answers being marketed by "The Story of Broke" and the like are lullabyes, meant to soothe rather than to solve. <br><br>ChemEng, that's very good to hear! The monastic institutions of the Dark Ages, like their equivalents in similar periods in China, Japan, etc., had immense influence partly because they were local and flexible enough to survive in very difficult times, and partly because they attracted most of the intellectually gifted people of their times and places. Using them as models for the deindustrial future strikes me as a very sensible plan.<br><br>Devin, thank you!

The likelihood that those are still going to be cheap and readily available to most Americans 20 years from now seems remote to me. <br><br>Thijs, as the Dark Ages gave way to the Middle Ages, the monasteries and nunneries did what institutions always do, and slid from their original ideas to become a cog in the social machinery; their role as dumping grounds for unwanted children became so much of an issue that by the late Middle Ages, you generally had to pay a significant sum to a nunnery to get your daughter in. The Dark Age context was very different. As for the anthology, I'm reading and rereading the stories; I've selected enough to fill maybe 3/4 of the finished volume, and will finish sorting the rest in the next couple of weeks, if all goes well. Then it's time to contact the lucky ones and start the editing process. <br><br>Don, that's why I and others working along the same lines are making sure that individuals have the tools they need to parry the thaumaturgy, think their own thoughts, and do something more useful with their lives. An individual equipped with the tools I've been discussing over the last few months is far from weak. <br><br>Justin, thank you for the cheerful note at the end! I had a visionary experience some years back -- yes, I have those now and then, although I don't often discuss them publicly for obvious reasons -- that suggested that when crunch time arrived, those who were willing to face the realities of the time would find it an exhilarating challenge, while those who refused to do so would find it a spiral of total failure ending, as often as not, in death. As with any such experience, it's anyone's guess whether there's any literal truth to it at all, but it's an interesting idea. <br><br>Dain, excellent. That's very good to hear. <br><br>Yupped, I'm not going anywhere. What's next? I've mentioned more than once that we're at the intersection of two massive historical shifts -- the end of the industrial age, on the one hand, and the twilight of America's empire on the other. I've talked a lot about the former. Now it's going to be the latter's turn.<br><br>Hari, I'm not a fan of Jensen's work. It seems to me that he insists on reading the entire cosmos through the lens of his own experience as a survivor of child abuse, with civilization in the abstract playing the role of the Bad Parent. The angry dualism and the advocacy of aimless violence that come out of that seem hopelessly unhelpful to me. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, monasteries in the Dark Ages were self-supporting, raising their own food by the labor of the monks themselves; the same was generally true of Buddhist monasteries in early medieval China and Japan, and you might also check out the Shaker communities in 19th century America, which were wholly self-supporting, and make one of the better models for an indigenous American monasticism. As for your other comment, you're quite right; some new set of social forms will unquestionably evolve to fill the void, though it's hard to guess in advance what they will be.<br><br><a href=#c481599765843106621 title="comment permalink">12/1/11, 11:06 AM</a><br><br>

While I agree with most of your observations, I did have a comment on Monastic orders. If I recall correctly from my High School Psychology class, (I know, it's not a real science) altruistic acts can be motivated by self interest and be perceived to provide the giver with short term benefits. This can be a very different meme than what you might find in say a native american consensus meeting about the effects of decisions unto the seventh generation. While I can't deny that there must be plenty of monks that have good intentions at heart, Evan D. G. Fraser and Andrew Rimas make some very interesting observations in their book 'Empires of Food' about medieval monastic orders, (among many other fascinating implications for our own civilization). According to their research, the growth of some of these orders was about keeping ones belly full. Some of these orders became rich selling food to the starving masses, and even formed the foundation of successful trade routes. To a hungry peasant, hard work and a bit of celibacy might sound like a good deal if it represented personal survival instead of starvation.<br><br>While pepper spraying people to satisfy materialistic impulses is personally inexcusable, it is the not so surprising logical climax of consumerist brainwashing. According to my collage course in marketing of many years ago, the whole point of marketing is to create wants where non existed before. It turns out that 'wants' can be a much more powerful motivator than 'needs'. Clearly, it is working. Indeed, I might argue that the whole #OWS movement is about wants, not needs. The problems we are facing are going to be putting empathy and altruism to the test. Food is the one need that will trump any want. I shudder to think what will happen to our food system when actual fuel shortages develop given how utterly dependent we are today on diesel. One only needs to look at the Middle East to see what people become willing to do if they can't afford to feed their immediate family. It doesn't have to be violent, but their are far too many examples of population decline given in 'Empires of Food'. Perhaps I'm being too cynical, but most people are going to have a hard time thinking about yet to be born great great grand kids if they have survival challenges in their lap. The trouble for us now in the developed countries of the world is that what most people 'believe' constitutes survival (think market defined lifestyle), has little resemblance to the reality of human life.<br><br><a href=#c4363883452551169012 title="comment permalink">12/1/11, 11:06 AM</a><br><br>

I don't know how clearly it came through, but I was writing that the idea that having access to the internet is some kind of human right--an idea which I have certainly seen bandied about--seems a bit silly to me. I would be surprised if the internet on any scale that we know it today continues to exist throughout my lifetime. Saying there is a human right of access to information or knowledge is something that makes more sense to me. But as you write, that is something within the legal and human realm, and not really a function of biology and ecology. It's more about what kind of societies and cultures we want to have as human beings. Point taken.<br><br>As for solar, I imagine we largely agree, as well. Massive, centralized solar plants built on subsidies to enrich powerful interests and attempt to maintain an outsized American lifestyle don't make sense to me, and strike me as little more than destructive. On the other hand, I live on an off-the-grid farm that deals in quite a bit of solar energy, despite its location on the Oregon coast, in an environment with 100 inches of rain a year. Despite these climate shortcomings, we still get a chunk of our limited electricity through a couple solar PV panels (the rest through a more important micro hydro generator) and a significant amount of our hot water comes from passive solar. So believe me, I agree that solar has its place (particularly when taking hot showers on cool summer nights after a long day of farming.)<br><br>Of course, the PV panels seem to me little more than a bridge and bonus based on our current industrial society. I can't see those lasting any longer than the internet, except in salvage mode. But passive solar is brilliant and will have a significant place in our scaled down future. Why every building in this country that uses hot water doesn't have solar hot water panels on it (but almost all do have water heaters powered by gas or electricity) is one more indication that, as a country, we're not serious about sustainability.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=#c2751994941401208963 title="comment permalink">12/1/11, 11:15 AM</a><br><br>

My goal is simply to hand out tools to the ones who are willing to pick them up and use them. <br><br>Adrian, all this is very good to hear. When you get the cold frame, try spinach -- plant it in the fall, harvest it in early spring; it tends to do very well under cover. <br><br>Andrew, a very good point indeed. There's a lot to be said for a less structured monasticism or, to use what used to be the standard term, a regular rather than a secular clergy, in movements such as contemporary Druidry. In fact, AODA is getting ready to launch (or, more precisely, revive) something along these lines in the new year. Stand by for details!<br><br>Doug, individual action is the foundation. Once it's solidly in place, individuals who have changed their own lives can work together on a wider scale, and network from there. One step at a time...<br><br>JohnGoes, the book you want is <i>Experience of the Inner Worlds</i> by Gareth Knight. Knight is a Christian operative mage, one of the major figures in contemporary magic, and this book of his is a guide to magical practice for Christians. (It has a lot of value even for people outside that particular faith, for that matter.) Aside from that, if you'd like to talk shop about magic with me, drop an email to me c/o info (at) aoda (dot) com one of these days. <br><br>Bobo, the interesting thing is that there's no sign that having monasteries lowers the IQs or the cultural or intellectual innovation of a society -- quite the opposite, in fact. <br><br>Professor, well, I've already put my thoughts on that subject in print in my latest book, <a href="http://www.cleispress.com/book_page.php?book_id=433" rel=nofollow>Apocalypse Not</a>. Still, I'll see what I can do. I might even consider a yearlong celebration of failed apocalyptic predictions, to lead up to the next example of the species when the 13th baktun rolls over without incident on 4 Ahau 3 Kankin 13.0.0.0, December 21, 2012. <br><br>Mark, I'll believe "neo-aboriginalis" when I see an example of the species. Right now we've got a lot of people engaged in roleplaying games, if I may be blunt. The species I want to see is Homo humilis, "humble human." <br><br>Kieran, good heavens.

How is it that the advertising convinces us even when we are skeptical of its message? Our attachment to our own happiness, possessions, family, and self creates a lack of perspective that makes us susceptible. However, if we can be mindful of the emptiness of self, we can create a space for choice rather than habitual consumerism. We don't have to live a life that is sold to us—we can make the brave choice to live simply."<br><br><a href=#c631387816051131920 title="comment permalink">12/1/11, 3:27 PM</a><br><br>

I saw it just this morning in some seagulls, a pukeko and some mynahs scrapping over food the neighbor throws on the grass. Grab as much as possible, right now, or lose out. Chase and bash others as required.<br><br>But that is binary thinking, when the reality is far more complex. There is also real value in cooperation, moderation, and rational planning, and we have evolved quite strong drives and abilities in those directions too. While anything from an amoeba on up can grab like a champion, these later strategies are best implemented using that later-evolved feature the brain, and the even later addition called culture. Perhaps compassion belongs at the top of that hierarchy.<br><br>But evolution doesn’t just junk the old when something new comes along. It builds using the old, and on top of the old, and often makes the old a part of the new. The old Grab-It-Now is still with us, still strong, and just as useful as, say, the proverbial hammer: great for driving nails, but for computer repair or making a friendship feast, not so much.<br><br>That’s where I hope that JMG’s real magic can help. Procedures that change consciousness can predispose people to favor using the later developments of cooperation, moderation and rational planning, instead of reverting to the older Grab-Bash-Consume imperative. <br><br>But as JMG notes in this week's post, teams of very accomplished thaumaturges will be promoting attitudes that can only lead to conflict when they steer the populace into a wall. The more that can be done to counter this unrealism, the better for all. So I’m still reading with great interest.<br><br><a href=#c6194708384213505875 title="comment permalink">12/1/11, 3:28 PM</a><br><br>

How can we best do, in the teeth of "Black Friday" consumerism as detailed in this week's blog, what the Sakharovs and Solzhenitsyns did in the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War? <br><br>Or, to take a different, and in some ways more telling, parallel, how can we do what Benedict of Nursia and Patrick of Ireland did during the crumbling of Rome? <br><br>Sometimes one feels paralyzed by fear and grief. <br><br>But it helps a little to think of real monasteries. Among the problems of the Greater Toronto Area, where I live, is the lack of monastic beacons. Such monastic foundations as exist here are small, almost to the point of invisibility. <br><br>That said, one can get a bit of solace out here by pondering the Archabbey of Saint Vincent in Pennsylvania, I think reachable from Toronto with a straightforward sequence of buses, and in the present state of cheap communications easily enough contacted by telephone. <br><br>This morning I opened the latest papermailed Oblate newsletter from that monastery and found in it a sincere, dignified layman's poem, praising the massive Saint Vincent basilica as an emblem of sanctuary and stability. Such things help restore courage, making it easier to ignore the clowns in Ottawa who are purporting to serve us. <br><br>Anyone who shares my grief and my attempted responses, and wants to talk privately about the Rule of Benedict, the Liturgy of the Hours, Catholic Worker, the helpful New Monasticism movement in the Protestant USA, etc, might want to get in touch by e-mail via Toomas.Karmo at gmail.com or by phone via the number visible at the foot of my homepage, www dot metascientia dot com. <br><br>And is there SOME Catholic other than me out there in the blogosphere who is learning Hebrew? One dreams some day of a Mass and a Church-wide liturgy of Morning and Evening Prayer that incorporates at least a bit of Hebrew. It is striking how easily the words "Jerusalem" and "joy" couple in the mind, and how hard it by contrast is to couple the concept of joy with Rome. Jerusalem makes one think of Hava Nagila, of bagels, of klezmers, of celebration. Rome makes one think of tramping legions, of the Catiline Conspiracy, of "Vivit, vivit, et ad Senatum venit" ("He lives, he lives, he comes to the Senate" - said by Cicero of some influential crook), and of the current miseries of our ever-so-sad Church. Oi veh.<br><br>Finally, I am hoping that there will be somebody out there who agrees with me on the importance of preserving some specific cathedrals of Industrial-Era thought, namely the salient Industrial-Era achievements in maths and physics. Does someone, in a week when so many blog commentators are referring to monasticism, agree with me on the desirability of doing this in a neo-monastic setting only loosely coupled to our now dishonest, now business-promoting, universities? <br><br>What is important is not so much concrete scientific results as the spirit in which the results were obtained - the spirit, namely, of formal cleanness, the spirit that expects fuzzy concepts like "limit" to be explained in epsilon-delta definitions, the spirit that refuses to be satisfied with, say, Newtonian mechanics until everything gets written out in ways that are dimensionally kosher. In particular, to be dimensionally kosher is to see to it that sin, cos, and ln get fed as arguments only quantities that are pure numbers: as soon as we find "sin x" in a context where "x" is a displacement, canonically measured in metres, we know that there is bacon on the matzot. And let calculus, especially the differential equations, be purged of the facile and obscurantist "df/dx" notation: let a first derivative be, forever, plain sober "f'(x)", without the perilous, facile, unclear upstairs-and-downstairs-d. <br><br>(signed)<br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br><a href=#c3135950355776524496 title="comment permalink">12/1/11, 7:41 PM</a><br><br>

We are just whistling past the graveyard if we honestly think that a significant % of people are going to voluntarily give up their existing lifestyles in order to save the planet. <br><br>We're all going to go there eventually, but most of us are going to end up living in poverty INvoluntarily. We're all stuck playing a world-wide game of musical chairs, and if <i>only</i> "up to ten per cent" of us try to get out of the game voluntarily, that will still not be nearly enough to prevent catastrophe. Hopefully some of us can save ourselves by dropping out of the rat race before it's too late, but we will still be at the mercy of vast historical forces beyond our control. <br><br>We've been busy growing and canning as much of our own food as possible, and we are going to "unplug" Christmas this year, but if (actually, <i>when</i>) the Euro collapses, my boss will be out of business, and I will be unemployed, and when the US government runs out of money (or prints so much that it's worthless), my husband's Social Security is not going to be sufficient to pay our bills). So, yeah, that whole monastic thing is a definite possibility...<br><br>The leaders and citizens of China (and India and every other developing country) understand that fossil fuel driven economic growth is the only way to escape from the poverty that has plagued them for, like, forever. Thus, they are not going to voluntarily give up their only reasonable hope to catch up to the industrialized West (and in fact many of them see well-meaning Western environmentalists who want to cut carbon use as nothing more than White racists who want to keep the colored peoples of the third world UNdeveloped, and therefore poor forever). <br><br>There is definitely a good correlation between per-capita energy use and physical standard of living (the USA and Canada are good examples), and the rest of the world wants to get a piece of that action sooner, not later. And if they don't get it at all, they will not be very happy.<br><br>Now, the fact that the world will run out of oil before they are all able to achieve a high-energy Western lifestyle is sort of beside the point. China, for example, is currently busy trying to snap up as many resources as possible in Africa, South America, and the Pacific. The world may run out of several vital resources in the near future, but as long as it's <i>everybody else</i> who is left standing when the music stops, the leaders of China will be <i>relatively</i> okay. If the US doesn't build the Keystone XL pipeline, China would be more than happy to pay top dollar (which they have a lot of, doncha know) for that nasty black goo from Alberta, and they WILL burn it. So, we can all just forget about Kyoto, okay? If it were up to us humans, I'm afraid the planet is just going to have to save herself.<br><br><a href=#c6973359233707049547 title="comment permalink">12/1/11, 7:55 PM</a><br><br>

Not that carbon isn't important, I do consider global warming a very major issue, but it seems some are focusing on that one issue so heavily that the rest of the environmental issues are being squeezed out of people's attention. Narrowing people's focus to carbon alone goes well with the agenda of Monbiot and his ilk.<br><br>Anyone else noticed how the "ecological footprint" seems to have been largely replaced by "carbon footprint". While I think the ecological footprint concept is flawed in some ways, it still serves as a useful idea for people looking to change their lifestyles. In my opinion, the change to carbon footprint is a step in the wrong direction, at least the ecological footprint was an attempt to think more holistically about our impact on the environment.<br><br>I personally think the effects of nuclear energy will be worse in the long run than those of global warming. The planet has many times in the past had CO2 levels well in excess of any of the realistic predictions I've seen, but it has never had nuclesr waste strewn around. I think we likely have a number of decades to go before the nuclear effects get real bad in a lot of places, as maintaining the reactors will likely have enough priority to get through the first half of catabolic collapse before large numbers of them fail because they can't be maintained. However, wars could certainly destabilize the situation enough for lots of radioactive caontamination to happen sooner, and Fukushima shows that radioactive incidents can happen in current times too. I see the reactors as like ticking time bombs, but much more insidious. People know of Chernobyl and Fukushima, but few know about Chelyabinsk, Russia where nuclear accidents during Soviet times have left a very sickened population, as the Soviets kept it secret for several decades.<br><br><a href=#c3321135851322216873 title="comment permalink">12/1/11, 9:50 PM</a><br><br>

The words used by commenters and their individual writing styles and thoughts tell so much about the individuals.

Take away one of those components and things get sort of squeezed which is what is happening now. Add in high expectations and you get a volatile mix. But, we are the culture component.<br><br>I'm saying this because, well, there's a bit of hand-waving going on here in some comments. Yeah, we don't control the system. Yeah, corporations act in self interest. Yeah, politicians act in self interest and are also possibly corrupt. Yeah, the environment is getting trashed. You could go on...<br><br>But, here's the naughty bit though. We benefit from the scraps that are thrown our way. The mere fact that we can collectively comment here via the Internet should be evidence enough that the decisions being made on our behalf - as toxic and as short term as they are - are actually benefiting us. <br><br>I'm not saying that I agree with those decisions or actions, but I certainly acknowledge that I personally benefit from them.<br><br>Which brings me to the conclusion that with so many enjoying so much, it would be very unlikely that the powers that be would actually want to move away from the status quo, even when the system is falling apart at the seams.

It is we in the first world countries that are set to fall - not them.<br><br>Yes, I also think that the Euro is doomed.

Ultimately they found they weren't big enough combined to solve their own lending issues and eventually fell to trying to save themselves.<br><br>Still it's not all doom and gloom.

I am thinking of the common self description of the form "I am so I don't ." This statement is made as though this is a concrete inevitable nonmalleable truth. I am not talking about adjectives that reflect hard realities ("I am 4 feet tall so I don't easily reach the top shelf without a stepstool"). I mean expressions like "I am lazy so I don't do physical work" or "I am distractible so I don't finish projects." These feeling are presented as simple facts, even justifications. Once upon a time these sorts of attributes were viewed as challenges within our characters to be overcome through discipline. Now they seem to be worn almost proudly as validations for our actions. <br><br>I'm sure I have told this next story before...<br><br>A few years ago I spend months out on a scaffolding meticulously scraping, sanding, repairing, and repainting our 1886 vintage Carpenter Gothic front porch, the only surviving example of its kind in the entire county. All the others have succumbed to the quick-fix and been replaced by boring 20th century stuff bought at the Big Box Home Center. At one point one of our neighbors driving by stopped and hollered out the window "That's so beautiful! I would never have the patience to do something like that." To which my unspoken reply was "Yes, and that is why you will never have something like this." She just took it as a given that she was an impatient flake, that's all there is to it, and she is almost proud of this fact.<br><br>Apparently in the modern world character is simply what you are born with, and you can no more work to change it that you can grow a third arm. This is especially odd given how much mass culture likes to glorify those who overcome extreme physical challenges, such people with no legs who compete in marathons. But modest individual personality quirks? Just accept them, indulge them, revel in them, and expect the rest of the world to accommodate to you rather than cultivating the teeniest drop of self-discipline within your own constitution.<br><br><a href=#c8365530486978948209 title="comment permalink">12/2/11, 5:42 AM</a><br><br>

I believe the assumption was that the man trained, through ownership or by raising them, the dog and horse. <br><br>I think what we are seeing in the industrial/mass media world is the substitution of parenting skills with mass media bombardment. Infants and young children don't get enough time, forget the drivel about "quality" time, with parents of character and skill in nurturing and instilling in their children the essence of character and integrity, of industry and discipline, and of the values and lore of family and (non-media) culture. Too many generations of the average parent were raised without effective parenting, and just don't recognize the difference.<br><br>What I see in my community is that there are still families that maintain the character and skills of effective parenting.

So, yes, maybe <i>Homo humilis</i> is the more useful imaginative -- we've got a heck of a learning curve ahead of us! <br><br>What I take from your message and my own experience is that right now it is easy to make lifestyle changes and (especially) easy to talk about it, because we feel the limits very faintly. When those symptoms become acute, I think lifestyle changes will start become mundane -- because it will not be voluntary, at least for the wise. We'll see!

Irvine, a professor of Philosophy at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio (not far from my Cincinnati). <br><br>In any case I have started reading it, thinking that this Stoic philosophy has a lot to recommend itself. Though written by an academic, the main point of the book is in offering a "life philosophy" instead of philosophical theory. Stoic tenets could serve us all well, now into the years ahead. I heartily recommend it.<br><br>Alongside that I've been reading "Reinventing Collapse" -also available from my public library. This book, which you cited in one of your own, is also excellent. What strikes me is how he talks about how hard drinking people become as the empire they live in (in this case he is talking about the Soviet Union, for those not familiar with the title) falls apart. <br><br>I was born in '79. Does my generation drink more alcohol and drug it up more than others? I'm not sure. This is another area though, where Stoic philosophy can come to aid. I enjoy alchohol, but don't like getting sick and drinking to excess. Stoic ethics would have us temper those short term cravings. Besides, there are better responses to the coming crises than trying to drink them away.<br><br>I've been enjoying the posts the past few weeks even though I haven't commented. Meanwhile I put insulation on my hot water pipes... lot's more to be done. On my own christmas list I would like to find a good axe for wood splitting.

What's most upsetting to me is when people feel they're entitled to everything at the same time while unwilling to put in the least bit of effort towards it. I'm personally enough of a minimalist with regards to my living spaces that I have no desire for something as ornate as a gothic porch, but that's a choice that I make, and I respect the different choice you've made.<br><br>Another thing I've noticed that's on a similar note is the tendency for the media to overplay genetics. I have seen this in regards to diseases, where an article headline will state that a study shows X disease is genetic, then if you read the article it actually states that it's really only that a gene has been linked to a higher incidence of the disease. However, the headline says the disease is genetic so plenty of people are convinced to think lifestyle is unimportant. A good example of a purely genetic condition is Down's Syndrome, where everyone who has the abnormality has the condition. Many other "genetic" diseases are much less straightforward. Some are genetic in the sense that you need to have the responsible gene in order to get the disease, but not everyone who has the gene gets it, as the gene needs to be activated. Many others that I've seen labeled in the media as genetic aren't dependent on any particular gene to occur, all that's been found is that a particular gene leads to a somewhat higher incidence. Yes, genetics is important, but it really seems to me that many people want to believe it's all about what they are born with, so as to excuse themselves from any attempt to take charge of their own lives. Of course that mindset plays right into the hands of the pharmaceutical industry, too, and so I think that could be considered another instance of thaumaturgy.<br><br><a href=#c6405968493231789215 title="comment permalink">12/2/11, 5:22 PM</a><br><br>

The reporter presented his report from the first canal which was built in the North West of England (my birthplace), beneath a derelict cotton mill. It was an interesting piece of history and ended with the question, “so what is to be the new cotton?” Implying that all we needed was some new material to make and sell and leaving aside the rather more pertinent question of ‘where is the energy going to come from to make, well, anything?’ The only example they provided of the stuff Britain is going to have to make to compete in the global market place (blah, blah, blah), was Graphene – that’s right, technology will save us.<br><br>On the same program we had the ‘honour’ of the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (I think that’s right) – the head military honcho anyway. The main thrust of the feature was that the US military is going to have to dramatically reduce its expenditure because of what’s going on in Congress (debt basically) and how was it going to cope. The interviewer’s opening question was rather telling (I’m paraphrasing): “So what is it like navigating through this period of decline?” To which the guy laughed out loud and of course denied it was a decline and that their military capability would not diminish, that the US would always be able to fight two wars AND all options were still on the table regarding Iran. It was an exercise in imperial bluster (he was in full dress uniform of course, with medals glinting) as an imperial <i>power</i> worthy of the name never has to answer questions about its ability to use that power – it’s a given.<br><br>Once again my thanks JMG for your on-going work, it really does help people and it’s a great comfort to know that Peak Archdruid is not upon us!

It's all part of the broader trend of gelding environmental awareness so that it doesn't get in the way of a lifestyle of crass conspicuous consumption -- the sort of thing that spawns SUVs with ecological bumper stickers on them. <br><br>Bill, I don't claim any kind of infallibility for visionary experiences! For what it's worth, though, the context suggested that "ending in death" was meant to imply "in fairly short order," or at least "earlier than would otherwise be expected." <br><br>Gweb, true enough. Those currently in power owe their positions, not merely to their ability to get the stuff for themselves, but to get it for influential others as well; when nobody can get the stuff, because the stuff isn't there to be gotten any more, the whole current system of influence and authority may come apart in fairly short order -- though what will replace it may not be an improvement. <br><br>Cherokee, and of course that's the thing nobody wants to mention -- the vast majority of the people reading these posts are receiving very concrete benefits from the system that so many of them insist they despise. As for the mulch, good for you!<br><br>Rhisiart, that's what Newt said. You'd be amazed by the number of people on this side of the water who have never heard of Stalingrad or Kursk -- or, for that matter, El Alamein. <br><br>Phil, all very true. Monasticism needs good defensive walls -- a trick that the Chinese and Japanese traditions developed into a fine art, with martial arts as a first rate backup. That might be a lesson worth learning this time around. <br><br>Bill, you've just identified one of the most powerful dimensions of thaumaturgy -- get people to embrace a limiting self-image, and you can all but guarantee that they won't do what you don't want them to do. (Such as, say, doing things with their own hands, instead of buing prefab junk from you.) <br><br>Maria, excellent. The disorientation is a fairly common experience at first. <br><br>Ando, it depends on the individual suburb or river town, but yes, as a very rough generalization, I expect a lot of suburbs to do much worse than a lot of small cities and towns on what were once good transport corridors. You might find <a href=../../2009/08/betting-on-rust-belt.html rel=nofollow>this post</a> a useful intro to my logic. <br><br>Mark, right at the moment it's easier to make lifestyle changes than it will be down the road a bit, because the resources to make those changes are still relatively easy to come by, and the pressures of day to day survival aren't what they will be down the road a bit. Of course it's always easier just to talk about it!<br><br>Justin, insulating your pipes is one of the basic, initiatory practices of Green Wizardry -- good to hear. As for Stoicism, by all means read modern stuff if you wish, but don't neglect the original sources -- especially Epictetus, whose writings are like an ice cold wet towel across the face. To my mind the classic stuff is still far and away the best. <br><br>Kieran, funny!

Most Americans can't. <br><br>Benjamin, glad to be of help! <br><br>Cherokee, the people who take pride in being helpless -- we have a lot of them here, too -- have made a trap for themselves that they will almost certainly never escape alive. By all means learn as much as you can from the couple with the still -- that's a major growth industry in times of decline, you know. <br><br>Traveler, I'm not "suspending" the Green Wizards posts; I've said what I have to say about the subject, and am handing it over to the <a href=http://www.greenwizards.org rel=nofollow>Green Wizards</a> forum on the one hand, and to my publishers on the other. No one person is an expert on everything that might go into a green wizardry toolkit; I studied organic gardening, energy conservation, homescale solar energy, and hand crafts back in the day, and those are the things I'm competent to write about. Now it's the turn of other people, while I turn to another set of subjects relevant to the overall theme of this blog. <br><br>Goat Path, good. Martial arts of the kind practiced in monastic traditions also tend to focus on weapons that are very, very easy to make -- wooden staffs, for example. <br><br>Loon, posts here don't come with an email address attached, even if you use an email address to sign into them. Please drop me an email via info (at) aoda (dot) org and we'll talk. <br><br>Nomad, where did you get the idea that I expect catabolic collapse to go smoothly? I've been saying all along that it's going to be a very rough road. <br><br>Matt, I haven't abandoned it. It's simply that like most American authors, I took a financial hit from the recent bankruptcy of the national Borders Books chain -- the billions of dollars in unpaid bills from publishers that they went broke owing amounts to a lot of royalties nobody is ever going to see. I'm doing better than many, because I also have a lot of foreign sales, but I've had to concentrate a bit on projects that will pay my bills. <br><br>Steve, I don't expect the internet to come apart any time soon. Down the road a bit, once internet access starts going sharply up in price (the likely first sign of trouble), I'll launch a newsletter service parallel to the online Report, and we'll go from there.<br><br><a href=#c8725234256258642686 title="comment permalink">12/3/11, 4:44 PM</a><br><br>

I'm happy to report that, during a week of nonstop clouds and rain, I had a "well, duh!" moment. My waterproof, insulated solar cooker should fill the need. So I found some instructions online, soaked a couple pounds of homegrown, dried soybeans overnight, dug out a cheap little quilted coverlet I bought on sale for $5 or so years ago, which has been waiting in the linen closet to find a use ever since, and VOILA! It worked! The quilt was exactly the right size, the solar cooker doubles beautifully as a fireless cooker, and 2 pots of soybeans - one savory and one boston-style - cooked perfectly using 10 minutes total of propane plus 8 hours inside the cooker.<br><br>I was also happy to discover that I like dried soybeans, which have a slightly nutty flavor, as much as sweet "lima-style" baby soybeans.<br><br>Onward and upward.

That's a good way to save effort and resources, too, since the same device can be used for solar cooking and fireless cooking. In the difficult years ahead, that sort of multiple-use device will likely be valuable to many. <br><br>Nomad, one of the points I've been making all along is that the binary between "slow decline with plenty of time to adjust" and "fast collapse where everything comes crashing down all at once" is based on bad logic and a poor grasp of history. The most likely future we face, to judge by past examples of collapse, is a "stairstep collapse" in which abrupt crises hit, but are followed first by drastic coping mechanisms, then by temporary stabilization at a lower level of prosperity, population, and social and economic integration, then by more crises and a repeat of the process, moving down a step each time. <br><br>Your example of the LA riots is very relevant here; sending in soldiers in full battle gear to stop an urban riot is a very mild example of the kind of coping mechanisms I'm discussing. There's an enormous range of things that governments can do to stop collapse in its tracks over the short term, and no imaginable reason why they would sit on their hands and not do anything, as most fast-collapse models require. <br><br>Now of course the coping mechanisms will only work over the short term; after a period of relative stability, something else will go haywire, and then we get another crisis, more death and impoverishment and breakdown of infrastructure, more desperate expedients, and another period of relative stability followed by another crisis from some other quarter; rinse and repeat over one to three centuries, and you're in the next Dark Ages. That, not some sort of gradual decline, is the model I've been talking about for the last five and a half years on this blog, and it's a source of some annoyance to me that so many people can read that description over and over again and still not get it, because it doesn't fit our culture's preferred binaries.<br><br><a href=#c8165963883176532578 title="comment permalink">12/3/11, 8:36 PM</a><br><br>

I mostly agree with you, but I'm still curious about some things.<br><br>There are two issues. The first one is that we would benefit from purposefully simplifying. That's how I (perhaps too generously) understand his calls for what can fairly be called ecoterror. I don't want to be involved with that myself and I think that for the most part simplification will happen whether or not anyone tries to push it to happen, whether they push gently or violently. So that's probably a moot point.<br><br>The bigger question, however, is about civilization. That's the thing about Derrick Jensen that has influenced my thinking the most, it's a line of thinking that I've been ushered towards by other less extreme thinkers as well. Jared Diamond (The Third Chimpanzee) and Christopher Ryan (Sex at Dawn) are the main people I have in mind when I say that. I would briefly describe it by saying that people evolved in circumstances much different from the ones we find ourselves in now, are much better suited for those circumstances, happier in them, and in better cooperation with the rest of life when in them.<br><br>Can I ask you, John Michael Greer, what you're own personal understanding of civilization might be? What meaning might there be to it? I have a hard time dismissing such a big endeavor as meaningless, but I also have a hard time accepting all the ugliness it's created.<br><br>I can recognize a binary in my thinking. Civilization vs. Pre-agricultural human life. It's also related to valuing nature vs. valuing humanity. Can I also ask how magic, as the study of the human mind (roughly anyways, as I understand it), and druidism, as the worship of nature (again, my understanding being very far from what it could be), go together?<br><br><a href=#c666407642057239516 title="comment permalink">12/4/11, 12:53 AM</a><br><br>

He and others are both extremely confident and extremely pessimistic.

It's made of wood that was logged and milled on-site, and was built in a way that allows just about anything that breaks, rots, or wears out to be easily repaired or replaced. It's a different sort of minimalism, that was not designed or built assuming the eternal existence of a massive industrial supply chain.

The crafts have pretty obviously become luxuries in the rural county where I live now, and poetry gatherings have always been luxuries – I know there will be local arts and crafts as things settle out, but I will mourn the richness of global creativity the way I will mourn the loss of bananas and coffee (if it happens in my lifetime) – accepted as a wonderful icing on a unsustainable cake. :-}<br><br><i>One of the points that needs to be drawn from these examples, and the many others like them, is that optimism and a can-do attitude are in large part effects rather than causes; or, to put matters a little differently, they are relevant to certain circumstances and not to others.</i><br><br>I try to point that out to optimists, but either they are biologically incapable of understanding the realists’ POV, or they are in denial… but anyone who reads history, and especially written-at-the-time history, can see that attitudes change when there is widespread loss of opportunity. And I love the next line, too – and it’s a fact that someone with teeth and muscles has cause for optimism! ;-) <br><br><i>Such a nation needs to foster entirely different qualities than the ones just mentioned: circumspection, patience, and a keen sense of the downside risks of any opportunity come to mind.</i><br><br>This brings to mind conquered nations (such as my ancestral Ireland), which also need to be wily in order to get out from under. Luckily, I believe many Americans have these traits, no matter how rusty they might be. Those who have been hit by the decline are already polishing them up.<br><br>As a side note, One of the manifestations of this “growth mania” that I’ve been noticing lately is that even craftspeople and non-profits seem unable to stay at the level they are comfortable – there’s too often a push for expansion, until they look and sound just like the myriad cloned businesses in the US! I get so discouraged when some group or craftsperson I really like gets “infected” and becomes unrecognizable (coming up with a motto or canned sales pitch is a typical sign)… <br><br>Another random thought: one of the other advantages of learning to live more simply by cooking from scratch is that you re-learn how to plan ahead. Instead of instant decisions about meals, a day or two of advance choice is needed. It's a fairly easy practice that has positive effect on other parts of life.<br><br><br>Also lots of great comments already! I’m only halfway through them, but I want to post this today before I go to finish up the crafts sale. My brief opinion of those in power: many people with hammers seeing a lot of nails!<br><br><br>@Richard Larson: <i>That cold-eyed assessment of the risks is what gets me in trouble with my hope-filled friends and neighbors.</i><br>Yes, I have that problem also. Now that they are finally at the stage of admitting there might be a problem, I’ve progressed to acceptance that it’s a predicament, so I’m not willing to discuss “solutions” anymore – unless they include making do with less!<br><br>@ChemEng: Good points!

I don't know if JMG will mention this author, but I learned about him from this blog a long time ago: Lewis Mumford and his Myth of the Machine (and Pentagon of Power) really helped me to understand a history of civilization a little better in a maybe fairer and more honest way. I hope that helps, those books are really gripping! I also find it extremely annoying that DJ has no problem telling others to do these big crimes like blowing up dams but obviously no intention on doing anything himself. I think I'd have much more respect for him if he got into trouble for doing something for once. I also find that when you read DJ you get a binary: "civ is murder" vs "everything else." It's possible to disagree with the ways our society has done things while still, well, not being a fan of DJ.<br><br>Plus I get so tired of envisioning him making love to everything.

I was startled into confirmation of this recently as I had a chance to see movies of myself from infant to age 4ish, and noted that not once in any of them did I smile or laugh, though children around me at similar ages did, and my younger sister, when she showed up, also did. I have to assume that my serious and introverted nature was either something I came in with or was cemented by the time I was christened at 3 months! :-} Even though I overlaid that with a gregarious persona, underneath I don’t think I’ve changed in 50 years… I’m not saying we can’t change or try to address personal limits, but I am saying that some folks more easily fit certain situations and I see no reason why we can’t allow diversity to ease us into situations we’d be best at.

They were so popular both in Europe and for example in China for materialistic reasons: they simply offered a way out of the worst poverty and education "for free". One would not have to pay taxes, one was fed on a regular basis and usually lived in much better conditions than if one struggled as a serf or one of ten sons of of poor peasant. And for this reason the motivation for persecution of Buddhism in 9th century China, a famous case, was almost wholly economic. Therefore, I would not exaggerate the willingness of people to choose frugal life, though I do not contest the fact that frugality was encoded in premoderdern cultures in a very different way than today and that it could have a very important position.<br><br><a href=#c1266778067034360084 title="comment permalink">12/5/11, 2:15 AM</a><br><br>

I respect that you saved that house from ruin.<br><br>Hari, Matt and Jess,<br>On the Derrick Jensen discussion, I feel the same way as JMG, not at all impressed. I ran across this recently, http://www.alternativesmagazine.com/39/jensen.html<br><br>He actually believes that a few computer hackers could "bring down civilization". I'm not enough of a computer person to know how much damage those hackers could actually do, but I do know the obvious, civilizations have been around for thousands of years before computers, and even if hackers could take down the whole internet it would not come close to bringing down civilization.<br><br>I don't consider lumping all of civilization together to be helpful at all, nor do I consider lumping all primitive peoples together any more helpful. Is it not enough to just say that humans are capable of creating an incredible diversity of cultures. The circumstances of some cultures are better for ourselves and for the environment than others, but I still wouldn't say it's all a matter of civilization versus primitive, Can Jensen and his ilk not imagine any other alternative, maybe one that incorporates aspects of societies past and present as well as new aspects that haven't even been dreamed of yet.<br><br>I can respectfully disagree with someone like Daniel Quinn, who has the same dichotomy as Jensen but much less destructive suggestions for people. However, Jensen's "solutions", if ever followed through by a significant number of people, only will make things much worse. The sort of violence he advocates would not accomplish his goals of bringing down civilization, but only lead to more misery, and with more people in fear, that would probably lead to an increasingly authoritarian government that people would support to end the terrorism, the opposite of what Jensen hopes for. To top that, Jensen rallies against people being the change they wish to see in their own lives, insuring that his followers will remain hooked to the system and feeding it while dreaming of destroying it.<br><br>Jensen himself refuses to do anything which he preaches to others to do. I think he desperately wants this violent revolt against civilization, but doesn't have the guts to do anything himself, so just hopes that if he's writes about what he wants done enough, others will do it for him.<br><br><a href=#c2581197403529557096 title="comment permalink">12/5/11, 8:40 AM</a><br><br>

"Civilization" is one of those abstractions. It's simply a label for societies that fall toward the upper end of the spectrum of human social complexity; there's no rigid line separating such societies from the rest, much less the sort of Gnostic dualism offered up by Jensen, Quinn et al. -- or for that matter the equal and opposite Gnostic dualism offered up by true believers in progress. <br><br>As for the intersection of magic and Druidry -- well, do you think that the human mind is somehow separate from nature? In what possible sense could it be? Human nature, after all, is part of nature in general...<br><br>Hadashi, thank you! If <i>The Long Descent</i> ever gets turned into a documentary, I'll see if I can't talk the producers into using that Grobschitt piece in the sound track!<br><br>Draft, I wouldn't go that far. Chris is very confident in his model of the future -- to my mind, more confident than he should be, given the usual cussedness of history -- and I'd encourage people to take his predictions with a grain (or a shaker) of salt, just as I'd encourage them to sit back and assess what I say, rather than taking it on faith. Still, I don't think he's a huckster -- simply someone who sees that our society is about to run off the rails, and is yelling himself hoarse trying to warn others. <br><br>Bill, true enough. Still, there's also the difference between death as an unavoidable reality that comes at the end of one's lifespan, and death in fairly short order as a wholly avoidable result of hopelessly self-defeating behavior patterns. <br><br>Edward, Cherokee's comment further down sums up my definition. As for Epictetus, he got me through the most difficult time of my adult life, the months after the death of my son. As a way of facing life that stands up to whatever life can fling at it, Stoicism stands up very well indeed. <br><br>Lance, exactly! One of the basic principles of systems thinking is that complex systems of all kinds behave in parallel ways. I think of it as a corollary of the Emerald Tablet's dictum, "As above, so below." <br><br>Cathy, good points all. I've seen the same sort of growth mania across the board, and it's ruined more good businesses, nonprofits, or what have you than I care to think about. There's a reason why AODA's policies deliberately put up barriers to fast growth!<br><br>Shadow, if you'd like to suggest that the American people in general have some sociopathic qualities, I'm not going to argue. My point is that blaming the so-called "1%" for behavior that's common throughout our society is probably not a helpful habit.<br><br><a href=#c7572086533501776165 title="comment permalink">12/5/11, 12:35 PM</a><br><br>

Every human institution starts off with its own ideals, and then slides away from them -- monasteries no less than any other. The monasteries of the Dark Ages, which is what I was talking about, were very poor, offering a life that was impoverished even by the standards of the time. Of course after a few centuries of donations nd the like, laziness crept in -- and that's when new monastic orders were founded, returning to the old strictness and poverty. Doubtless the ecosteries of the 26th century will be known for their cushy lifestyles, but we have a long hard road to go before we get there. <br><br>Bobo, the people who go into monasteries are not necessarily any more peaceful than the people who stay outside them. A lot of aging knights retired to monasteries after a career of bloodshed, and for that matter, I suspect you've heard about the Shaolin Monastery! Nor does there seem to be any tendency for societies with monasteries to be more violent than societies without them.<br><br><a href=#c4627161878494394537 title="comment permalink">12/5/11, 12:44 PM</a><br><br>

Just this evening I came across the reading material from one of my Academy courses: "Revolutions as Changes of World View" by Thomas S.

It's kind of weird because I commented last week that I also took a hit to my income recently. Perhaps this is what the coal face of decline looks like?

More on that a little lower.<br><br>Ozark: I'm not sure about the purpose to that link. I'm guessing it is to illustrate how dangerous Jensen is. I remember that excerpt from that book. I don't remember responding to it when I first read it the same way I did while briefly glancing through it just now, which seems noteworthy. I'd like to point out that I'm not very concerned with Derrick Jensen at all right now. I asked that question. It has led to related but separate questions that seem to me to be much more important, questions about civilization and about the relationship between humanity and nature.<br><br>John Michael Greer, Thanks again for your response. It really is very impressive how you respond to everyone of us. <br><br>Permit me to quote you shortly, "It's simply a label for societies that fall toward the upper end of the spectrum of human social complexity". With all due respect, I'm afraid that you're assuming that I meant something other than I did. My use of the word civilization may very well have been misleading, but I knew what I meant. I understood civilization to refer to all societies ranging from the most complex to anything agricultural and settled, no matter how simple. I suppose you could say I have less of a binary of "civilized societies" vs. "uncivilized societies" and more of a binary of "agricultural societies" vs. "pre-agricultural hunter gathering societies". <br><br>I'm sorry to have used a misleading term but I believe that the question I asked is still useful and helpful. Let me state it again. It seems to me (I cited sources earlier, although do admit the list seems a little sparse) that the dawn of agriculture was a very regretful affair and has continued on downhill from there. As I said before, I have a hard time dismissing such a huge endeavor as meaningless. What meaning might there be that might compensate somewhat for how very regretful agriculture seems to have been? <br><br>About my question regarding nature and the human mind and your answer to it: my question was very vague, you do an incredible job responding to everyone, I already spent some of your attention on another question and, like I said, the question was vague. I'm a little embarrassed to have thought that I might have gotten a more in depth answer. But, I do have to say (and I hope you take this humorously), that I feel a little like I might if I were to ask Obama about the relationship between race and politics but only heard from him something along the lines of, "Yeah, they're related, what did you think?" In any case, I think I need to continue thinking about how to express that bit of curiosity I have more clearly.<br><br><a href=#c4836308121107809099 title="comment permalink">12/6/11, 9:38 AM</a><br><br>
