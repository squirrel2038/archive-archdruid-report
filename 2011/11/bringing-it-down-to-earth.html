We’ve covered a lot of ground in the last two months or so, and at this point I want to summarize the territory thus explored and link it back into the core of this blog’s project—the search for a realistic understanding of the troubled future ahead of us, and a meaningful way to respond to it. One crucial part of that response, I’ve suggested, relates to that tangled realm where consciousness meets the unconscious drives that shape so much of our experience of the world: a realm that contemporary thought addresses, however incompletely, through the science of psychology, and that the older lore of magic approaches in a much more comprehensive and potent way.<br><br>That latter lore is only one part of the toolkit we’re going to need to deal with the storms to come, but it’s an important part, and it’s well suited to deal with issues most of today’s proposals for the future leave unanswered. Much more often than not, peak oil, anthropogenic climate change, and most of the other symptoms of our civilization’s head-on collision with planetary limits to growth are treated as technical problems that can be addressed with technical solutions. Bookshelves around the world have accordingly been piled to the breaking point with proposed technical solutions. Some of them are basically handwaving, others are attempts to shill for one or another industry or political movement, but a fair number are serious proposals that could do at least some good if they were put into effect.<br><br>The difficulty, as I’ve discussed in previous posts, is that none of these plans are being put into effect, and there’s no good reason to think that any of them will be. Quite the contrary: by and large, modern industrial civilization is moving the other way, following the same trajectory of overshoot that has terminated the history of so many other civilizations. What’s more, we’re not being dragged down that road, or forced along it by the pressure of circumstances; by and large, we’re going that way with whoops of enthusiasm. When the United States abandoned its last real attempt to head in the other direction, in the early 1980s, the collective sigh of relief must have been audible on the Moon, and anyone who didn’t join in the stampede along the road to overshoot—and I can speak here from three decades of personal experience—came in for a spectrum of nasty responses, ranging from spluttering abuse to scornful pity, from pretty much anyone else who noticed.<br><br>That is to say, it’s not the technical dimension of the predicament of industrial society that matters most just now. It’s the inner dimension, the murky realm of nonrational factors that keep our civilization from doing anything that doesn’t make the situation worse, that must be faced if anything constructive is going to happen at all. In a civilization that’s spent the last three and a half centuries trying to pretend that this inner dimension doesn’t matter, it was a foregone conclusion that most people’s inner lives would end up an unholy mess. It doesn’t help matters at all that plenty of political, economic, cultural, and religious interest groups, some of them with prodigious resources at their beck, have put a very large fraction of those resources into schemes to manipulate people’s minds using any number of nonrational hot buttons, in order to maximize their own wealth and power.<br><br>An effective response to this predicament, as I’ve proposed here, involves several unfamiliar steps. The first of them is to get out from under the collective thinking of our society and the manufactured popular pseudoculture that holds that collective thinking pinned firmly in place in the minds of most people, so you can make your own decisions about what goes into your mind, instead of letting huge corporations ante up millions of dollars to choose for you. (It still amazes me how many people never wonder why what appears on TV is called "programming.") This is a challenging task, made even more so by the blank incomprehension and active hostility of those who are still down there in the belly of the beast, but the payoff is worth it. The problem with thinking thoughts that you’re told to think by others, after all, is that the people who tell you what to think are doing it for their own advantage, not for yours; think your own thoughts, and doors open before you that the thoughts you’ve been told to think are meant to keep tightly shut.<br><br>The second step is to learn how to get along with the nonrational side of your own inner life. There are any number of ways to do that; various schools of psychology, philosophy, religion and magic all have their own toolkits for this kind of work, and what appeals to one person is certain to repel somebody else. I’ve discussed a handful of useful mental tools, drawn mostly from one tradition in which I’ve had some training, and they may be enough for those readers who don’t feel any attraction to the more intensive work on offer from the schools just mentioned. Those who do feel such an attraction can find more detailed guidance in whatever tradition they choose to study and, more importantly, to practice.<br><br>These two steps provide the neglected mental dimension that’s so often missing in attempts to deal with the future bearing down on us. Without them, with weary inevitability, proposals for change end up gathering dust on the overloaded bookshelves already mentioned, if they don’t simply mutate into yet another excuse for business as usual. Einstein’s famous dictum—"We can’t solve problems using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them"—is true, but it’s only part of the whole picture. You can change your thinking all you like, but if you don’t deal with the nonrational factors that drove your previous thinking, your brand new thoughts are going to head in the same old directions. Only if you distance yourself from the thaumaturgy that predetermines so much human thinking, and then come to grips with the mental automatisms and unthinking reactions within yourself, that you can pick the locks on what Blake called "the mind-forg’d manacles" and choose your own path.<br><br>Once all this is done, though, there’s a third step, which consists of bringing the work you’ve done down from the realm of mental phenomena into the realm of everyday life. That’s an essential element of magical practice, by the way; it’s a core teaching of the old occult philosophies that your magical work, however deep it may reach into the innermost realms of consciousness, has to be brought all the way down to earth, and anchored right here in the world of matter by an appropriate action on what occultists like to call the material plane. Put more simply, in magic as in anything else, it’s necessary to walk your talk, or the talk dries up into excuses and goes rolling away like tumbleweeds in the wind.<br><br>One question that needs careful consideration, though, is how to walk the talk we’ve been discussing over these last few months—or, to put the thing in more explicitly magical terms, how to choose an appropriate anchor for the movement of consciousness I’ve tried to set in motion in the last two months of blog posts. The careful consideration is essential here for several reasons, but the most important of them is that contemporary culture is well stocked with bad advice on this subject.<br><br>Thus it’s a very common notion, when the issue of walking your talk comes up, to think that it’s enough to engage in activism—in other words, to walk your talk by insisting that the government, or the big corporations, or other people in general, get out and walk theirs. Activism has its place, to be sure, and potentially an important one, but activism only matters if the people who are doing it have already followed Gandhi’s advice and become the change that they wish to see in the world. When that first necessary step doesn’t happen, activism fails. Those of my readers who have watched the self-destruction of the climate change movement have already seen how far activism gets when the activists show no signs of accepting the limits that they hope to impose on others.<br><br>Beyond that, there’s another problem with activism in this context, which is that it amounts to demanding that somebody else do something. There are times when this is an entirely appropriate thing to do—when, for example, it’s precisely the actions or inactions of a government or a corporation that need to be addressed. Not all the difficulties that beset a modern society come from such causes, though, and when a problem is actually being caused by habits of thought and action that are shared by everyone—even when some people engage in them more, or more profitably, than others—trying to make a handful of the worst offenders take the blame for everybody is not an effective strategy. Nor is it any more helpful to insist that a few people, however rich and powerful they may be, are to blame for changes that have their origin in factors entirely outside of human control.<br><br>The Occupy Wall Street protests that are still struggling gamely on as I write this, despite a rising tide of police repression, have fallen into both these latter traps. Though the culture of larceny that defines Wall Street these days amply deserves criticism—not to mention the legal charges of racketeering and fraud that the Obama administration has steadfastly refused to file, even in the cases that most stridently call for it—the misbehavior of bankers and stockbrokers doesn’t actually have that much to do with the decline of the American economy that has deprived a great many of the OWS protesters of the chance to earn a living. Central to that decline is, first, the unraveling of the American global hegemony that, until recently, funnelled some 25% of the world’s energy resources and 33% of its raw materials and industrial product to the 5% of humanity that lives in the United States; and second, the ongoing depletion of those same energy resources and raw materials, which is ending the abundance that made the American lifestyle of the 20th century possible in the first place.<br><br>No amount of protesting is going to refill the once vast and now mostly depleted reserves of cheap oil and other resources that gave America its age of extravagance, nor is protest going to do anything to stop the decline of America as a world power or the rise of competing powers. Blaming the results of both these processes on the manifold abuses of Wall Street is not going to help the situation noticeably—though seeing bankers and stockbrokers doing perp walks through the streets of Manhattan might do a little to restore public faith in the rule of law, which has taken quite a beating in recent years. Most Americans, ignoring these realities, still insist they are entitled to a standard of living that neither their country’s faltering position in the world, nor the hard facts of physics and geology, will enable them to have for much longer, or get back if they’ve already lost it. Until that sense of entitlement gives way to a more realistic set of expectations, nothing is going to solve the problem Americans think they have—that of finding a way to hang onto hopelessly unsustainable lifestyles—and nothing is going to be done to deal with the predicament Americans actually face—that of dealing with the end of abundance in a way that doesn’t finish shredding the already frayed fabric of our society.<br><br>Any attempt to walk the talk that we’ve been discussing here, in other words, has to begin with the individual, and has to start with the acceptance of a very significantly lowered standard of living. To return to an acronym I’ve proposed here already, any response to the future that doesn’t involve using LESS—<i>L</i>ess <i>E</i>nergy, <i>S</i>tuff, and <i>S</i>timulation—simply isn’t a serious response to the downside of the industrial age. The toolkit of the Seventies organic gardening and appropriate tech movements, which I’ve discussed here at some length, is among many other things a very effective way of responding to the need to use LESS in a humane and creative manner.<br><br>By growing a garden and raising chickens in your backyard instead of buying packaged and processed vegetables and eggs that are shipped halfway across the continent, conserving energy relentlessly and getting as much as you can from local renewable sources, and sharply downscaling the pursuit of material excess in favor of a life that’s rich in experiences, relationships, and meaning, it’s possible to get by very comfortably on a small fraction of the energy, stuff, and stimulation that most Americans think they need. This isn’t simply a good thing on abstract grounds, though it is that. On the individual scale, such steps provide a margin of safety in hard times that the ordinary American lifestyle simply doesn’t have; on the community scale, those who embrace such steps are positioned to act as role models and mentors for those who decide to make the same changes later on, when the advantages of doing so are likely to be much more evident; on the wider scale, even a very modest movement in this direction, amidst the widening failure of the political and economic mainstream to do anything worth noticing in the face of the widening crisis of our time, might just possibly fill the role of a seed crystal around which a much larger movement could take shape.<br><br>Seen from another perspective, though, these practical steps also have a magical dimension: they serve to bring the changes in consciousness we’ve been discussing for the last two months all the way down into the world of everyday life. To complete the task of breaking away from the murky thinking and the tangled nonrational drives that dominate contemporary life in today’s America, it’s necessary to break away from the lifestyles and everyday choices that are produced by that thinking and those drives. Mind you, the same equation works the other way around: to make the break away from lifestyles that demand energy and resource flows we can’t count on getting for much longer—and making that break is perhaps the most essential task of the decade or so immediately before us—it’s going to be necessary to turn away from the thinking patterns and the unmentioned and usually unnoticed passions that make those lifestyles seem to make sense.<br><br>The recognition that these two transformations, the outer and the inner, work in parallel and have to be carried out together is the missing piece that the sustainability movements of the Seventies never quite caught. Significant steps were taken toward that discovery; books such as Gregory Bateson’s <i>Mind and Nature</i> and E.F. Schumacher’s <i>A Guide For The Perplexed</i> lay out much of the groundwork from which an analysis of the sort I’ve been suggesting in these essays could have been built. Some of the less intellectually vacuous movements in the alternative spirituality scene of the time were moving in the same direction from the other side of the equation. Still, it never quite came together; the engineers were too dismissive of the occultists, the occultists were too suspicious of the engineers, and when the Reagan administration came into power and hit the entire movement at its most vulnerable point—the flows of government and foundation grant money on which nearly all of it, appropriate tech engineers and New Age theorists alike, had become fatally dependent—the chance at that recognition went by the boards.<br><br>That could happen again. I’ve suggested more than once that the troubles looming ahead of us in the near term may well open a window of opportunity for the same kinds of effort toward sustainability that we had, and then lost, in the wake of the energy crises of the Seventies. If something of the sort does happen, once the immediate crisis is out of the way, there will inevitably be a backlash, and that backlash will likely wield the same tools of thaumaturgy that were turned on the appropriate tech movement in the early 1980s with devastating effect. Good intentions and idealism, it bears remembering, are not an adequate safeguard against systematic manipulation of the mass mind, especially when that manipulation moves in parallel with the desperate craving of a great many Americans to have the lifestyles they think they deserve and ought to get.<br><br>Meeting a challenge on that scale is a tall order. Still, any movement faced with a backlash of that kind can accept its short term losses, renew its commitments to its values and vision, keep on going straight through the initial waves of negative publicity, and carve out a niche from which it can’t be dislodged, and pursue a long-range strategy, knowing that the tide will eventually turn its way. With a few worthy exceptions, that didn’t happen in the twilight years of the early Eighties, but many other movements of many kinds have done it, and a noticeable number of them have passed through that stage and gone on to accomplish their goals. Whether green wizardry or the broader peak oil movement reaches that last milestone is up to the future; for the time being, though, while it’s vital that we be ready to respond if a window of opportunity does open for us, it’s even more vital that when the backlash comes, as the Who put it, we won’t get fooled again.

When Clinton recently appeared on TDS he stated that solar and wind are now cheaper than nuclear power. Coal, too, if you factor in coal's associated health costs.<br><br>So even if WS is not directly responsible (many contributing factors, including public-private partnerships, etc.), the anaology of diversifying our (energy) portfolio is apt. To whom would you assign responsibility for the continued monopoly on our energy portfolio? The less than freely-competitve energy market has essentially made it possible to manipulate markets for maximum profits and - at the very least - contributed to the global sense of being forced to the endure the wild fluctuations at end of one paradigm while scrambling to create the next before it's too late. <br><br>Even without knowing the details (we're all ears), one gets the intuitive sense that all that trading in futures might have something to do with it.

It's also possible to see the mental and material as distinct, but link them up in deliberate ways. You're quite right, though, that most spiritual traditions recognize the need to make the connection with everyday life. <br><br>Mouser, er, if you get your energy analyses from politicians you're generally going to be led astray. The reason solar and wind aren't taking over from coal, oil, and natural gas is that they're not economically competitive in the real world -- whatever the fancy numbers churned out by promoters claim -- and that, in turn, is a function largely of the low net energy and very diffuse concentration of energy in sun and wind, as compared to the high net energy and highly concentrated energy in fossil fuels. <br><br>Right now the only thing that makes solar and wind viable is government subsidies -- of course that's also true of nuclear power and ethanol, just for starters. In the long run, sun and wind will be what we have when the fossil fuels are gone, but they're not a viable way to prop up our current unsustainable lifestyles -- only fossil fuels will do that.<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c6900235988737153444 title="comment permalink">11/23/11, 10:04 PM</a><br><br>

One is that you dislike the holier than though attitudes that come from some quarters such as San Francisco, about how they are more "green" than others, and so forth. The other is that we need to walk our talk so that others see that we do what we say. I agree that those who claim to be "green" or don't walk their talk are annoying.<br><br>But to most people I think these two preferences are contradictory. When I eat with acquaintances they are surprised to find that I'm vegan and tend to pack my own food that I grow much of myself. Mostly this is for convenience since there's little vegan food around. It's also because I can't raise animals. Just by virtue of being vegan I'm seen as a sort of weirdo. It gets worse when I'm asked why I'm vegan or grow my own food. I'm then elevated to a holier-than-thou/weirdo/threat. That's despite the fact that I am not pushy in any way.<br><br>Many trendy young people, for example, in places like New York and San Francisco have gotten into urban gardening, bicycling, making their own clothes and honey and beer and tools and so forth. And yet these people are generally annoying to everyone else, myself included. Maybe it is because they seem to be doing the "right" things for the "wrong" reasons? Or because of the fact that they are conspicuous about it? But isn't being conspicuous good?<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c5279852767384068352 title="comment permalink">11/23/11, 11:27 PM</a><br><br>

A self sufficient life style built around farming seemed like the best way to support a 'life of the mind' when we first considered the problem three years ago. Socrates recommends a simple life, the Epicureans tried to have it, the monasteries of Europe survived the fall, Nietzsche sought to be a gardener, Emerson, Thoreau, Wittgenstein became a gardener, Heidegger idealized peasants; the idea of building up from the simplest building blocks of human life a good livelihood has been bouncing around in philosophy for some time. Since that time issues like peak oil, economic instability, and the displaced peoples of the upcoming century have many times given new meaning to the project.<br><br>We have been saving money, collecting resources, learning the basics of self sufficient living (yay for wwoofing!) and continuing to reequip our mental tools kits (thanks for the recent talk on magic, I have found several useful 'tools' in those posts!); now we are getting ready to make our move and start land shopping once the weather warms in the spring.<br><br>During those three years many others have shown interest, but mostly only as a fall back plan in case their personal solution to keeping us on the track of progress goes bust, and only a few people are sincerely interested. A few is plenty to start with, forming community is nothing to sneeze at, so far as challenges to deal with go.<br><br>The final winter, waiting to make the decisive move of getting land and building a farm/school/thinkery/community looms and brings with it a restlessness, and the material realities of life often leave me with less to do that feels like a productive move then I would like.<br><br>Your way of discussing magic along side more familiar view points of philosophy, psychology, and science has been helpful in forming many useful connections in thinking to accompany the more down to earth skills I have been trying to acquire. Now thinkers from countless intellectual traditions seem to be presenting themselves with ideas to contribute to the project and solutions to some of the more entrenched mental befuddlements that I have thus far recognized. Thank you.<br><br>P.S. - I smiled when you mentioned Bateson, I was recently turned on to him. Many of his ideas have been seeping into my head, helping to connect things I would have never have thought to cross.<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c6766437156197714620 title="comment permalink">11/23/11, 11:59 PM</a><br><br>

Of course, the broadcast was mainly concerned with your book, "Apocalypse Not." But enough bread crumbs were thrown out there to lead interested people to this blog, the Green Wizards blog or your other books having to do with the long descent and the ecotechnic future. (As a side note, we'll know we've arrived when the spell check recognizes "ecotechnic.") <br><br>There was one part of the broadcast where you talked about yearning for apocalypse as a kind of wish fulfillment of some kind of more perfect future. But waiting around for one kind of apocalypse or another doesn't really take much effort or investment. <br><br>I had to poke around in that murky inner dimension, and not too deeply, to discover that some of my interest in peak oil is of the waiting for the apocalypse kind.

A tight old two bedroom house (room for my aged father, if he likes) with a garden spot, overgrown herb garden and four old fruit trees in the front yard. Some drawbacks.

I have to say I find almost every week an experience of light bulbs coming on and new connections made. I had some bits of my mind opened to magic years ago from some odd experiences in my own life, from Robert Anton Wilson's Cosmic Trigger, and from Scott Adams of all people (author of the dilbert cartoons). Even though I sensed that there was something to this, I packed it up into a box and set aside because at the time I couldn't fit it in with the rest of my rationalist world view.<br><br>Enter Mr Greer, whose writing (especially the theory of catabolic collapse) convinces me that he's one of the clearest thinking and most rational people I've come across... who starts talking about magic! So I give him the benefit of the doubt and he proceeds to provide me with a way of understanding it that can sit comfortably in my mind along with the science and engineering. Sincere thanks, sir!<br><br>I've purchased Learning Ritual Magic and the Druid Magic Handbook - found myself reacting against the former, but the latter seems a natural and comfortable fit. I have a couple of "dumb questions", and while not expecting the forum to act as a "magical helpdesk" would nonetheless appreciate any opinions:<br><br>1. In the elemental cross part of the sphere of protection (and with directional aspects of rituals generally), should I reverse south and north as I'm in the southern hemisphere? (the fire of the sun is at my left hand when facing east, not my right)<br><br>2. It seems appropriate to me to invoke australian aboriginal gods and spirits (as they feel closer than welsh ones). Cherokee Organics you're in australia too right? Any suggestions or pointers to good sources for aboriginal mythology?<br><br>3. Would it be ineffective to invoke abstract concepts or virtues, such as truth, justice, compassion and mercy instead of gods with names?<br><br>Cheers,<br>GuRan<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c1231257253145009082 title="comment permalink">11/24/11, 2:57 AM</a><br><br>

When I look back at how so many of us climbed aboard the MORE train in the 80s (I was helping to lead the charge back then) you can absolutely see the power of the material drive backed up with mental commitment. But it's only really powerful when the mental commitment is essentially unconscious, and so goes unchallenged. I suppose it's obvious really - we'll only jump off a cliff if we don't realize we're jumping off a cliff.<br><br>I didn't start to change my approach until something shifted inside, and it was very painful at first. Reversing it takes time and perseverance, but I'm finding on this journey a level of happiness and ease that I never found in all of the stuff I accumulated in the 80s and 90s.

I'm getting ready to start bringing it into the real world. <br><br>I do have one technical disagreement- I believe ongoing advances in semiconductors and power-conversion electronics will continue to cheapen solar power for some decades, and thus continue to expand the part of the earth where it is cost-effective. A complete replacement for petrol? no. but enough to operate computers and communications around the world, and manufacture them in solar-rich places, if nothing else. We will probably have to be much more stingy with our use of steel as a structural material, and go to more ceramics/carbon/silicon/organic materials, and generally build things that are lighter and less sturdy.<br><br>Anyway the main thing i'm getting from your essay:<br><br>the doctrine of LESS applies to the USA. but as you say, we are only the 5%. So here's a big and painful mental leap to somewhere significant:<br><br><i>we, the "99%", are actually 99% of the 5%. Globally speaking, we are all the bad guys</i>.<br><br>And accordingly, it is right and proper that we will get LESS, especially if we preach equality.<br><br>But the rest of the world at this time is actually getting MORE! <br><br>I'm thinking standard of living in third world countries, where even the lowest ranks of the working class can get cel phones, watch TV, wear cool T-shirts, not starve or get eaten, ride bikes and possibly motorcycles, ride on buses and trucks (shared with others, which is how we will do it too). Seems like that's about the per-human-being level of luxury we can afford, even if we can magically maintain today's energy/population balance. That's another reality check.<br><br>So the logical conclusion is, that we in America (or Europe or Japan) recognize that we are all the bad guys, we oughtn't try to stop our standard of living from falling. Yeah, that message sure is going to take some magic to spread (the soviets did it but they used force and look how it turned out). <br><br>Anyway, i'm concluding that we ought to help the collapse of easy-living along! If we have a chance to make energy MORE expensive, and reduce the rate at which it is extracted, we should take it. Probably the best way to do this is start some wars with energy-producing nations (Goooo 'bama!).

Not all, but many occupiers understand overshoot quite well, and the need to build a community that is sustainable and not based on endless growth and consumption...which is exactly what the occupations are trying to do. Furthermore, I think it is quite obvious that Wall Street, the government, the military and CIA, multinational corporations and even universities - the 1% - are for all intents and purposes one and the same.

I know that and have accepted it, being past the 3-score and ten. However, while I'm here, some things are needful above and beyond. Some examples:<br><br>If your gums are likely to flare up without special attention, by Minerva, you get that sonic toothbrush and the precious little between-teeth heads and all the rest of that picky paraphenalia. <br><br>If your fingers develop a hard shell that cracks and starts bleeding in cold and dry weather despite lavish use of every cream and home remedy on the market and gloves besides, you don't experiment with keeping the house temperature in the mid to low 60s unless you can do handwork and writing in mittens.<br><br>And - from the serious to the risible - if you wear a Size 34DD bra, you grit your teeth and order more underwires. <br><br>That is to say, there are limits beyond which real hardship ensues. It will anyway; you don't celebrate your 6th birthday half a year before the end of World War II, or be taught by GI-generation teachers (or Lost Generation! Think Colonel Potter from MASH for a prime example)and escape knowing that. <br><br>So - like Martin Luther's drunken peasant trying to get home on horseback, one falls off on first the left side, and then the right side, and then the left side again, and call that the Middle Way. Except that the peasant could at least count on the horse having more sense than he did! So -- where do I get such a horse?

When you mention a post-Crisis backlash of Reaganite proportions, I beg to disagree. First, because I come from a perspective of the cycle of Turnings laid out in Strauss &amp; Howe's book Fourth Turning and what happens post-Crisis is always a Recovery. Not a very good one at times, but a sound, solid one based firmly in the survivor's heartfelt "Never again!" and the steps they take to ensure that. The Reagan years were the start of an Unraveling, where the Crisis survivors are either dead, retired, or brushed aside as "standing in the way of Progress." I myself stood appalled as the lessons taught by the Roaring 20s repeated themselves in living color and 3D and nobody was listening to me. <br><br>Second is because you yourself said that after each of the Crises that mark the stairsteps we fall down, civilizations picks up and rebuilds quite strongly on what they have left.

We went in the 1990 volvo that serves as my farm vehicle. 7 minutes away was the creek and 200 acres of old forest I have chosen as my home (part of a college campus). I went to some large rocks overlooking the creek and sat down to meditate. <br><br>I heard some crows and other birds. The goats loved climbing on the rocks and tried to push each other off. I threw some sticks for my dogs who enjoyed chewing on them.<br><br>I headed home an hour later, fed the goats, the dogs, my husband (who was on the computer as always). I went in the basement to my 50 gallon worm bin and harvested some of the castings for my (now indoor) citrus tree, and fed my collected discarded vegetables to the worms. <br><br>Then I sat down to read your post. I thought about Rudolph Steiner, and how he wrote a series of essays called "Bees". <br><br>It occurred to me that he must have had some way to work with the dimensions beyond rational thought- when he talks of clairvoyant knowledge, he is probably talking about his own experiences. <br><br>I decided to study "Bees" to see if I could understand how he worked with that dimension, just as I have studied Buddhist texts.<br><br>My heart is full of joy to have read your post and be validated on my choice of path, one that combines a study of magic, nature, and farming, that I have been following these past 6 years since I found you. <br><br>I no longer feel the alienation, confusion, acute loneliness that I did back then.<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c9142304916339025584 title="comment permalink">11/24/11, 6:46 AM</a><br><br>

I'm a little perplexed, however, by your characterization of the OWS movements that have been springing up across the country (and around the world) as peopled by those who feel entitled to a standard of living we've all become accustomed to for the past several decades. From what I've observed this is no ordinary protest movement simply demanding jobs like some reinvigorated labor movement. By occupying public space and setting up permanent communities that are scaled down dramatically in terms of resource consumption it seems to me that we in the OWS movement are indeed walking our talk, being the change we want to see in the world and "sharply downscaling the pursuit of material excess in favor of a life that’s rich in experiences, relationships, and meaning" in your words. The level of brutality being directed at the OWS participants and the dismantling of their utopian encampments (not to mention the blizzard of ridicule being thrown at them by politicians and pundits)shows just how threatened the authorities- those who are deeply committed to the old paradigm- are by those who are paracticing in and helping to create the new paradigm in such an open, public and headline-grabbing manner. As imperfect as this movement is at times we should all be embracing it, nurturing it and welcoming it into the world. It is our future after all.<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c7275613766991901708 title="comment permalink">11/24/11, 8:00 AM</a><br><br>

Bicycles of the time needed a smooth, hard surface to overcome their weight and thus the extra effort it took to ride them versus today's models. They did not have the features that make it possible for mountain bikes to operate off-road. The League of American Wheelmen (later Bicyclists) was founded to advocate for paved roads for cyclists to use (www.bikeleague.org/about/index.php).

I don't think any them who realize that globally they are part of the "1 %" are trying to divert attention to scapegoats. There are real villains in the U.S. society,and it strikes me that OWS is addressing distribution as well as justice. As you say, we don't think much of our government when those guilty of destroying the economy through greed are neither indicted nor tried.<br><br>And as you have said, we in the U.S. face a cut of 80% on our access to income and resources. If we don't equalize our distribution, most of us will die. I think this one thing OWS is trying to address.<br><br>It is a common place that revolutions consist of the poor, led by the disposessed middle class and rich. People are disparaging the young OWSers for being whiners who want more than they deserve. Yet they may be the disposessed middle class that lead this round. Whether it will end any better than the French or Russian revolutions is another matter.<br><br>When people point out to you that you primarily address the situation in the U.S. you have repeatedly said that since that's where you live and what you know, that's what you talk about. I'd say the same about OWS; conditions in say, Rwanda, are irrelevant to them, conditions in the U.S. are.

They are brought into existence quite consciously, with unbelievable compassion and determination, from another world. Then the job of people experienced in ecstasy is to prepare the soil for them; carefully sow and plant them; care for them; watch them grow.....But not only are these people needed to bring new worlds into existence. They are needed to bring them to an end so as to help them make way for the new....The simple truth is that every single civilization including this western world, was brought into being from a sacred place to serve a sacred purpose. And when that purpose is forgotten, when its original alignment gets lost, when the fundamental balance and harmony of its existence becomes disrupted beyond a certain point, then nature has her way". <br><br>This seems to take green wizardry and gardening to a higher level.<br>The gardeners should perhaps be clearing away the remnants of the old civilisation, and seeking and planting the bulbs of the new. It requires a new spiritual impulse, not seeking to patch and extend the old, as the parable of the new patch on an old garment told us.<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c5386752359851588958 title="comment permalink">11/24/11, 10:48 AM</a><br><br>

Indeed, how else could this happen without manipulating unconscious and instinctive drives on a societal level? I'm sure my fellow Americans on this site are looking on with pity. Imagine if such impulses were channeled to compassion and temperance instead. I think this explains the current cultural preoccupation with zombies - we feel like we're living among them, and the eating of brains is a rather on-point analogy.<br><br>I think the Occupy movement was (is) about nothing more than saying that life in modern America is not all right, and that something is seriously wrong. It was simply a mass expression of discontent, and little else, but even so I think it is valuable. How to actually change things is beyond the scope of OWS at this point, but I would not be surprised if a number of people eventually do come around to the type of lifestyle you've described so eloquently here. Maybe not all of them, maybe not at first, but some will, and that's a good thing.<br><br>From an economic standpoint, it does play into Peak Oil, as it is finally dawning that once we cannot rely on eternal growth, we will need to wrestle with problems of distribution. Occupy is about people realizing that having the productive labor and taxes of the vast majority of people flowing to a minuscule wealthy oligarchy (the 99 versus the 1 percent narrative) is simply feudalism by another name. This has been covered up by the panacea of eternal fossil-fuel fired growth, and as that recedes, our declining resources will prompt more and more to seek more equitable distribution.

It's purely the fact that national governments are being bamboozled or browbeaten into guaranteeing the bad debts of private banks that's pushed the continent to the edge -- and once the defaults happen, as they will, and the banks go broke, as they will, new currencies will be issued and things will stabilize again in a year or two. More on this down the road a bit. <br><br>Ruben, I disagree. People told me that mentioning that I'm an archdruid, talking about decline, and discussing magic on this blog were all doomed to fail, too, and they've worked very well so far. I plan on using LESS precisely because nobody else dares to do so -- and I think a lot of people in this case, and in others, are ready to hear the thing that nobody else is willing to say. <br><br>Draft, I have no objection to the people in SF who actually walk their talk, and do it for its own sake rather than to prove as ostentatiously as possible just how much better they are than everyone else. It's the people who talk sanctimoniously about saving the Earth and then go on planning their holiday in Thailand, and who won't ride a bike or use public transit because it would take them thirty more minutes to get to work, that make me roll my eyes.

That makes some sense especially about those who do not walk their talk, though I'm still confused on one point.<br><br>The line is very fuzzy between telling people about the more sustainable lifestyle one leads and being sanctimonious and appears to depend on the person you talk to. And worse than that I think many people take anyone living in a way out of the ordinary as inherently sanctimonious. I run into this frequently just from not eating meat even when I don't push anyone about it or even bring it up. Maybe this is a defense mechanism on their part. But many people get very uncomfortable or even hostile. I think to them I am sanctimonious.<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c1525252619280374060 title="comment permalink">11/24/11, 12:54 PM</a><br><br>

That's got to have been a huge amount of work; I trust it turned out to your satisfaction. <br><br>A, well, I wish I were that sanguine about solar power, but cost these days rarely reflects the real cost of energy inputs in manufacturing and sourcing raw materials, if that has to be done by renewable means. As for the rest of the world, they're getting more -- for the time being -- precisely because US global hegemony is breaking down, and with it goes the structural imbalances in the global economy that funnel so much of the world's wealth to us. How that will interface with the peaking of most of the world's nonrenewable resources is another matter. <br><br>Andrew, I've worked with clay soils before, and the answer is organic matter, organic matter, and more organic matter. If you can get fallen leaves in the autumn, work 'em in, add all your kitchen and yard waste, and anything else you can get. The more organic matter you can work into the soil, the quicker the clay is broken up into something more useful for gardening. <br><br>Raven, we should certainly pay more attention to myth -- I'll leave each of my readers to choose the mythic narratives that turn their crank. <br><br>Ward, well, I disagree. What I've seen and heard from OWS and its equivalents -- and no, I don't mean from the mass media; I don't watch or listen to the mass media -- suggests to me that the "new, more democratic systems" are the same failed tactics of manipulated pseudoconsensus that have been hamstringing activism in the US since the early 1980s; and the entire rhetoric of 99% vs. 1% was exactly what I was trying to critique in this post. Still, if that's what your heart tells you to do, by all means. <br><br>Justin, nicely put.<br><br>Gail, there again, I disagree. I'm glad to hear that some people in the OWS and its kindred movements get overshoot, but people from the peak oil scene who've visited the various encampments report quite consistently that the people they've talked to <i>don't</i> get it -- they insist instead that everyone could have a nice American lifestyle if only the rich weren't so greedy. Nor is it a useful strategy to insist that all your potential opponents are inevitably one and the same -- for heaven's sake, how are you going to divide them against one another (which is what every effetive movement for social change does to its opposition) if you insist that there are no differences along which they can be divided? <br><br>Grrl, good advice on stockpiling the things you need. As for the Reaganite backlash, though, I'm not a great fan of the Strauss &amp; Howe theory -- from my perspective, they have to do a lot of lopping and stretching to force history into the Procrustean bed of their theory -- and I think it would be unwise in the extreme to assume that that sort of backlash can't happen. Forewarned, as one of my teachers used to say, is a Hindu deity...<br><br>Robo, nicely put -- and you're equally right about reactions, which are more important than I think most of us realize. How often do we really notice just how little actual comfort and pleasure we get from all the arbitrary symbols of comfort and pleasure that surround us?<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c1688339830391825047 title="comment permalink">11/24/11, 1:01 PM</a><br><br>

Quite a bit of what passes for the comforts and conveniences of an American middle class lifestyle are uncomfortable and inconvenient for me, too. <br><br>Vyse, my guess is that most people will continue to cling to the fantasy that they can have a typically lavish modern lifestyle long after the last chance of anyone having that lifestyle has gone blowing down the wind with the leaves. That gap between perception and reality is going to drive some very counterproductive behavior in the decades to come, I suspect. <br><br>Cathy, thank you!<br><br>Goldmund, well, we'll see. So far what I've seen doesn't bear out what you've suggested. <br><br>(By the way, it fascinates me that when I've been expressing moderate criticism of the OWS business for weeks now, this week's post rather than any of the others has fielded the OWS pushback. It's either an interesting coincidence, or the OWS movement is gettng a good deal more sophisticated about media management.) <br><br>Nomad, that's a massive project, given the range of things I discuss on this blog. I might be able to put something together for the Green Wizardry project, but on a broader scale, you're talking about a reading list for a BA degree.<br><br>SLClaire, true enough!<br><br>Marrowstone Glenn, no. I'm criticizing OWS because, based on what I've seen and heard of the movement, it's not paying attention to the actual causes of the predicament we're in, and has instead fallen into the conceptual traps I listed. None of those have to do with other countries; all of them have to do with the direct consequences of American lifestyles on the American future.<br><br>Raven, Kingsley is an odd duck, and his writing combines some very keen insights with a tendency to hardcore binary thinking that I don't find useful. <br><br>Escape, I wish that people who use the word "feudalism" would learn something about it first. As I pointed out in a post <a href=../../2007/11/fascism-feudalism-and-future.html rel=nofollow>quite a while back</a>, it's not simply a snarl word meaning "rule by a small number of people one doesn't like." More generally, I wonder how many of the people protesting in America today would be willing to accept the huge decline in standards of living they'd have to experience if they no longer benefited from the imbalances that keep such a large fraction of the world's wealth flowing to America, and boosting their lifestyles among others. <br><br>Jason, I wish you could have pointed out to your friend that the only people who are isolated enough to believe that religion is almost dead are members of the very tiny minority of educated middle class intellectuals in the industrial world...<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c1376686132973071865 title="comment permalink">11/24/11, 1:23 PM</a><br><br>

I plead guilty - I should know better. Ironically, I've been reading a book about the transition from the Roman Era to the Dark Ages - Barbarians to Angels by Peter S. Wells (I know Late Antiquity is the preferred term, but Wells uses the former). Wells looks at the archaeological knowledge rather than written sources. When you strip away the laments of civilation ending coming from Classical sources and look at the evidence, you find that day-to-day life went on, just differently. Little actual evidence exists of massive destruction that some people assosciate with this time. Buildings were more humble wooden structures rather than monumental stone architecture, and beautiful works of art were still created. Even long-distance trade continued. Perhaps most facinating is the discovery of several feet of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_earth rel=nofollow>rich, dark humic soils</a> all over Europe in this time period. A sign of people producing food closer to home, perhaps? <br><br>Here's just a thought for contemplation - it seems places with more equitable wealth distribution also have much more efficient use of energy. Denmark and the Netherlands are a great examples. How much of our profligacy is due to attempting to preserve status?

Mostly my understanding of aboriginal culture comes through the anecdotal reports of European early settlers and explorers. Also ecological histories are an important source too. If you're interested in an historical investigation into how the Aboriginals became a sustainable culture I'd recommend reading, Dr Tim Flannery's book, "The Future Eaters". It's an easy and interesting read into the ecological history in this country.<br><br>The question is though, "Why don't we know much about the Aboriginal cultures?" - especially in the south of the country. Well, it's because disease wiped out about 90% of the population within two decades of colonisation. The remainder were rounded up and left to the care of the missionaries who were almost certainly in cahoots with the settlers as well as pursuing their own self interests. Unfortunately the missionaries weren't particularly good (for some reason) at documenting the Aboriginal cultures, society and practices.<br><br>This sort of thing is very common across the world history.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c4593733171464911746 title="comment permalink">11/24/11, 11:28 PM</a><br><br>

Sad really, because any initiatives other than bigger and cheaper are layered in bureaucratic red tape and they produce such low quality housing en masse.<br><br>Still, mustn’t grumble!<br><br>As a general note to the readers here, with movements such as ows, if they were to be successful in over throwing the status quo, it would be mayhem. The reason is that few seem to be expressing their visions for a feasible replacement system. I would have thought that there is enough evidence by now that intentional communities have a very high failure rate. Why do people coming back to this theme?<br><br>The other thing is that if they were to be successful, how would your country bring in enough income and resources to maintain at least a minimal standard of living? Do they even realise what they are asking for? Any low energy future needs to put far more of a person’s effort into the domestic economy. <br><br>For example: Most people flick a switch to heat their house. I have to: fell a tree; move the saw logs; cut them into firebox lengths; store them so that they can season for a year or two; split them when seasoned; and then I have to move them from the storage area to under cover to dry out for few weeks before I can burn them. This is a huge amount of work to heat a house.<br><br>Smashing the system, means losing that switch. It's a big call and one I wouldn't make.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c6367833460875662152 title="comment permalink">11/25/11, 1:54 AM</a><br><br>

Though it's perhaps forgiveable to conclude that religion is on the decline when so many churches are turned into pubs and people opt for non-religious weddings and funerals. <br><br>In Europe any politician evoking God would be labelled a wacko kicked out of office sharpish (according to Wikipedia 52% of Europeans believe in God - falling to just 20% in Denmark, where I live) - a sharp contrast to the US where it seems almost compulsory to do so (more than 90% believe in God).

Regarding being a bunch of chemicals, of course, that is what we are physically composed of. Schumacher's point (which I have adopted) is that it is taught to us that life originated from a few compounds 'deciding' to form a membrane around thmselves and replicate. <br><br>Try as I might I can't find any reasonable explantion from the scientific community about how this could have happened. The most honest admit that it's simply a mystery. So my point is that if enough people think there's nothing remotely supernatural about the existence of the universe and life within it then it follows they have no reason not to mess up our planet, like we are doing.<br><br>@escapefromwisconsin. I can't talk about Holland, but here in Denmark energy and money are fairly evenly distributed primarily because it is a small country with a very homogenous culture.

Even without considering its unsustainability, cost, and environmental impact, I just prefer living in the fresh air and not the stale artificial air the the air conditioners give out. It takes a bit of adaptation to get used to hot, humid summers, but I still have no desire for an air conditioner. Could say the same about TV as well as cell phones and all the other similar gadgets that have been popping up. Most people think that going witout these things is a sacrifice but to me it's a preference.<br><br><br>On the topic of meat eating and vegetarianism/veganism, I recently read the book "Meat: A Benign Extravagance" by Simon Fairlie, and he manages to address the subject with none of the polemics that are so often seen on this issue. He just discusses it from an environmental impact/sustainability point of view, avoiding the health discussions and for the most part avoiding the ethical discussions too. He has an agricultural backgrouns as well so can back up his ideas with experience. <br><br>Fairlie is British so focuses on what's most sustainable for Britain, but there's plenty in the book that applies to those of us in other places too. He eats meat and has the position that a certain amount of animals makes the system more sustainable and mre resilient, but that our current method of raising them is quite unsustainable and must change. He isn't against vegetarianism however, just those claims that it's always the best way for the environment.<br><br>There's a lot of useful thoughts about sutainable agriculture in general in Fairlie's book, and it's of the mindset of needing to use less energy too, no techno-cornucopian schemes.

You live where wool is easy to come by, and the tools &amp; equipment to do many useful things with it are also ready to hand. *Everybody* likes hand knit socks. Weaving is amazingly fast and actually quite simple (though it can get stunningly complex, it doesn’t have to be to produce beautiful and quite functional fabric). Felting requires no tools besides your hands and some hot and cold soapy water. I am one of those people who seems to have a bit of an overdose of Puritan Work Ethic, and knitting and the associated crafts keep me from feeling guilty about my down-time. Plus, it’s a tremendously useful skill to have and preserve, and has the added benefit of being meditative!<br><br>@ Draft: regarding the ‘vegan’ thing … perhaps you could try saying that you “avoid industrial food”. I was vegetarian for a lot of years but started eating meat again when I realized that in my part of the world, (as Hawlkeye so clearly pointed out) I couldn’t realistically manage a vegetarian local diet. I decided it was more important to eat locally, but wisely. I often tell people I only eat animals I know – which tends to get laughs, or “how could you? I could only eat animals I didn’t know” (which leads quite nicely into “nah, I’ve seen feedlots – I’ll stick with the ones I am certain went straight from pasture to butcher, thanks”). It doesn’t tend to come across as “I’m better/smarter than you” (at least not judging by the reactions I get, but then, I’m Canadian and we are terminally polite) … more like “I’m just terribly squeamish and I can’t stand the thought of feedlot meat on my plate”. A lot of people have seen “Food, Inc.” and could understand a desire to steer clear of industrial food (particularly industrial meats). Good for you for sticking with your beliefs. Oh … as for vegans and honey, you just have to get honey that was produced by free-range bees! (Yes, I saw that at a farmer’s market, loved it.)<br><br>@The Archdruid: Thanks for the encouragement (again) to do what I can with what I have where I’m at now. I have been thinking recently that although none of the little things we do in this household amount to a whole lot in terms of ‘saving the world’ (we conserve, compost, garden, raise some of our meat … but we’re still heavily reliant on the larger structures of our fossil-fuel-powered world and under no illusions of self-sufficiency) - perhaps the biggest effect of these actions is their magical ‘side-effects’. As PeakOilPoet mentioned above, one of the effects of the many rules and prayers of the Jewish faith is to provide you with multiple opportunities each day to bring God into your thoughts, to keep your faith constantly before you. Every time I put scraps out for the chickens, do the maintenance on the solar and wind power systems, open a jar of summer produce, or wash the ‘family cloths’, I am bringing to mind the fact of a low-energy future, continually repeating the counterspell “there is no brighter future ahead” while at the same time saying “but we can work with the future that is coming if we are willing to adapt”. It seems to me that not only does the mind-work have to have physical anchors in every day living, but that those anchors provide a supportive kind of feedback to the mind-work, making a nicely self-reinforcing cycle of growth. It’s working that way for me, anyway. :)<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c778287647739151623 title="comment permalink">11/25/11, 7:18 PM</a><br><br>

Very briefly: first, in a feudal society, the logic of feudal relationships runs from the top of society all the way to the bottom -- dukes are the vassals of kings, while poor peasants may have other, poorer peasants as their vassals; it's not simply a relationship between one level and another. Second, the feudal relationship is always person to person, not class to class -- a given peasant, let's say, is the vassal of a particular baron, not to the aristocracy as a whole, and in fact may fight against other aristocrats in defense of his own liege lord if it comes to that (and in feudal societies, it generally does). Third, feudal relations are always mutual -- the peasant has specific rights as well as responsibilities vis-a-vis the baron, and the baron has responsibilities as well as rights vis-a-vis the peasant. None of those factors are to be found in today's plutocratic oligarchies and their international relations. I know I'm more than a little crabby about this issue, but "feudal" has come to be used as a scare word (like "fascist" -- and of course the two get used together, which is an absurdity on the scale of "dry water" or "five-sided triangle") so often these days. <br><br>Ozark, I can't stand air conditioning myself, and don't use it at home even in very hot weather.

I know JMG makes it clear that he is talking of the USA, but his erudition takes us back to old Empires and classical origins, to history, which is spot-on in my view. The USA unfortunately is notorious these days in thinking of itself as 'essential humanity'.

Like so many heirloom varieties of vegetables, heritage breeds of livestock are close to the edge of extinction, and are invaluable allies to eaters in the temperate climes.<br><br>Folks who raise and serve these populations of animals as a species, as irreplaceable varieties, are doing us all a great service; they play the role of alpha through selection, and the role of predator through culling.

To a first approximation, it takes the stereotypical patriarchal family organization and arranges these in a nested hierarchy (except that the connections are not necessarily defined by blood relation). Everyone has one and only one master. Corporate entities are not persons (no matter what the courts say) and they have no human face to be face-to-face with. <br><br>One of the closer approximations I have seen to a concept of real neo-feudalism (I mentioned this a few months ago) is Jeff Poppin's (a.k.a. The Barefoot Farmer) vision of one farmer supporting 50-100 happy hippies on his land. The happy hippies take care of the farm work and maintenance as needed (leaving plenty of time for sleeping in hammocks and strumming guitars on porches), and the farmer oversees the whole operation, owns the land, and makes sure everyone has what they need. Nest a bunch of these together, tie the farmers to a regional boss, and on up the line, and you have reinvented feudalism. <br><br>One thing I do wonder -- have the feudal bonds always been essentially for life, and difficult to break? Or were there times and places when they were more fluid, and a disgruntled peasant could chose to seek a new manor without becoming an outlaw?<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c7696079139639754187 title="comment permalink">11/26/11, 6:47 AM</a><br><br>

I was on the receiving end of a demonstration in the 1980s when at college, and while I was somewhat sympathetic to the cause, the demonstration didn't further persuade me to join with them – it just seemed a noisy and clueless complain from someone who didn't know who or what I was. <br><br>Since then, I've followed lots of protest actions in the news – actions at the School of the Americas, the World Trade Organization, and so forth. Some things seem more effective to me than others – the nuns who protested at the School of the Americas seem more effective to me than the drumming and the street puppets and the other street theater that somehow came into vogue. I wonder what James Kunstler would say about the street theater types? Are they sending the not-so-subtle message that “this is a circus, we're clowns, don't take us seriously”? I contrasted those tactics to the tactics of the old civil rights movement, where people wore jackets, shirts, and ties, and gently sang instead of chanted. I am also reminded of Hunter Thompson's description of the protesters at the 1972 Republican Convention, most of whom he described as “a disgrace to the long tradition of public protest”, with the exception of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, who marched, rolled in wheelchairs, and hobbled on crutches, in platoon formation down the street, silently using hand signals just as they did in Vietnam, totally cowing the delegates, press, and the cops. <br><br>This all came into sharp focus for me due to a chance encounter last week. I'm still unsettled by it, both by what I saw and by my frankly emotional reaction to it. Our local Transition meeting (which is just getting going) met to discuss a couple of chapters of the Transition Handbook. As it so happened, the OWS General Assembly was meeting across the street, but got rained out, so the OWS crowd came into the place where we were meeting and met across the room. It was a motley-looking group of students, unsurprisingly. What so upset me was hearing some of the rhetoric – an angry shout about “charging the citadels of power” sticks in my mind. I cringed – this is the raw material with which movement is trying to effect political change? Clueless play-radical college students? <br><br>Furthermore, some of the OWS students sat in on our book discussion. Within five minutes two of them were spouting off about how the oil companies were suppressing some free-energy discovery. I cringed again, and thought how antithetical this message was to the message of Transition: instead of acknowledging scientifically-known natural limits, it pretends that there is limitless energy; instead of recognizing that we have to change our lifestyles, it conveniently scapegoats the oil companies for greedily blocking us from the energy utopia we unselfishly deserve (snark). It took a lot of self-control, but I managed to get out a statement that perhaps it was unwise to base public policy on the hopes of an unproven technological miracle. I wanted to yell out “Space Bats!!”, but no one would've gotten the reference. <br><br>So my impression of the OWS people locally is pretty hopeless. But I don't want to react the same way – so emotionally – next time – I'd rather engage and try to coax them to a better understanding. Any advice you or others have is welcome.<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c8363716576488412213 title="comment permalink">11/26/11, 9:44 AM</a><br><br>

Sort of like thinking about having to down scale to riding a horse instead of driving a car. The positive reframe would be to consider the value of developing a working relationship with an intelligent nonhuman sentient being who is much larger and physically more powerful than you are. Consider this vs the relationship you have with your car. Which has more life potential enrichment. <br><br>But then there is the rub. What defines life potential enrichment, more bluntly where do we get our ego blows from? Here I feel we have some growing up to do and it’s going to be a painful process because how we seem to feed our egos comes from some very unhealthy “food”. If we feed our enrichment from the “food” of power, control and win/lose games then we are going to define what is a lost and a gain quite different than if we feed ourselves from the “food” of cooperation, teamwork and win/win exchanges.<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c7571450295645120612 title="comment permalink">11/26/11, 9:51 AM</a><br><br>

Excellent post! <br><br>While clearing out a closet yesterday, I came across some papers I kept from my college days in the early 70's. The art school I attended was a stones throw from San Francisco, and I had the opportunity to attend one of the first (if not the first) "Earth Day" celebrations in that city. <br><br>The San Francisco Chronicle (if I recall correctly) featured this beautiful piece called "Celebration For a Small But Important Planet." by Harold Gilliam. It apparently touched my eighteen year old self so much that I felt the need to type the whole thing on my manual typewriter (there were no desktop copying machines or Kinko's back then :-) <br><br>Remember, this was the early 70's, but what strikes me about this wonderful writing is it's hopeful, optimistic tone and how it's just oozing with reverence for all things natural. I naively thought we were all on the same page back then. <br><br>I think this piece might reflect the high-water mark of the green movement, when we had, as you've often said Mr. Greer, the opportunity to profoundly change the direction of our society. <br><br>Nevertheless, the writing still inspires me today. I took the time to retype (rekey!) the text, and offer it to you all for your enjoyment and contemplation. I tried locating this online but had no luck.

Where I find I come into more internal dilemmas and uncertainty is how to individually behave and respond in group decision-making, in a way that is true to myself and my beliefs, while not being controlling.<br><br>I’ll be specific. I live in a group house with five other people, and the living situation is somewhat cooperative, though not to the extent of some co-ops. Compared to many other houses, we do use less energy and resources. We do not have air-conditioning. We compost. We caulk and put plastic on windows during the cold months, and keep are house at 62-65 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter. We do not have dryer either, though there have always been housemates through the years who think we should, but some of us (including me) have so far sucessfully kept that from happening.<br><br>However, we do have a dishwasher, that was there before I moved in. I prefer washing dishes by hand for a variety of reasons. Others in the house prefer to use the dishwasher, but since it was already there, it hasn’t really been an issue I feel like raising. However, recently the dishwasher is not working (and doesn’t seem to be fixable this time as it has been in the past). At dinner tonight, it seems that my housemates are already looking into getting a new dishwasher (which the landlord, not us, would pay for if we decide we want it, so it’s not even an issue of being forced to pay for it). I’m the minority opinion on this issue (the only one who does not see a need to get new one and thinks we could all just go back to hand-washing).<br><br>I know there are some studies that suggest that dishwashers do use less water than handwashing. That may be true (though I think it depends how one handwashes) if one is measuring water usage once the dishwasher already exists. But somehow, I feel rather certain if one is taking into account the water used in all stages of the mining, manufacturing, and transport of the dishwasher machine itself (everything from water used in oil and other resource extraction, water used in transport and industrial processes and used by workers at work, water used in related industries that the dishwasher industry depends on, etc. etc.), that dishwashers waste more water than hand-washing. <br><br>And of course, the issue is not just water, it’s also about usage of energy and other resources, which I’m sure hand-washing would definitely win out. And also, even if dishwashers could be thought of as more “efficient,” handwashing definitely wins out by being more “resilient.”<br><br>Anyway, my opinion comes from a gut feeling, and I admit I don’t have any hard data or studies to support my opinion that dishwashers are actually wasteful. Does anyone have any good articles or sources that I could share with my household that might influence them?<br><br>Group living does have some benefits, but there are definitely challenges, especially when people’s values are different. Even with a small group of six people, consensus decision-making is difficult, so I definitely can agree with your critiques of the use of the consensus method in much larger groups of people.<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c5658218214218147481 title="comment permalink">11/26/11, 4:10 PM</a><br><br>

This is a crucial issue, and as usual, you pull together the threads wonderfully well. Specific thoughts: <br><i>…it’s not the technical dimension of the predicament of industrial society that matters most just now. It’s the inner dimension, the murky realm of nonrational factors that keep our civilization from doing anything that doesn’t make the situation worse…</i><br><br>Not only do I see this in everyone around me, but I grapple with this over and over- as you say, the difficulty in bringing this down to earth are the inner gremlins that can sabotage the best of intentions. The gremlins of doubt, anxiety, shame (ie: ”I can’t do a good enough job”) guilt (“I’m not doing enough, so why do anything?”), etc – none of which are amenable to a good talking to. :-} When I review the methods that have worked on these inner resistances, they all involve some kind of imagery and action to directly address the resistance as a real thing. Lately, I’ve tried to ignore them and “stay rational” – nope, doesn’t work. Back to the visualizing and ritual – thanks for the reminder. <br><br><i>In a civilization that’s spent the last three and a half centuries trying to pretend that this inner dimension doesn’t matter, it was a foregone conclusion that most people’s inner lives would end up an unholy mess.</i><br><br>I love this line – will be quoting it, I’m sure! Yes, although there are exceptions, our society has waded in the shallows of the inner world for so long we don’t know there are real depths. Until the sea monster surges in… ;-}<br><br><i>It still amazes me how many people never wonder why what appears on TV is called "programming."</i><br><br>Love this line, too!! And I had ample chance to experience it again over Thanksgiving – not the direct tv, but the Maya created by it, as people who I considered generally self-aware argued the relative benefits of the latest “must have” technology! They admit they are gadgets (one woman even admitted that none of it was sustainable) and yet they said they planned to buy these trinkets &amp; toys… <br><br><i>however deep it may reach into the innermost realms of consciousness, has to be brought all the way down to earth, and anchored right here in the world of matter by an appropriate action</i><br><br>And that’s where so much of the so-called New Age stuff falters. Having worked for a New Age publication and met some of these prophets when they were dealing with profits, I gotta say many did not walk their talk. But rather than judge, I used that to look at myself – where are my ideals and values in contradiction to my daily actions? It’s really difficult sometimes to walk one’s talk! And yet, there is much power available if you can. Jung used to talk about dream work that way – it was not enough to look at the dream and understand it. If you didn’t act on what you’d learned, the unconscious would cease the guidance. But if we act, amazing synchronicities occur.<br><br><i>Activism has its place, to be sure, and potentially an important one, but activism only matters if the people who are doing it have already followed Gandhi’s advice and become the change that they wish to see in the world. </i><br><br>It’s taken me a couple decades, but I’m finally getting that. :-} Not only is the power of a good example more potent than good advice, but it’s basically hypocrisy to advise others to do what you can’t yourself. It’s meant that I’ve become uncharacteristically silent over the past 5 years or so, until I can truthfully claim to be doing what I think is the right thing. And even then, I have learned, talking doesn’t do much unless the person is open. And I agree that LESS is where we need to go… but again, if someone isn’t open, they’re not going to hear me. So I just keep practicing in my own life. And I’m grateful to be able to do it gradually, rather than all at once.

Not one of them have made any major changes in their lives because of it. In fact many use 2012 or similar scenarios as an excuse for inaction, because they think that whatever actions they take are meaningless in comparison to whatever disaster or mass change of consciousness or whatever they believe is waiting.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that I've never talked to anyone who has a deadset belief that winter solstice 2012 is the end of the world. Most just consider it to be an "important date". The vagueness is one of the more frustrating aspects of it to me. At least with predictions such as Harold Camping's rapture prediction, it was clear to everyone after it passed that it was wrong. I bet after winter solstice 2012 comes and goes, some people will take some event that happened around that time and declare it the fulfillment of the prophecy, even if it's nothing more major than you'd find any other year. They could also claim that there was really a mass change in consciousness that started on that date but just isn't apparent to most people yet. Who knows what sorts of things people who don't want to admit to themselves that they were wrong will consider fulfillment of such a vague prophecy.<br><br>When 2012 comes up in a conversation, my response comes from what you've written on the subject, JMG. Most often I just point out how the 2012 ideas going around now didn't even originate with the Mayans and that they referred to dates well after 2012 too. That does get people's attention more than anything else I've said, because everybody assumes the prediction came from the Mayans themselves. I only discuss the problems with apocalypticism in general when people are open to having a more in depth discussion.<br><br>One of my favorite things to say for a laugh when end of the world scenarios are brought up is in the nature of "The end of the world? That's already happened, there's just a msssive conspiracy by the powers that be to make you believe the world is still going."<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c5655857267045858572 title="comment permalink">11/26/11, 6:45 PM</a><br><br>

(Interestingly, the Wikipedia bio of Seton doesn't mention the later Woodcraft movement at all.) It made room for people of both genders and all ages, and had a great many other features that might be worth reviving now. Woodcraft handbooks can still be found now and then on the used market. <br><br><br>Sounds like I should re-read my wilderness survival books by Tom Brown, (a contemporary of mine)! I also highly recommend 'The Backwoodsman' magazine (it comes out every other month). It was originally a 'Black Powder' magazine but it has a lot of "country living" suggestions, including a gun powder recipe.<br><br>On a related note I think I've got a chance at buying ten acres on the Oregon California border in the next county over. From the satellite map it's off the open high desert and up in the tree line. The price isn't bad, it would take a year and a little change to buy it on my current income. The bad news is the nearest large town is 26 mi's away. If the soil there is 'good enough' for pasture it might support a high country garden, with pit green houses for the more delicate food plants. I'm thinking hilly country, I could build a sand bag bank barn for my horses, the goats and some chickens. Then build my house on top of the barn to benefit from the natural heat from the stable.<br><br>If I bring my client/best friend with me it's a long way from a hospital but she would absolutely love living out that far!

Have managed to keep reading, but no energy left over for proper digestion and contribution.<br><br>Thanks again for an interesting series of posts, JMG. One I was certain I was going to find difficult to swallow. Wrong again…<br>Summation of this week’s post: “Don’t just stand there like a bunch of empty lemonade bottles, <i>do something!</i>” – Have I got that right?<br><br>It’s been a really interesting experience, this getting out of the metaphorical Dodge. The aim has been to live in this small town, meet people, suss out the local microclimates and such, then buy some acreage. Now that we’re here, the people we have met are mostly all “doing less with less” and more than happy with the process. Sure there are some ostentatious w*nkers who want to do the big shot city type act, but they are soooo in the minority and the rest seem truly happy with their choices. We really feel we’ve made the right choice in selling up and coming here, no matter that some of our old friends keep calling us “courageous”. Thank you Sir Humphrey.<br><br>@Glenn – have you made friends at your local dairy yet? The big ones have a continual problem of what to do with poddy bulls. Some just hit them over the back of the head and compost them; others spend a significant amount of income raising them to selling age, when they get less than they’ve invested for the sale, due to dairy cattle not being acceptable for the meat industry. We’ve just put one set of dairy farmer friends in touch with another set of Holistic Grazing Management friends – result, two poddy bulls on one house cow, happy dairy farmer, happy HM farmer, house cow output down to 4 – 8 litres per day from &gt; 18 litres, no need to milk every day, no need to train neighbours in cow milking should you happen to go away for the weekend. I’m also told that Jerseys (prime dairy cattle) grow fantastic tasting flesh, even if they’re too scrawny to sell to a butcher. It’ll be a year or two before I can confirm this rumour.<br><br>@All those in the veganism digression: HM, mentioned above, is a technique out of Africa for managing grazing lands in such a way that animal impact from herds (usually of cattle and sheep) actually improves the quality of the pasture, water retention, carbon sequestration, soil life, yada, yada, yada. Take the animals off the land in brittle environments (most of Africa, Australia and a big chunk of North America) and desertification is the result. Put the animals back on (managed holistically) and native grasses start to come back, soils deepen and the whole environment supports vastly more complex biota. <br>If the militant vegans had their way, fully one third of the world’s currently arable land would wind up as desert. Not namby-pamby New Mexico type desert – the full on Sahara/Gibson/Great Sandy type desert. It is therefore your duty to eat meat; only a little bit of carefully sourced meat. <br>If you live on the east coast of the US, go find Joel Salatin. Buy your meat from him, or someone who uses his techniques. Just don’t buy it from the evil empire.<br><br>@Cherokee – have you documented your house building anywhere? I’m trying to convince my better half that we could build, but she’s very reluctant. Mostly we hear about the failures, not the successes. OTOH, most of the houses on acres for sale around here are shoddy air-conditioned cr@p. Some inspiration from people other than those in Earth Garden magazine would be cool.<br>Congrats on the food forest article. Nice work and some interesting hints as to your journey so far. If ever I’m back in Vic, I’d love to catch up with a chat (ditto if you’re ever in the Manning Valley).<br><br>Cheers,<br>LD<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c2617332417634406960 title="comment permalink">11/27/11, 3:37 AM</a><br><br>

Very interesting! I've learned a lot tonight. I was especially interested in wikipedia's description of one of the precursors to feudalism (located on wiki's Manorialism page): the struggling Roman Empire's freezing of the social structure. Workers of land were not to leave their land, sons were to take up their fathers' position, etc. I can see that we're not very close to that yet.

Being up in the Manning Valley I'd reckon you'd be turning away guests. What a great part of the world. As to building your own house, well, it's an interesting experience but you can apply the quality standards and design that builders just can't economically manage. You could save a bit of hassle by getting a truss company to make it all up off site too. Up your way I'd avoid concrete slabs and go for maximum insulation, double glazing etc because it can get both cold and hot there. <br><br>As to Earth Garden types - are you messing with me? I'm not stressed either way really, you did give me a laugh. If you look at page 22 of the summer edition, you'll see me staring back at the camera trying to look tough hanging onto the building frame. Hope you enjoy it. If you want just those pages - it was a good article - leave a comment with your email address on my blog site which I left the short story on. I won't publish your email address.<br><br>Apple Jack Creek - Thanks for the suggestions, I'd never thought about that and really appreciate the suggestion. My mum used to hand knit me woollen jumpers when I was younger and they were really nice - a good use of my time. I dislike the puritan work ethic but am burdened by it at the same time. Idle hands are the devils workshop I'm told! I've been sourcing second hand woollen blankets for some time now. It amazes me how few there are out there and they last forever.<br><br>Hawlkeye - Thanks for your thoughts. I'd never thought about that though - vegans don't generally grow their own food. Draft had a very well balanced non preachy take on the whole thing which I did like. In developing countries they usually only eat meat when Westerners turn up or at special occasions. I've never experienced frozen ground here in Australia even in the highlands of Tasmania (which is the large island to the south of the continent).

There is no better way to get rid of the more difficult parts of your personality than co-existing with strangers.<br><br>As to the dishwasher - and for the record it's manual all the way here - you might want to look at the types of chemicals used in that machines cleaning products versus the garden friendly products you can use whilst manually washing.

I am interested to see how you think the economics and politics of LESS can play out.<br><br>I agree with you that one should be bold and lead with LESS, not MORE. There is a lot of talk in the air of 'the economics of free', 'the economics of less' and so on, and it seems right to continue to lead with this.<br><br>However, the standard worry is that consuming less leads to deflation which, pretty quickly, leads to economic collapse. That is the more-or-less standard analysis of the origins of The Great Depression. I think it is Galbraith (but also certainly many others) who describes how capitalism relies on investment and the promise of the greater returns on one's invested money, which in turn drives industry to consume resources in the production of goods and services. To date, no-one sees a way of 'downsizing' without collapsing catastrophically.<br><br>This is particuarly relevant in countries like the UK which would struggle to be self-sufficient, unlike much of the US where you still have enough land and some other resources to make a go of a new agrarianism. For us, this type of move might be, literally, suicide.<br><br>Politically, too, one faces the problem of big-time free riders using the last of fossil fuel resources to give themselves power through weapons, better transport etc to drive through their agendas against those trying to live more sustainable lives. Though I suppose one could counter here <br>that, just as with Gandhi, no meaningful battle was ever won without suffering the aggression and hubris of one's opponents at some point.<br><br>In any event I await your analysis of the wider impacts of a substantial return to the land and to localism.<br><br>All best,<br><br>Carl<br><br><a href=bringing-it-down-to-earth.html#c2089126954939194162 title="comment permalink">11/28/11, 12:10 PM</a><br><br>

Let's work together to create a template of how to do this that each person can come to centers where ever they are and learn these skills (permaculture !) and these cent<br>ers would be of no interest to those hanging on to the old system.
