It occurred to me a few days ago that this week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> essay will be posted on a date that future generations may remember, at least in passing. One year from now is December 21, 2012, a date onto which quite a few people have piled extravagant labels and grand expectations, but which will get a different moniker after the fact; the one I have in mind is Nothing Happened Day.<br><br>No doubt the confidence expressed in that latter phrase will rankle with some of my readers. It’s a safe bet, in fact, that somebody’s going to post an indignant comment here insisting with some heat that the future isn’t predetermined, and a giant comet or the space brothers or something might show up on that day and make me look like an idiot. That’s a very common way of looking at things, and there are contexts in which it’s also more accurate than not; it’s just that this doesn’t happen to be one of them.<br><br>Not all predictions, after all, fall within the wiggle room that the laws of nature and the innate cussedness of things give to the future. When somebody announces that a working perpetual motion machine is about to hit the market, for example, they’re quite simply wrong—as wrong as if they announced that tomorrow the Sun will rise in the west and rocks will fall straight up into the sky. There are plenty of uncertainties in physics—more than most people outside the physics profession realize, or so I’m told—but the workings of basic conservation laws on the human scale aren’t among them. If somebody makes a prediction that contradicts those, especially if it relies on some tried-and-untrue gimmick that’s been responsible for an abundance of failed predictions before, you can safely bet your bottom dollar that it will fail again.<br><br>The same argument is just as valid, interestingly enough, for predictions that fall afoul of the limits of the cosmos in subtler ways. The example I have in mind here is the logic that drives bubbles and busts in a market economy. Behind every speculative bubble, to be a bit more specific, is the conviction that some class of assets which is rising in price will keep on doing so indefinitely. That conviction is always false, and it’s always disproven within a couple of years, but you can’t have a speculative bubble without it—it’s the delusion that the price of the asset class du jour is just going to keep on zooming upwards that leads otherwise sensible people to sink their net worth into Pets.com stock or subprime mortgages, and lose it all—and so, with weary predictability, that delusion gets trotted out every time an asset class starts blowing bubbles.<br><br>What this means is that once you learn to recognize the signs of a speculative bubble, it’s possible to make exact predictions of future events with perfect confidence. A fair number of people—I was one of them, as longtime readers of this blog will recall—did that with the real estate bubble that popped so catastrophically in 2008. Few bubbles in economic history showed the signs of imminent trouble more clearly than this one, and while all but a tiny fraction of economists missed those signs, they were not lost on less blinkered observers. As Keith Brand over at the HousingPanic blog—a voice of sanity all the way through the bubble—used to say, “Dear God, this is going to end so badly.” He was right; his more specific predictions, and those of a lot of other bubble bloggers, were by and large square on targer; and those who derided them—and there were a lot of them, some with impressive credentials—have spent the last three years doing their best to pretend that they didn’t make fools of themselves.<br><br>None of this is irrelevant to our present situation, as it happens, because we’ve got another speculative bubble going at full roar in America just now. It’s considerably more focused than the real estate bubble—well, to be fair, the real estate bubble was by most measures the most gargantuan speculative bubble in the history of markets, so just about anything’s going to be more focused—but it may yet wreak comparable damage on what’s left of the American economy. The asset at its heart? Shale gas.<br><br>The shale gas bubble is the big economic story you haven’t heard about, though that will likely change in the near future. Behind all the hype about limitless shale gas are two simpler and noticeably less impressive realities. The first is that fracking technology applied to shale deposits can free up modest amounts of natural gas. The second and more important is that for the last half dozen years or so, at least, fracking technology applied to Wall Street has been able to free up immodest amounts of credit, providing the funding for an explosive growth in the natural gas drilling industry.<br><br>The intersection between those two facts has produced a classic bubble, with wildly inflated reserve estimates bringing a torrent of cheap credit to bear on an asset that can’t support the grandiose claims made for it. Because US mineral rights laws and Wall Street’s expectations both require firms that buy shale gas rights to produce right away, irrespective of the state of the market, natural gas is now selling for a price—wobbling around $3.50 per thousand cubic feet, last I checked—that covers much less than the cost of drilling and extraction. My readers will no doubt recall real estate speculators in the midst of the bubble feverishly buying rental properties even when the rent covered only a small fraction of the mortgage payments; the logic here is exactly the same.<br><br>Thus it’s as certain as anything can be that at some point in the fairly near future, probably though not certainly within a year or two, the shale gas bubble is going to pop, major names in the industry are going to go the way of Countrywide Mortgage and Washington Mutual, and gas drilling is going to slump until rising gas prices and declining budgets for exploration and drilling come back into a relationship that makes sense. Mind you, it’s equally certain that the closer we get to the bubble’s end, the more extravagant will be the claims made for the permanence and game-changing nature of the so-called “shale gas revolution,” and the more abusive will be the responses of those whose jobs depend on the bubble to any suggestion that a bubble is in fact what’s going on.<br><br>All this brings us back to December 21, 2012, and the prophecies of cataclysm or mass enlightenment that have clustered around the end of the Mayan calendar. To start with, of course, the Mayan calendar doesn’t end in 2012. In point of fact, it doesn’t end at all—like most ancient peoples, the Mayans saw time as a circle, not a straight line—and the Mayans themselves didn’t predict anything out of the ordinary for that day; it’s just the rollover date for one of the many cycles of time they tracked. The whole shebang was quite simply invented by the late José Arguelles out of a free mix of New Age philosophy, scraps of misunderstood Mayan lore, and the drug trips of Terence McKenna, and it’s thus not surprising that no two people agree on what 2012 is supposed to bring. In many ways it’s become the ultimate inkblot onto which any imaginable fantasy can be projected; since the only thing anybody seems to agree on is that whatever happens that year will be very, very big news.<br><br>Look closely, though, and the belief in a 2012 apocalypse has a great deal in common with the belief that asset prices can have an infinite upside. Both beliefs offer grand narratives that replace the ordinary patterns of human existence with a something-for-nothing fantasy. The bubble believers insist that they can have limitless wealth without having to work for it; the 2012 believers insist that they can have the new and improved world they think they want—whether that amounts to a new age of enlightenment, on the one hand, or a Hollywood movie world of heroic survivors blazing away against hordes of roving zombies, on the other—without having to work for it. In either case, what drives the fantasy is the conviction that it makes sense to sit on your backside and wait for the market, or the space brothers, or something else to give you the future you think you deserve.<br><br>That’s a very appealing notion for many people in America these days, and it’s worth glancing at the reasons why that should be so. To begin with, of course, a great many people in America do sit on their backsides and get rich. Most of them sit in the corner offices of large corporations, where they spend their time making decisions that, to judge by the results, would be better off made with one of those Magic 8-Balls: “reply hazy, ask again later.” John Kenneth Galbraith pointed out with a commendable lack of restraint in his book <i>The Culture of Contentment</i> that in America, as a rule, the more money you make, the less work you have to do—and, one might add, the less value you have to produce. Consider the upper reaches of the American banking industry, with their multimillion-dollar annual bonuses: what, other than misery for millions of ordinary people, do they actually produce?<br><br>For that matter, the vast majority of those who insist they’re part of the 99% these days benefit hugely from the systematic imbalances that give the 5% of humanity that live in the United States around a quarter of the world’s energy resources and around a third of its raw materials and industrial output. If Americans suddenly had to live on their fair share of the world’s resources and economic output, as I’ve pointed out more than once in the past, we’d have to take the equivalent of an 80% pay cut. This implies that, if you’re near the average, only around twenty per cent of your lifestyle is paid for by your own labor. The rest? Most Americans don’t want to know, and will insist at the top of their lungs that wealth can pop into being out of thin air or, well, almost any other absurdity you care to imagine; it beats thinking about just who is paying the costs of their comfortable lives.<br><br>Still, I’ve come to think that the most important force driving all these something-for-nothing fantasies is a subtler and more pervasive thing: the faith in progress that is the established but unmentionable religion of the modern industrial world. The belief in perpetual progress embodies exactly the same kind of grand narrative as speculative bubbles and apocalyptic prophecies: such everyday realities as diminishing returns and limits to growth are brushed aside by the conviction that the future must, by some irrevocable law of existence, always be shinier than the past. That’s what motivates the people who pop up on this and every other peak oil-related blog to insist that we can keep on powering our SUVs and Blackberries forever by building thorium reactors or harnessing zero point energy or turning the state of Nevada into one vast algae farm. It’s not incidental, either, that the vast majority of these people aren’t actually doing anything to make these dayreams happen; as with the rest of the something-for-nothing fantasies, reasons to do nothing have an important role in the payoff.<br><br>It’s the popularity of faith in progress, in turn, that makes believing apocalyptic fantasies so easy for so many people. If you’ve already bought into the idea that history is a grand narrative that assigns you a privileged place in the overall scheme of things, it’s easy to shift from one grand narrative to another—say, from the one that identifies people in today’s industrial societies as destiny’s darlings to the one that identifies them as wicked environmental sinners in the hands of an angry Gaia, or urges them to wait for salvation from outer space with all the fervor and most of the rhetoric of a Melanesian cargo cult, or claims that the Creator of the cosmos is about to unleash His genocidal fury on every human being who doesn’t buy into some particular religious ideology, or—well, you can fill in the blanks yourself, because at heart, they’re all pretty much the same. In the face of a cosmos that generally fails to cater to our sense of entitlement, they all offer narratives that make believers feel special, promise them some variation on pie in the sky, and offer them a good hearty helping of excuses for not taking action at a time in which action desperately needs to be taken.<br><br>These days, the old time faith in progress is becoming increasingly hard to sustain. It’s symptomatic that Gordon Moore himself has stated that Moore’s Law, long central to the rhetoric of technological triumphalism, no longer applies. The vagaries of the collective imagination are not one of the things that can be reliably predicted about the future, but the giddy claims about December 21, 2012 have me worried. There’s good reason to think that in the year to come we’ll be facing very hard times—not, please note, the imaginary cataclysms of apocalyptic rhetoric, but the sort of slow, plodding, frustratingly mundane hard times our grandparents or great-grandparents faced during the Great Depression before this one—and in such times the glittering promises of apocalyptic fantasy can be hard to resist.<br><br>It’s important, though, that at least some of us resist those promises. The grand narratives we’re discussing have another thing in common—they always fail sooner or later—but the narratives of apocalypse by and large fail sooner, more completely, and with more drastic consequences, than most others. The research for my most recent book, <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not: Everything You Know About 2012, Nostradamus, And The Rapture Is Wrong</a> was among other things a first-class education in the pointlessness of apocalyptic prophecy. There’s nothing in today’s advance press for December 21, 2012 that doesn’t have precise equivalents in a thousand similar prophecies for a thousand similar dates when nothing happened. One thing this implies, of course, is that there’s precisely no reason to take this prophecy any more seriously.<br><br>As I’ve tried to suggest here more than once, on the other hand, there’s a lot that can be done and indeed has to be done to help individuals, families, and communities deal with the prosaic but potent mix of difficulties our society’s misguided choices have brewed up for us. Sitting on our backsides waiting for the space brothers or the Rapture to solve our problems is no more helpful than sitting our our backsides waiting for progress or the free market or algal biodiesel farms to solve our problems. These two ends of the spectrum are twins—think of them as the Tweedledoom and Tweedledee of the imaginary Wonderland that dominates so much collective thinking these days—and getting past them, it seems to me, is an essential step on the way to less futile responses to a challenging future.<br><br>Over the next year, as a result, I plan on celebrating Nothing Happened Day in advance with a new weekly feature: the End of the World of the Week Club. Every week, after the usual (or unusual) essay, I’ll be posting a brief discussion of one of the many apocalypses that slipped past its pull date. It should be entertaining and, just possibly, enlightening. If it manages to help at least a few people step outside the hall of mirrors constructed by all those grand narratives that celebrate our supposedly special status, and begin to notice what the world is like when we stop treating ourselves as the center of attention for the entire cosmos, it may even do some good.<br><br>Two notes before we get there. First, I’m pleased to report that I was able to talk Viva Editions, the publisher of Apocalypse Not, into offering a winter solstice present to readers of <i>The Archdruid Report</i>. (Yes, one of the benefits of Druidry is that you get your holiday presents a few days early.) From now until January 1, if you go to the <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Viva Editions website</a>, buy a copy of <i>Apocalypse Not</i>, and type the code APOCNOT25 on the order form where it asks for coupon codes and the like, you’ll get a 25% discount off the cover price. A happy solstice, or whatever else you celebrate at this time of year, to all!<br><br>Second, I’m equally pleased to report that Valerie Green and DanceEntropy will be performing <i>Rise and Fall</i>, a work inspired by my book <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/L/The-Long-Descent>The Long Descent</a>, as part of their show <i>Eternal Return</i> at the Baruch Performing Arts Center in New York City, January 20, 21, and 22—details and tickets are <a href=http://www.danceentropy.org/ >here</a>. If you’re located anywhere near New York, or will be there in late January, check it out.<br><br>********************<br><br><span style=font-size:130%>End of the World of the Week #1</span><br><br>Chicago, December 20, 1954. A circle of typical American suburbanites gathers in a typical backyard on a typical Midwestern winter evening. As evening deepens, they frantically get rid of every scrap of metal on them, down to the eyelets on their shoes. For the last few months they’ve gathered around a housewife turned channeler, Dorothy Martin, who believes she is in contact with intelligent beings from a distant planet, and has been told that a cataclysmic flood will sweep over North America the next day and destroy everything in its path. Martin and her followers have been promised that they will be lifted to safety aboard a flying saucer that night; the prohibition against metal has something, though no one knows quite what, to do with the alien technologies that they believe will save their lives.<br><br>The saucer didn’t show, of course, and neither did the flood. The group scattered over the weeks that followed; Martin left Chicago in time to miss a psych evaluation that probably would have landed her in an institution, took the new name of Sister Thedra, and spent the rest of her life preaching the alien gospel to a mostly uninterested world. The entire affair would have passed all but unnoticed, except that a handful of the group’s members were ringers—graduate students from the University of Minnesota who joined the little cult as part of a study. <i>When Prophecy Fails</i>, the book that came out of that study, has become a classic of American sociological literature, and remains well worth reading today—not least because a great deal of the belief system that’s clustered around the supposed end of the Mayan calendar in 2012 comes from sources not noticeably different from the ones that sent Dorothy Martin on her long strange trip.<br><div style="text-align: right">—story from <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a></div>

As you suggest, JMG, knowing the earth and knowing the iron laws of nature, and the elastic laws of human societies, will help us through the trials toward which humanity set its course centuries ago. Study, wait, be diligent, have compassion and patience, and do not fall for the temptation of apocalypses, the one which gnaws at the hearts of those who say to themselves, "They will see that I am right," when others dismiss their fevered imaginings.

I realized the proclamations about the never ending reserves of shale gas were absurd, but I hadn't realized the industry was so exhibiting the signs of a speculative bubble. That should be another fun disaster to watch. (He says with sarcasm, as it will inevitably lead to further unnecessary suffering.)<br><br>One of the more frustrating things that a certain family member of mine proclaims is the imminent arrival of aliens bearing the gift of new technologies and energy systems that will solve all our problems. This honest belief is mind boggling to me, though I do understand the psychology behind it. If there were aliens out there with such technology and the means to travel to our planet to bestow it upon us, why on earth would they do such a thing? What have we done to deserve such a gift? If I was one of those aliens viewing the goings-on on this planet, I would stay as far away as possible. It seems clear to me that mixing yourself up with the likes of us would be more likely to lead to something along the spectrum of annoyance to misery than to a good time had by all.<br><br>But I dare not get too smug with said family member as I've been quite guilty of yearning for apocalypse in recent years. It's a habit that your writings have shed light on and I thank you for that. I'm working on getting away from it, and transferring whatever energy I put into it into more useful endeavors. As you say, there's a lot of work to be done to deal with what promises to be a sticky future.<br><br>Speaking of, one of my more consistent challenges is in the department of discipline. I have a heck of a time getting down to business and engaging in the hard work necessary to move toward my hoped-for future. I think I've made some small progress in that realm of late. I'm writing regularly on my blog and have been fairly pleased with a good bit of it. This may not seem like much, but I've spent a majority of my life wanting writing to be a major component of my life, and only a small minority of my life has seen that a reality. Therefore, I'm pleased with my current successes, modest as they may be.<br><br>That I am doing this while simultaneously farming part time and getting ready to take on another farming gig (both of which are and will continue gaining me valuable experience raising and working with a variety of animals) creates quite the satisfaction. If I can integrate my writing into a life in which I'm learning valuable skills that will likely prove advantageous in the future, then I'm feeling pretty good about my current direction.<br><br>Love the idea of the ongoing series on failed apocalyptic predictions. Apocalypse Not is on my short Christmas list. Being in recovery from Apocalypse, I'm sure it will prove invaluable.<br><br>Happy solstice to you and all readers here. It's a gorgeous night here on the Oregon coast--clear as can be, the stars bright, quite cold but warm here in my yurt with the wood stove. I'm blessed, indeed--I think we all are to be living in such an incredible and beautiful world, problematic as we may at times make it.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c7634748871619589191 title="comment permalink">12/21/11, 10:08 PM</a><br><br>

Yet sometimes events much like apocalypses do happen. August 1914, the 1929 Stock Market Crash, Pearl Harbor, the Nazi Holocaust, the Arab Oil Embargo, the collapse of the Soviet Union, 9/11/01. One day the world is one way; the next it has changed profoundly.<br><br>Watching Bush and then Obama respond in exactly the same ineffective way to the 2008 financial emergency has me very worried about a global financial meltdown. Would you consider this a real possibility and what would keep the results from being an apocalypse? Are you saying we can have catastrophes but not apocalypses, in other words is this about the meaning of the word "apocalypse"?<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c5827671766703960176 title="comment permalink">12/21/11, 10:13 PM</a><br><br>

Today, sunny, humid 29 degrees Celsius outside (84.2 Fahrenheit). Light to almost 10pm here at 37 1/2 degrees south. Nice.<br><br>It's been complex because the oven has been going for about 3 hours now cooking Xmas cakes. I don't celebrate Xmas personally, but roll with others who do. Northern hemisphere images of snow etc. and fat men in red suits don't translate very well into down under! Snow has been absent here for the past two years now. The last snowfall killed my coffee tree! Grrr.<br><br>Ah, master, is it to be before cataclysm chop wood, carry water. After cataclysm chop wood, carry water? hehe!<br><br>On a serious note, this year has been year of the chicken having started with them last New Year’s Eve (it was a scorcher too at 40 degrees in the shade). I think the world would be a far nicer place if everyone was responsible for a flock of chickens. They have taught me so much and are now truly invaluable here.<br><br>Still, most people around here tend to own Isa Brown varieties, but I went for heritage breeds and have noticed that the chook world is a harsh cruel place. They have a great run + housing, in the shade, deep mulch litter (which eventually becomes food for the fruit trees), good food + garden greens. All a happy chook could ever wish for.<br><br>The issue of the chooks genetic heritage has been on my mind recently because one of the breeds looked good, but were a bit off. The other birds had zero tolerance for them too. It's interesting, because I have two remaining of this variety (silkies) but they were cross bred with another variety - so they don't run pure - and they are tougher, hardier and more alert birds. It's given me food for thought.<br><br>I wonder how much of our food chain is dependent on a small genetic pool? Also how will I obtain new genetic inputs (I already own a rooster) in future without the co-operation of neighbours?<br><br>Happy summer solstice J9.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c7786996517093700927 title="comment permalink">12/22/11, 12:50 AM</a><br><br>

What a wonderful idea!<br><br>Many thanks to JMG for the generous rebate on your latest book. Alas I already got my copy a few weeks ago!

" <br><br>A few years ago I talked to a good friend of mine about the many dysfunctions of modernity notably that exponential economic growth on a finite planet can only but collide with physical limits and thus become dysfunctional. After a few e-mail exchanges his reaction was that thanks to science and technology " modernity knowns no major dysfunctions, only minor ones which are fully expected" <br><br>At this point I surrendered and accepted that no amount of reasoning can make him see past his massive blind spots. I accepted his position as the resultant of a religious belief in progress and science and it was best I respect his belief systems instead of challenging them. <br><br>It is amazing how prevalent this way of thinking is and how impervious it is to facts, figures and common sense! Might as well bang your head against a brick wall. The same sort of deviant logic explains why so many people are enamored with ideas of sustainable development. <br><br>I also like the idea that the faith in progress "offer them a good hearty helping of excuses for not taking action at a time in which action desperately needs to be taken." <br><br>Now I understand why people care to do so little in face of our predicament and why I get so many blank stares and silences when raising those issues.<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c8753829295947939139 title="comment permalink">12/22/11, 1:23 AM</a><br><br>

Eventually we sold all the properties for a modest profit and concentrated on buying distressed properties, fixing them up, and "flipping" them. We usually made about $10,000 profit per house after repairs and other costs. Not bad for a few months of drywall, electrical, plumbing and painting work in our spare time.<br><br>Then, we began to notice that lots of other people were bidding at the HUD auctions, driving up the prices for the foreclosed houses. It got to the point where the spread between what it cost to buy and rehab the properties and what we could sell them for after repairs approached zero. Soon, we were seeing "investors" paying <i>more</i> for the foreclosures than the houses could reasonably be worth <i>after</i> rehab.<br><br>And then our regular mortgage brokers started coming to us with loans that required no documentation, and no money down out of our own pockets. It seems that Mr. Greenspan and the Fed were keeping interest rates so low, in an effort to keep stimulating the economy, that the lending institutions were literally shoveling money out the door to anyone with a pulse.<br><br>That's when we stopped flipping foreclosures.

We all know that the supply of fossil fuels is NOT infinite, and sooner or later we actually will run out. However, what the current fracking boom is doing is ensuring that we will run out later rather than sooner, which may buy us some additional time to make the necessary adjustments in our lifestyles. <br><br>Not all of the numbers being thrown around about how much of this stuff is left in the ground are the product of gas industry PR hype. It appears from what I have seen that there probably is enough to power the US economy for several additional decades, possibly most of the rest of this century, at current (or perhaps slightly reduced) levels of consumption. Of course, that assumes we don't sell any of it to China, the way the Canadians are threatening to do with the Alberta tar sand goo (if we don't build the Keystone XL pipeline). <br><br>Up in Antrim County in northern Michigan, where my Mom lives, there has been a gas drilling boom going on for several years. The Antrim shale extends down to Indiana and Ohio and may extend out under Lake Michigan to Wisconsin. Unlike most other shale gas plays, the natural gas from the Antrim appears to be biogenic gas generated by the action of bacteria on the organic-rich rock.<br><br>Please note, I am not saying this is going to solve all of our problems forever, but it will help to mitigate our energy problem for quite some time (most of the people reading this blog will be long gone before the gas is all gone).<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c6898000403231316386 title="comment permalink">12/22/11, 9:37 AM</a><br><br>

While Americans have seen a steady, grinding decline in the 2007-2011 period, I am beginning to wonder if this decline will gather speed and intensity in 2012. Certainly not roving hordes of zombies, but perhaps the beginning of conditions that approximate what was seen in the Great Depression. An "apocalypse of our own making," in a sense. <br><br>I notice that these New Age beliefs about 2012 germinated in the 1970s, precisely the period when civilization's limits to growth gained popular recognition. The 2012 meme then gained wider popularity, it seems, during the same period when Americans ignored these limits and committed themselves to the vacation from reality that we now see unraveling around us. <br><br>Is it crazy to think that, through some thaumaturgy in the collective unconscious, Americans have spent the last few decades turning their nation into a bomb with a timer set to 2012?<br><br>At the very least, these 2012 beliefs probably reflect a widespread recognition that the world we've built over the last few decades has will inevitably end in the not-too-distant-future.<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c8065566523357547220 title="comment permalink">12/22/11, 10:31 AM</a><br><br>

That, and an awareness of the utter failure of a money system based on debt. I think we are in the midst of a debt bubble that when it pops, will make every other bubble seem like a burp. <br><br>And yes, there is no salvation but what one is willing to do to heal oneself, and in doing so, healing the Earth.

It is very mysterious to me.<br><br>That said, I'm not likely going to create a device that defies that Law, and I'm not expecting that anyone will.

When the natural gas bubble pops, how am I going to heat my home, here in Minnesota? Passive solar and a wood boiler, is what I have in mind. Where is that wood going to come from, at the center of a 3 million metropolitan area, with suburbia extending thirty miles in every direction?

It sounds as though you've made a good beginning, though. <br><br>Stuart, understood, but I think a line needs to be drawn between real historical events and wish-fulfilment fantasies. Yes, we're probably going to be facing some very rough times in the future -- but I'd encourage you to read a few good histories of any of the events you've named; things didn't change overnight as a result of any of them.

I think it's quite possible that plenty of economic indicators are going to go tobogganing downhill in the new year, mind you, but that's just ordinary history unfolding in an ordinary way. <br><br>Yupped, of course; I know a lot of people who are busy getting ready for hard times, and who also have religious beliefs about the future that are, well, questionable. Still, I suspect we're going to see a great deal of overtly cargo-cult apocalypticism of the "don't worry about that, the space brothers will rescue us" type -- the sort of thing that ofthehands talks about in his comment above -- and that this will be yet another round of excuses for doing nothing. <br><br>Thijs, quite true -- in fact, I made room for a discussion of the tulip bubble in <i>Apocalypse Not</i>. Is there any way the Dutch could come up with another basically harmless speculative bubble for the world to invest in, do you think? It might distract the rest of humanity from investing in more dangerous bubbles. <br><br>Avery, I suppose you could, but it looks to me more as though 2012 is a form of collective thaumaturgy encouraging people to do nothing and wait for a miracle to rescue them from the consequences of their own actions. As for risk-taking and dangerous activities, most of the people I know who claim to believe in the 2012 hoopla are still putting money into their retirement funds...<br><br>BruceH, no, that was one of many I didn't have room to cover. It's only a 40,000 word book! The folks at Stelle -- they were the people who thought there was going to be a polar flip on 5/5/2000, weren't they? <br><br>Mister R., I've met too many people stuck in the same sort of bind, with an obsession with some sort of prophecy of total change making up for a really messed-up life. I hope the diabetes is under control these days! <br><br>Robo, exactly. The industrial world (you'll notice that I don't use the term "first world") is a temporary anomaly; what's now called the Third World is fairly close to human normal, though it's more crowded than usual just now. It's also a fair image of the future of the deindustrializing nations, as I've commented more than once in these essays.<br><br>Maria, glad to hear it! Yes, every Druid teacher covers things in different sequences -- that way students have a better chance of finding a pattern that makes sense to them. <br><br>Nano, thank you! All I have to do is find out what "gas mk 1" amounts to in degrees Fahrenheit, which is what's marked on the dials of ovens here in America1 (That and figure out which gluten-free flour blend will work best, since my spouse has celiac disease.) <br><br>Tideshift, good question. As I mentioned in the book, there was more than one reason for American prosperity in those years -- having had all rival nations practically bombed back into the Stone Age didn't hurt, either -- but for reasons discussed in the book, I think high tax rates for the excessively rich had a good deal to do with it. <br><br>Planner, I'm delighted to hear that you brought it up! You're quite right; the dependence of American lifestyles on American empire is something nobody wants to discuss, even far to the left, because the implications are too unwelcome to consider. Still, we're going to have to consider them -- if only by having our faces rubbed in what happens as our empire goes away.<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c415896440308264151 title="comment permalink">12/22/11, 1:09 PM</a><br><br>

My wife and I relocated and bought our house in 2009, in the narrow window between when the bubble popped and when mortgages became basically unavailable, following the same sort of thinking you used. As for shale gas, though -- well, no, there I think you're wrong. The analyses that I've seen, especially of the depletion rate of fracked wells, make me think that we've got about five years of cheap natural gas, maybe a bit more, before gas prices start soaring and the first shortages loom. More on this in a future post.<br><br>Chris, it's quite true that apocalyptic fantasies tend to breed like bunnies during times of severe social stress, and in particular in the decades immediately before major social crises -- think of the Millerite movement, as one example out of many, as a harbinger of the American Civil War. My own guess is that we may see a huge apocalyptic movement, of Millerite scale or larger, around the 2012 prophecy; nothing will happen on Nothing Happened Day; and in the aftermath, things will start spiralling out of control in the political sphere. More on this, too, in a future post. <br><br>William, I'd certainly agree that the universe is more mysterious than we can know. I just find it embarrassing that so many members of our species treat that as justification for the claim that they can know, in advance, that history is about to be replaced with wish-fulfillment fantasy. That's what this blog post was meant to talk about. <br><br>Myriad, the commodity that's soaring in price isn't natural gas, true. It's mineral rights leases in shale gas country, and to a lesser extent, the stock value of gas exploration and production companies. That's where the bubble is; the price of gas, as I suggested, is equivalent to rental costs in the midst of the real estate bubble. <br><br>Archivist, as I recall, the original version of Timewave Zero argued that time was speeding up and would reach infinite speed in late 2012, causing the end of history. I think most of us of a certain generation had experiences like that, somewhere in among the tap-dancing spiders and fanged peanut brittle. <br><br>Valkyrie, what can I say? I think he's wrong. I'm sure he will say the same thing about me. Still, as I keep on having to point out, the difference between our viewpoints isn't fast crash vs. slow crash; it's fast crash all the way to the bottom vs. fast but incomplete crash, stabilization, partial recovery, rinse and repeat over one to three centuries until things finally bottom out. <br><br>Escape, yes, that's the progress side of the delusion -- the Tweedledee of my metaphor. The photos of the tsunami clouds -- good gods, those things are unnerving! Any ancient augur who saw those would be trembling in his toga. <br><br>William, human beings are capable of impressive creativity. The people who make crop circles are no exception to that rule. I hope you don't treat their really very lovely handiwork as an excuse not to do the things that will help build a better future. <br><br>Professor, I gather I hit a nerve with this week's post. I think if you reread what I wrote, you'll find that I never suggested that there's anything deluded about love, joy, hope, and inner wellbeing. I simply pointed out that it's not helpful to make those things dependent on the fantasy that some outside force is going to pop out of the woodwork and fix the world for us. That's what I've been saying here all along; if you managed to miss that, well, that's no fault of mine, you know.<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c8430360548685355091 title="comment permalink">12/22/11, 1:33 PM</a><br><br>

It was a frosty day and I was changing the water in the ducks' kiddie pool. The hose had been frozen but had managed to thaw a bit and when I turned it on, a series of icicles a bit smaller in circumference than the inside of the hose slipped out and onto the river rocks of a french drain running next to the pool.

Similarly, I take a joy in waking up in my cold yurt on a frosty morning to find the farm covered in white. Or in watching the ducks quack and thrash around in their pool, washing themselves and taking their own joy in the water. Or in watching our cats play in the grass, the chickens peck and scratch at the ground, the many birds flit around our farm, and so on.<br><br>All of that (or approximations) will exist in our future world, no matter how much suffering a lower-energy existence may temporarily pin on us. This is far too beautiful a planet to not provide joy and love, exuberance and exhilaration even in harsh times. I take comfort in that. I'm in no way prepared for a series of collapses and who knows if I would survive long through such happenings, but knowing that beauty and joy will be there no matter what keeps me hopeful.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c1559613759057076203 title="comment permalink">12/22/11, 2:04 PM</a><br><br>

Microcontrollers are programmable, which means that you need a computer to let them do anything useful at all. I think that "programming" is one aspect of electronics that would change if we tried to maintain some electronic technologies in a salvage society. Basic electronics - radio and the like - are most likely viable options, but for processors - in computers or microcontrollers - I guess human brain activity will likely replace CPU cycles.<br><br>Microcontrollers, and computers in general, have been designed as an extra layer of abstraction on an already high level of complexity (transistors, rare earth conductors...). The slow decline we are facing will probably affect the less abstract layers first, making it impossible for the higher layers to exist very long without the lower.<br><br>2º) Someone did post a link on thermoelectricity. This paper is testing various materials by calculating the thermoelectric effects you can get with each of them, and the calculations are based on the known properties of the materials. However that study does not seem to focus on any practical aspects - which materials are more apt to get us started somewhere if we want to perform any basement experiment at all ? Has anybody in the academic field ever experimented with that effect and brought it to some practical result ?<br><br>3º) I have recently seen an ad in the Paris subway. It is an ad for a dating website, and it goes like this : "I have gotten to meet my neighbour at last !". Surely, it has never occured to the readers of this blog that the Internet could slowly shrink below the level at which it can be viable economically - in the way that we have developped it - for the simple reason that people will slowly move away from it ?<br>Just like big cities could somewhat downscale a little as it becomes no longer economically attractive. Here, the economical attractiveness is something that also includes quality of life in my view - the current office work culture here is forcing young people to work increasingly long hours, probably because of a higher pressure on the conomy. So being economically viable also includes the quality of life.<br>My view is that at some point, being too connected to technology could actually hinder us in having basic relationships with other people.<br><br><br><br>It is not like the current worship of technology could ever change. It is not like the Roman empire itself was accompanied any deep changes in religious beliefs...<br>Here in France the CSA movement (community supported agriculture, called AMAP here) has been gaining momentum, just because people like it.<br>So it is important when thinking about technology to wonder both if it is feasible practically AND if people will actually like it in the long term. That is why I hope for Internet's sake that people will learn to like it in a more healthy way !<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c7259672508887748995 title="comment permalink">12/22/11, 2:27 PM</a><br><br>

Occasions for joy are everywhere, as is beauty. For me this joy and this beauty are more than enough without any measure of hope. <br><br>We have made a yard that many kinds of wild birds find very welcoming, here in New England. Yesterday I watched a female downy woodpecker foraging -- a beautiful small bird, enjoying (so far as I could read her body language) the small challenges of finding food in a fairly generous environment, enjoying the food itself, and enjoying her sharp-beaked victory over a squirrel that had tried to drive her away from some suet. <br><br>A few days ago there was a small hawk on a branch just outside one of our windows, visibly enjoying the meal she was making of a juncoe -- though I do not suppose that the juncoe took any joy in being that meal. <br><br>Always and everywhere both beauty and terror are seen, and each can bring us closer to the Sacred,to High Reality. <br><br>Do you remember how, on 9/11, a man who jumped from the Twin Towers, executed a perfect dive as he went down? Facing his own unavoidable death, that man imposed his own choice of form upon it and made of his fall a thing of heart-stopping beauty as well as gut-wrenching terror. Perhaps he did this only for himself, since he could not know whether anyone else was watching him as he fell. (When you know that you must die right now, you might as well create some small thing of beauty as you go down, for whatever joy it may bring you.)<br><br>I take from that man a lesson for myself as I age and the world I used to know crumbles under the weight of its own profligacy.<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c4239764870397840701 title="comment permalink">12/22/11, 4:35 PM</a><br><br>

As a prelude, the solstice occurred within a few minutes of local apparent midnight here, meaning that technically speaking the sun reached about the farthest negative altitude, and the night was about as long, as is mathematically possible. By just fractions of a second and an arc-second, of course, but it was still a noteworthy alignment. <br><br>Then we had a mostly cloudy dawn, which is not unusual here, but with enough breaks that the clouds were growing progressively more rosy-orange as the dawn approached. Until a few minutes before the scheduled sunrise, when the red glow rapidly faded! It looked like the sun had decided to turn around and go back down, in spite of the persistent drumming! Of course it was just a trick of the light caused by the shifting breaks in the clouds, but it was a peculiar (and a bit unnerving) thing to see during the dawn that is supposed to mark the turning of the seasons and the promise of ultimate spring. <br><br>I have a suspicion that 2012 might be an echo of 1968, a year when many things come to a head. Of course 1968 was not the end of the world, and neither will next year be. <br><br>As for the Shale Gas Bubble, let's just hope this thing pops before it wreaks even more havoc on the rural landscape than the Housing Bubble did. Unfortunately, this does not seem likely.<br><br>Lenticular clouds, by the way, are a dramatic but exceedingly well known and widespread phenomenon. They are the crests of standing waves in atmospheric currents. Though best known from mountainous areas (where they are triggered by the topography), they also turn up in flatlands when there are especially strong jet streams overhead. Think of them as being analogous to the whitecaps that form on top of standing water waves in a rapidly-flowing river.

That's exactly the point -- love, joy, hope, et al. are all around us even in the harshest times. Not only is it not necessary to believe in apocalyptic fantasy to have these things, to my mind, apocalyptic fantasy gets in the way of them. It's the ultimate form of provisional living: everything gets put off until the world we have is replaced with the world people think they want. <br><br>Stu, happy solstice. I don't see myself as any sort of spiritual leader, and I'm not at all sure that such critters exist; I teach an old-fashioned and somewhat unpopular craft, is all. Still, if my rants have been helpful to you, I'm delighted to hear it. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, very true. My own guess is that microcontrollers will no longer be economically viable once wages drop to the point that hiring a person to do the job is cheaper than paying a share of what it costs to build and maintain the massive infrastructure needed to make microcontrollers make sense. So much of modern technology is no more than a set of complicated gimmicks for doing what a human being can do with ten minutes of on-the-job training. As for people's preferences changing -- yes, precisely. It's the religion of progress that makes the cult of the machine seem to make sense; as progress loses its shine, I suspect we'll see massive changes in attitudes and opinions. <br><br>ChemEng, good heavens, I certainly didn't mean my remark to be taken as a blanket critique of Christians -- my apologies if it came across that way. Some of the people I had in mind do belong to one or another Christian church, but quite a few others don't -- dubious beliefs about the future are very widely distributed among the world's traditions, you know, as are attitudes of a more adaptive sort. <br><br>Richard, I've seen apparently serious arguments for filling Nevada with algae farms. The water? Oh, that's just a detail that'll be solved once they get to it. I wish I was joking. As for natural gas, exactly -- we've got maybe five years of unreasonably cheap natural gas, which means that those of us with gas furnaces, etc. have five years to get a replacement or a backup in place, and some spare money to do it. That could be very useful. <br><br>John, the question of what counts as hope in an age of decline is a hugely important one, and very likely needs a post to itself.

I admit to having had some of the “yearning for apocalypse” that you describe, and I can see where it can paralyze or let people off the hook in some situations. OTOH, I also caught myself feeling a bit more “free” in the sense of “freed from social burdens” when considering “what if this were my last year?” As someone who was always too much of a “good girl”, I know it’s way past time for me to be acting from my own inner sense of meaning.

I took it as a good omen (I’d ceremoniously started a new fire at dusk the night before, and tried to keep it going at least until bedtime) and laid on more wood. So I hope that bodes well for 2012.<br><br>A few little comments: <br><i> All I have to do is find out what "gas mk 1" amounts to in degrees Fahrenheit, which is what's marked on the dials of ovens here in America1 (That and figure out which gluten-free flour blend will work best, since my spouse has celiac disease.)</i><br><br>Dunno about Brit gas, but rice flour works for me in most cake recipes…<br><br><i>Still, as I keep on having to point out, the difference between our viewpoints isn't fast crash vs. slow crash; it's fast crash all the way to the bottom vs. fast but incomplete crash, stabilization, partial recovery, rinse and repeat over one to three centuries until things finally bottom out.</i><br><br>Difference between falling out the window and falling down the stairs…;-)<br><br>Oh, and I just listened to the Kunslercast – very good!

You disparaged David Korten's take on it in his book by the same name in The Long Descent as a quasi-apocalyptic justification for adoption of a liberal political agenda. I am more interested in the deeper psychological aspects of how the myth is involved in personal transformation. I believe he got the concept from ecopsychologist Joanna Macy who defines it as "the essential adventure of our time: the shift from the industrial growth society to a life-sustaining civilization." <br> See: http://www.joannamacy.net/thegreatturning.html<br><br>Is presenting the turning away from an industrial energy-dependent mythology and mindset, and turning towards a earth centered mythology and mindset, with overtones of a personal apocalypse necessary to people in our culture so steeped in these kinds of stories? Or are you saying that even without a promise of an utopian world on the otherside; just a turning towards earth-centered sensibility; the epochal/ apocalypic myth is a source of interference? <br><br>Thank you, I appreciate the weekly dose of insight.<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c5092695503126047723 title="comment permalink">12/23/11, 12:09 PM</a><br><br>

We use a fair amount of almond flour, especially in blends for cookies and the like; still, I'll certainly check out the link. <br><br>Yupped, excellent. It's precisely in the day by day choices we make that, it seems to me, is where real change becomes possible. <br><br>Jennifer, good heavens. That's good to hear. <br><br>Michael, no, I didn't. I criticized Korten's <i>The Great Turning</i> as a profoundly antidemocratic tract arguing that certain people (those with what Korten calls "spiritual consciousness," which is explicitly defined as those people who share his background and worldview) are more fit to lead than anybody else, and those who disagree with Korten's views belong to lower "developmental stages" -- a fact which he thinks ought to render them unfit for taking part in collective decisionmaking. (I'd encourage you to revisit my review of Korten's book, which you can find in three parts <a href=../../2007/03/round-in-circles-review-of-david-c.html rel=nofollow>here</a>, <a href=../../2007/03/round-in-circles-review-of-david-c_14.html rel=nofollow>here</a>, and <a href=../../2007/03/round-in-circles-review-of-david-c_21.html rel=nofollow>here</a>. <br><br>That said, though, I can certainly answer your specific question. The apocalyptic myth, at its core, is based on the claim that someone or something else is going to fix things; whether it's Jesus or the space brothers or an arbitrary shift in collective consciousness, some force outside the life and efforts of the individual does the work that only individual lives and efforts can accomplish. Thus I see apocalyptic fantasies, whether they're overtly supernatural or embodied in the sort of authoritarian politics Korten is offering, as a major obstacle to the work ahead of us. What we need, I would suggest, is not a Great Turning but a great many Little Turnings -- one for each of us, and each one creatively different from the others.<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c7198934847199136561 title="comment permalink">12/23/11, 12:40 PM</a><br><br>

However, when I consider all the nuclear weapons around and the potential destruction they could cause, I keep thinking they are something that could possibly turn things into a fast crash that could be considered apocalyptic. Of course, this is certainly not a desirable scenario, and any survivors would just have an immensely rough road ahead of them rather than the paradise envisioned by many apocalyptic scenarios. I remember you making a brief reference to nuclear apocalypse scenarios in the book, but nothing that convinced me that such a scenario couldn't happen.<br><br>I would appreciate your thoughts on the matter of nuclear war, as you've pretty much convinced me that other things I used to think could precipitate an apocalyptic crash won't do any such thing, and that they have many parallels in history. However I any histdon't see any historical parallel for nuclear weapons. We have managed to avoid nuclear war so far and sure hope we will continue to do so, but with the effects of resource depletion in a nuclear world, it's a significant concern for me. Will you be discussing this at all in your posts on the decline of the American empire?<br><br>I also see no historical parallel for the effects of nuclear energy, but these don't have the apocalyptic potential as the effects of radiation are insidious and show up over time, except for extreme doses. I consider the nuclear reactors will probably have the effect of making the descent steeper toward the end, deeper down to the bottom, and slower to recover than it would be otherwise.<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c234037343848969636 title="comment permalink">12/23/11, 7:39 PM</a><br><br>

A foil who can keep pace and come up with his own angles makes much of the difference.<br><br>It did get me thinking about why the current generation can't go for ap. tech. It has a lot to do with the much-maligned 60s. I used to hate it when people talked about how 'optimistic' the 60s were -- since nothing came of it the optimism was delusory, was my thought. <br><br>But the ap. tech. movement was all about ok, back to the land is the next trip man. And it's going to be an interesting ride. The whole idea of junking the system as it stood was in the air. People thought it stank. Bateson was interacting with R.D. Laing and Jules Henry, systems theory was happening alongside rock, everyone was beginning to suspect the standard-issue 'American Lifestyle' was pompous hypocritical neurosis. It <i>did</i> seem possible that simply 'dropping out' of the mainstream and preparing to live differently was the more rational route. It <i>did</i> seem that working out how to live like a hobbit could actually be the exhilarating ride JMG's spiritual vision showed it could be, <i>if the challenge were accepted</i>.<br><br>Much of the dropping out might have been little more than amiable loafing but the spirit of the times was more useful than some now allow and there's no sign of it today. The argument for techni-comfort has won out completely. The majority is not in the mood for a challenge and doesn't believe it could in principle be worthwhile.<br><br>So I agree, not looking great for this generation's response so far. It may be up to the pop culture to show a way forward as it did then. Or have the suits prevented it?<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c3708187981842643683 title="comment permalink">12/24/11, 6:55 AM</a><br><br>

If not, I certainly won't take it personally if you elect to delete this comment. :-)<br><br>I agree that on some "deep-down" level, all of us in US society know that we had a choice to make thirty years ago and that we made a catastrophically wrong choice. When you contrast this "deep-down" knowing with the official, socially-acceptable public ideology, the result is cognitive dissonance on a massive scale. I would go so far as to say that this cognitive dissonance makes very many of my experiences of society as an adult far more readily understood. This includes, as Chris B. pointed out, the "Apocalypse Now Or Later" fantasies (referring to how the fruition date of "predictions" such as the Scallion Map keep getting pushed always further into the future when Nothing Happens at the appointed time) that have been proliferating like acne on a teenage boy's face.<br><br>Also, if the Millenials don't "get it" yet (being the least homophobic generation to have existed in my lifetime, I have something of a soft-spot for them), I am not inclined to throw stones at them, having lived in something of a glass house myself for a period of time. When I was unable to obtain a middle-class job back in the late nineties/ early aughts, I took it very personally for a while. This was because it had been instilled into me from many sources for many years that a great deal of the measure of my self-worth would rest in my ability to secure admission into the mainstream middle class. It was only upon understanding what has really been happening and why for the past thirty years that I have been able to peel away the outer layers of this dysfunctional conditioning.<br><br>And also, I don't doubt that the ongoing posting of highlights from your book about failed apocalyptic predictions will be both informative and hilarious. :-)<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c8504770878494537946 title="comment permalink">12/24/11, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

I've pointed out in previous posts here, though, that a sudden massive blow -- a nuclear exchange, a lethal pandemic, or what have you -- is actually a lot easier to get through, and to recover on the far side of, than the sort of slow decline we'll get otherwise. Anything that lowers the population suddenly leaves a lot of resource flows available to the survivors, and outside of the blast zones, most facilities and other economic capital will remain intact; thus it's another stairstep jolt, with a high likelihood of a substantial degree of recovery afterwards. <br><br>Lloyd, thank you.

I just finished reading Why the West Rules—For Now: the Patterns of History and What They Reveal About the Future, by Ian Morris. Morris works out a scale to grade the social development of cultures based on energy capture, urbanism, information processing and ability to make war. The majority of the book is spent tracing the progresses, and occasional setbacks of the West and the East, concluding that the East, centered on China, is overtaking the West and may pass it about 2100. As befits a Stanford professor, he is careful not attribute the current lead of the West to racial or social superiority. Like Jared Diamond he gives a great deal of credit to the geography of Europe which encouraged ship building, first to make use of the Mediterranean, then to cross the Atlantic. China concentrated on internal trade and would have had a much longer voyage to reach the Americas in significant numbers. But Morris seems oblivious to the fact that energy capture and energy use are not the same thing. Agriculture and domestication of animals does capture more of the sun’s energy for human use than hunting and gathering. So does development of wind and water powered machinery. But the use of coal and oil as the Arch Druid has pointed out, only uses what has been stored. To claim otherwise is to act as if inheriting a fortune is the same as earning one. Morris cites predictions of future energy use that seem completely impossible (116 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, up from 86 million in 2007) without ever asking where that oil is coming from. He mentions the need for nuclear energy, brushing aside the problems of radioactivity. The race between East and West is enlivened by an imagined contest between the opposing possibilities of Nightfall and the Singularity. Nightfall is a complete collapse of civilization and culture, named after the Isaac Asimov story about a planet whose multiple suns only set simultaneously hundreds of years apart. The resulting nightfall causes panic and collapse so complete that the memory is not preserved to warn the future generation for whom it will happen. Singularity is the concept of humans and computers merging, suggested by Ray Kurzweil. Morris seems to lean much more toward Singularity than to Nightfall as our destiny. <br>If this is the sort of drivel turned out by award winning historians it is no wonder the average citizen is unconvinced the arc of history is going anywhere other than up.<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c9076767176908618497 title="comment permalink">12/24/11, 9:29 PM</a><br><br>

He plans to take classes in welding so that he can get a job building the tanker trucks.<br><br>The thing is, I've lived through this before. I was in high school in the late 90s, when all the buzz was about the desperate need for computer technicians, and how it would take 30 years to fill that need. Since I liked programming well enough and didn't know what else I was going to do, I signed up for computer science at the university in 1998. Before I had finished, the dot-com crash and then the off-shoring of tech jobs made my prospects very thin.<br><br>My point is, I'm now highly suspicious of any claims about some "hot new field". It seems to me that they are mostly propaganda by industry and schools, the first to lower their employment costs by increasing the worker pool, and the second to entice the tuition out of people desperate for any chance. Of course those same people are the ones that feel much of the pain when the bubble bursts.<br><br>--<br><br>On another note, I just read an article that illustrates one facet of the decline.

I don't really want to get into a long discussion about the actual consequences of nuclear war just now, but there's a good deal of difference between nuclear weapons as real if terrible phenomena and nuclear weapons as magnets for apocalyptic visions. <br><br>Rita, fascinating! Thanks for the reference -- I'll have to check that one out. I suspect that his giddy optimism regarding future energy resources comes out of his preference for the Singularity fantasy; any less rosy view leads to Nightfall in fairly straight order. Still, it'll be worth a read, and then a critique. <br><br>Gary, I've been less than satisfied by the science I've seen so far in crop circle research, and even less so by the weird tendency to jump from "something odd is going on here" to various notions about aliens from Zeta Reticuli, etc. -- you could as well argue, with considerably more support from folklore, that crop circles are made by dancing pixies. Still, pixies don't feed the dream of a nice shiny future we don't have to work for, which is probably why they're not too popular today!<br><br>Bert, it's going to get some serious discussion here, because it's shaping up to be another big bubble, and I'm not sure the US economy can take another one of those. <br><br>Mel, thanks for the heads up! The signs you've just cited are good evidence that the shale gas boom is about to take off for la-la land -- meaning we've got a couple of years, maybe, before the bubble pops. Seat belts, everybody!<br><br>Cathy, which poets? It's been too long -- I should be able to guess by what you've said. As for "beckastr," my guess is that it's short for "beckaster," which is like a disaster but with a much louder mouth. <br><br>Lance, interesting. I recall a weekend afternoon in 1986 or thereabouts when my spouse and I were taking the bus home, and the day was full of this vast, still, autumnal feeling as though the last chance to turn away from a very dark future had just gone sliding silently by the boards. We both felt it, and ended up going out to dinner -- not something we did often in those days; we were very poor -- and talking about it, very quietly, the way people talk when they're standing just outside a room where somebody's dying. I never did figure out what might have triggered the perception; it may have been nothing at all, simply a sense that too much time had gone by and nothing was going to be done. <br><br>Kieran, true enough. Thing is, for more than a decade now blowing bubbles has been the only thing the US economy has done that has created jobs -- think of the number of people employed in housing during the housing bubble!<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c2897420426162771050 title="comment permalink">12/25/11, 3:50 PM</a><br><br>

The obvious point that a society that is devoted to the destruction of its most important life-support systems can not really be consider truly lucid is one that one that we refuse to deal with - “Nah, nah, I can’t hear you!!” The point that the Enlightenment imposed a set of blinders as restricted as any other believe system – well, they are OUR blinders darn it, thank you very much SIR!<br><br>I was always very uncomfortable with the “magic” he added into his two peak oil novels.

This latest round of hoopla is an example; not too many years ago, even those who were into oil statistics would have responded to the Norwegian discovery with a yawn -- and of course the Bakken Shale got exactly that response when it was originally discovered years ago. <br><br>Lance, oh, granted -- the whole US economy is basically suds at this point, composed of bigger and smaller bubbles. Still, I have something a bit more specific in mind with regard to shale gas -- it's the kind of speculative bubble that could very well produce a drastic boom-and-bust cycle, like tech stocks and subprime real estate. More on this in future posts. <br><br>Cherokee, glad to hear that the storm was a blessing and not a disaster!<br><br>Unknown, I remember that. The argument I heard was that the extra gravitational tug was going to unleash earthquakes -- a nice theory, until you looked up previous alignments that put a bunch of planets in a straight line and noted that there was no correlation between those and earthquakes in the past. <br><br>Edward, excellent. That's not merely good practice, it's good work. <br><br>Poet, most interesting. Thank you. <br><br>Doctor W., bingo. A truly rational worldview wouldn't justify ravaging the biosphere that keeps us alive; it also wouldn't be quite so eager to pimp for business interests at the expense of human values. <br><br>Ceworthe, pie crust is tricky, but it can be done. We had a very nice lemon meringue pie for solstice. <br><br>Ric, California is the Rust Belt of the 21st century, and it's also got a rising spiral of ethnic conflict to deel with. Not a pretty sight. <br><br>Cathy, "big-mouthed disasters surround you" sounds like a line from a very odd fortune cookie! Thanks for the reference; I'll check it out. <br><br>Ozark, the discrepancy you've noted is at the core of my point. A nuclear war, a major upward jolt in global temperatures, a really big pandemic, etc. -- these are things that can happen and have happened to human populations in the past. They're not apocalyptic in the strict sense of the term, because afterwards, life goes on; we don't enter a world composed of daydreams. <br><br>The entire argument I've been making since before this blog got started is that we're facing a long ragged decline punctuated with major crises and disasters; an exchange of nuclear weapons could be among the crises and disasters, though the ability to launch a really massive nuclear strike may already be degrading as I write this (the threat is far more useful than the reality). <br><br>With or without mushroom clouds, in other words, we've basically got the same future ahead of us. It's the broader shape of the future that, to my mind, needs attention right now -- that and the steps that individuals can take to deal with the ongoing decline themselves.<br><br><a href=tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html#c4745794968802320257 title="comment permalink">12/27/11, 5:32 AM</a><br><br>

Don't plan on the educational system being around in anything like its present state for much longer, and beware of it while it's here, since it's going to be much more interested in raking in money to keep itself afloat than in giving anybody an education worth the name. <br><br>Hal, that's as good a metaphor for what happened to America in the wake of the Seventies as I've ever seen. <br><br>Joel, a rehabilitation of apocalypse would have to start by going all the way back to the roots of the concept, and recognizing that -- as the word actually means -- it's about revealing the hidden, not necessarily about predicting one specific kind of future. Back in the 17th and 18th centuries you saw alchemical and mystical interpretations of the Book of Revelations that understood it not as prophecy but as an unveiling, in symbolic form, of the timeless nature of things; Eliphas Levi and, more recently, John Michell did equivalent things in their writings; but that hasn't caught on. Instead we've got a way of thinking about the future that's as consistently counterproductive as any I can think of.

While I don't deny that this is true of some of my peers, not all of us are like this. We grew up surrounded by gadgets, true, but we also grew up surrounded by stories from our parents' coming of age: stories about the value of social justice, peace, creativity, respect for the Earth, and so on. The cognitive dissonance between the stories and the materialism has caused many of us, like me, to question the value of our current lifestyles and worldviews.
