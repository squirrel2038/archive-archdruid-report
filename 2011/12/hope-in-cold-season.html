<a href=../../2011/12/tweedledoom-and-tweedledee.html>Last week’s post</a> on the empty promise of December 21, 2012 and other apocalyptic fantasies fielded me a fair number of denunciations. That was predictable enough; the parallels I mentioned in that post between apocalyptic beliefs and bubble economics include the awkward fact that in both cases, those with the most to lose by buying into the delusion du jour are pretty consistently also the ones least willing to hear any questioning of their misplaced dreams.<br><br>Under other circumstances I’d simply have shrugged and filed the resulting tirades with the ones I get on a more routine basis from those who can’t stand some other aspect of this blog’s project. Still, one of this latest batch made an accusation that I found baffling at first glance, and then indicative of something worth attention just now. The commenter in question, to be precise, insisted that by criticizing the industry that has sprouted around the fake-Mayan prophecies of 2012, I was treating "love, joy, hope, and inner well-being" as so many delusions.<br><br>It probably needs to be said first off that this assertion involves a very odd definition of the concepts just named. Let’s imagine, to put the same logic in a different context, the plight of an unemployed single mother in today’s America during the holidays. She has, we’ll assume, barely enough money to pay the most basic expenses for herself and her children, and the clock is ticking on her unemployment benefits, which will run out after 99 weeks. Her desperate efforts to land any job at all have gone nowhere—that’s common enough these days—and it’s become plain, as the holidays draw near, that if she’s going to be able to afford to keep her children fed and clothed and housed into the new year, there aren’t going to be any Christmas presents.<br><br>What does she say to the children? According to the logic offered by my commenter, she presumably ought to insist to them that Santa Claus will show up on Christmas Eve with a big sack full of presents for all. It’s certainly true that this will fill the children with love, joy, hope, and a sense of inner well-being, for the moment. It might even seem like a good idea, as long as you don’t think about what’s going to happen on Christmas morning, when eyes that had been sparkling with delight the night before look up tearfully from the bare floor to their mother’s face.<br><br>I think most people recognize that the right thing to do instead in a situation of that kind is to tell the truth, or as much of it as the children are old enough to grasp, and do it early enough in the season that they can get past the inevitable misery and go to work making the best of things. Talk to people who grew up during the last Great Depression and you’ll hear stories of this kind over and over again—the holiday decorations pieced together from wrappers and scraps, the depressingly plain meal livened up with a few little touches or sheer make-believe, the little doll handmade from rags and burlap sacking that’s still treasured three quarters of a century later, and so on. If love, joy, hope, and authentic inner well-being are to be had in such a difficult situation, they’re going to come that way, not by way of making gaudy promises that are never going to be fulfilled.<br><br>Still, that sort of ethical clarity—so obvious to most Americans in the 1930s—is apparently far from obvious to a great many Americans today. The speculative bubbles of the last decade, again, offer an uncomfortably clear look at the popularity of delusion in American public life just now. When John Kenneth Galbraith wrote his brilliant and very funny history <i>The Great Crash 1929</i> back in 1954, he noted that the best preventive for the miserable economic aftermath of a speculative bubble was a clear memory of just how miserable that aftermath had turned out to be. In 1954, he was quite correct; a generation raised in the Depression years kept Wall Street on a very tight leash back then, and indeed Galbraith’s own testimony before a Senate subcommittee in 1955 on the implications of the 1929 experience was enough all by itself to pop a stock market boomlet—a circumstance Galbraith recounted in wry terms in the foreword to the second edition. The memory of 1929 had an immunizing effect so potent that it took until the 1960s for the US stock market to blow its first very tentative bubbles, and it wasn’t until the mid-1980s that a really classic stock market boom and bust followed the traditional path, up with the rocket and down with the stick.<br><br>Consider today’s economic scene and the contrast is hard to miss. The tech-stock bubble inflated all through the second half of the 1990s and crashed to earth between 2000 and 2002. No sooner had the rubble stopped bouncing than an even more gargantuan bubble in real estate took off. That crashed in 2008, and even though the rubble’s still bouncing, it’s doing so right alongside a bouncing baby bubble in shale gas. If some clever promoter comes up with a way for ordinary investors to speculate in shale gas leases or something of the kind—and I’ll be surprised indeed if that fails to happen in the coming year—it’s a safe bet that millions of people will take all the money they’ve got left and plunge into the shale market, driving another economically devastating cycle of boom and bust.<br><br>Part of the difference between then and now is that the 1929 crash came on the heels of a spectacular bubble in Florida real estate, which crashed in 1925, and that followed another nasty little bubble and crash in the stock market in 1921; thus we’re only just now at the point where the idiocy of trying to get rich off bubbles should be sinking in. Another part of the difference is that the financial authorities in 1929 responded to the implosion of the bubble by letting investors crash and burn, where today’s basically wet themselves trying to make sure that investors don’t lose money, even if keeping them solvent means that the economy goes down in flames. Still, I think there’s more to it than that.<br><br>In 1929, America was still an expanding society, with an economy that was still producing something other than fiscal hallucinations, and a standard of living that had been moving raggedly upward for a good long time. The delusion that drives bubbles—the notion that it’s reasonable to expect to get rich on unearned wealth—could seize the population now and then, as it’s done since market economies got abstract enough that speculative bubbles became possible in the first place. Still, most Americans could reasonably expect that with hard work and prudence, they could expect to have a better standard of living in the future than they had in the past, and their children could expect to do better still.<br><br>Those days are long past. For the great majority of Americans, living standards have been declining since the early 1970s, upward mobility is increasingly a nostalgic dream, and it’s becoming harder even for government flacks to keep pretending that training prople for jobs that don’t exist will make those jobs miraculously appear. Ours is a contracting society, and outside of the narrowing circle of privilege—itself facing, a little further down the road, a far more drastic form of downward mobility—most people realize that hard work and prudence, the road to a better future in past generations, are merely a slightly slower road to impoverishment than the one everyone else seems to be taking.<br><br>Combine that with the modern cult of celebrity that showers randomly chosen individuals with brief but spectacular bursts of wealth for the most absurd of reasons—would anybody care to explain to me just what the Kardashians did in 2010 that was worth an income of $65 million?—and the frantic marketing of consumer gewgaws that pervades American culture, and you’ve got a perfect recipe for a society in which an increasingly desperate populace will gamble all they have at increasingly long odds for a shot at unearned wealth. That’s what drove the speculative bubbles of the recent past, and will drive those of the near future. It’s also what drives the fixation on apocalyptic events that will supposedly dump history’s ultimate jackpot into the laps of those lucky enough to draw the winning ticket, whether that ticket is marked "Rapture," or "Singularity," or "December 21, 2012."<br><br>Now it’s fair to say there are those—and the commenter mentioned above may be among them—for whom a fixation of that sort is readily confused with hope. It may even be that it’s the closest thing to hope that some of them have left. Still, it’s not actually hope in any meaningful sense of the word. To understand why, we’re going to have to take a hard look at just what hope is.<br><br>That’s a vexed question just now, and not only because the current US president used the word to get into office via one of the most monumentally cynical political campaigns of modern times. Even before it got stripped of its remaining content by Obama’s marketing team, the old virtue of hope had gotten tangled up in America’s culture of entitlement, and twisted completely out of shape in the service of cynical marketing disguised as cheap sentimentality. "When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are, anything your heart desires will come to you..." Readers of a certain generation will remember hearing that bit of doggerel out of the mouth of an animated insect. I knew a small boy who, after seeing the movie in question, took to singing, "When you wish upon a star, you don’t see things as they are." Like most children, he knew better, and hated being on the receiving end of lies. I sympathized, having had exactly the same reaction a quarter of a century earlier.<br><br>We have, to be more precise, confused hope with the facile optimism of the privileged, the sort of thinking that insists that nothing really unpleasant can ever actually happen, not to us. A great many Americans, for example, think that being hopeful in the face of the depletion of fossil fuels means assuming against all the evidence that some ample replacement will be found in time to allow us to keep our energy-intensive lifestyles running. A great many of us more generally think that being hopeful in the face of the limits to growth means trying to convince ourselves that those limits don’t apply to us, or that there will turn out to be some way around them, or that somebody or other will bail us out before our refusal to deal with those limits lands us in consequences harsher than we want to think about.<br><br>It’s interesting by contrast to consider the historical conditions that surrounded the evolution of the concept of hope in the ethical thought of the Western world. Like so much of postclassical Western culture, it emerged out of the creative collision between Greek philosophy and Christian religious ideas in the late Roman world. That was not an age of economic expansion and rising standards of living. Quite the contrary; as the Roman Empire ran up against its own limits to growth, and then drove itself into bankruptcy and collapse trying to defend borders defined in a more expansive age, economic crises and a soaring tax burden sent standards of living steadily downwards while the Empire lasted. Its fall in turn brought an age of chaos in which whole regions that had once known widespread literacy, busy market economies, and such amenities as central heating devolved into fragmented, impoverished and drastically underpopulated successor states in which eking out a bare subsistence was an achievement not everyone managed.<br><br>The current American concept of hope would not have lasted long in the protracted downward spiral of the Roman world. The concept of hope as an ethical virtue, by contrast, became universally accepted during that same downward spiral. Why? Because hope, to translate its definition out of the ornate moral philosophy of the day, isn’t a sense of entitlement that insists that good things will inevitably come one’s way. Rather, it’s the recognition that some good can be achieved no matter what the circumstances might be, combined with a sustained willingness to try.<br><br>Compare hope to any of the other ethical virtues celebrated in that harsh time and the distinction is even clearer. Courage, for example, isn’t a facile assurance that one is destined to win. It’s the quality of character and the act of will that does the right thing in the face of danger and fear. This is, among other things, the opposite of the conviction that victory is inevitable. That’s a logical point—if someone recognizes no danger and feels no fear, he’s not courageous no matter how many risks he unknowingly runs—but it’s also a practical one. One of the commonplaces of military history, for example, is the army that believes it can’t lose, and then collapses in panic when the battle turns against it because it has never had to grapple with the possibility of defeat.<br><br>In the same way, hope doesn’t depend on a sense of entitlement that insists the universe is obligated to provide us with whatever happy ending we think we want, and in any real sense, it’s incompatible with notions of that kind. Hope is the quality of character and the act of will that finds some good that can be achieved, no matter what the circumstances, and then strives to achieve it. The sense of entitlement, in turn, is precisely equivalent to the belief that victory is inevitable, and it produces the same sort of brittleness; it’s for that reason that it tends to collapse into despair, and it’s despair, ultimately, that feeds fantasies of the apocalyptic event that will make everything different.<br><br>It’s for this reason that apocalyptic fantasies always flourish in the aftermath of grandiose movements for social and spiritual transformation. Behind the current flurry of 2012 prophecies lies the New Age movement’s conclusive failure to create its own reality, just as the parallel flurry of Rapture prophecies mark the bitter endpoint of a trajectory that began with the buoyant optimism of the "Jesus freaks" and the Good News Bible, when enthusiastic young Christians believed they could remake the world in Christ’s image. Hubris disguised as one kind of hope always ends up giving way to despair disguised as another kind of hope. In the process, the concept of hope itself risks being discredited.<br><br>That’s profoundly unfortunate, because it’s when overblown ambitions crash to the ground that hope in the true sense of the word is most needed. Behind the rise and fall of the New Age and the Evangelical movements stands the vaster rise and fall of another attempt to build Utopia here on Earth, the attempt we call industrial civilization. Right now, as the limits to growth tighten around us like a noose and an economy geared to perpetual expansion shudders and cracks in the throes of decline, one of the things that’s needed most is the willingness, in a time of gathering darkness, to locate what lamps can still be found, and light them. To return to the metaphor I offered earlier, we need to listen to the voice that tells us, "Honey, I’m really sorry, but Santa Claus isn’t coming this year"—and having heard that, and done whatever grieving we need to do, we need to draw in a deep breath, accept the hard fact, and get to work to spread at least a little light and warmth in a cold season.<br><br>*******************************<br><span style=font-size:130%>End of the World of the Week #2</span><br><br>Say what you will about the paired prophetic hysterias surrounding 2012 and the Rapture, not even their most extreme forms get quite as dotty as the apocalyptic beliefs retailed in the early 19th century by French philosopher Charles Fourier. One of those people for whom the word "crackpot" might as well have been invented, Fourier spent his working life as a traveling salesman and his off hours elaborating the Harmonial Philosophy, a dizzyingly complex theory of everything that included a set of colorful predictions about the impending total transformation of the Earth and everything on it.<br><br>There were many other thinkers in Fourier’s time who were convinced that their ideas marked a vast turning point in the history of the world. Nobody else, as far as I know, took it to the extent of thinking that the general acceptance of his philosophy would turn the oceans into lemonade. That was just one of the great transformations that, according to Fourier, would happen once a significant minority of the Earth’s human population embraced the Harmonial Philosophy and ushered in the era of Harmony, the fulfillment of Earth’s history. Torrents of "cosmic citric acid," he claimed, would then descend from heaven to turn the seas tart and tasty. Meanwhile four additional moons that ran away from Earth orbit—they were embarrassed to be seen with a planet whose inhabitants hadn’t accepted Fourier’s ideas—would come swinging gaily back to their places; lions would turn into cuddlesome, vegetarian antilions; and human beings, freed from drudgery by Fourier’s discovery that economic problems could be solved by "passional attraction," would devote their time to gourmet dining and orgiastic sex.<br><br>Odd as these ideas sound today, they were hugely popular in Europe and America, and something like a hundred Harmonial communes—"Phalansteries," as they were called—were organized by enthusiasts hoping to make the dream real. Alas, neither the cosmic citric acid nor the antilions showed up, and the communes folded promptly once it became clear that passional attraction wasn’t up to the task of producing enough food, clothing, and other necessities for even the most devoted believers. At its peak in the 1820s, the movement unraveled thereafter, feeding erstwhile followers still eager for Utopia into other radical movements of the time. There was a brief attempt to revive Fourier’s ideas in the 1960s—something about his ideas, not to mention his prose style, seems to mesh well with the popular drugs of the time—but outside of that, he remains one of the forgotten ancestors of today’s Utopian beliefs.<br><br><div style="text-align: right">—story from <a href="http://www.vivaeditions.com/book_page.php?book_id=25">Apocalypse Not</a></div>

I've been mulling what hope in a harsh future means and plan to write a post of my own on it, working off some of my comments in last week's thread. I think taking some time to sit down and work through those thoughts would be good--I've been feeling a little melancholy the last day or two when thinking about what kind of future may face us.<br><br>I spoke with my young niece on Christmas about working and life. She's barely out of high school, has a young child and was doing some retail work over the holidays that she may or may not be able to continue. She was talking about wanting to get a car but enumerating some of the extreme costs. I advocated she not get it--that it wasn't worth it, especially considering she's able to get around on the bus right now and buy a three month pass for $20(!) from her school. Car insurance alone would cost her over $100/month. I hope she'll think about my words a bit, because getting a car would crush the very limited maneuverability she currently has.<br><br>It's funny, too--she mentioned that she's been reading my blog. I've been fairly explicit on it of late that I don't see this way of life continuing much longer, with worsening economic realities coming down the pike. I wonder what she makes of that. I don't imagine she believes it and I have to wonder what she feels about the idea, having a child, in school, hoping for an eventual decent job, still living at home, just barely getting started. I'm lucky enough to be in a much more flexible position, with no one reliant on me. I can't imagine what it would be like to be considering such a future as a young mother.<br><br>All the more reason we need to hold onto all the honest hope we can find.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=#c3829937837956636283 title="comment permalink">12/28/11, 7:01 PM</a><br><br>

I guess I do not know myself, or I just can't resist your writing. As for the concepts of love joy hope and inner wellbeing - I am sure that as a scholar and a druid you can find some philosophy or religion that takes these ideas and applies them usefully and productively to the vision of the declining world that you posit for us in such conscientious detail each week. Yet you don't, and I think last post I was left wondering why you don't. You are not an optimist. And what confounds me about this is that you are obviously a spiritual person. Still, as you remind us constantly, you wear your mage’s hat lightly in this forum, so I think that it might be too much to ask that you might offer those concepts as hermetic values, and speak a little to – yes, ineffable love and impossible optimism, regeneration, spiritual ascension – you know, the higher consciousness-new ager type things that you so cynically deconstruct here. As for the poor mom on Christmas morning – many of us mothers have been “her” in one way or another when it comes to not being able to provide fully for our children – I think it is best to offer one’s children whatever material sustenance there is, but not to be sparing with the food for the soul. (Love? joy? wellbeing?) It is the only thing that lasts when everything else is gone.<br><br><a href=#c5612872151095879746 title="comment permalink">12/28/11, 7:02 PM</a><br><br>

What's coming involves not just "gradual decline", via peak energy, but a catastrophe via discrete political and economic vectors. The entire Eurosphere/Anglosphere economy is a vast debt sandwich, and we are soon going to choke on it. Combine Ponzi collapse with a late 2012 existential poltical crisis in the US - involving a Ron Paul Third Party bid, which will throw the election to Obama via the EC with less than 45% of the actual vote - and you have all the ingredients for a violent and protracted civil war...for which the Regime is clearly preparing. If a Black Swan precipitant is needed, try the Iran War, also coming down the pike. Instant "peak oil". In short, first Tuesday in November, 2012. Then: 60 days to Fort Sumter.

They're as available right now as they ever were, and they'll still be available at the bottom of the coming dark age, in the midst of the stark material poverty of that time; I've said that repeatedly here.

It has clarified things for me considerably. <br><br>When I have railed against hope here in the past, calling it a perpetual deceiver, it has always been this "when you wish upon a star" hope that I had in view, this weird blend of facile optimism and stubborn denial that is so widespread now-a-days. <br><br>What you say about the older sense of the word hits home for me, and your comparison with the related virtue of courage seems spot on. In fact, I had been using the word "courage" for both virtues in my own thinking.<br><br>My own ancestors have been deeply tinctured with this Harmonial Philosophy and its offshoots in New Thought from at least the mid 1800s down to Norman Vincent Peale and the New Age. And it has been the source of one disaster to another in their lives for over a century. Each disaster became the subject of family stories, always with the hidden message "if only we had been more optimistic, if only we had been stronger in our affirmations (really, in our denials), . . ." then things would have gone well. <br><br>For an example of this sort of thing, see now Lucia Greenhouse's excellent "Fathermothergod: My Journey out of Christian Science." It shows what this kind of life looks like from the inside, whereas Barbara Ehrenreich's "Bright-Sided" remains an outsider's critique.<br><br>Robert Mathiesen<br><br><a href=#c8984071936803768629 title="comment permalink">12/28/11, 7:46 PM</a><br><br>

Similarly, after the Apocalypse, the Earth will still be in ruins. There will be no magical transformation. It will in no way resemble a paradise, even for the Amish. We will still have to do the hard work of restoration that, had we done so previously, would have prevented the collapse.

I had just finished an outing and dinner with my lovely Nana (grandmother) a few hours ago. She has been on the New Age train for quite some time and blends those ideas liberally with those of her Irish Catholic upbringing. She is an eternal optimist and always responds poorly to me when I speak of things such as economic failure or Peak Oil. She proclaims that I am too negative and that I must stop speaking of those things....even when reluctantly admitting that they "may" happen. Well...tonight we had a delightful discussion where I used the same framework you used in this post to argue my position. My goal was to make her understand that I am not miserable, I am not resigned to doom, and I am not negative. It was a minor break through. She was very encouraged and even told me that she is sad that she may not live to see the changes we discuss here at The Archdruid Report because she desires the opportunity to apply real hope and courage in a great struggle once more before she passes.<br><br><a href=#c6416476559312605301 title="comment permalink">12/28/11, 9:00 PM</a><br><br>

It's not ignoring the enormity of the tasks ahead or the roadblocks that stand in our path. It's not sitting on the sidelines or shirking from a fight. Hope is that thing inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us if we have the courage to reach for it and to work for it and to fight for it.</i><br><br>Which is another way of saying what you wrote above:<br><br><i>Because hope, to translate its definition out of the ornate moral philosophy of the day, isn’t a sense of entitlement that insists that good things will inevitably come one’s way. Rather, it’s the recognition that some good can be achieved no matter what the circumstances might be, combined with a sustained willingness to try.</i><br><br>Here's something odd: you and Obama define hope in much the same way, as that definition above is from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/03/us/politics/03obama-transcript.html?pagewanted=all" rel=nofollow>his speech upon winning Iowa, probably the first time many people saw him speak about hope</a>.

After being introduced to your blog last June, what seems strangest to me is how hopeful your writing is - not hopeful in the entitled sense, but hopeful in the optimistic in the face of any circumstances sense. That kind of hope requires acknowledging the harsh realities one is up against in order to know one’s response. You certainly do not shy away from illuminating the harsh realities of our collective choices, and you respond to them with hope for the good we can still accomplish. Hope can only grow out of realism, or even cynicism. Yves Smith, another hopeful blogger who led me to you, often references a study that found cynics to be more accurate judges of reality. <br><br>One of modern America’s most debilitating and hope-killing cultural straight jackets then is our false Positivism, born of unexamined confidence. How the trolls will come scurrying out of the woodwork, ingrained misconceptions in hand, at the slightest mention of unvarnished truth. And often with God on their side, preaching Positivism. Most Positivists are disturbingly pessimistic at heart, banishing any distress that dares disrupt their fragile fantasy of certainty. Anyone who cannot tolerate dissenting (read “negative”) views possesses little faith, hope, or confidence in a world beyond their control. They are hopeless and often quite embittered from it.<br><br>Thank you for restoring hope to a meaningful place in the dialogue. When it became a one-word slogan for political campaigning, the promise of presumed entitlement seemed to hijack its other meanings. And thank you for restoring so many other terms and ideas to places of significance for your readers.

The assumption amongst middle class types is that India will grow, the infrastructure will eventually become like Europe and that the nation will regain its once prominent place in the world as a leader. They even have plans to build a Japanese bullet train system in the country. The reliance on petro-chemical for agriculture, the largely unrestrained enthusiasm for industrialization and the building of luxury flats and race tracks on fertile farmland will, in retrospect, look quite foolish when the nation can no longer pay for increasingly expensive petroleum imports from the ME.<br><br>Still, here and in China nobody sees this. There is a naive vision of the future where a lot of people (mostly the privileged middle classes living in cities) see their countries as having the same standards of living as in Europe or America if everyone just works hard enough.<br><br>The unfortunate reality is famine will probably claim over a billion lives or more in Asia and the social upheaval will reverse the development seen in the last half-century.

This might be an aspect of the Great Divide, though – between the optimists and pessimists (or, as we like to be called, “the realists”). (okay – that’s dualist; I’ll work on a 3rd option.) I have been fighting all my life against those who insist on believing “the best is yet to come” or “believe it, and it will happen”. Half the time, I have observed, they are simply trying to push away the conversation (whatever it is) – those aphorisms are just their way to shortcircuit discussions of problems they don’t want to look at. But there are those who really “believe” – and those seem to have made their lives contingent upon these beliefs being true. Occasionally I have had one blurt that “I just couldn’t live if I didn’t believe this!” – ie: there is no meaning in their lives aside from this belief in a Great Benevolence that will not allow them to suffer (or if they are suffering, will reward them proportionally at some future point). Been there, done that, hated the tshirt. Finally, because I simply couldn’t turn my back on the realities of my life, which did not reinforce these bubbles of hope, optimism, etc., I came to a detachment that accepted I am a small part of a vast cosmos and my meaning comes from appreciating the mystery and the beauty that is always around me. (Accepting <i>most</i> of the time – I’m not finished my inner growth.)<br><br>I have gotten a lot from the books of therapist James Hollis, (one is “The Middle Passage: From Misery to Meaning”) precisely because he does not promise impossible happiness as a result of inner work – he says once we discover our true selves, we discover our meaning, but that meaning could be full of suffering. I have never been able to accept those who promise happiness; they are far too likely to blame the victim if that happiness doesn’t arrive.<br><br>BTW, weren’t Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and the Russian writers of the time very influenced by Fourier? I believe I read that in a bio of Dostoyevsky.<br><br>@Nutty Prof: <i>I am sure that as a scholar and a druid you can find some philosophy or religion that takes these ideas and applies them usefully and productively to the vision of the declining world that you posit for us in such conscientious detail each week. Yet you don't, and I think last post I was left wondering why you don't. You are not an optimist. And what confounds me about this is that you are obviously a spiritual person.</i><br><br>Optimists seem to think that theirs is the only valid point of view. I, also, am not an optimist and I also am a spiritual person. If by optimism you mean (as you seem to) that “all will be well”, then that is just one option. As a spiritual person, I believe this life has <b>meaning</b>, which is not the same thing as saying I believe I will be fortunate if I believe. The only possible valid versions of your listed spiritual values – “ineffable love and impossible optimism, regeneration, spiritual ascension” to me are about <b>detaching</b> from the ordinary way of perceiving the world and seeing ourselves as smaller parts of a Whole – but again that does not guarantee my being treated well or comfortably. You seem to be implying that by believing in the values listed, you will be spared pain, doubt and hard work (maybe that’s an exaggeration) and/or you will “get your crown in Heaven” – ie: you will eventually be “paid off” for the pain and thus the “economics of spirituality” (if I may coin a phrase) will be balanced. The key difference between “hope” of the ancients and the modern “hope” is who’s acting – the modern hope requires that some external being act (to love, to provide salvation) whereas the ancient “hope” is an internal act – one is reaching out to the everyday miracles and drawing sustenance from them. Perhaps that is a bit more clear?<br><br>BTW, another ambiguity is the fact that we use the word “hope” as a verb to mean “I want this to be true” as in “I hope you are feeling better”. <br><br>More in a separate post about the New Age apocalyptic visions.<br><br><a href=#c8857635364340189886 title="comment permalink">12/29/11, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

If we could take some children from the 1730s, put them in the depths of the 1930s Depression, and gauge their reaction on Christmas morning, they'd probably be quite thrilled with life. Or, if you prefer, swap some of today's recently-become-lower-income American children with Haitian children. Misery is to a great extent relative. (By saying this, it does not mean I believe all children would be better off living like its 1730s America or modern-day Haiti. And yet, many today would accuse me of being some kind of pessimist.)<br><br>Like JMG, I too have been labeled "not an optimist." Over and over again I stood speechless and began to think, "Well, maybe they're right." I have sought many years for an antidote to this strange spell, and I think it has to do, not with hope itself, but with the all-but-lost concept of gratitude.<br><br>I would like to share some practical advice.<br><br>One way to recalibrate your "hope meter," as it were, is by consciously practicing gratitude. I give credit to the author Sarah Ban Breathnach for the idea: she advised keeping a gratitude journal. Once daily before bed, write down five things you are grateful for that day. Her claim was to try it for a month, and it will change your life. Well, I thought that a bit fantastical, but I tried it anyway. I can report that it truly changed my perspective. (This was a couple years before the Archdruid Report. In retrospect I realize I may have inadvertently changed my consciousness in accordance with will. Hmm...) <br><br>But I would advise doing this discreetly, at least at first. It can be quite difficult in practice because we may not realize how "uncool" gratitude really is. There is a TON of pressure in America today to be UNgrateful for what we have. How many of us have had the experience of feeling embarrassed, or even being openly ridiculed, by admitting, for example, that we took time on Thanksgiving to actually be thankful? (How many of us even know what “being thankful” is?) Our own teenage children can shame us into thinking we are foolish to be grateful. What power they wield! In fact, many young political activists, supposedly the "beacons of hope" of our international secular culture, would eye us with suspicion if we admitted we were actually grateful for things as they are. As JMG noted in a previous post in reference to a book by Ioan Culianu, millions of Americans go to work each day with the task of making the world ungrateful for what it has. (The solution, of course, is always a product or service for sale. Perhaps that is why our current President seems to believe our current health care problems can be solved by forcing people to buy something...) But I digress.<br><br>I believe another important reason gratitude is taboo nowadays is its historically tangled relationship with religious thought. JMG could probably write an entire post about how that came to be, but for my part I offer this disclaimer. I admit my introduction to practicing gratitude comes from sources affiliated with the Christian tradition. <br><br>As another starting point I also must thank this essay by Mark Mitchell: http://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2009/06/cultivating-gratitude/ To repeat my disclaimer, be warned that this article posits and makes reference to a singular higher power.<br><br>I recommend anyone to try keeping a gratitude journal or similar practice according to their own traditions and beliefs, and please note that it does not involve sending me any money but it does involve doing some work for oneself.<br><br><a href=#c1547162958606526511 title="comment permalink">12/29/11, 8:20 AM</a><br><br>

I seem to be realizing that word, serendipity, a lot lately. It seems to be somewhat more positive than "coincidence", a bit like "hope" relative to "faith". <br><br>I spent yesterday with old friends (since third grade) who are looking for a small stake here in the mountains. I let them know when the nine acre homestead (two properties down the road) went into foreclosure, an excellent candidate for a sustainable family compound. Good bottom land, about five acres of hardwood, and the brisk little stream that rises on our land runs through the heart of the property. Good southern exposure as well.<br><br>The former owner was a friend who succumbed to ALS about 18 months ago, and I was sort of a mentor to him regarding things renewable. When he first broke ground I advised him on things that have worked for me and tried to steer him away from "free electricity machines" and such. He had built a small well-insulated home, a garden plot, a small spring-fed pond, a root cellar and a nice earth bermed greenhouse, before his symptoms became overtly evident. He was acting upon his hopes to become more self sufficient and resilient. During this time, his first wife died and he remarried.<br><br>The last time we spoke he had no idea who I was. I stopped visiting him shortly after that, though we did meet up occasionally in town before he died. He was only 63.<br><br>My friends came up from their current home, formerly a small town that has been devoured by the Beast that is metro Atlanta. I took them to view the property from the road and noticed that there was a car down at the house. I hesitated to go down, not wanting to seem like a scavenger circling above the remains of a compadre's life, a potentially awkward situation. Since my friends had made the journey to view the property we went down to the house. The widow came out, was very gracious, explaining that she was packing some things up, that the property was indeed foreclosed on, and she was looking forward to moving to a small apartment in town; returning to a more simple, basic life. There was no will for the remaining estate and she wasn't going to fight her step-children for what was left. She "hoped" to return to a quiet, affordable life, and it was clear she was acting on that hope.<br><br>I joined my friends in viewing the property and as I went behind the house noticed some changes since I had last been there. On the hill above the greenhouse and root cellar was a rather colorful shrine; painted crosses, large wooden hand painted tablets of the 10 Commandments, a huge rainbow embossed with with "JESUS SAVES", and other totems to "Christ Our Lord". In his last diseased days, my friend had remained quite busy. <br><br>The path that led up the hill created a distinct division between the garden, root cellar, greenhouse,, all the evidence of an active hope of building a better future, and the transition to a more passive faith that a better future was guaranteed in the afterlife. My once quite intellectual friend had become the empowered believer. The physical/spiritual demarcation was remarkable, deserving contemplation.<br><br>We thanked the widow and left, my friends expressing their intension to bid on the property. They returned to the suburbs as I settled in to read this week's Archdruid Report (coincidentally? published early). Thanks, JMG for another dose of understanding, and sorry for the long comment, as I work through another day in paradise.<br><br><a href=#c4854877243423591258 title="comment permalink">12/29/11, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not sure if she's taking on debt or not--I know she would qualify for grants and my hope would be that she's sticking to those. But I suspect she's taking out some loans, as well. That's too bad, as I can't imagine hers paying for themselves anymore than mine have.<br><br><br>Chris,<br><br>I may be extrapolating from my own experiences too much here, but I do think one of the issues in our society is that many people are doing the wrong work, and their distaste for it leads them to think that all work is bad, unsatisfying drudgery. (And, of course, we have a popular culture that reinforces this idea.)<br><br>For instance, most of my standard working life was in retail. There was a stretch during which I liked it okay and I always had the luck of working with good people. But after a few years, I became progressively less happy. I wouldn't say that was all because of the job, by any means, but I certainly didn't enjoy the work or find meaning in it. At a certain point, recognizing this reality, I got out of it. I did a couple terms of AmeriCorps, went back to school for awhile and finally wound up farming. That has been a progression I've loved and has taught me how much I can enjoy doing good work. As it turned out, it wasn't work in general I disliked but the terrible work I was doing. In fact, it was <em>physical</em> labor that I found meaning and joy in!<br><br>I received a little confirmation of this change from outside, as well. After I started farming, I found myself back in town hanging out with old friends, one of whom I had worked with during my retail days and the other I had lived with for years during that time. They both admitted, in a moment of beer-fueled honesty, that they had not expected me to last farming. They thought I would hate the work. They thought, basically, that I didn't like to work. The word lazy wasn't spoken, but it think it was there in subtext.<br><br>I think many people, if they came back to work rooted in the earth and in their own sustenance, would discover that they really enjoy it and are happy to do it. In a context of unsatisfying and destructive work, I was unhappy and probably lazy. In the context of farming well, feeding people, connecting to the earth and helping to build my local community, I'm intensely happy and a good worker (though nowhere near as hard a worker than the woman who owns the farm I live on, I'll admit.) Context matter. The work itself matters.<br><br>For me, this is a big part of the context of hope. Right now, we live in a society that creates associations and judgements about work based on a very messed up standard of work. It's based on the system of slotting oneself into whatever job is available, no matter the work, often with little to no regard for one's particular skills and interests. And more often than not, that work is part of a system that's destroying this planet and tearing apart our culture and society. It's not surprising we have a large population of people who don't like work. The context is horrible.<br><br>People have to discover what good work is. When they do that, I think most will be willing to do more of it and will find more joy in it.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=#c7604655015692736745 title="comment permalink">12/29/11, 10:46 AM</a><br><br>

Sometime later, I used the other side of that piece of paper to write down something for a friend of mine. She happened to flip over the paper and questioned what the "Four Stones" meant and I explained sheepishly, after a moment of hesitation. I was a bit embarrassed by it.

When the Buddha taught that the essential nature of life was suffering, was that a negative vibration? What about Jesus, when he stood on the Mount of Olives and warned his disciples -- quite accurately, too -- that within the lifetimes of some of them, Judea would be ravaged and depopulated, and the Temple flattened to the ground? <br><br>The notion that unhappiness is somehow unspiritual has been forcefully rejected by all the great spiritual teachers of our species. It's only in the beliefs of a pampered minority -- and yes, the middle class American audience of the current New Age scene fits that description to a T -- that such ideas could catch on. <br><br>Cathy, nicely put. I think that in a lot of cases, the people who use thoughtstoppers of the sort you've described are hiding from their own misery, as you've suggested. That's a profoundly human reaction, but it's also guaranteed to fail. <br><br>Dr. Juliet Ashley, who was the third Grand Archdruid of the order I head, and a classic American occultist of the old school, used to say that there's a surefire technique for dealing with suffering. The first step is to identify exactly what's wrong; the second is either to change it, or to learn to live with it.

To advocate something is to believe it is the best alternative, not that the alternative is inevitable.

This JMG triology highlights one of the forms that hope can take - the hope, namely, that some of the labours of our science predecessors (JMG focuses on maths) can be preserved, perhaps in a monastic setting, when civilization declines.<br>----<br>The first two of the three JMG pieces may be seen at <br> http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2006_11_01_archive.htm l.<br><br>The third of the three pieces may be seen at <br><br>http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2006_12_01_archive.html.<br><br>----<br>Some readers may additionally find it helpful to see a picture of a slide rule, since that numerical-calculations tool is central in JMG's three-part fictional narrative. I have taken such a picture today, from my own maths-work desk, and I have uploaded it to<br> <br>http://www.metascientia.com/CNNN____slide_rule.jpg.<br><br>----<br>The slide rule is from high school days in the late 1960s. Up to this point, it has been successfully preserved in the face of upheaval. <br>----<br>Although I do not really use the slide rule, the papers under it in the photo are authentic, unposed, papers from maths-in-progress. My work in maths, astronomy, and electronics is humble, below the level of any grad school. At the moment I am on a rewrite of the somewhat rushed Salas-Hille 1990-textbook proof of multivariate Chain-Rule-along-Curve. (Salas and Hille rushed their proof by failing to consider such possibilities as a not-quite-nice curve r(t), where r(t) is as usual a function from some real interval into the ordered triples of reals, and yet r(t) is discourteous enough to be constant over some subinterval of its domain.)<br>----<br>The obituary I perpetually keep over the far left of the desk commemorates calculus specialist M.Edelstein. I briefly discuss Prof. E's first-year maths teaching in the first chapter of "Utopia 2184", in the "Literary" section of www.metascientia.com. Prof. E's life, which included escape from the Holocaust, was and is a tutorial in hope.<br>----<br>Maths is itself a school in the virtue of hope - specifically, in the hope that, with mathematical truth standing above the mere human mind as the sun stands above mere sunlit streets, glints of that truth become available to all who work diligently. <br>----<br>The same kind of hope drives work in physics and astronomy, concerning which parallel points could be made. I think that JMG hints at such points in some of his other fiction, "Star's Reach", at http://starsreach.blogspot.com/.<br><br><a href=#c5252678292123950351 title="comment permalink">12/29/11, 1:46 PM</a><br><br>

There are certainly many who put great faith in the power of positive affirmations, and seem to tend towards the whole positive thinking/Tony Robbins sort of thing. Of which I am not a fan at all. At the same time, there are some that line up with more of a Buddhism-lite or stoic approach, in which accepting reality for what it is and surrendering to it is the greatest spiritual practice. Eckhart Tolle, for whom I must confess some affinity, would be an example. <br><br>Becoming comfortable with reality, and accepting all of the uncertainty and change and possibility that it entails, seems to me to be quite a hopeful act. Letting go of the past, not worrying about the future and focusing on what can be done in the present moment will likely be quite a good habit to form in the coming years, just as it is a good habit today. I have enough experience with (practicing) to live this way that I can say confidently that positive things do flow from accepting reality as it is, even when that reality features various hoover-like attributes (ie. It sucks). But you have to put down your expectations, really put them down, and be open to what life is actually bringing along at the moment. And that is tricky, especially if you have developed the attention span of a small insect. <br><br>But in that basic openness to reality, acceptance of what is, I think there is the basis for real hope.

My one major disagreement with Ilargi and Stoneleigh both is that they consistently underestimate the power of the tools the existing order can use to hang on; they've repeatedly predicted an economic fast crash within a short time frame, which hasn't happened, and I wish sometimes they'd draw what seems to me to be the obvious conclusion, which is that it's going to be a slower and more ragged process, with the current system using every bit of its considerable power to keep a fast crash from happening.

The seven virtues I'm working with are: <br>chastity<br>temperance<br>charity<br>diligence - of mind and body<br>patience<br>kindness<br>humility<br>as taken from Wikipedia as being the current list of the seven virtues in the Roman Catholic tradition. <br>The virtues are traditionally (in binary logic)seen as opposites to the current list of the seven deadly sins (in same order):<br>lust <br>gluttony <br>greed <br>sloth, laziness of mind or body wrath <br>envy, and at the root of all, <br>pride.<br>Today's discussion has been about hope, which we see does not make the list, but figures prominently in Corinthians 1:13, a well known passage, where Paul, in verse 13 writes: "And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love." (King James version with "charity" rendered as "love")<br>(My personal take on this passage renders "love" as "compassion".)<br>But we see that charity (or love or compassion)is indeed a classic Christian virtue.<br>My essays often explore some point JMG has made, in this one I'm thinking about his reference to Aristotle's view of virtue, as well as his frequent depiction of the dominant faith in material progress as a religion. Always excellent food for contemplation. The theme I'm onto is the possibility of synthesis: a spirituality that fully embraces science and science that fully embraces spirituality. Perhaps with a little trinary or lateral thinking I'll muddle through! More likely, the answer is already staring me in the face.

Most of the young people I know are condemning themselves to decades of poverty by being suckered into taking out student loans for education that will never pay back what it's costing them. </i><br><br>I work in the UK university sector, mostly teaching postgraduate students. Recently, I saw a former student on the TV news; he'd come back to university after a period of unemployment, taking a higher degree in Management in order to improve his opportunities. I believe that he took a loan in order to do so. Having obtained his degree he was still unable to find work.<br><br>What worries me is that he was one of the best students in his year: intelligent, inquisitive, hard-working, and articulate. Normally, I count myself lucky if even one student has prepared for class, or voices an opinion. The majority appear to have no interest in the subject they are studying, and are simply trying to obtain a qualification with minimum effort so as to boost their career opportunities.<br><br>As that past student shows: that probably won't happen. Eventually word will get out, and the students will stop coming. That'll be awkward, since we now depend on student fees for our funding. JMG's comment on last week's post was thus rather close to the bone:<br><br><i>Don't plan on the educational system being around in anything like its present state for much longer, and beware of it while it's here, since it's going to be much more interested in raking in money to keep itself afloat than in giving anybody an education worth the name.</i><br><br>For now, I can only feel sorry for these kids, adrift in a collapsing economy and taking on debt that will be a burden for many years. I'm more motivated every day to acquire useful, not theoretical, skills, and to make my home resilient while I still have a regular salary.<br><br>For UK readers who are thinking along the same lines, the following link may be interesting:<br><br><a href=http://www.tradeskills4u.co.uk rel=nofollow>http://www.tradeskills4u.co.uk/</a><br><br>(I don't have personal experience of them, but it looks useful).<br><br><a href=#c6621080520924299246 title="comment permalink">12/30/11, 1:30 AM</a><br><br>

I've written about this in a popular article in my blog "Rushleigh - the pursuit of wisdom chronicle". The article is "Climate change and the implication of beliefs in determining the future". The link is: http://rushleigh-pursuit-of-wisdom-chronicle.blogspot.com/2009/12/climate-change-and-implication-of.html<br><br>Also I owe you a considerable debt of gratitude for all you put into your book, "The encyclopaedia of the occult". It was immensely helpful to me when I was going through the worst time of my life - the deconstruction of long-held New Age belief structures. Few could comprehend quite how shattering spiritual dis-illusionment can be. I've written a great deal about this in my blog "Rushleigh - the Wasteland Chronicle" with the section on the Spiritual Wasteland being contained in posts for the month of April 2010. Since you were encouraging Robert to tell his story of his family's New Age entanglements, I venture to share part of my own story here, along with the link to an article which encapsulates much of the legacy I 'inherited' from my father: I've called it "What were all those spiritual books?" and the link is: http://rushleigh---the-wasteland-chronicle.blogspot.com/2010/02/what-were-all-those-spiritual-books.html<br><br>I've been meaning to write to you for some time to thank you, you can't know how much.

That's ultimately the core problem with those belief systems that insist that someone or something else is going to plop you into paradise, whether that takes the form of the Rapture or "spiritual ascension" -- if you can't manage peace, joy, and love right here and now, you won't experience them in paradise, either, because they're the product of inner states, not outer conditions. <br><br>Karah, er, you need to get out more. There are a lot of single moms (and other people) these days whose 99 weeks of unemployment coverage have run out, and whose assistance checks from the government don't begin to cover the cost of food, rent, utilities, and other necessities. <br><br>Morrigan, excellent! By saying "I have enough, I don't want more," you're giving voice to what, for most Americans, is the ultimate heresy -- and you're also rubbing their noses in the fact that, in most cases, they're profoundly dissatisfied with their lives, and know perfectly well that another trip to the mall won't solve that. <br><br>Lewis, my guess it's the other way around; Fourier's first book was published in 1809, and his ideas were hugely popular in American radical circles in the 1820s and 1830s, giving them plenty of time to filter down into folk songs. <br><br>Richard, thank you. It's also worth remembering that Hesiod, who's the original source for the story of Pandora, was a cynical, misogynistic old git. <br><br>Dweller, the set of traditional virtues I have in mind are those that were canonical in the Middle Ages and Renaissance: the four civil or cardinal virtues of courage, justice, temperance, and prudence, and the three religious virtues (I always want to call them the ordinal virtues!) of faith, hope, and charity. It's the latter three that will occasion the spluttering, as none of 'em mean what most people nowadays seem to think they mean. <br><br>Cherokee, bingo. The labels "optimist" and "pessimist" are mostly rhetorical noise meant to distract attention from what's actually being discussed. As for the deadline, thank you; I'm on track to meet it. <br><br>Carp, exactly. I would encourage people who have things to teach to begin thinking about how they'll teach those things when the current education industry grinds to a halt -- an event a lot closer here in America then elsewhere, but on the horizon in a lot of places. <br><br>Leigh, a fascinating story! The realm of popular alternative spirituality from which the New Age emerged is a very mixed bag, as you noted, with some very good points mixed in with some complete toxic waste, and the bait of personal immortality (or at least extreme longevity) fed a lot of the latter in much the same way that the bait of apocalyptic transformation feeds equivalent pathologies today.

As if there were nothing that could be done besides regular patterns and habits employed for so many years. The main concern was how inconvenient life would become and the possibility or probability of diminished life spans (though not in all places equally inevitable; Okinawans and others have had tremendous life spans as far back as anyone has cared to record) and with the exasperated question I was a little fed up myself (it was a relative of mine) and said "We die, of course. All of us eventually and some sooner than others, but that will happen regardless. That doesn't mean we shouldn't take care for what we can see coming." but it took me until today to realize what I felt behind that statement: A quote I heard years ago "It's not the dying that hurts, it's all that trying to stay alive in the meantime." so the inner feeling was and is that of course life may be shortened on statistical averages but how we choose to try and live in the meantime is what makes the difference in the end.<br>I am sorry to flog a dead ungulate but gender equality is neither the creation nor sole property of any civilization industrial or otherwise. Perhaps it has made life convenient enough to make differences of treatment less visible and physical differences a non concern. As long as I am not asked to breast feed an infant I suppose my state of natural gender difference will not need to be easily observed. John, your <a href=../../2008/08/reviving-household-economy.html#c2182165329561256983 rel=nofollow>comment to Noah</a> just over 3 years ago sums up my feelings on it better than I am able and I hope I don't come across as offensive; I just get a little flustered inside when someone insists that the only reason we have A, B, or C is because 'it happens to be present in our lives and we happen to live in an industrial civilization so it must have been caused by this civilization'. It is absolutely not that I don't value equitable societal gender pressures, I certainly do, just I don't feel that saying the cause of our current state of gender relations is exclusively bound to industrial civilization is a useful or accurate thing.<br><br><a href=#c2707760417216280141 title="comment permalink">12/30/11, 6:24 AM</a><br><br>

An additional 536.6 tcf are classified as "probable" from existing fields, meaning that they have some expectation that the gas exists in known formations, but it has not been proven to exist and is not certain to be technically recoverable. An additional 687.7 tcf is "possible" from new fields, meaning that the gas might exist in new fields that have not yet been discovered. A further 518.3 tcf are "speculative," which means exactly that.

Of course I have a lengthy answer, but I'm sure you know how well it goes over! As for gender equality, though, that's a complex issue; still, industrial societies have had a much better track record with providing basic civil rights to women than most others in human history, and that's a legacy worth trying to preserve, I feel -- thus the discussion about causes and consequences is worth having. <br><br>Bobbi, thank you!

The notion of fleeing to the woods is a standard trope in contemporary American culture, but it's also one of the worst possible strategies right now -- and it wasn't a very good one back in the late 60s and early 70s, either. The problem is simply that living in isolation is brutally hard -- you have to provide <i>everything</i> you need by your own labor, and unless you're up for unremitting labor from can't see to can't see right around the year, your chances of producing enough to make a go of it are minimal. In time of social disintegration, there's also the issue of vulnerability -- if the Skeksis come looking for you, so to speak, you don't want to be in some isolated place far from help. <br><br>This is why the community, not the individual or the family, is the basic unit of human survival, and by "community" I don't mean a dozen unrelated people trying to live together -- I mean a village, a town or a small city. That's why I advise people to consider where they live right now; if it's anything from a small town to a small city, has a stable water supply, and is near plenty of agricultural land, the best thing to do is usually to stay put; if not, choose a town where the cost of living is low and where, if at all possible, you've got family or friends, and move there; work on getting the skills you'll need to produce goods and services people want or need, so you'll have something to exchange in a deindustrializing economy; and learn to live on a fraction of your current income, so you can look at getting a home with a backyard big enough to garden, a basement big enough for a root cellar and a workshop, and all the other things you'll want to make it comfortably in a contracting economy. That's my best suggestion -- and it's also the strategy I'm following, for whatever that's worth. <br><br>Zach, I hadn't heard of Vost's book! That's really good to hear -- the more people who learn how to use their heads as something other than a rack to hang earphones from, the better off we'll be. <br><br>Escape, good. This is right along the lines of the saner analyses I've been hearing.<br><br><a href=#c831159975090551821 title="comment permalink">12/30/11, 10:16 AM</a><br><br>

Either we have hope or we don't; it is a dimension of the soul, and it's not essentially dependent on some particular observation of the world or estimate of the situation. Hope is not prognostication. It is an orientation of the spirit, and orientation of the heart; it transcends the world that is immediately experienced, and is anchored somewhere beyond its horizons.... Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going well, or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed. The more propitious the situation in which we demonstrate hope, the deeper the hope is. Hope is definitely not the same thing as optimism. It is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out."<br>-Vaclav Havel<br><br><a href=#c5299385698556217863 title="comment permalink">12/30/11, 10:22 AM</a><br><br>

I do know people whose lifestyle drastically changed, people who lost millions of dollars, and they go on living one way or the other - it is not a tragedy. I suppose that our standards of living could decline quite far and people would still get by just fine - by fine I mean without a huge cataclysmic event that would wipe large percentage of the population out.

It is true that they are a diverse group, but the part that fascinated me, and is most appropriate to this posting, is that many if not most of them have changed their dire “predictions” about 2012 over the past few years! When I worked at a New Age zine back in ’05 (it was the only gig in town), there were many who were literally talking about the end of the world – with the “enlightened ones” raptured off (tho they didn’t call it that) by transforming to higher energy beings… and I have been fascinated (and a little appalled) that as The Date got closer and closer, those predictions morphed into an energetic transformation that still left their little bodies here on earth, and was safely invisible to the great unwashed. ie: you can’t prove nuthin’. ;-) To me, that says that even those who professed to be “sure” of energetic transformation truly couldn’t get close to the end of the world without cringing and shifting to denial of what they once believed (which, ironically shifts them closer to reality.) I probably could go back and find some of this in the old issues, but I’m not trying to prove it to anyone.

I think too, that most people simply don't have sufficient skills or organisational commitment to make these things work for the long term. I found John Peterson's story as told by himself in the documentary "The real dirt on Farmer John" insightful and inspiring. He really has been through a tough time, and made a success of organic farming - not just for himself but including many others as well. I've written a brief item about it which you can find on this link:<br>http://rushleigh-pursuit-of-wisdom-chronicle.blogspot.com/2010/09/real-dirt-on-farmer-john-documentary.html<br>You may also find the two companion articles useful, one on how Cuba has coped with its own peak oil crisis, and the other about renewable energy programmes in Germany.<br><br>A lot of my blogging hinges around sustainability issues, wholesome living, and about how to make do with *much* less.

This objective was in hindsight, probably not compatible with the goals of the big end of town though!<br><br>However, it was the declining quality of food that led me on a journey through organic food production, resource depletion and eventually to this blog and my current activities.

You can't grow vegetables in a forest environment unless you understand soil! Too many people think that dirt is just something that keeps plants upright. Read, read and when you are finished read some more. There is no substitute to this activity. People setting up communes probably had no idea about soil.<br><br>Passengers - I'm self-motivated and I see things through to completion. However, when I work in a group - any group - there are always a minority that want to passenger along. I'm cool with that. However, a small holding cannot afford to feed passengers. I think a lot of communes may have failed because they were big on talk and dreams and very small on activity.<br><br>Organisational structure - Think running the government is hard. Got complaints? You can't please everyone. Try doing all that when there are friends and family involved. Most successful village type structures involve clear lines of responsibility, plus everyone is accountable to each other. An intentional community can't achieve this, it must evolve at its own pace, time and relationships.<br><br>System shocks - As our host pointed out few people can live as individuals without the co-operation of others. I always relate this concept to stone fruit. Some years yellow peaches and nectarines do better than the white varieties. If you only had one variety then any system shock would mean that you didn't eat that year. Communes were vulnerable because they commenced all at the same time and any system shock they suffered knocked them out.<br><br>Our host says that a resilient system is not an efficient system and he is correct (I have 300 varieties of fruit trees here and the climate is about as variable as you'll get).<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c2155783051305675093 title="comment permalink">12/31/11, 2:29 AM</a><br><br>

If you grow up with prosperity and authority handed to you on a silver platter, with other (lesser) people assigned the responsibility of seeing the details through, then the scope and character of your Hope are going to be markedly different from those at the bottom of the pyramid. Meanwhile, in American culture we have spent a hundred years promoting, paying, and lionizing the "managers", the Ad-men, the "idea men", the politicians, planners and bureaucrats at the expense of the actual workers, the trench-diggers, the farmers and craftsmen. In a national sense, personal security, sustainability, and self-sufficiency are viewed as passe and boring, hence not an object of hope. The only hope our culture has promoted for a century is that of the tycoon, the "game-changer", the "high-roller", the gambler. This is the result of a culture of privilege which has started taking its own privilege for granted; affluence taken as a given instead of appreciated. Of course that's hard for most Americans to hear when they're struggling with overpriced mortgages and rapacious bills. But as you always point out, the first step in a realistic assessment of one's situation is to turn your eyes away from pop culture and its keep-up-with-the-mythical-Joneses values.<br><br><a href=#c1323368613645257954 title="comment permalink">12/31/11, 9:47 AM</a><br><br>

I look forward to many more Thursday morning peeks at the blog!<br><br>On the topic of hope, it’s interesting and a bit sad to see people shooting the messenger for mentioning the Emperor’s new clothes. For my part, hope is essentially a spiritual quality, and is inextricably intertwined with my relationships with other people and the greater forces in the universe. The material world is, of course, always with us, and the dangers of substituting material things for spirituality have been trumpeted down the ages. What little of history I have read suggests that hope may in fact may in fact be closely related to times of great turmoil and change, because those times require a pruning of one’s “tree of life” to preserve those things that are truly important.<br><br><a href=#c5713304740130419660 title="comment permalink">12/31/11, 10:39 AM</a><br><br>

Hope is linked less to happiness than to joy. <br><br><br>Joy, a leading art critic has recently said, is a sterner thing than happiness.<br><br><br>An appropriate musical accompaniment to Havel might be the Israeli anthem "Hatikva" (literally, "the hope").

I have now spent about four hours studying the device, and I think I understand all the scales on my duplex Faber-Castell 52/82. Further practice would now, admittedly, be desirable.<br><br>The arguably best of the approximately five slide rule books in open stacks at the Gerstein Science Centre at Univ of Toronto is J.N. Arnold, "The Complete Slide Rule Handbook" (Prentice-Hall Inc., 1954; originally published as "The Slide Rule, Principles and Applications"). When I visited the Gerstein stacks yesterday, I unfortunately did not find a book of high repute, Lee H. Johnson's "The Slide Rule" (Van Nostrand Company, 1949, with 1951, 1953, 1955, 1957 reprintings).<br><br>One of the benefits of the slide rule is that it rubs one's face in several practicalities of trig - that sin x changes very little over the range 80o-to-90o, that for angles more acute than 5.5o there is scant practical-engineering difference between sin and tan, and that for any angle theta (even negative, even obtuse, even reflex, even an angle turned through more than 360o by a rotating shaft) if eta + theta = one right angle then both cos eta = sin theta and (provided cot eta and tan theta exist) cotan eta = tan theta. (Hence, no doubt, the use of "co" in the trig-function names, since to say that eta + theta = one right angle is to say that eta and theta are "complementary angles". Schools seem not to stress the logic behind the "co" in the names for the trig functions.) The slide rule thus gets one closer to several mathematical realities than the pocket calculator does. <br><br>JMG again: You asked me a few weeks ago, on this blog, whether any monastic orders in the Catholic world are addressing the need for preservation-of-knowledge. I think the answer to this is "not really, not yet". A natural place to look for such an eventual movement in the Church would be the Jesuits - e.g., within the Jesuit-administered walls of the Vatican Observatory Research Group, at Castel Gandolfo and in Arizona. <br><br><br>Hastily,<br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br><a href=#c5180403263637836719 title="comment permalink">12/31/11, 8:55 PM</a><br><br>

Pandora then panicked and slammed the lid on hope. It was somebody's task--ours? hers? the gods--to open the box again and release hope.

It reminds me of the quote by Marx - <i>"history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce"</i>. <br><br>I wonder if some of the push-back you receive is from people feeling offended by having their "enlightened" prophecies compared to those of people predicting The Rapture, even though that's a very fair and almost literal comparison in this case. I wrote a short bit about this last summer and I'm sure your readers can relate.<br><br><a href=http://peakcomplexity.blogspot.com/2011/06/post-peak-rapture.html rel=nofollow>The Post-Peak Rapture</a><br><br><i>It deserves a brief mention that May 21, 2011 came as expected and went the same way, without any massive earthquakes rapidly spreading around regions of the world as the Sun cast its light on their shores. The reason it deserves a mention at all is because it highlights the difference between the true doomsayers and the realistically "pessimistic" among us. The two groups are frequently confused, especially by those casually belonging to the dedicated tribe of "hopefully apathetic consumers".<br><br>These people thrive on mindless entertainment, so it is no wonder that they make a sport out of ridiculing anyone who dares to utter the word "conspiracy" or "collapse". They have a slightly easier time suppressing their condescension when the topic of discussion is "peak this" or "peak that", but still lose interest in such topics very quickly; in fact, almost immediately. Many of them, however, are not ashamed of conversing with their family and friends about the banality of "debt". While debt is obviously a very important issue in today's world, it is chronically misunderstood by mainstream society.<br><br>...<br><br>If you are brazen enough to throw the imminent issues of peak oil and climate change into the discussion , then you may as well go ahead and pencil in a date on your calendar for the Rapture to begin, so that the whole world can look and laugh. Immediately, people will begin conjuring up Hollywood images of fire and brimstone; death and destruction; utter confusion and chaos; digitally grafting those simple crowd-pleasers onto the remnants of your once complex and rational argument.<br><br>Welcome to our global society of "all or nothing", where either the world burns to the ground in a few weeks, at most, or things just muddle along in an entirely plain and mundane fashion for at least a few decades. What this binary logic fails to understand is that financial, industrial and environmental collapse will be a combined process of gradual deterioration, stabilization, slight "improvement" and rapid disintegration, coming to the surface of our consciousness in fits and starts. It will not necessarily follow that order, and will be extremely non-linear and short-term unpredictable.</i><br><br>Again, this is not to say you are confusing the two groups, because you aren't, but only that some people might erroneously feel that way.<br><br>Regarding TAE and I&amp;S, I have come to understand that they do regret making relatively specific predictions about the timing of market events early on, which are actually very few and far between for them, and non-existent as of late. Such predictions are irrelevant to their general financial message, which is perhaps best summed up as - "much better safe than sorry". <br><br>However, in the terms of your last post, a relatively rapid market crash event is certainly not outside the possibilities of nature, and is indeed very much within them. It's not that the entire global financial system will disappear overnight, but that a lot of imaginary paper wealth can disappear over the course of only hours/days/weeks, and that can feed into the loss of productive wealth as well. <br><br>Thank you for the great posts as usual!<br><br><a href=#c5594441867861114751 title="comment permalink">1/1/12, 3:24 PM</a><br><br>

But there is at least one myth worth salvaging from the dross.<br><br>While tending the garden in front of the local New Age bookstore, I became enchanted with the Findhorn story. Here was a family who had collapsed from the height of luxury running a four-star hotel, to the depths of poverty in a trailer by a dump. Following spiritual guidance, they got off their channeling bums and built an extraordinary garden.<br><br>Compared to what was on the rest of the bookshelves, Findhorn appeared quite instructive and practical - it was the only story featuring real men and women doing real work in a real garden, striving to live in harmony with their place.<br><br>Then along came Machaelle Small Wright with her research using applied kinesiology and a "hands-on" approach to building Findhorn-style gardens everywhere. I was baffled why everyone wasn't rolling up their sleeves. Forget the silly ascension, what about the spirit in matter everywhere?<br><br>By the time I made my pilgimmage to Scotland's Mecca in the early 90's, none of the gardeners there practiced the nature attunement that put them on the map. So I taught them muscle testing and they let me play foreman with the visitors work crew for a week.<br><br>For over a decade after that, I used these same skills in my landscape practice to foodify local backyards (never the front; must maintain resale value, ha!, lotta good that did). Most clients had no idea I "talked to the plants" but the results certainly spoke for themselves. But it was still a struggle to earn a living without the mow, blow and go, despite all the cosmic greenie foodies who all loved the IDEA of transitioning from ornamentals to edibles.<br><br>But the garden in front of the bookstore was fun while it lasted.

Maybe there is, and we owe it to Fintan O’Toole. That trenchant Irish commentator is a biographer and theater critic, and a critic also of his country’s crimes and follies, as in his gripping if horrifying book, “Ship of Fools: How Stupidity and Corruption Sank the Celtic Tiger.”<br><br>He reminds us of the famous if gnomic saying by Donald H. Rumsfeld, then the United States secretary of defense, that “There are known knowns... there are known unknowns ... there are also unknown unknowns.” But the Irish problem, says Mr. O’Toole, was none of the above. It was “unknown knowns.”<br><br>What he means is something different from denial, or evasion, irrational exuberance or excess optimism. Unknown knowns were things that were not at all inevitable, and were easily knowable, or indeed known, but which people chose to “unknow.”<br><br>Unknown knowns were everywhere, from Wall Street to Brussels, from the Pentagon to Penn State. Ireland merely happened to offer an extreme case, where “everyone knew.” They just chose to forget that they knew — about the way that Irish banks ran wild, how easy credit fueled a monstrous explosion of property prices and speculative house-building. Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister at the time of the rapid economic growth, merely boasted, “The boom is getting boomier,” preferring to unknow the truth that booms always go bust.<br><br>Beginning in 2008, the skies were lighted up by financial conflagrations, from Lehman Brothers to the Royal Bank of Scotland. These were dramatic enough — but were they unforeseeable or unknowable? What kind of willful obtusity ever suggested that subprime mortgages were a good idea? An intelligent child would have known that there is no good time to lend money to people who obviously can never repay it."</i><br><br><a href=#c3877914784576894945 title="comment permalink">1/2/12, 10:52 AM</a><br><br>

You have maybe 1 second before it disappears from view again.<br><br>For your wish to come true you have to make it before the shooting star disappears.<br><br>Now i know that that will come as a surprise to most readers - that your wish only comes true if you make it before the star disappears - but if you think about it it makes a lot of sense.<br><br>Let's say that you are very focused on something you want to achieve - and that it fills much of your daily thoughts. You want to become a doctor say. You really want it. You do everything that you can to progress towards that goal. Reading medical material. Studying hard. Learning all you can that takes you where you want to go. You live and breath it.<br><br>Now, staring at the sky you see a shooting star - and instantly on your lips is the wish to become a doctor. It's totally automatic - there's no thinking about it or weighing this desire against that one. It's a crystalisation of all you are - a doctor.<br><br>How likely is it that your wish will come true?<br><br>Counter that with the WISHY-washy wish you might make if you can take as much time as you like to make the wish. Unless you have something that really drives you, defines you, you're likely to make any old sort of wish - like a new bicycle or to win the favour of someone or other. The wish will have no meaning and is likely to be forgotten soon after you made it - your mind wondering off on some tangent triggered by any arbitrary stimulus.<br><br>Wishing on a star works - if you are worthy of the wish.<br><br>pop<br><br><a href=#c1346016605258182618 title="comment permalink">1/2/12, 4:45 PM</a><br><br>

Too little hope makes for a dismal existence. Too much hope brings on delusional thinking. No hope -- well that's probably the most frightening and dangerous of all human conditions.<br><br>As an exchange from one person to another, hope can have extraordinary and transformative powers. If you've ever been able to offer someone genuine hope, you'll know what I mean. And who hasn't been on the grateful receiving end of a gift of hope? <br><br>But when offered by politicians hope becomes rather tinny doesn't it? I personally tossed a good chunk of it into my junk drawer before Obama even completed his first year in office. :-) <br><br>Hope is the essence of human optimism, and, for everything it represents-- from the crossing of ones fingers to the lighting of a votive candle, this little four-letter word might very well be the "god-particle" of all words. <br><br>Hope might be considered an equal opportunity bonding agent that holds together all human transactions and aspirations. It's the spackle that fills the gaps in faith. I may be wrong, but maybe In the face of absolute truth, hope isn't necessary. Maybe in the face of absolute truth, hope transitions into reverence and gratitude-- and isn't gratefulness a sublime state of mind!?!<br><br>As for the doomsday scenarios and apocalyptic fantasies so many people are obsessed with, I have a theory that this is all really a collective form of sublimated suicide by a species that has painted itself into a corner; domesticated itself to the point that it can't feel or recognize authentic human experience. <br><br>Technology has succeeded in creating a totally prophylactic relationship with life and, at some deep level of consciousness, people with any spark left in them, desperately yearn for authentic human experience.

Restoration not a bad thing to do as the means were still available (including current fossil fuel economy). The linked restored forests could probably do it on their own by now. A great company of people volunteered over the years and there was significant 'consciousness change' in some surrounding forestry management, in both private and official forestry. Upland Scotland is still largely managed on behalf of international rich with status ambition, it seems, but probably sufficient seeds are sown and in place for the longer term.

I think the title is Nickeled and Dimed. <br><br>My two cents on homelessness and hunger in America, based on reading and some observation. All cities and many towns have some adults and youth regularly sleeping outdoors under doorways or under bridges or illicitly in city parks. Statistics on the homeless often include a much greater number of people who can often sleep under some sort of roof but have to keep moving, such as people living in their cars, people couch surfing, and people spending the night in a seasonal or temporary homeless shelter. Forms of low cost housing that used to be available to single adults, such as boarding houses and single room occupancy hotels, barely exist.<br><br>There is a great deal of hunger in America but not much outright starvation. The incidence of nutritional diseases of the rural poor such as pellagra is lower than it was during the Great Depression. <br><br>High calorie, low nutrient foods are widely available and relatively cheap. Adults and children suffer from food insecurity, meaning that they have to skip meals because the money is needed for shelter, transportation or other necessities. Some are malnourished, meaning that they aren't getting enough fruits, vegetables and protein, because they can't afford the foods they need, have no place to prepare them, or have to travel long distances to purchase them.<br><br>I suspect that because home economics is no longer taught in public schools, many of both the chronic and the newly poor do not know how to spend their food budget to the best result because they haven't been taught nutrition and don't know how to cook from scratch.<br><br><a href=#c3006884509123506123 title="comment permalink">1/4/12, 1:00 PM</a><br><br>

Minimum wage does not cover even minimal housing in these cities and here in Chicago, the CTA engages social workers to deal with families spotted literally living on the trains, hopping from train to train at the end of the line to get out of the cold. They often have three or four kids in tow. <br><br>When a family falls through the floor, it has to go through a lot of bureaucracy to line up any benefits. There's plenty of time to be evicted from your apartment and end up in the lines at food banks. Especially vulnerable are people who do not qualify for unemployment benefits, such as anyone working as an "independent contractor" or who owns a business that has failed. <br><br>I have a number of friends and acquaintances who have dropped from middle incomes, to lower incomes, to total poverty, mostly those over age 40 and 50 who have no parents and often no siblings they can turn to. It could easily happen to you or me. It could happen to anyone who isn't wealthy, especially if they have no savings. Most people in this country have no savings but do have massive stacks of debt, which goes into default when they lose jobs or businesses.<br><br><a href=#c3081282677431900745 title="comment permalink">1/4/12, 7:33 PM</a><br><br>

We now have a solar water heater and 4.5Kw PV system that we didn't have 6 months ago, and this year the plan is for a rain harvesting system to go with the new metal roof.

We're also living on my income so that we can throw his income at the mortgage principal and get the house paid off, so this is requiring us to live leanly, which I figure is a good thing to get used to before we actually have too.
