I want to expand here on some of the points raised in last week’s post, because they deal with factors in our situation that operate well below the surface. One of the things that makes the predicament of industrial society so difficult for most people to notice, in fact, is that its effects are woven so deeply into the patterns of everyday life. Over the last decade, for example, crude oil prices have more than tripled; over the last decade, behind a froth of speculative booms and busts, the world’s industrial economies have lurched deeper into depression. Peak oil researchers have pointed out for years that the former trend would bring about the latter, but long after events proved them right, the connection still remains unnoticed by most people.<br><br>To be fair, the way most people and nearly all economists think about economics makes this sort of blindness to the obvious hard to avoid. It’s standard these days to treat the circulation of money—the tertiary economy, to use a term from my book <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/W/The-Wealth-of-Nature>The Wealth of Nature</a>—as though it’s all that matters, and to insist that the cycles of nature and the production of goods and services (the primary and secondary economies) will inevitably do whatever we want them to do, so long as there’s enough money. This is why, for instance, you’ll hear economists insisting that the soaring price of oil is good for the economy; after all, all the money being spent to buy oil is getting spent in turn on other things, right?<br><br>What this ignores, of course, is the fact that the price of oil is going up, in large part, because petroleum is getting steadily more difficult to extract as we exhaust the easily accessible sources, and so the cost of oil production is going up while the amount of oil being produced is not. As a growing fraction of industrial civilization’s capacity to produce goods and services has to be diverted into oil extraction in order to keep the oil flowing, the amount of that capacity that can be used for anything else decreases accordingly. Notice, though, that this diversion isn’t an obvious thing; it happens one transaction at a time, throughout the economy, as laborers, raw materials, capital, and a thousand other things go into oil production instead of some other economic sector.<br><br>The place to begin making sense of the shape of the process under way, it seems to me, is <a href=http://www.energybulletin.net/stories/2011-08-15/growth-debt-and-world-bank>the intriguing article</a> by green economist Herman Daly, cited in last week’s post, about the way that the World Bank’s pursuit of global growth via the worship of economic orthodoxies ran headfirst into a shortage of "bankable projects"—in plain English, economic projects that would yield the ten per cent or so per year necessary to pay off the loan and also make a profit. The World Bank, as Daly recounts, tried to make up for the shortage by lowering its standards, and pouring money into projects that counted as bankable only in the same imaginary world where Pets.com stock and subprime mortgage-backed securities count as good investments.<br><br>The point I’d like to make here, though, is that a shortage of bankable projects has been a problem for some time now in regions not normally consigned to the Third World. The Rust Belt town where I live, Cumberland, Maryland, is one example. Until 1974 it was a significant industrial center, with two large breweries, a tire factory, a fabric mill, and several smaller concerns. 1974, though, was the year that the consequences of America’s first brush with peak oil hit home, and Cumberland was one of the targets. A combination of soaring raw material costs, slumping sales, and competition from overseas shuttered every factory in town, and none ever reopened. Cumberland, like the rest of the Rust Belt, suddenly had a shortage of bankable projects. The shortage wasn’t total—a handful of "big box" stores found construction loans during the retail-empire boom of the 1990s, for example—but rock-bottom real estate prices, favorable tax policies, low labor costs, and two colleges nearby to provide workforce training at state expense couldn’t lure factory jobs back into the region.<br><br>That same experience is being repeated now all over America, and for that matter across much of the industrial world. Capital shortage isn’t an issue—with two rounds of quantitative easing and a tacit agreement on the part of bank regulators not to raise awkward questions about the actual value of the paper assets owned by banks, there’s plenty of money available to lend—but loans aren’t being made, and the reason given by bank after bank is that next to nobody who wants to borrow money has a credible plan that will allow them to pay it back. That claim has been rejected with some heat by commentators, but I’ve come to suspect that it may be more accurate than not. That was exactly what happened to Cumberland, after all; in the changed economic environment after 1974, a factory built here wouldn’t have made enough money to pay back the loans that would have been needed to build it, and so the loans weren’t made. Increasingly, that seems to be true of the industrial world as a whole.<br><br>All this can be described, in the terms I used in <i>The Wealth of Nature</i>, as a widening mismatch between the tertiary economy of money and the secondary economy of goods and services—or, to put the matter even more simply, a rising tide of paper wealth chasing a falling tide of actual value. Still, I’ve come to think that there’s another way of looking at it—one that unfolds from the perspectives I’ve been discussing here over the last few weeks.<br><br>Let’s step away for a moment from the game of arbitrary tokens we call "money," and look at the economy from a thermodynamic perspective, as a system for producing goods and services by applying energy to an assortment of raw materials. Until the coming of the industrial revolution, the vast majority of the energy that went into human economic systems went from sunlight to crops to human and animal muscle, which produced and distributed goods and services. The industrial revolution transformed that equation adding torrents of cheap abundant fossil fuel energy to the annual income from photosynthesis. Only a small fraction of the labor force and other resources had to be diverted from food production to bring this flood of energy into the economic equation, and only a small fraction of fossil fuels had to be cycled back into the fossil fuel extraction process; the rest of the labor force, other resources, and all that additional energy from fossil fuels could be poured into the rest of the economy, producing goods and services in unparalleled amounts.<br><br>Physicist Ilya Prigogine has shown by way of intricate equations that the flow of energy through a system increases the complexity of the system. If any further evidence was needed to back up his claims, the history of the world’s industrial economies provides it. The three centuries that followed the development of the first functional steam engines saw economic complexity, measured by the creation of new job categories, soar to a level almost unimaginably greater than any previous civilization had achieved. The bonanza of wealth produced by adding fossil fuel energy to the sun’s annual contribution spread throughout the industrial economies, and the ways and means by which money sprayed outwards from the pockets of coal magnates and oil barons quickly became institutionalized. <br><br>Governments, businesses, and societies ballooned in complexity, creating niches for entire ecosystems of office fauna to do tasks the presidents and tycoons of the nineteenth century had accomplished with a tiny fraction of the personnel; workloads obeyed Parkinson’s Law—"work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion"—and everyone found that it was easier to add more staff to get a job done than to get the existing staff to do it themselves. The result, in most industrial societies, is an economy in which only a small fraction of the labor force actually has anything directly to do with the production of goods and services, while the rest are kept busy managing the sprawling social and economic machinery that has come into being to organize, finance, manage, staff, market, advertise, sell, analyze, tax, regulate, review, praise, and denounce the production of goods and services.<br><br>What seems to have been lost sight of, though, is that this immense superstructure all rests on the same foundation as any other economy, the use of energy to convert raw materials into goods and services. More to the point, it depends on a certain level of surplus that can be produced in this way, and that depends in turn on being able to add plenty of fossil fuel energy to the economic system without having to divert too large a fraction of the labor force, resource base, and energy supply into the extraction of fossil fuels. Some sense of the difference made by fossil fuels can be measured by comparing the economies of the industrial age to those of societies that, by any other standard, were near the upper end of human social complexity—Tokugawa Japan and Renaissance Italy are the ones that come to mind. Urban, literate, and highly cultured, each of these societies had the resources to support extraordinary artistic, literary, and intellectual creativity. Still, they did this with economies vastly simpler than anything you’ll find in a modern industrial society.<br><br>The division of the labor force among economic roles makes a good measure of the difference. In both societies, the largest economic sector, employing around fifty per cent of the adult population (nearly all adult women and most elderly people of both sexes), was the household economy; a good half of the total economic value produced in each society came out of the kitchen gardens, spindles, looms, and other economic facilities associated with households. Another thirty per cent or so of the population in each society, including most of the adult men, was engaged full time in farming and other forms of direct food production; maybe ten per cent of the adult population worked in the skilled trades; and the remaining ten per cent or so was divided between religious professionals, military professionals, artists and performers, aristocrats, and merchants who lived by buying and selling goods produced by others.<br><br>The limited range of categories available in those societies was not the result of inadequate cleverness. If some Italian despot or Tokugawa shogun had decided he needed a staff of human resource managers, corporate image consultants, strategic marketing specialists, and the rest of the occupational apparatus of modern business life, say, he would have been out of luck, and if he tried anyway, he would have been out of a job—the resources needed to train and employ some equivalent of modern office fauna would have had to be diverted from more immediate necessities such as training and employing an adequate force of condottieri or samurai, which was not exactly a viable strategy in those times. This is why Italian despots and Tokugawa shoguns got by with relatively small staffs of clerks, scribes, feudal subordinates, and maybe an astrologer; that’s what their economic systems could afford.<br><br>Equally, an aspiring craftsman or merchant faced real challenges in expanding his business beyond fairly sharp limits. In a few cases, a combination of luck, technical skill, and adequate transport allowed one region to take on a commanding role in some specific export market, profit considerably from that, and build up an impressive degree of infrastructure; the golden age of Greece was paid for by the profits from Greek wine and olive oil exports, for example, and the woolen trade brought similar benefits to late medieval Flanders. Far more often, though, local needs had to be supplied by local production, because the surplus energy that would have been needed to power long distance trade on a large scale simply didn’t exist, or couldn’t be spared from more pressing needs. Thus the institutional arrangements that governed economic life before the industrial age were as closely tailored to a world of relatively scarce energy, in which most people worked in the household or farming sectors of the economy, as today’s institutional arrangements are tailored to a world awash in cheap abundant energy.<br><br>That last point defines the crisis of our times, however, because we no longer live in a world awash in cheap abundant energy. We’ve still got a lot more energy than Renaissance Italy or Tokugawa Japan had, to be sure, but the per capita surplus is not what it once was, and a growing fraction of what we’ve got has had to be diverted to cover increases in direct and indirect energy costs of energy production. Meanwhile, the institutional arrangements are still firmly fixed in place, and they aren’t optional; try starting a business sometime without dealing with banks, real estate companies, licensing boards, tax authorities, et al., and you’ll quickly discover how non-optional these arrangements are.<br><br>The mismatch between the economy we’ve got and the economy we can afford has many implications, but one of the largest is precisely the issue I raised earlier in this post: across the industrial world, there are very few bankable projects to be found, even at a time when there are millions of people who need work, and who would happily buy products if they had the chance to earn the money to do so. Our economy is burdened with an unproductive superstructure it can no longer support. The globalization fad of the 1990s, which arbitraged the difference in wage costs between Third World sweatshops and industrial-world factories, was in effect an attempt to evade the resulting difficulties by throwing the industrial nations’ working classes under the bus, and it only worked for a decade or so; as so often happens in the declining years of a civilization, a short term fix was treated as a long term solution, and a brief remission of symptoms allowed the underlying crisis to worsen steadily.<br><br>Over the long run, the mismatch is a problem that will solve itself; once the unraveling of the industrial economy goes far enough, the superstructure will come apart, leaving a great many human resource managers, corporate image consultants, strategic marketing specialists, and the like with about as much chance of finding jobs in their fields as they would have had 17th-century Osaka or 14th-century Milan. In the short and middle term, though, the mismatch will almost certainly continue to show itself in exactly the same way that it’s been visible over the last few decades: more and more often, business ventures simply won’t be able to make enough money to cover startup costs or to stay in business.<br><br>Of course there will be exceptions. We are talking about a shift that will appear, as it has appeared so far, as a shifting of statistical averages, and the background of ordinary economic fluctuations will make it more than usually difficult to tease out the signal from the noise. Even in hard times, some ventures make fortunes; what makes hard times differ from boomtimes is that the fortunes are fewer, and the odds of making one of them come more and more to resemble the odds of walking away from a Vegas casino with a six-figure jackpot.<br><br>All this has two implications, it seems to me, that are of core importance for the shape of our future. The first is simply that those of my readers whose plans for the future depend on holding down a job may have a very hard row to hoe. The shift under way in the economy will more than likely squeeze the current model of economic life from both ends—as it becomes harder to find, keep, and earn a decent living at an ordinary job, businesses will continue to fold, debase their products, or both, and so it will also become harder to convert the income from an ordinary job back into goods and services worth having. One of the core themes I’ve been discussing here for some time now, the need to move at least one family member out of employment into the household economy, is in part a response to that situation; what you produce yourself for your own consumption doesn’t pay a share of the costs of the economic superstructure. Beyond that, the deterioration of the official economy is accompanied, as pretty much always happens, by the growth of alternative economic networks that allow goods and services to be exchanged outside normal channels; it may be a while before those networks become solid enough to support more than a few people, but taking part in exchanges through these networks even in their early stages may be worthwhile.<br><br>The second implication also relates to a core theme of this blog, though it’s on a larger scale. While other economic arrangements are certainly imaginable, the one we have right now is strictly limited in what it can accomplish by what can make a profit: to repeat Daly’s term, it has to be a bankable project, or by and large, it won’t get done. This may just turn out to be a far more dangerous limitation than anybody has yet realized. There are, after all, any number of plans for grand projects in response to the end of the age of cheap abundant energy; each of them would require the investment of a great deal of capital, labor, raw materials, and other resources; and under present arrangements, none of them can go forward unless someone can count on making a profit from making them happen. Under present arrangements, in turn, it’s likely that none of them will be profitable enough to get a construction loan or to cover their operating costs once they get built.<br><br>We’ve already seen a solid prefigure of this in the ethanol bubble of a few years ago, in which firms in corn states rushed to build ethanol plants. Even with government subsidies and a guaranteed market, a great many of those plants are now bankrupt and shuttered. It’s an open secret that many recent solar and wind energy projects make money only because of government subsidies. Grandiose plans to turn large swathes of Nevada into algal biodiesel farms or vast solar arrays are arguably even more likely to be subject to the same rule—and the subsidies in these latter cases would be ruinously expensive. Earlier posts here have discussed some of the other reasons why such projects will not be built; if the pattern I’ve sketched here is anything to go by, though, the future these projects imagine won’t arrive, because it won’t be able to pay its bills.

Suppose there is a husband making $20/hour at a factory and wife making $10/hour as a sales clerk. Overwhelmingly couples would choose the wife as the one who should switch to household work.

If the bankable projects aren't currently here, it doesn't seem like they're going to show up in the next year or two. How long, then, can we stumble forward without new investment and growth? At what point does it manifest in another shock to the system, and what will that shock be?<br><br>I wonder, too, if we might see a collapse of much of the renewable energy industry in the near future. As government budgets get tighter, there's going to be greater pressure to cut a wide variety of subsidies. I know here in Oregon, we have some of the most generous state subsidies for renewable energy but there's been rising political pressure to cut back on these, with the argument that they're not really bringing in a good enough return. If the pressure grows too large and those subsidies do start to get cut in various states as well as at the federal level, it seems like that could sink a hefty portion of the industry. Which might just leave some people frustrated and bewildered.<br><br>I wish we had some kind of index to measure household economic activity. I would have to think it's rising sharply at the moment. Even if a small minority of the population gets that the household economy is going to come roaring back soon as a major feature of the times, surely a decent chunk of the millions of unemployed people out there have started to do work within the household, just as a byproduct of their circumstances. I realize many of those skills have been lost, but there's been a certain small trend in recent years to rediscovering them and there are still a number of people out there who have at least some related skills but whom didn't utilize them when they had a job. Now's their chance, and with little money, it makes significant sense for them to get on it.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c8377849607194659995 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 12:48 AM</a><br><br>

In particular, I've been attempting to evaluate my support of and participation in the Occupy movement with some of those concepts.

Thanks for another fine post.<br><br>A few years ago, I dropped out from a regular job and went into contract project management and consulting (I do IT work mainly). This has allowed me to adjust my hours down gradually, to the extent that I am now doing about 50% earning income, and 50% doing household economy stuff. This summer I only “worked” 25% in the business world, and spent most of my time doing serious gardening. We’ve dropped our expenses substantially, and will keep adjusting this balance over the next few years. So I recommend this contracting/part-time approach to people who want to put more time into their homesteads. Many corporations seem to be open to this approach, too.<br><br>One challenge is trying to help my teenage kids with what to do next. I’m encouraging them to learn practical skills, be able to use those skills on a piece-rate basis with a flexible schedule, and try to find happiness in things other than making tons of money. It’s easy in principle, but will be trickier in practice, at least for a while until this becomes mainstream. But this approach is being perceived by their peers as a sensible strategy - betting one’s future on a stable “job” is starting to be seen as unrealistic. <br><br>This is just a transitional approach, though. It still assumes that the regular money economy will be there to pay the bills - we are just changing the way that we interact with the money flows. It will get a lot more interesting as those money flows dry up. I have this hope that as the economy continues to contract, many smaller local businesses that seem hopelessly unrealistic now (butcher, baker or candlestick maker type of things), may become "bankable" again on a smaller scale, where "bankable" means they could support a low-cost lifestyle with barter as a significant part of the payment plan. We'll see. What exciting times we live in!<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c3762222848514282451 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 2:49 AM</a><br><br>

It's hard for a parent to throw cold water on your kids' ambitions, but I am trying to persuade them to have a back up plan, maybe take some profit from your 'flip' and buy and hold a nice little piece of farm land. <br><br>In the meantime, on my farm I'm planning to have to house and feed them and their 'significant others'. They understand what I'm doing and don't denigrate it, but they don't really believe it will come to that. <br><br>Boundless optimism of youth, I guess, 'something will come along to fix things'. They have both agreed the homestead is the fallback point though.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c9127320334374344453 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 3:04 AM</a><br><br>

As you say, the unraveling of the industrial economy is afoot and as alternative economic structures become more satiable--such that the "value" of a basic human need (clean water, food, shelter, energy, clothing, etc.) is determined not by the "price" in money someone is willing to pay, but by association and necessity of mutual needs. Of course, this requires an entirely new mode of production that reshapes our understanding of value and the production and distribution of "valuable" and more scarce resources.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c6323489775365775211 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 6:10 AM</a><br><br>

I would like to add the name Rod Swenson to the discussion. He has a number of papers on the topics of order, complexity and entropy at his website, http://rodswenson.com/<br>I think that there are two points worth noting in the connection between energy and social complexity. One is that it is not the absolute amount of usable energy that creates complexity but the rate at which that energy is burned to create useful work. <br>The second point is that the creation of complexity or order that spontaneously arises with the burning of energy is not a continuous phenomenon, i.e. more energy burned does not automatically create more complexity. At each level and for each instance where complexity arises out of the burning of energy there is a minimum threshold below which the burning of energy does not produce more complexity. Stable complex structures are maintained only as long as the rate of burn remains above the minimal threshold. <br>What I think this means for complex societies is that it is not enough to have some amount of energy to maintain some arbitrarily complex phenomenon such as the internet. Once burn rates drop below the threshold for the given phenomenon, order simply collapses and energy dissipates randomly without any creation of complexity. I suspect that this is what we may find out is wrong with wind, solar, ethanol and other alternative energy schemes. Not that they can't produce renewable energy, but that the rate at which they do this is simply not enough to maintain the level of social complexity that oil and coal could in the past. Jobs may be one of the first social phenomena to disappear as a result of reduced energy fluxes. <br>A third point worth mentioning is that complex structures tend to be hierarchical. Higher level phenomenal rely on lower level phenomena. For instance, the internet relies on network technology which in turn relies on lower level hardware which in turn relies on manufacturing processes which in turn rely on manufacturing technology mining and energy production. Lowering the burn rate at any level of this hierarchy to where the necessary complexity can no longer be maintained will make the entire scheme collapse and it will do so all of a sudden.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c9175916895635927160 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 6:36 AM</a><br><br>

I can't imagine going into the future without a kitchen garden or a neighborhood garden. I have a couple of observations I will add.<br><br>First, I suggest you spend some time on a small, organic farm which is actually making some money. I work on one half a day a week. Many farms will let you work for a week in the summer. What you will discover is that it requires a tremendous amount of knowledge and work with your muscles to live on a solar budget through the courtesy of plants and animals. Nothing must be wasted, and everything must be recycled. One person's urine can fertilize one acre.<br><br>Second, you have to deal with your location. Most local governments will make life as difficult for you as possible. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that local governments are among the criminal element. Anybody who gets serious about living on a solar budget will lead a less than antiseptic existence. A good one, but not anything a TV commercial would be happy about showing. Local governments will make your life miserable.<br><br>Third, timing is everything. The current issue of Permaculture Activist talks about relocalizing staple crops. The tricky part is this. Most staple crops contain very little water (think of a grain of wheat). Water, and particularly the refrigerated water required for fresh produce, is way more expensive to ship than dried grain and dried beans. Therefore, it may well be decades before it becomes economically attractive to grow wheat again in the Champlain valley, rather than ship it in from Montana. So localize smartly--or you will lose all your money.<br><br>Fourth. The mental adjustments that JMG has talked about are crucial. If you cannot enjoy preparing and eating fresh greens from your kitchen garden, then you are still in thrall to a culture that is dying. But it is going to gasp for air as long as possible.<br><br>Don Stewart<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c3941329329524172239 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 7:47 AM</a><br><br>

Convincing one's family members of the real value of household economy production is harder than showing the results of your labor quantified in a regular paycheck, and our culture still stigmatizes those who "don't have a <i>real</i> job". <br><br>I mentioned in a late comment to last week's post that, so far this week, my efforts on the home front have resulted in: 30 raspberry plants transplanted; one deer shot, processed, and in the freezer; another cord of firewood in the shed; solar systems maintained (@50KwH in the batteries); helped two friends insulate (labor trade in the bank); about 6 hours in the garden, preping for spring; all of the cooking; etc. <br><br>While it's hard to put a monetary value on these things, I'll take a few and try: <br><br>@ 60 lbs. deer meat at $3.00/lb. = $180<br><br>@ one cord firewood = $180<br><br>10 hours labor banked at $10/hr = $100<br><br>about $5 worth of electricity.<br><br>The value of a generation's worth of raspberry production is hard to figure, as are other things, and the solar systems' costs were paid forward, their production ongoing. The costs of purchasing equipment (chainsaw/fuel/oil, etc) also needs to be factored in, but, taking what I know equals $465. I always multiply by about 1.5 due to no taxes being assessed, no money changing hands, none of the costs associated with formal employment applying, I calculate the real dollar value of my efforts over the last four days to be around $700. This arrangement also reduces the tax rate on my wife's income somewhat, as she can claim me as a dependent. 'Real' income from my part time business is low enough to be added to her income.<br><br>Of course, as the Archdruid suggests, the greater value of such an arrangement may be more intangible. Helping friends insulate further cemented our cooperative relationship, and we had fun doing it = social capital. While my wife gets stressed by not being fully/formally employed, my stress level goes up, spinning my wheels, obtaining that almighty pay check. I have trouble divorcing a mainstream job from providing support to a system which is corrupt, destructive, and self-destructing.<br><br>Having said all of this, I plan to get back into the job market soon, hoping for part time, fully knowing that whatever job I find likely won't exist for long. Pay a few things off, stockpile a bit of fiat cash (as Stoneleigh suggests); one last stand for America ;-)<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c7043160500293332903 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 8:03 AM</a><br><br>

I continue to go through the five stages of Kubler Ross grief and for the most part, I’m past the anger stage, and into accepting that the destruction of jobs (and the monetization of “non-profits” into hideous monstrosities that pay their workers $9/hr and their CEOs six figures) is part of this attempt to maximize rapidly disappearing profits. Like sand creatures scrambling as the tide ebbs… So I’m finding it easier to focus on how I am going to adapt, and paying more attention to how successful (or not) my attempts are. And when I feel I am getting the hang of these processes, I hope to be able to share with others – who might soon be looking around for hints!<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c3295176993806513092 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 8:16 AM</a><br><br>

In Canada the police wouldn't allow it as it would be considered unhygienic to sell produce in the open air on the roadside. <br><br>You can also open an eatery here with minimal government paperwork. There is a trade-off because food handling in often unhygienic (by western standards), but the costs are kept low and I reckon it is actually fairly easy to make a living with just your family while buying local produce strait from the farmers conveniently on the roadside. A wok, boiling water pot, some tables and chairs is almost all you need really to open up an eatery in India.<br><br> In contrast to that back home you have heaps of overhead costs and required restaurant equipment which make a little family-run eatery infeasible with intolerable start-up costs.

So what you're saying is that the structure we have today was built to support a cheap energy flow and that as the economy isn't changing its rules the transition will happen when people start operating outside of the formal economy. So what do you think about American manufacturing? Is there a way to rebuild our infrastructure (to whatever limited extent)--or will that never happen? I thought that was one of the reasons you moved to the rust belt actually; the factories are there waiting to be reopened?

It's the only one that works...<br><br>Forget abourt Donald Trump or the reporters on Fox or CNN; we need someone like you, Mr. Greer, to moderate the next debate between the people running for President. So far, at least, it doesn't appear that any of the current crop of candidates (or the people asking them questions) has a clue...<br><br>My own analysis looks something like this: a successful household in the future might have to have a few acres of arable land to grow enough food to support an extended family. Some chickens, goats, etc, would provide eggs, meat, milk and cheese for family consumption or sale or trade, but most of the land would be required to grow fruits and vegetables, or grass for the cows and horses. <br><br>Families that specialize in a particularly lucrative trade (skilled artisans, craftsmen, etc.) might need less land if they are successful enough to buy most of their food from others, but most households will have to be larger, with more generalists than specialists, in order to be more self-sufficient. Right now our relatives are scattered all across the country, but in the future, most of the kids and their partners will be staying closer to home.<br><br>People are still going to need bread, but the acreage required for growing adequate amounts of wheat, corn, rice, or other staple row crops would be more than most households could afford to own, so those crops would still have to be mostly grown on large farms that specialize in those commodities. <br><br>Transport costs would limit such farms to areas relatively close to the towns that they feed, and the towns would have to be spread out into the countryside to be relatively close to the food supply. This means the end of suburbia and several of the larger metro areas, and migration back to the small towns that housed most of our population before the automobile age. There will still be toll roads, maybe even railroads (although 10,000 ton coal trains will be a thing of the past), plus canals, etc. Who knows what political or economic models will be developed to meet our need for trade in the future?<br><br>A stand of hardwood trees might supply some fire wood for the kitchen or winter heating, but the main reason for having such trees on your property might be to supply lumber for a small woodworking shop which could produce quality furniture for the local market, to bring in some extra income. The resource would have to be managed for the long term, rather than for maximized short-term profit, to make sure the grandchildren will still have a viable source of income.<br><br>The shop equipment could be powered by water wheel, or by a handful of windmills or solar panels that the family has built over the years, but the production schedule would be determined by when the wind was blowing or the sun shining. Thus, most "industry" would have to be some sort of small-scale family operation instead of a factory setting with regular employees who show up at a regular time to punch a time clock. You just can't afford to have a bunch of regular employees who end up standing around with nothing to do because there is no electricity to power the machines. Family members, on the other hand, can always go out to weed the garden or perform other necessary chores around the household.<br><br>Right now, life is relatively easy, but complicated. Life in the post-oil future will be hard, yet relatively simple. That's a trade-off I can accept.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c6119785853295078052 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 9:18 AM</a><br><br>

However, I did not see a single mention of slavery. Civilization is dependent on slaves. Sometimes they are recognized as such (Aztecs, Greece, Rome); other times it is simply a case of the overlord being able to draft labor at will (Incas, medieval serfdom). Without slaves there is no civilization. We pat ourselves on the back because we think we don't have slaves, but we still had the draft until 1973 and most farmers are essentially slaves now (those making &lt;$10,000 a year in gross receipts = 60% of US farmers and their net is even smaller).<br><br>Colonel Drake's first commercial US oil well started in 1859 and by the end of the Reconstruction debacle, liquid petroleum was well on its way to powering American empire. The US did not have pre-industrial infrastructure in place as a drag on economic growth in the western states either. These two factors were not coincidental to the rise of US dominance.<br><br>The energy slave concept is extremely important because it reframes our idea of the future. Will we go back to slaves to keep some semblance of civilization going? I doubt it. People are not going to go for it, even though we see governments ramping up the prison-industrial complex and corporations trying out a somewhat similar idea in the Bakken oil shale rental market.<br><br>Sad to say, we are likely to revert back to tribal structures. However, for those of us well-prepared, we can choose our own tribes.

I'd encourage you to look into how life was lived a century or two ago in whatever part of the world you live in, and try to get as much detail as possible -- that'll give you a much more nuanced view than simple percentages. <br><br>McMaven, by all means come up the canal! We've got some decent lunch places in town. I haven't had the chance to do much exploring locally, since I don't own or drive a car -- I go where passenger rail service does. As for Hagerstown, though, I think there's every chance that it'll be a very lively place in the deindustrial future; small cities in agricultural regions on major transportation routes tend to do very well most of the time.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c191382647181833465 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 12:54 PM</a><br><br>

The challenge is to come up with something that isn't simply a mushing together of the two ends, but a genuinely different third factor that brings them into balance. <br><br>Greg, take a moment sometime to compare the amount of economically extractable oil in the Bakken shale with the amount the US uses in a year sometime. It's an enlightening comparison. <br><br>Rashakor, yes, I figured there would be at least one person who wouldn't get it. How are you going to pay for the labor, raw materials, energy, etc. for all these infrastructure improvements here and now, when the debt markets are already circling the drain? That's the issue this post is about, and insisting that we ought to do it anyway doesn't exactly answer the questions I've raised. <br><br>DC, precisely -- but until people lose faith in the money economy, that new way of understanding value is going to be a minority thing at best. Mind you, that's no reason not to get busy working out the details. <br><br>Greenbasket, I've talked about that at great detail in previous posts. Right now I'm exploring something different. <br><br>Engineer, thank you -- that's a useful data point. My working guess is that within two decades at most, and quite possibly less than that, the venture capital industry is going to be a dim memory, because in a contracting economy, on average, all investments lose money. <br><br>Wolfgang, that's quite plausible. The process of decline and fall that we see in history fits your model well, provided that it's kept in mind that after a system comes crashing down, people normally scramble around putting the pieces back together again in some less complex form. Thus the internet could go down in a fairly short time, but something less complex will likely be cobbled together from some of the remaining hardware and software within a few years at most; later, of course, the next crisis hits, there's another round of disintegration, and another scramble to put something back together again at an even lower level of complexity. <br><br>Andy, that's an unnervingly likely parallel. <br><br>John, thank you. I hope it's getting around fast enough. <br><br>Hawlkeye, good heavens. No, I didn't mean the illegal economy, though that will no doubt play a part in things. I'm talking primarily about small-scale, unlicensed, off-the-radar-screen production of goods and services for personal use and very local exchange, typically without money changing hands. I'll leave smuggling and the like to those who know something about the subject, which I don't. <br><br>Ric, you've just named a career skill that I'd strongly suggest to anybody who's fairly young and has a good head for numbers: classic double-entry bookkeeping, using pencils and ledgers. Books on the subject are easy to find on the used market, and as computer technology prices itself out of low-end markets, somebody who can take care of the books for businesses will likely be in a very good position. <br><br>Bryant, I've seen the ssme thing -- and you're quite right, it's an important indicator. Note how many of the businesses going away sell goods, and how many of those coming in sell services that require very little fossil fuel input.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c9018571824447612559 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 2:44 PM</a><br><br>

One thing I encourage people to do, if they've got the option of growing their own food, is to concentrate on things that have the vitamins and minerals you don't get from bulk grains and legumes, which will likely be available for a very long time to come -- it's relatively economical to grow them in large quantities and ship them by train. Still, choose the path that works for you!<br><br>Don, those are all excellent points. One good thing about living in a small city in the Appalachians, by the way, is that it's entirely legal to have livestock in your backyard, and there are no neighborhood associations to tell you that you can't turn your lawn into a garden. <br><br>Ghung, been there, done that; I was a househusband for many years, and still put a lot of time into the domestic economy between bouts of writing. It helps if you can show that you're also getting training for some more obviously useful task, which you should be doing anyway. <br><br>Steve, exactly! You get tonight's gold star for summing up the issue concisely. If our economic system had a different definition of value, one that took little things like survival into account, we'd be in fine shape even this late in the game; unfortunately it doesn't, and so we're neck deep in kim chee. <br><br>Zach, the bank may also be desperate for cash. A lot of banks are just now -- the whole financial economy is in very deep trouble, and the sort of freeze-up of the banking system that happened in 1932 could well happen in the next year or so. <br><br>Cathy, exactly. One of the really deadly traps that spring shut in times of crisis is that people get so caught up in struggling to stay afloat that they forget to look for the nearest shore, and when they can't keep paddling any more, they drown. Getting away from the media, and away from the delusional economic thinking so propular these days, makes it much easier to see past the demands of the moment. <br><br>DE, depends on the individual. Those who get started preparing now, even if they can only prepare slowly, are likely to be in much better shape down the road than those who procrastinate, for whatever reason. Still, you can lead a horse to water...<br><br>Ceworthe, nicely summarized. <br><br>Jeffrey, exactly! Remember that the US is on its way to becoming a Third World nation, so a transition to Third World business models makes sense. I expect to see the emergence of a two-tier economy, in which the gradually shrinking well-off population maintains a shell of business as usual, while the bulk of the population lives in shantytowns and manages its own affairs. That won't last indefinitely -- the shell will eventually shatter -- but it may outlast many of this blog's readers. <br><br>Jess, no, I didn't and don't expect the factories to be reopened. The role that I expect Cumberland and places like it to play is that of market center, transportation hub, and nursery for new economic models in the wake of the collapse of abundance industrialism. We'll rebuild our infrastructure, but it will be a very different infrastructure, and much of it will be rebuilt by hand. <br><br>Mustard, that's got to have been an intriguing experience. You know, a book on managing organizational continuity, full of colorful bad examples with the names changed, would probably find an eager market. <br><br>Susan, most rural households will need more than a few acres to produce enough to trade for necessities they can't produce themselves; most urban households will need a lot less, just enough for a kitchen garden, chicken coop, rabbit hutch, etc., since they'll be earning their living producing goods and services that can't be grown on farms. (They're the ten per cent who work in the skilled trades, plus an equivalent share of the domestic economy.) Other than that, your model looks good.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c2590276284673927398 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 3:18 PM</a><br><br>

It seems very straightforward to suggest that another ought to be found and put into use, but the details are where the devil pops up...<br><br>Walter, sure, if you want to define slavery so broadly that it includes the lower end of any hierarchical society, you've inserted slavery into all possible civilizations. I don't find that rhetoric useful -- and I'd point out that slavery as such, in the strict (and proper) sense of the word, tends to be the product of specific historical circumstances.

The shogun did not need to hire bureaucrats precisely because samurai worked in this role. There were a lot of samurai doing various types of government work - it can hardly be dismissed as a few scribes here and there. That said, there were also a lot of samurai left out - there is a book called Musui's Story that you might want to check out.<br><br>As for marketing and promoting, Edo Japan birthed countless commercial ventures, many of them with plenty of marketing - for example, the ukiyo-e prints that are so famous often featured famous actors and actresses. Posters and banners adorned the theaters. Advertising of various sorts was quite common.<br><br>But your larger point is correct. Many more people lived in the countryside, even as Edo was one of the world's biggest cities (if not THE biggest) at the time. <br><br>That said, I think that the balance may have shifted quite a bit, and in a way that is hard to undo. I think mechanized agriculture will be one of the last things to go, so what will happen to all the unemployed marketers? They aren't going to working farms. Sure, some will be swallowed up in the household economy (I've seen this a lot in people in their mid to late 20s), but agriculture isn't yet ready to pick them up. Even if we chase away all the immigrant workers, there just aren't that many jobs there. Perhaps agriculture will grow back to employing significantly more than the 2-3% it does now in the US, but it would take a real disaster for it to go back to 30%. I don't think even peak oil will do that, at least not for the next hundred years.<br><br>The future may not be able to pay its bills, but that doesn't answer what happens... What I am seeing is the reconstitution of extended families and larger households, more people staying at home, less consumerism, more people doing things that require little energy and money (video games vs. driving out somewhere, eating in vs. eating out). Still, we have a surplus of variously unemployed people.<br><br>But the end result is still unknown. The past is not a perfect map for the future, while some things we hold dear will die, unexpectedly others might live. Cellphones are big in the third world, where land-line service never worked.

In my chemical career, I also picked up an MBA and did a lot of market analysis as well as chemical research. For the chemical industry, the lack of bankable projects was noticeable even in the ‘90s, except for building plants for existing products in the Far East. An eye-opening experience was to see the hoops that the line management of one chemical company I worked for had to jump through (and little white lies they had to tell) in order to modernize a old plant of theirs in the US. This chemical plant was about ready to literally collapse. The modernization then had to been done very quickly, in case someone above them changed their mind, so it wasn’t very well thought out.<br><br>A few years later, the company bought another (failing) chemical company and closed the renovated plant which was in a suburb of Chicago, and moved the production to an acquired plant in Houston, TX as a cost saving move (they had a loss that year due to buying the failing company). More importantly though, acquiring the other company gave them a whole bunch of more people to fire, since their required annual blood-letting rite had gotten the headcount a bit too thin on the ground.<br><br>The big point is that one simply could forget about commercializing any new chemical technology or products. An earlier chemical company that they acquired was doing comparatively innovative work in their laboratories. One product that was partly commercialized in Europe was taken up and commercialized here as well. But the laboratory that was doing creative work was taken apart over time. No new products, please – we are Americans.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c5993153167294763938 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 7:10 PM</a><br><br>

We've still got some of them in the US from the late 18th century -- you pay a modest membership fee, and that and a trust fund keeps the doors open and the shelves full. It might be one of the few ways to break out of the downward spiral that's swallowing state funded public libraries. <br><br>Edward, you're quite correct -- barter is taxable income. So is money gained by crime, and gambling winnings. The IRS doesn't miss much!<br><br>Twilight, that's certainly one approach. Down the road I'll be suggesting another. <br><br>Adamatari, granted, but compare the total number of samurai working in administrative functions in, say, 1650 with the number of employees of any one Japanese government bureaucracy today! Similarly, Edo had plenty of advertisements -- so did Pompeii, by the way -- but it was a very small industry by modern standards. I expect there will be advertising in urban areas a century from now, but it won't employ any more than the most minute fraction of the current total of advertising employees. <br><br>Rich, that would work! <br><br>Doctor W., and then people wonder why it is that the US is falling so far behind in most technological fields!<br><br>Mark, photocopy that map and hand out copies to everyone at next week's farmer's market!

Welcome to Third World America; I wonder if there might be a point in teaching people in Birmingham how to make and use inexpensive composting toilets. <br><br>Sidd, actually, yes, they did have to pay rent on the lost days. That fact caused riots in a number of European cities, as I recall. <br><br>Joseph, no, I don't see any particular hope in the protests and protesters you've named. It's very easy to make a name for yourself and get people riled up by criticizing the existing order of things, but if you don't offer a meaningful alternative -- just a collection of slogans -- it doesn't really matter that much. The real work has to begin at the level of the individual and build from there -- to the family, the neighborhood, the community, and so on. It's the lack of that foundation that's gutted the American Left since the 1970s, and still leaves it effectively powerless today.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c1377955337511269025 title="comment permalink">12/15/11, 8:15 PM</a><br><br>

This topic is a sore nerve for me. I'll try and explain by giving reference to the difference two decades can make to my profession.<br><br>I started working full time for the public service and studying part time at university at night in the late 1980's. The recession hit in 1991 and by early 1992 I along with tens of thousands of others were made redundant. Job stability and security was finished whilst I was only in my early 20's. The previous generation had enjoyed relative job security. I endured a time of 10% unemployment and despite my education worked in commercial debt collection for several years before the economy picked up again. I took whatever job put food on the table and paid the rent. I learned a lot about people though!<br><br>My profession now requires an undergraduate and post graduate degree plus three years experience prior to receiving professional recognition and membership (ie. licence to operate). I have jumped these hoops. There are also other licencing requirements which I have to meet. The previous generation entered the profession via an apprenticeship and joined the membership of the professional bodies by paying a $50 membership fee (which is now well over $1,100 per year).<br><br>As for education, as I said before, twenty years before I started working, it was an apprenticeship and no formal education was required. However, had those people wanted to undertake an undergraduate university course, they could have done so free of charge. By the time I started university, courses were fee based (the debt accumulates with the government in Australia and you pay it back through the taxation system). Post graduate courses cost even more again and require payment up front.<br><br>Houses prices over that 20 year period increased by a factor of 10, yet salaries increased by only about 4. Just enough so that you now require two people to pay a mortgage which would have been a different situation to the previous generation who would have been able to afford to have one member of the household working in the domestic economy, whilst still servicing a mortgage. Child care anyone?<br><br>Oh yeah, working hours got longer too. I remember back in the late 1980's Friday afternoons used to be spent down the pub - bosses and all. Not so now. It's not enough to get the education and do the work experience, but apparently you also have to work long hours as well. Something about productivity and commitment they say. In my mind it's a wealth transferral mechanism - you're effectively providing work for free. Well done, employers!<br><br>So at the end of the day it's hardly surprising that Gen X's are disaffected and probably a bit overwhelmed. Saddled with student loans, huge mortgages and double incomes that just keep your head above water. I'm also hardly surprised that Gen Y's are so late to start life, they're probably frightened silly.<br><br>I might sound bitter, but I took all of the above lessons on board, jumped through the increasingly raised hoops and worked on personal projects on the side which proved to be the right way to go. I can't say the same for my friends who are being increasingly sidelined.<br><br>My gut feel is that the baby boomers were at the very peak of resource availability. Still, second and third place is no bad thing in a historical perspective either. I somehow think that the baby boomers easy retirement plans will become unhinged very rapidly soon by the general fall in the economy. Would I have acted differently in their place? Probably not.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c4572833150607874387 title="comment permalink">12/16/11, 12:00 AM</a><br><br>

Many jobs from city councillors to tenant farmer were made hereditary because they had become so onerous and expensive that no one wanted to do them. The structure becomes more ossified the more the pressures to change mounted, until of course the barbarians tore the whole thing down. <br>In my experience all bureaucracies eventually come to see themselves as the most important thing rather than the people they should be serving, and I'm confident todays western 'democratic' bureaucracies are no different. Look at the difficulty all the politicians who promise 'efficiency savings' in the civil service have in actually delivering any savings.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c7864508362239445199 title="comment permalink">12/16/11, 12:30 AM</a><br><br>

If you let one partner control the purse strings then, in this world where money still controls everything, you will have an unequal relationship. I personally don't see how you accomplish this unless you take a fully communal approach to the money -- all income that comes in from any source is *ours*, there is no "yours" or "mine." Otherwise you are accepting the external society's valuation of each partner's contribution to the household. Of course this only works to the extent that both partners are financially responsible and have sufficient impulse control.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c7575636730350271628 title="comment permalink">12/16/11, 5:21 AM</a><br><br>

The problem of adequate rainfall in arid climates seems clear enough, but I fail to see which difficulties the cities in a tropical climate would face that those in a temperate climate would not. If anything, it seems a year-round growing season is an advantage.<br><br>One reason I ask, though this could go beyond the scope of my own lifetime, is that I recall your "Solstice 2100" short story featured a tropical climate (temperatures never dropping below 70) in what is now the American Midwest. Will North America have to wait for a cooler climate to develop the urban societies of a new civilization?<br><br>"Ecosystems of office fauna" has to be one of the most hilarious phrases I've heard in some time, by the way.

For example, with the millions of people out of work, it would be nice to have farmwork available absorb these people right now, but that's difficult with industrial agriculture still going strong. And I've never met any WOOF farmer willing to take on an entire family. And going back into the household economy is only possible if you've got family or a spouse or something to rely on, I think. <br><br>Also, housing during transition. It seems the height of absurdity that so many people are homeless while so many homes sit empty. If the Occupy movement seriously focuses on this concrete issue I think I'll take a look at them again. I wonder at what point will banks realize that they're never going to get the previous value of some of these properties. There has to be some policy or something that can be made to address that. I wonder if it will take a certain tipping point of the number of homeless. Surely it's in the government's best interest to ensure that the majority of their population isn't out on the streets. This is where dispelling the myth of progress would be useful I suppose.<br><br>Anyway, ok I see what you mean about the rust belt areas. For some reason I thought I'd remembered you saying that some of the manufacturing infrastructure was there waiting to be reused. Well, I'm sure that there's at least some raw materials in all these old places that will prove useful in some way again.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c5680963852144418962 title="comment permalink">12/16/11, 8:38 AM</a><br><br>

I've been wondering of late, if we had built out the renewable energy projects rather than diving full bore into burning fossil fuels as fast as possible, where do you think we would be headed now? Might be too big of a question for this venue, but I'm curious how far into the future you think that could have taken us and if that would have provided the real ability to create something of a technic society with relatively high energy usage (nothing like today, but higher than most of human history) within a sustainable framework.<br><br>Then again, reading your thoughts on the collapse of societies (and wanting to read some of your sources--I just got a used copy of Overshoot and I'm seriously considering starting to tackle Toynbee's <em>A Study of History</em> in the new year) it would seem that even with a renewable energy push stemming from the 70s movement, would we still be on schedule for a collapse due to all the other non-energy issues? We could easily have built up a renewable energy infrastructure but continued on with a vapid and empty cultural reality, especially if said infrastructure prolonged our ability to outsource our survival and thus fail to build a real culture out of necessity for continued existence.<br><br>Then again, it would probably be a mistake to take the possibility of having built such infrastructure and divorce it from cultural implications. In other words, if we had built said infrastructure, it seems that reasonable and wise decision would have coincided with a decision to solidify and build a more thoughtful and grounded culture.<br><br>Joel<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c3316355894505204790 title="comment permalink">12/16/11, 12:08 PM</a><br><br>

If so, I have multiple friends who work there. The collapse of that company would certainly seem to have some serious ramifications in Portland. The implications you tease out there are not pretty, but that seems like a very feasible future possibility. To the extent in general that Portland and Oregon is banking on the growth of the industrialized renewable energy sector suggests some bad times in the area if that sector does unravel in the near future. Of course, the real kicker is if the computer industry starts to go into contraction. Imagine what happens to the area economically if a good chunk of Intel's work force goes away.<br><br>The basement apartment comment brought a chuckle out of me, as I did my time living in a cheap basement apartment. ($285 rent, right off Hawthorne and 34th!) Good times, that. Sometimes I try to figure out if the particularities of Portland (multiple young people sharing housing, the preponderance of small and locally-owned businesses at the expense of large, centralized employers, the trendiness of homesteading and local and urban farming, and so on) makes the city more or less resilient facing a future of lower energy and economic contraction. Perhaps a combination.<br><br>Fort George! Did you try the North V, by any chance? I was curious about that, but haven't had a chance to try it. I missed out on the Holiday Ale Fest because somehow my volunteer sign up slipped through the computer cracks. $25 for eight 4 oz. tastings was a bit rich for my poor blood.<br><br>I wish we could have a collective species chat with some blue whales. I imagine they could give us some very relevant and needed perspective on things. It's funny you mention them, as I was talking to my friend/employer the other day about the hike and he asked if I'd seen any whales.

As the answers to this problem appear obvious, while understandably complicated, it appears people are unwilling to even take the first steps in easing this burden. Probably to the irrational belief that this will turn around and well be back on the path to glory. Or because the answer implies a harsher lifestyle lacking the comforts we have created. <br>Among the answers to our problem is a change of desires. Americans as well as all industrials see wealth as accumulation of dollars or other fiat currencies in which we can then purchase any comfort we desire, as we can afford it, which is what makes credit so appealing. And therefore to propose at this point a different system that advocates less fiat currency and more as you put it "household economy" is reviled by most. The "irrational positivist" those who believe "if I say it is then it is" wants nothing to do with any of the real answers to the end of our civilization that will result in the best of all possible transitions.

There are as you say important examples from history.<br>&lt;&gt;//www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/agricultural_revolution_01.shtml<br>See the above BBC history web site for the important example of the agricultural revolution in England roughly 1750 to 1850, which was hardly subsidised much by fossil fuels although the surrounding expansion of industry clearly was. Though the popultion trebled to near 18M over the hundred years, about 22% of the population could just about feed the rest using mostly 'organic' resources. Of course there is not enough arable land here to feed our current 62M in the total UK, but you can see that a sizeable 'urban' population can be fed even if only when the conditions are right, but the knowledge remains that it can be done.<br><br>On another point, I am very glad you have made the point again in comments that 'kitchen gardens' can provide essential vitsmins, minerals and phytonutrients to supplement the traditional grain and legume calories and protein, (which as you say should be available for some time yet).

But I tend to think of it as simply one type of flow through an underground economy. After all, these days you’re a smuggler if you carry a jar of raw milk over to a neighbor.<br><br>Please help me understand these distinctions, because I interpret un-licensed, un-regulated, un-registered, un-official, to all mean illegal. Same with off-the-radar-screen, because whose radar screen are we talking about? Authorities’, no?<br><br>Following the thought that complexity can't just reverse and de-complexify smoothly, how are current participants in the tertiary economy going to back ourselves into the exchange part of the household economy once we've got producing households? Apply for a business license? <br><br>Modern life has become boxed in by big-box laws, which to a very large extent require us to live by that lifestyle. At some point in the establishment of household economies outside the Box, we’re going to be stepping on those legal toes. Fully binding legal complexity is one Dickens of a pickle! Green hands become tied in so many knots there’s no unknotting; at some point a knife is required. <br><br>I see grey markets as inseparable from the household economy, and it seems to me that a willingness to make an illegal transaction is a peak oil initiation. Today, it’s what gains one entry to the shadow economy, and is a requirement for continued participation within it. This is as much a moral as a technical challenge for many people who strive to be law-abiding citizens while the rule of law falls out from under them. <br><br>Determining the distinction between what is illegal and what is immoral is a strategic adaptation that will be necessary for the widespread adoption of green wizardly ways of living. Developing these networks also serves as a safety net during a financial crisis, as pointed out by Rich P’s Foreign Policy article, as well as Orlov’s descriptions of a collapsing USSR. <br><br>This article also compares the world shadow economy as second only to the United State’s GDP of $14 trillion.

Because of that, we were lucky not to have to start small when we did find an acreage in our price range. <br><br>We saved money by paring down our expenses - no eating at restaurants, for instance, and always buying things second hand - clothing, cars, frying pans, you name it. We did not have a TV anyhow, but we cancelled our magazine subscriptions. I see people who are insistent that they 'can't afford' to have only one spouse working, but they are usually people who have a very large house in a high-tax neighborhood, two brand-new vehicles, his-and-hers Blackberries, and a flat-screen TV wider than I am tall. Now, there are a lot of people who genuinely cannot make ends meet on one income, but there are also a lot of people who could easily do so if they re-evaluated their lifestyle.<br><br>We are trying to preserve (and now, grow) a majority of our own food. Some days (years) this works better than others, but we've only been at the preserving for a few years, and this year was our first big garden. We grew a lot more than we needed, and shared with friends, family, and neighbors. We found it as easy to grow six rows of potatoes as three, and our extras have become social capital and a way to entice friends and family to take up gardening. <br><br>There is a huge learning curve, but better to tackle it now, when there is so much information readily available on the internet, than later, when you may be on your own. We do have a large collection of relevant books, too, though.<br><br>If things deteriorate to the point that I lose my job, there is a good chance that our extra farm products (organic eggs, milk, vegetables, etc) will have real (as in, enough to make it worth the effort) monetary value to local people, so my 'new job' will be in boosting the production of these things.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c291760697759458945 title="comment permalink">12/18/11, 9:47 AM</a><br><br>

There were plenty of farm families foreclosed out of their farm for falling behind on mortgages, operating loans, etc. with banks, but there were also cases of tax delinquencies.

That benign neglect has allowed our market to get off to a pretty good start the first couple of years, and to survive some really bad management over the last two.<br><br>Unfortunately, it looks like that free ride is coming to an end soon.

First of all, the amount of money those fees would raise will not even pay for one bureaucrat. Second, no one knows how many lives have been saved by health and safety codes, but it's probably very many.

My reaction is about the same as yours. <br><br>Donkey, I'm pretty sure that within a decade or two, most Americans are going to have to do without banks. In a contracting economy, lending at interest is going to be a losing game for all concerned -- and without that, banks basically have no income. <br><br>Ginger, good question. I suspect that those networks make their money off the huge differentials in income between rich and poor countries; when Americans, for example, can't afford drugs they don't grow themselves, there's going to be a massive hole in the Mafia's profit margin. <br><br>Sophie, many thanks for the links! There are plenty of ways to raise capital, in the financial and nonfinancial senses of the word, once the requirement that somebody make a profit off it goes away. <br><br>Cherokee, it's about the same over here; of course we've got the progressive degradation of the US educational system at all levels to thank in part -- it's quite common for people to graduate from college with BAs who have never learned how to look up a fact their teachers didn't give them, think in quantitative terms, or write a literate paragraph of English. All that additional education required for jobs is in some part an attempt to fill in the gaps that should have been covered in elementary school. <br><br>Guardian, it's an excellent example, and you're quite right about today's bureaucracies, of course. <br><br>Erich, I see the proliferation of bureaucracy and the like as a function of entropy, not a resistance to it.

By situation I mean economic, political, environmental. The only real answer to this mess we have today is a turn around of what we think needs are. For instance why does a home have to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The 800 square foot house I have planned and will build in a few months, that will house 4 and sits on 5 acres will cost me $6000. The land cost me 14,000 and thankfully was paid through a personal loan from a friend. <br>So essentially I will not be leveraged against an out of control confiscatory government. So the reality is if I lose my property at some point due to not enough fiat cash I will have lost very little. As well as in the mean time what cash I can make will be better served storing reserves of real goods not a savings account in a bank. I will have no loan to repay. Opportunity to purchase better property as it presents itself is a viable option simply because I have not leveraged my future to a bank. The best answer for now and our future is a desire for sufficiency not more and more. When we can say I have enough is when we free ourselves from the burden and control of others. For the most part. We will always have to deal with tyrants.<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c783487986764938778 title="comment permalink">12/20/11, 5:10 PM</a><br><br>

It's nice to be remembered. Yes, I am still an Ypsituckian.<br><br>As for the deer, while they're beautiful animals, I am starting to favor the term "hoof-rats." They are pests -- tasty, tasty pests. :) I figure if we're going to extirpate the wolf, it falls to us humans to play the role of top predator for the deer. I am happy to say that my son got his first deer this season, and we now have our first family-caught venison in the freezer. He finally listened to me about going out with some friends to hunt -- <i>I</i> am not a hunter, never having been taught, so I can't show him myself. But, I can point him to those who do know... (First outing, one shot with a muzzleloader, reportedly at about a hundred yards, and he made a clean kill. I'm proud of the kid.)<br><br>peace,<br>Zach<br><br><a href=future-cant-pay-its-bills.html#c1251252810374212428 title="comment permalink">12/29/11, 7:19 AM</a><br><br>
