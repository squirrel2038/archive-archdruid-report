It’s not uncommon, when I give public talks about the end of the industrial age, for people to ask me whether I can offer them any hope. Now of course people mean many different things by the very indefinite word at the end of that utterance; some want me to tell them that I was only joking and industrial civilization isn’t really careening headfirst into hard planetary limits, others want me to tell them that when the crash is over and the dust settles, some kindly power or other will hand them an even shinier society than the one we’ve got, and still others will settle for being told that our civilization won’t drop dead until at least a few moments after they do.<br><br>To all these I have nothing to offer. Still, there are always a few who simply want to know if there’s some reason to believe that the next half century or so might not be quite as ghastly as it looks. I do have something to offer them, and it’s one of the ironies of our time that the reason for hope I’d like to discuss in this week’s post is also one of the most annoying features of contemporary society: the very common assumption that people in the industrial world can’t possibly scrape by without access to amounts and kinds of energy that few if any of our ancestors would have been able to figure out what to do with.<br><br>I’ve discussed more than once in these posts the fact that the average American uses around three times as much energy each year as the average European, to support a standard of living that by most of the standard measures isn’t even as good. That’s relevant to the point I hope to make, but there’s another factor as well. Most of the energy that’s directly used by a household in a modern industrial society consists of highly concentrated fuels and 120-volt alternating current electricity. The forms of energy that are actually needed to support a fairly comfortable human life, on the other hand, consist of food on the one hand, and a distinctly modest supply of relatively diffuse heat for cooking, water heating, and space heating during cold weather on the other.<br><br>Mind you, this is what’s needed to support a <i>fairly comfortable</i> human life. Most of our ancestors got by with a lot less, and a good many of our descendants will probably do the same. Still, most of our ancestors, and in all probability at least an equal share of our descendants, would or will see the point in a well-stocked pantry, a working stove, hot water on tap, and a home where the ambient temperature is well above freezing in winter, and it seems reasonable to aim for these things now – particularly because they are a lot less difficult to provide than most of the frankly less important uses of energy that get most of the press these days.<br><br>It’s worth being a bit more specific. Producing highly concentrated fuels and 120-volt alternating current electricity at home, in anything like the quantities most Americans use these days, with the sort of resources and equipment most Americans can cobble together readily, is a very challenging task; for most of us, "impossible" would be a better description. Producing the amounts of food and diffuse heat that’s needed for a comfortable lifestyle under the same conditions is a good deal less challenging, and in some situations it’s actually pretty easy. Most current projects for dealing with the harsh constraints on energy supplies in the wake of peak oil have fixated on finding ways to keep the highly concentrated fuels and electricity flowing, and a great deal of highly dubious reasoning and evidence has been trotted out in an attempt to insist that we can keep pipelines and gas tanks topped up and grids humming with power from renewable sources; meanwhile, by and large, the much simpler resources that human beings actually need to survive have been left out of the discussion.<br><br>The Green Wizard project was launched, in large part, to offer an alternative to this sort of thinking. We’ve spent much of the last six months talking about ways to produce at least some of your own food in your own backyard, using hand tools and readily available organic soil amendments in place of the extravagantly energy-wasting methods of food production indulged in by current agribusiness. There’s plenty more that could be said on that subject, and I’ll doubtless be saying some of it in passing as my own backyard garden begins another season, but the main focus of the posts to come will be on the other half of the equation: diffuse heat.<br><br>And this, dear reader, means that you need to get friendly with the laws of thermodynamics.<br><br>That may seem like an unlikely assignment, if only because the laws in question don’t seem particularly interested in making friends. Most popular presentations of the laws of thermodynamics these days tend to stress the negative side of these much-maligned rules. Still, as the word suggests, thermodynamics is simply the branch of physics that tells you how heat moves, and if you’re going to be moving diffuse heat around, you need to know how that’s done. The British musical comedy duo Swann and Flanders <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTHiIwxcexI">made this easy</a> some decades ago by explaining the first two laws of thermodynamics in a lively little song. (The link, I’m sorry to say, will play you the song but won’t show you Swann and Flanders singing it; for reasons that left me utterly baffled, the only copy I could find online has video-game characters dancing around and fighting monsters in tune to the music. And, inevitably, throwing around vast amounts of energy in the form of lightning bolts. Go figure.)<br><br>Got that? Okay, now that you’re tapping your toes to the melody, let’s apply it.<br><br>One of the pervasive mistakes made by people in the industrial world these days – oh, all right, made by most Americans and a much smaller number of people elsewhere – is the notion that the only thing that matters when you’re dealing with heat is having enough energy to produce it. Every autumn, accordingly, you can go to your local department store and find scores of portable heaters waiting for you in serried ranks, so that you can turn electricity or propane or what have you into plenty of heat wherever you want it. You can do that, but unless you do something to encourage the heat to stay around for a while, it’s not going to work very well, and it’s also going to cost you plenty, because producing heat is only the first part of what matters; the rest of the equation, which is in many ways the most important part, is keeping the heat from leaving the place you put it any sooner than it has to.<br><br>This is helpful even if you’ve got abundant fossil fuels or plenty of electricity handy. If you don’t, and you have to get by with the much less concentrated energy available from renewable sources, it’s not helpful, it’s essential. The maxim from my old Master Conserver classes was "weatherize before you solarize," and the principle can be extended: unless you take steps to use heat effectively, if you try to get your heat needs met from renewable sources, you’re basically wasting your time.<br><br>So the first and most crucial step in making sure that you have enough diffuse heat in your life to get by comfortably in an energy-constrained future is to do a smarter job of using whatever heat you’ve got. In order to do this, you need to know how heat leaves the places where you want it—your home will do for now; we’ve already talked about the food you cook, and we’ll talk about hot water in a later post.<br><br>Swann and Flanders’ useful ditty could use just a bit of modification for our purposes, because the three ways that heat passes from a hotter body to a cooler body – conduction, convection, and radiation – aren’t equally important in green wizardry. Conduction is the most important of the lot, convection gets a look in here and there, and radiation is a minor factor; there’s also a fourth, combined factor, which is nearly as important as conduction, that’s called infiltration. This is air movement through leaks, and it’s the process by which cold air gets into your house. Technically speaking, infiltration is balanced by exfiltration, which is the process by which the nice warm air in your house goes outdoors so it can radiate its heat to the environment; in practice, since infiltration and exfiltration use the same kinds of leaks and can be fixed in the same ways, the label "infiltration" does for both.<br><br>This is a huge issue in most American homes – anything from a fifth to a half of the heating load on a house is typically accounted for by losses to infiltration and exfiltration – and in most cases, it’s also far and away the easiest and cheapest source of heat loss to fix. The gear you’ll need are a caulk gun, several (usually, quite a few) tubes of good weatherproof caulk, and an assortment of weatherstripping supplies for doors and windows; a sturdy scrubbing brush, cleaning supplies, and a pair of gloves you don’t mind ruining also belong on the list. Your local hardware store will provide you with everything you need.<br><br>If you’ve never used caulk or a caulk gun before, you’ll find detailed instructions in the fourth of the Master Conserver handouts available for free download at the <a href=http://www.culturalconservers.org/library.php>Cultural Conservers Foundation</a> website, and you can also find good instructions in any decent book on home repair. Your goal is to find all the little cracks where air is leaking into and out of your home, and seal them with caulk. There are almost certainly a lot of them: along the baseplate where your house joins its foundations, along the frames of windows and doors, in the little holes drilled through the walls by the guy who installed cable television or internet service, around outdoor water faucets, and the list goes on. Search the inside and outside of your exterior walls, and find every crack and gap; make sure the surfaces are clean, so that caulk will stick to them, and then, to borrow a phrase from one of my instructors, caulk those puppies.<br><br>Now of course you’re not going to caulk the moving parts of your windows and doors, since you need to be able to open and close them. (Nonmoving parts of windows can and should be caulked; if the windows are old, they probably leak like sieves.) For doors and windows that open, you need weatherstripping. There’s a dizzying range of products available; most of them haven’t changed much since I studied this stuff in the 1980s – for that matter, most of them haven’t changed much since the 1950s- and 1960s-era home handyman books I collect started to include chirpy little articles on "Saving Money with Weatherstripping!" – but different door and window situations call for different kinds of weatherstripping, so take your time and explore your options. The Master Conserver handout mentioned above has a fair amount of info on the subject, and so will books, new or used, that cover energy conservation at home.<br><br>A few other details can help you close off other air leaks. Electric sockets and switches on the inside of exterior walls are often the places where the air that leaks in through openings elsewhere gets into your living spaces; your hardware store will sell you inexpensive foam gaskets that go behind the faceplates to take care of this. The hatch into your attic, if you have one, needs to be weatherstripped, since your attic is probably vented to outside – and if it isn’t, it should be; more on this in a later post – and can leak a lot of heat. Finally, if you’ve got an open fireplace, one heck of a lot of warm air is rising out through the chimney to warm the great outdoors. A set of glass doors or some other way of closing up the fireplace opening when it’s not in use will be well worth your while.<br><br>By the time you finish caulking and weatherstripping, not to mention putting in foam gaskets and installing glass doors on your fireplace, you may be wondering how any air is going to get into your house so you can breathe it. With the relatively simple technologies we’re using, that’s not an issue; if you do a good job, you’re probably going to be able to reduce the rate at which air flows through your house by something around half, which means that you’re going to save about half the money that infiltration currently costs you – roughly ten to twenty-five per cent of your heating bill, in other words – without causing any problems worth noticing with air quality.<br><br>There are high-tech methods out there that will save you a great deal more. Very thorough sealing is an important part of those methods, and so is air quality remediation. These aren’t things you can do yourself – you’ll need to hire a professional – and you’re going to shell out quite a bit of money to do it, but if you’ve got the funds to invest, free heat for life is a pretty good payback; the Passive House system, which was invented in Germany and has recently taken root on this side of the Atlantic, is one approach about which I’ve heard good things. Still, unless I’m very much mistaken, the vast majority of the readers of this blog don’t have the kind of spare income that would allow them to drop five figures on a passive house remodel, and even fewer will have that kind of money as the economic unraveling of our society picks up speed; furthermore, it’s exactly those among us who don’t have the funds to spare for that sort of project that have the most urgent need to save money and energy just now.<br><br>Cutting down on infiltration by caulking and weatherstripping, then, is the first step in getting your home ready for an age of energy limits. Over the next couple of weeks, we’ll discuss some of the other steps: all of them inexpensive, all of them easy enough that the average homeowner or renter ought to be able to do them effectively, and all of them important in cushioning the impact of rising energy costs in an age when most people will no longer be able to afford ignoring what kinds of energy use actually matter.<br><span style=font-size:130%><br>Resources</span><br><br>The book that needs to be listed at the very top here is one I haven’t been able to find: a good clear explanation of the laws of thermodynamics in language that a fourth-grader can follow, with plenty of colorful examples. If there is one, I’d be grateful if someone can point me to it; if there isn’t, there’s got to be a physicist out there who can write one, and I can probably even talk a publisher or two into giving it a look. In the meantime, there’s always Swann and Flanders.<br><br>Good detailed instructions on caulking and weatherstripping can be found in almost every guide to do-it-yourself home repair published since the end of the Second World War; your local public library can probably provide you with a couple of good examples, and so can your favorite used book store; review the details and then get to work, and you’ll be in a position to help your neighbors figure out how it’s done. The Master Conserver handouts mentioned earlier in this post are also useful.<br><br>If you’re interested in the Passive House system, a visit to <a href=http://www.passivehouse.us/ >www.passivehouse.us</a> is a good way to find out about it.

Because we aren't carpenterly, we had the original double hung windows restored, which means the sashes tightened up, rehung, new weatherstripping etc. I bring this up because so many people throw out perfectly reparable old wood windows, which already represent so much embodied energy, and replace them with vinyl windows. These new windows are of a petro based material, can't be repaired and should really be considered disposable. Not very green. Reliable research from architectural sources has shown that original windows with correctly functioning storm windows and screens are as energy conserving as all but the highest end replacement windows. There are other simple measures that can be done by the non-carpenterly to reduce the leakage of old windows and I will discuss those on the Green Wizards site in a few day.<br><br>Also, we heat with hot water radiators, and a couple of winters ago we put the silver sided bubble wrap behind each radiator. This serves two functions, it reflects heat back into the room, and helps block heat transfer from the radiator to the colder exterior wall. I bought a roll at the local home improvement box store. I cut pieces just slightly smaller than each radiator and leaned the bubble wrap between the radiator and the wall. It was so simple and it made a noticeable difference in the comfort/coziness level. Especially in small rooms, such as the bathroom or when sitting close to the radiator. Cost was about $45. I don't know yet if this has helped with overall energy/cost savings because we haven't had the house long enough.<br><br><a href=energy-what-actually-matters.html#c8343077775025094275 title="comment permalink">2/17/11, 7:23 AM</a><br><br>

The reason that radiators in housing structures built during the 1920's (and I'm pretty sure that ever since I moved out of the college dorms, I've lived in structures built during the 1910's or 1920's) are so overzealous is because in the wake of the Spanish Flu epidemic, people were fearful of the health-effects of stale, non-circulating air. So the solution at the time was to make radiators so big and numerous that one could heat one's home <i>with the windows wide-open</i>. Of course, this practice fell out of favor in the 1930's when economic conditions forced people to realize that they were essentially dumping cash into a bonfire. It really drives home just what kind of extravagance was allowed by the brief period of very cheap and abundant fossil-fuel energy.<br><br>Because my apartment in this building is the only one with shut-off valves on the radiators, my neighbors pretty much have to open their windows during the winter. Why won't the person responsible for the property install shut-off valves on the other radiators? Because it would cost too much money, of course ($105 each). If you're thinking this individual is not-quite-right-in-the-head, you would be correct.<br><br><a href=energy-what-actually-matters.html#c6883780742015182720 title="comment permalink">2/17/11, 7:38 AM</a><br><br>

Thus massive savings could be made without much change in actual living conditions.<br><br>I write this from my flat in Copenhagen, which is heated with not much more than waste energy from cooking, body heat, and some hot water for when it gets really cold (it's currently at freezing point outside with a wind chill factor of minus 20C (-4F) and inside it is a balmy 23C (73F)).

I might chime in with a few more tips: <br><br>Many people believe that fiberglass insulation can prevent heat losses from infiltration. It doesn't, no matter how thoroughly you cram it into cracks or pack it around air entry points. The caulk gun is the way to go.<br><br>Until air handlers are a thing of the past, it will be true that up to 20% of your home's heat can be lost immediately after production, in your ducts and air handling system. Many workers who install air handlers these days do not know how to properly seal them. Duct tape does not seal, nor do "zip ties", &amp;c., though each has their proper function. <br><br>Use mastic to seal joints between ducts. Read about this in detail before undertaking the project. Take up the vent covers in your home and ensure the vents aren't poorly installed - they should be cinched flush to the interior surfaces of your home. Often enough, vents are instead blowing some air into the interstitial spaces inside your wall, floor or ceiling. Secure the vents flush with the interior surface, caulk around the vents to prevent infiltration into the interstitial space, and then put the vent covers back on.<br><br>As you note, sealing up your home will create a different problem - that of contaminants. In the historical leaky days of yore, this maybe wasn't as big an issue as it is nowadays. Use a high quality air filter <i>and change it at least monthly</i>. When possible, do add an air exchange system whereby outside air can be mixed with your inside air. The health hazards of home contaminants shouldn't be minimized. Frying foods, burning a candle, burning toast, all generate nasties which you don't want to rebreathe for days.<br><br>On this topic, after sealing your home, please test regularly for radon. It is a short-lived alpha emitter; alpha particles and life forms do not get on well. <br><br>And (this is my opinion) have houseplants. These can serve many roles in the household.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br><a href=energy-what-actually-matters.html#c4709400688850231347 title="comment permalink">2/17/11, 12:10 PM</a><br><br>

I've personally known a number of pioneer families whose elder members settled hereabout in the early turn of the last century. The stories of hardship in hindsight were measures of their strength of will and determination to survive. In a blossoming industrial age they preached the advent of a 'better life' to the children of my generation....with many never realizing the short term with which sustainability would last when resources were deplenished at ever increasing rates.<br><br>There are many who are just beginning to wonder about the ACTUAL REALITY of available renewable fuels such as wood-fired stoves. It seems that all aspects of power such as falling, bucking, hauling, storing and such must be considered when considering the eventual lack of easy transport options. Its great to have a personal wood-lot but not if you haven't the physical stamina it takes to articulate its usefulness. Without chainsaws,wood-splitters,and vehicles one begins to recognize the dilemnas one will certainly encounter as what fuels ARE available become scarce. While carts and wagons will work they require draft animals and all the amenities required for their maintenance as well. The effort to secure a cord of firewood by modern methods by an average homeowner will be tripled and quadrupled using hand tools.<br><br>It is one of the many considerations we must pay heed to if we are to teach the upcoming generations the reality of simple existence.<br><br><a href=energy-what-actually-matters.html#c4184466514376899715 title="comment permalink">2/17/11, 8:42 PM</a><br><br>

I firmly believe that after awhile, many will welcome more simplicity to their lives. <br><br>Sometimes however, I wonders if we have truly lost the way, lost in contemporary American culture.

Your readers who are asking about leaking windows need to consider replacement options if they wish to increase long-term usefulness.Power loss = light loss and window utility in varying degrees. <br><br>Windows are also excellent sources for solar options and plant light. <br><br>Simply caulking around a window pane only insures draft stoppage at its source but doesn't consider the total picture. It is a good idea for a homeowner to remove the trim around windows and check for insulation. This can be easily corrected with cans of expanding foam. Shrink fit plastic is a modern convenience but doesn't work near as well as a good sealed unit. Second hand sealed units can be acquired reasonably if you take the time to look. Determining their condition requires looking closely for moisture and therein price. Some companies know how to reseal them cheaply. I've built windows with little more than hand tools according to the size of the pane. Its not that difficult.<br><br>Cross current air-flow can be a bonus in good weather and it should be assessed whether window location favors this or isn't necessary. In the case of the latter other considerations could be made. Also...draft draws can be created for wood stoves. This needs to be considered for homes which are sealed to modern specs. If your shack has a basement you might consider digging to expose the foundation and covering the exterior wall with sealant. When using a wood heater in the basement it should be remembered to isolate your cold storage for vegetables etc by an insulated partition. Mositure content in the air is also a factor. Wood heat is extremely dry.<br><br><a href=energy-what-actually-matters.html#c3575512232960174438 title="comment permalink">2/18/11, 12:29 AM</a><br><br>

Although it gets down to about zero degrees celsius over winter here at night where I am, mostly we're trying to keep the heat out. Fortunately the methods that you describe work just as well at this.<br><br>I've got a further complication, and that's bushfires. Fortunately, I'm building it myself and can take the time to ensure that all openings and weaknesses are sealed. Even the metal roof openings are sealed with zinc alume flashings and mineral wool. Yes it's the same commercial stuff that you find around blast furnaces! Not to mention all the other bits and pieces. Still, it works very well over summer. It can be 40 degrees celsius outside and only about 24 to 26 degrees celsius inside (depending on how many hot days have been in a row).<br><br>What's interesting on a really well sealed house, is that, the inside house temperature will hover around the average temperature if you provide no mechanical heating or cooling. This is not dissimilar to the thermal workings of a cave which always hover around the average ground temperature.<br><br>Well, I hope it doesn't get put to the ultimate test.<br><br>In Australia, we've had serious bushfires in 2009 and now very serious floods this year. I can almost see that if society didn't have the resources or the will to repair or rebuild the infrastructure, then they'd have to abandon the areas. This is the face of catabolic collapse. How many disasters can a society or area suffer and bounce back to the same level as previous to the disaster?

Around here you regularly see houses that are 100 - 120 years old. They're small for good reason. Cheap to build, maintain and run.<br><br>Work at energy conservation before all else. If you can reduce your outgoings spect on energy, then you're saving money. Try to also heat just one room, rather than the whole house. For that matter, if you're short on funds try to heavily insulate just one room, rather than the whole house and do most of your living in there. In Victorian times, this used to be the kitchen or when visitors turned up the parlour. Seriously.<br><br>Thermal mass only works when it is isolated from the external environment. I used to live in a house that was 120 years old and it had double brick walls which were inside the house and not exposed to the outside at all. They acted like a giant thermal battery which kept it cool over summer and warm over winter. In Australia, it's standard practice to build brick veneer houses on concrete slabs. The slab is in contact with the ground and it radiates heat over summer and cold over winter - even if insulated with polystyrene. The external brick walls which are cladding rather than part of the structure, radiate heat and cold exactly the same way which is the opposite of what you require. What they need to do is put the bricks on the inside of the house and insulate them from the outside. Oh well people love them, but without power they'd be hard to live in!<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=energy-what-actually-matters.html#c6841103746521002852 title="comment permalink">2/18/11, 3:53 AM</a><br><br>

A walk through my house, at night with all the lights off, reveals a little galaxy of multicolored lights that blink or beam softly or both -- my iMac does both, the indicator light a pearly white circle that dims and brightens, dims and brightens -- to tell me my appliances are turned off, but not to worry, they're ready to fire up at a nanosecond's notice. <br><br>The computer, the printer, the scanner, the toaster oven, the microwave, the can opener for crying out load (I need this silly device, to my chagrin, on account of my arthritis), the sound system, the juicer, the usb hub, the modem, the router, the plug that connects my laptop, the air conditioner, the electric space heater, the TV, the DVD player, the power strip, the standing fan, the bread machine, the phone charger, &amp;tc. <br><br>Whose idea was this? How much is this costing me? Used to be that if you turned a device off it was, well, off. An indicator light was called an "idiot light." I feel touched, in retrospect, that the manufacturers of these devices believed I was of sufficient mental capacity to remember from day to day where the coffee maker was without a beacon to guide me in the pre-dawn gloaming. <br><br>I could unplug everything every night before I retire, but at this point it seems a daunting task, since I use most of these items most days and would have to reconnect them in the morning. I've disconnected the air conditioner and the fan for the season, of course, but what about the rest of it? <br><br>I'm really making a formal effort to use less energy these latter days, with some success. My heating bill is way down this year. I lead a modest, low-impact, and frugal life, compared with some of my friends and with the way I used to live back in the day. But criminy! Am I fooling myself? Am I merely complacent and self-indulgent about my thriftiness, which come-to-find-out is really maybe delusional?

An apple, a<br>tree, a house... <br><br>But let's get a bit more creative and expand the idea<br>of "a thing". Let's play a game where we draw boundaries around things<br>to group them into a bigger thing.<br><br>For example around this flock of birds. That's a "thing", true<br>enough. It thus has an energy that could be counted. Great. But before that, let's consider closer what we mean by "this flock".<br>If the birds move around, or even if this little flock gets mixed in<br>that larger one, "our birds" remain "our birds" for as long as we<br>want. We have defined what we call a system. That is, we have enclosed<br>in a strong mental boundary a set of "things". <br><br>This allows us to rephrase the zeroth law: every system that we can<br>think of has a quantity, called energy, that can be counted. And if it<br>can be counted, we are entitled to hope that it will give us insights<br>on the behavior of the system. That's exciting. Exciting, but until<br>we know how to count it, without any practical use.<br><br>Before getting there, let's try to think about other properties that<br>systems have and that can be counted. For example, something that an apple, a tree,<br>a flock of bird all have is a mass. The mass of the apple can be<br>measured, and the mass of the flock of bird is the sum of the mass or<br>each bird. That's a good easy start. Just note that mass is not measured directly, but via its manifestation: in other words via the weight it gives things.<br><br>Now, suppose that one of "our bird" eats bread crumbs. We suddenly have<br>inside one of "our birds" a few grams of bread. After<br>few hours, we still have "our flock", with one of our birds having<br>expelled few grams of processed bread. The bread crumbs remained<br>"alien" for all the time of their transit.<br><br>This is a useful representation because if the mass of processed bread<br>is less than the mass of the bread crumbs, we know that there is still<br>some "alien bread" mass running around without "our birds". If for our<br>pratical needs this "alien bread" has become indistinguishable from<br>the bird stuff that forms "our birds", we can agree that the mass of "our flock" has increased a little. And actually by an amount we can<br>easily estimate.<br><br>Playing the game of drawing systems and keeping track of the flow of<br>matter that enters and leaves them is a very good exercise that will<br>prove useful once we get to counting energy. This task will be made<br>possible once we add the first law to our toolkit.<br><br><a href=energy-what-actually-matters.html#c5885449148494052939 title="comment permalink">2/18/11, 5:22 AM</a><br><br>

I tore out exterior walls, insulated and sealed very thoroughly, and installed better windows. In the four rooms I have completed, I have installed no source of heat. Even in my very cold climate (Montana) these rooms can be heated by body heat. My bedroom will always be warmer in the morning than when I go to bed, even in sub-zero weather. I can now heat my entire house with a very small wood stove.<br>None of this is very difficult, nor expensive. Mostly, it requires a lot of labor, and attention to detail, but is within the scope of a good DIY homeowner, such as myself.<br>A book that I strongly recommend is "Insulate and Weatherize", from Taunton Press.

Mine had no sheathing, just clapboard on the outside and thin tongue-and-groove boards on the inside with an air space between. Plus a metal roof nailed over widely-spaced perlins with no underlayment. In a situation like that, a caulk gun is indeed a fly swatter against stampeding elephants. But a lot of people live in houses that are not in such dire initial conditions, and for them the caulk gun can make a quite noticeable difference.

It's a beautifully cheap, practical, lotech, very low energy-demanding refuge, where you can retreat when the weather is bitter, whilst you continue to install proper high-quality energy conservation in the rest of your house.<br><br>Take a look at some of the traditional Korean peasant houses of former times, especially in the north, to get ideas of how to do all this with only modest, local, hand-installed means.<br><br>My snug is a space approximately 6' x 6' x 17', already insulated and draft-controlled, heated by a modest, very un-greedy woodstove that I made to suit both heating and cooking uses.<br><br>The key point about this snug is that, as a small boat, it was fitted out from the start to have ALL the facilities that you need to cook, eat, wash-up, sit, study, write, relax, sleep, shower and dump, all carefully tailored into that one small volume. (The shower'n'dump facilities are separated away inside an even smaller -- but artfully-arranged -- cupboard at one end of the main cabin).<br><br>Having lived here since 1993, I can tell y'all that it's a very convenient and satisfactory living space, and laughably easy to fuel. I just go out about 150 days a year with the dogs and pick up whatever woodland light timber comes to hand, and is easy to carry home. Bit of useful light exercise with bill and bowsaw, and that's my snug fueled, and to spare.<br><br>I'm not making this up, or exaggerating how easy it is. But you do have to get off the North American/overprosperous-Brit lifestyle, fairly comprehensively.<br><br>However, that's a real nightmare way to live, compared to the much lower-pressure way that this modest demand on the world makes possible. I'd never try to go back, even if I won the lottery.<br><br><a href=energy-what-actually-matters.html#c4831920057907573145 title="comment permalink">2/19/11, 1:23 AM</a><br><br>

All the time we were talking about growing things, it was a frozen tundra outside. The last week here has been so perfect that to do anything but dig in the dirt would be unthinkable. Last two days I have dug three beds and planted lettuce, collards, carrots, and onions. All good companions to each other. Also planted a peach tree with the backhoe that came with the tractor I picked up at auction last month. Just can't think about weatherizing, though I'll probably wish I did next year.<br><br>Actually I won't. I don't believe in living in an thermos.

The traditional Devon 'longhouse' extended to house the animals as well as people. My north wall would benefit from a veg and fuel store to keep the wind off.<br>I'm slightly alarmed by those who burn fuel and then try to reduce air intake to a minimum - sure a recipe for carbon monoxide poisoning? I think building regs (often ignored) here provide for an external supply of air to a fire (through a wall or under floor).<br>In what now seems like a previous lifetime, I once worked in Norway and Sweden. I was in a studio apartment in Norway in midsummer. It had triple glazing and underfloor heating. (Probably powered by electricity generated by sustainble plants in the fjords?) The windows could not be opened and the heating could not be turned off. I could only sleep with the door open to the street. I must admit that I'm in the 'wear more clothes and open the windows' camp. Human activity produces an enormous amount of moisture. Unless some dry heat and ventilation is supplied then condensation is surely going to be a problem? This can cause damage to the building fabric.<br>I have a 8kw modern woodstove, powering 3 radiators in the upstairs room, by convection - (no pump). I will certainly sometimes run this low and keep the doors open to get a healthy flow of air when the tenperature is 5 - 10C! There is a rule of thumb that says that if you can think of 3 benefits of an action then it's probably a good idea. If my stove heats the air, central heating water, domestic hot water and dries the laundry then it's difficult not to justify its use. A good way to keep wastage to a minimum is to cut, cart and chop your own wood - makes you appreciate it!<br><br><a href=energy-what-actually-matters.html#c6767005088172906346 title="comment permalink">2/20/11, 10:23 AM</a><br><br>

I highly recommend an electrical energy audit - 1/3 of our energy use was vampires. Getting rid of them was the key and doing wierd things like converting some to use the same DC source (door bell, central vac), rewiring the microwave to be off if the door is open and just leaving it that way. Our water soften is not plugged in - it uses more $$ in electricity to meter the water than it uses in salt (we manually regenerate every 7 weeks or so).<br>Passive House is really neat - but it assume an extrodinary amount of energy use which will heat the house for you. If you energy use is &lt;1/2 that of a typical household you've got no chance. The HRV is critical and most of the time they're oversized for the home driving the humidity down to 30% RH. Choosing a proper model would make it possible to power one with electricity. Our home needs some sort of extra ventilation - be it an HRV (expensive, impossible to install) or a bath fan on all of the time with a window cracked open.<br>Friends went whole hog with a 1960's house - they took off the aluminum siding, adding strapping, pulled out the sagging 2" thick fiberglass (in 2x4 studs) and sprayed in about 6" of foam - air sealing and insulating.

To remove heat you either need ventilation or a heat pump of some kind, i.e., air conditioning. The unspoken assumption in play when saying that insulation is good for cooling is that one is going to be air conditioning. Most people in the South these days can't imagine living without A/C, but our ancestors did it, and I haven't used mine in a couple of years, though my house is far from ideal.<br><br>The house you described sounds like the basic Southern dog-trot house, and I'd love to have one, but as Bill said, I'm probably stuck with what I've got. The dog-trot features two separate cabins with a breezeway between, and a heat-source (fireplace, traditionally) on each end. It's usually off the ground with high ceilings and dormer windows to maximize air circulation. In addition to the air circulation allowed by the breezeway, it also seperates the cooking space from the sleeping area.<br><br>If I ever build it will be a dog-trot, only well insulated for the winter. I'll also put a loft in the cooking cabin to sleep in during the winter months.<br><br>This might be jumping the gun to a future topic, but one thing that's really not good in the South is thermal mass. I know that's heresy for those educated on the West Coast and other semi-arid areas, but if you aren't going to have A/C, thermal mass is the worst design you can use in humid areas.

Most heat transfer from a system in the real world is through some combination of convection, conduction and radiation, but convection in that process does not require actual mass to leave the system. For example, convection from the radiator to the air and from the air to the window pane, conduction to the air outside, etc. Infiltration is removing the actual mass and its thermal energy out of the system, which is different enough to be a useful distinction in these discussions.<br><br>I was inspired to caulk and gasket the last leaky door – it's the one next to the wood stove where it is usually 80-90 degrees, so motivation was low but what the heck. Sealing up for me mostly involves using rope caulk and small cardboard shims cut from cereal boxes to stop the old sashes from leaking so much. When they were made some 175 years ago they undoubtedly fit a little better (and some are replacements), but then they were never intended to totally seal and thermally isolate the inside of the home from the outside environment – that is a new concept that I don't find at all appealing. Instead I'm trying to learn to use it more like it was intended, which means it was around 52 in the bedroom this morning, and that feels perfectly normal to me.<br><br>The easiest thing to fix about your home's thermal performance is your own expectations about how warm it needs to be, and how constant that heat needs to be from room to room or over time. It is very easy to keep your own body warm, as the surface area is quite small compared to your home and it is constantly producing waste heat. Beyond that, keep in mind that the efficiency of heat transfer increases with temperature difference, so the warmer your home is inside the harder it is to keep it from moving to the outside. Note that this does not apply to infiltration, which is pretty much completely efficient at removing heat regardless of temperature difference.<br><br>There's a diminishing return on all our battles against entropy. Certainly it makes sense to keep the actual warm air from just blowing out of your house. Basic insulation too. But somewhere between that and tearing your place down to the studs lies a point where your efforts and resources might be better spent elsewhere – like buying a sweater and planning the garden.<br><br><a href=energy-what-actually-matters.html#c5903170672973151238 title="comment permalink">2/22/11, 6:34 AM</a><br><br>

Over time, carbon monoxide can build up in your home due to this effect. The symptoms are commonly misdiagnosed and often seem like a low level flu.<br><br>It is imperative that you have a professional come and test your home for carbon monoxide and backdrafting, once you have sealed your home. <br><br>Also, concerning thermodynamics: <br><br>My training is in physics - with a nonlinear emphasis. What you're interested in is the emergent thermal behaviors of matter - the laws of thermodynamics are very general and a few more specific consequences are really what we should pay attention to:<br><br>1. Air mass density: Hot air rises. This means it is far more important to seal up the top parts of your home than the bottom, in the winter.<br><br>2. You are interested in the Stefan-Boltzman law of radiated energy per unit surface area. A consequence of this law and the behavior of blackbodies ("all surfaces of a house are blackbodies!") is this: Each additional layer interposed between you and the outside (it matters little what it is, as long as air does not pass through) will reduce radiation losses by 1/(N+1) where N is the number of layers. Radiative cooling of the home occurs through windows and by radiation of the exterior surfaces. Multiple window layers - or more properly, multiple interstitional layers of air - can help. As you can see, even a few layers will help significantly.<br><br>3. Performing work using thermal energy (viz, "burning something" to do work): In thermodynamic terms, it is the <i>difference</i> between the temperatures of two things, which is exploited to do work. Once that temperature difference has been dissipated, we can no longer do work. In conceptual terms, we exploit the temperature difference between two "heat reservoirs" to do something useful through various contraptions of our invention. <br><br>These are all cyclical thermodynamic processes, since to do useful work they must in an abstract sense cycle through a set of states. This is called a "heat engine"; real engines of course fall within its jurisdiction. What Carnot showed was that no heat engine can be more efficient than the Carnot efficiency (and a "Carnot engine" is a thought-construction, impossible in practice.) <br><br>Implications: The greater the temperature differential you are exploiting, the more "pep" your device will have but the less efficient it will be, qualitatively. Et cetera.<br><br><a href=energy-what-actually-matters.html#c7326731316914657279 title="comment permalink">2/22/11, 9:18 AM</a><br><br>

There are always tradeoffs in temperate climates. <br><br>Our house is actually a dogtrot, the wood-frame version of it that was popular in the early days of wood frame construction replacing log construction around here. It's the L-shaped "3-pen" variant, with a third "cabin" behind one of the two main ones, also separated by a space. This rear space is the kitchen, thermally separated from the sleeping areas for better summer sleeping and for better isolation of kitchen fires. Our version is built as one enclosed structure, with double doors on either end of the dogtrot. In the original log cabin concept, of course, the dogtrot was roofed but not enclosed, hence the dogs could trot through it. <br><br>Before I insulated the house, it cooled off wonderfully on summer nights. With the uninsulated metal roof exposed to outer space, the interior cooled down almost to outside ambient temperature. And then the sun got up, and hit the roof, and the upstairs (it's a 1-and-a-half story house) became uninhabitable. Now the temperature swings are less, the upstairs is livable in summer, but the whole thing is substantially warmer at night for sleeping, which is NOT a plus here in August!<br><br>But... in the winter before the insulation, the house was almost unheatable except for spot areas. Milk froze on the kitchen counter. Pipes froze in the bathroom. It was not compatible with bare minimal expectations for 20th Century indoor infrastructure (e.g. indoor plumbing) unless you pumped huge amounts of 20th Century energy in to it, which is how people did live here through the 20th Century. Now, with the insulation, I actually can make some headway on the heating with 21st Century heat sources like home-grown wood and active or passive solar. Plus the efficacy of the remaining 20th Century energy sources is greatly improved. So, on balance, in the Tennessee climate, winter trumps summer and insulation wins. Vice versa in Miami. Somewhere in between the balance will tip, depending on your architecture, needs, and preferences.<br><br><a href=energy-what-actually-matters.html#c3720729416300608766 title="comment permalink">2/22/11, 2:13 PM</a><br><br>

Take the Carnot Efficiency "CarnotEff" as an over-the-top, never-going-to-happen, best possible efficiency for any given heat-engine you have built:<br><br>CarnotEff = 1 - (T_cold/T_hot)<br><br>(A perfectly efficient device would operate with Efficiency = 1.)<br><br>Since T_cold, the temperature of the cold side of your heat-engine, is generally going to be the temperature of the outside air (or in some cases, the temperature of a nearby body of water, or a well you drill in the earth), the easiest way to change your thermal efficiency is to change T_hot, the temperature to which you are heating the hot part of your engine.<br><br>So what I mean is, keeping T_cold unchanged, thermal efficiency, in a loosely argued general sense, should be expected to *increases* with the highest temperature you can achieve in your heat engine. This will also give you more "pep". <br><br><br>Apologies for any confusion generated by the tail end of my previous comment about efficiency and "pep. Just goofy, that. <br><br>See here:<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_efficiency<br><br>Typical heat-engines of most kinds would be lucky to operate at half the Carnot efficiency in practice.<br><br>Cheers<br><br><a href=energy-what-actually-matters.html#c510436512196903229 title="comment permalink">3/15/11, 1:22 PM</a><br><br>
