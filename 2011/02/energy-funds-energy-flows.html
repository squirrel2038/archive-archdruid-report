It’s a safe bet that whenever I post something here discussing the limits to energy resources, one result will be a flurry of emails and attempted comments insisting that it just ain’t so. I’ve long since stopped responding to them, since the arguments they raise – they’re always the same – have been repeatedly addressed here and in my books on peak oil, and endlessly rehashing the same really rather straightforward issues isn’t that productive a use of my time. Still, I keep track of them; it’s a useful reminder of just how many people have never quite grasped the fact that the laws of nature are under no obligation to cater to our culture’s emotionally charged fantasies of perpetual progress and limitless growth.<br><br>That failure to come to terms with the realities of our predicament is by no means restricted to internet bloggers, to be sure. The World Wildlife Federation, to cite only one example, has just released a <a href=http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/footprint/climate_carbon_energy/energy_solutions/renewable_energy/sustainable_energy_report/ >lavishly produced study</a> insisting that the world can replace 95% of its fossil fuel energy from renewables by 2050, with ample room for population increases, ongoing economic growth in the industrial world, and a boom in the nonindustrial world that will supposedly raise it out of poverty. The arguments in the report will be wearily familiar to anybody who’s followed the peak oil debate for any noticeable length of time; Erik Lundberg of Transition Milwaukee has already <a href=http://www.energybulletin.net/stories/2011-02-06/fantasies-hyper-globalism-wwfs-energy-report-0>commented on these in some detail</a>, and his points don’t need to be revisited here.<br><br>Underlying all the grand and sweeping fantasies of endless economic growth powered somehow by lukewarm sunlight and inconstant wind, I’ve come to think, lies the simple fact that the human mind never quite got around to evolving the capacity to think in terms of the huge amounts of energy our species currently, and briefly, has at its disposal. It’s one thing to point out that a planeload of tourists flying from Los Angeles to Cairo to see the Great Pyramid, back when political conditions in Egypt allowed for that, used more energy in that one flight than it took to build the Great Pyramid in the first place. It’s quite another to understand exactly what that means – to get some sense of the effort it took for gangs of laborers to haul all those blocks of stone from the quarries to the Nile, load them on boats, then haul them up from the Nile’s edge east of Giza and get them into place in the slowly rising mass of the Pyramid, and then to equate all that effort with the fantastic outpouring of force that flows through the turbines of a modern jet engine and keeps an airliner poised in the thin air 40,000 feet above the ground for the long flight from LA to Cairo.<br><br>Like the age of the Earth or the distance to the nearest star, that torrential flow of energy is on a scale our minds are simply not capable of grasping in any but the most abstract sense. From the perspective we inherit from our evolutionary origins, where the effort needed to chase down an antelope or fight off a hyena lies toward the upper end of our imaginations, the power needed to keep a couple of hundred tons of aluminum, steel, fuel, luggage, and human flesh in midair for most of a day is so close to infinite that it’s all too easy to confuse the two.<br><br>As we prepare to navigate the rough waters of the immediate future, though, confusing the two is a major mistake. The fantasy of infinite energy is what’s behind the assumption, common throughout the industrial world, that using as much energy as possible in as many ways as possible is an unqualified good. Once supply limits enter the picture, unlimited use becomes problematic, but it’s important to grasp that there are two kinds of limits to energy availability and two kinds of problems that result.<br><br>The best way to think of the difference I’m addressing here is to borrow a metaphor from money. One kinds of energy limit is a limit to energy <i>flows</i>, which works like the limit imposed by the amount of a weekly paycheck. If you make five hundred dollars a week, that’s how much you have to spend that week, and if the potential uses for that money amount to more than five hundred a week, you have to prioritize. So much has to be set aside for rent, so much for food, so much for utilities, and so on, before you decide how much you can afford to spend on whatever else you have in mind. Neglect to prioritize and you can end up scrambling to get by until your next weekly paycheck shows up.<br><br>The other kind of energy limit is a limit to energy <i>funds</i>, which functions like the limit imposed by the amount of an inheritance or a lump-sum lottery win. If you have ten million dollars in the bank from a winning lottery ticket, the kind of limit the fund’s size puts on you is very different from the kind that a weekly paycheck puts on you. Treated as a fund, that ten million dollars is all you’ll ever have to spend, and unless there’s less than ten million dollars’ worth of expenditures you’ll want to make in your entire life, you have to prioritize, just like the guy making five hundred a week.<br><br>Notice, though, that if you’ve got a fund rather than a flow, the temptation to ignore priorities and run amuck with your wealth can be very high, because payback doesn’t come midway through the week; it comes when your bank balance drops too low to cover your current expenses, and when that happens, it’s far too late to do anything about it. If you have more than the usual amount of brains the gods gave hominids, you can dodge this by turning the fund into a source of flow. In the world of money, this is called investing: you buy assets that give you a steady return, and the resulting flow becomes the bedrock on which you build your financial life; even if you mess up and have to scramble, there’s always the next check to help you out. Still, you have to make the decision to do that, and then keep your grubby hands off the funds you’ve invested.<br><br>Apply this to energy and you’ve basically got the history of the modern world. Until our species broke into the Earth’s store of fossil fuels and started going through it like a lottery winner on a spree, we lived from paycheck to paycheck on the incoming flows from the sun, and we got fairly clever at it. Growing food crops, raising livestock, building windmills and waterwheels, designing houses to soak up heat from the sun in winter and shed it in the summer, and a good many other ingenious tricks gave us the annual paycheck of energy we used to support ourselves and cover the costs of such luxury goods as art, literature, philosophy, science, and the occasional Great Pyramid.<br><br>With the transformation of coal from ugly black rock to energy resource over the course of the eighteenth century, that changed radically. Simply put, our species won the lottery, and it wasn’t a paltry little million-dollar prize, either – it was the great-grandmother of all jackpots, unimaginably vast enough that for most of three hundred years, the major constraint on how fast we used fossil fuels was the struggle to figure out enough clever ways to use it all. What nobody noticed at the time, or for a long time thereafter, was that we’d switched from a flow to a fund, and the faster our fossil fuel use accelerated, the faster the bank balance depleted.<br><br>We could have done the smart thing and converted the fund into a source of flows. That’s what the alternative energy scene of the 1970s was all about: figuring out ways to use the world’s remaining fossil fuel reserves to bridge the gap to a renewable energy technology that could last after the fossil fuels were gone. Even then, it was a gamble; nobody knew for sure if it would be possible, even using the world’s still-huge fossil fuel reserves, to create a renewable infrastructure sturdy and productive enough that it could keep providing ample energy into the far future. Still, it’s possible that it could have been done, if the initiatives launched in that decade had been pursued in the decades that followed.<br><br>The people responsible for the World Wildlife Fund study, and those people who deluge me with cornucopian screeds that aren’t simply chanting "Drill, baby, drill" or insisting that God Almighty will refill the world’s oilfields so that we can keep on living exactly the sort of life of extravagant luxury, wealth and pride their own Bible condemns in no uncertain terms, are basically insisting that this is still an option. It’s not, and the reason it’s not comes from the one major difference between money and energy resources: in the world of energy, <i>a fund is also subject to restrictions on flow.</i> It’s as though the bank account where you have your lottery winnings stashed has a regulation saying that you can only withdraw two per cent of your total balance per month.<br><br>If you’ve got ten million dollars in the bank, that limit hardly seems worth noticing at first, but as your tastes grow more extravagant and your bills mount up, the amount you think you need each month goes up, and the amount you can theoretically withdraw goes down as your balance depletes. Sooner or later those two lines cross, and once that happens only a drastic program of cutting expenses and prioritizing bills can save you from financial ruin. Unless you’re willing to suck it up and live very cheaply for a good long while, you certainly can’t afford to take the money you have left and sock it into an investment; you need the money to cover your bills right now, and the best you can probably hope for is that the remainder of your lottery winnings will clear your debts and maybe pay for some nice things you won’t be able to afford in the future, when you’re back to earning five hundred a week.<br><br>The restrictions on flow that affect fossil fuels are the product of geology and economics, not bank regulations, but the principle is the same. It’s simply not possible to extract more than a certain amount of oil from a given oil field per year – the amount varies from field to field due to fine details of geology – and trying to do so is a good way to exhaust the field prematurely, losing the chance to get some of the oil you might have had by doing things the right way. Despite all the ballyhoo about high-tech methods of extracting oil from the ground, in practice, those turn out to get about the same amount of oil as the old-fashioned method, just a lot faster; in practice, that means that the field keeps production at a higher plateau for a while longer, but runs dry sooner. The limits to coal and natural gas production are a bit more straightforward: neither one is cheap to produce, and the faster you want to produce it, the more it’s going to cost you and the sooner you run out of good places to dig or drill.<br><br>Thus you don’t have to run out of fossil fuels to end up in a world of hurt; you just need to get to the point where rising demand crosses decreasing potential flow. Worldwide conventional petroleum production passed that point in 2005; coal is closing in on the equivalent point, the point at which the cost of expanding production from depleting reserves will exceed the ability of the global economy to pay; natural gas is a little further off, though nothing like so far as the press releases from shale gas drilling companies hoping to buoy their stock prices would like you to think. In terms of the metaphor, our bills are mounting and our ability to withdraw enough cash to cover them from the First National Bank of Earth is starting to come into serious question.<br><br>Can we afford at this point to invest a very sizable fraction of what we have left in a project of the sort the World Wildlife Fund imagines? Not without a process of global economic retrenchment that would make the Great Depression – the last one, not the current one – look like a lawn party. Political realities being what they are, it’s not going to happen.<br><br>This means, as these essays have argued repeatedly already, that trying to find some new jackpot of energy to fuel our current lifestyles is not a viable response to our predicament. The foundation of any viable response needs to start from the other end of the equation, by changing our lifestyles to accept the drastic retrenchment that’s waiting for us anyway as fossil fuels continue to deplete. If our imaginary lottery winner wants to get out of the trap he’s made for himself, after all, the first thing he has to do is stop spending money so freely. Once that happens, the range of potential opportunities broadens significantly, but unless that happens, there’s no way that things are going to end well.<br><br>The distinction between funds and flows is important enough that I’d like to ask those of my readers who are working on the Green Wizards project to use it to expand on the list you made last week. That list, as you’ll remember, includes every way that heat enters into your house during the cold months of the year, and every way that it leaves. (If you didn’t think of the furnace, the stove, and other heat-producing appliances when you were coming up with ways that heat enters your home, by the way, you should probably do the list over again.) For this week’s work, take each of the ways that heat comes into your home, figure out whether it comes from a flow (for example, sunlight) or a fund (for example, natural gas), and if it comes from a fund, what restrictions affect your access to flows from that fund (for example, the cost of natural gas).<br><br>This may take you a bit of research. Your refrigerator, for example, puts a noticeable amount of heat into your home; if it’s electric, what energy source produces the electricity you use? If it’s coal or natural gas, it’s from a fund; if it’s hydroelectric, it’s from a flow; it may well be a mixture of these and more. Take the time to find out; it’s good practice, and will also give you a much better idea of what factors are likely to affect your electric bill in the future as different resources run short at different rates. More generally, go over your list from last week and see if you can expand on it. Next week, with the help of a pair of British musical comedians, we’ll begin applying this information to the next practical stage of the Green Wizards project.<br><br>*******************************<br>My books on peak oil and the future of industrial society, <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/4014>The Long Descent</a> and <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/4051> The Ecotechnic Future</a>, are available from your local full service bookstore or direct from the publisher at the links just given.

Maybe food in your cupboards, and you have no more money to go out and buy more- now you have to prioritize would be a better way for some people to 'get it'. <br><br>We installed a wood stove with the highest EPA ratings we could find. We still haven't managed to have enough fuel to keep the house warm all winter, but I suspect that if we don't get better at it, our winters are going to be a lot cooler indoors in the future. Right now we can heat with natural gas when the wood runs out. Maybe not, in the future. Probably not.<br><br>I for one believe in things humans learned to do for themselves before the Industrial Revolution, one of which was coppicing. That describes 'flow', because you not only burn that produced by the sun (and water, but that's another issue), you burn the same tree over and over and over again. Unfortunately, I can't grow enough fuel on the quarter acre on which my house stands, so getting used to colder winters may be in my future. But I'm still going to grow trees for coppicing and try my hand at it.<br><br>I guess that as long as our government is truly controlled by various corporations, real progress will never be made. People here in the States abhor socialism, but it's the Scandinavians that have the highest standard of living in the world, and are in a much better position than we to keep it in the very nebulous future.<br><br><a href=#c8687528831865067809 title="comment permalink">2/9/11, 9:45 PM</a><br><br>

I fear that the <b>only</b> way people will begin to grasp this is to revert to manual function for several of their daily needs… and most of the people around me recoil if they even get close to this. For example, since I switched to cooking 98% of my meals from raw materials, it’s easier for me to imagine having to go the whole way – pump my own water, milk my own cow, etc…. and yet I know I am not near that now. But friends who microwave the part of their diet they don’t order out, have very, very little understanding of how much energy their food requires. Similarly, since I heat my house about 75% with wood, I see how many hours of chopping is translated into how many hours of heat… they don’t give it a thought, and when I push them on it, their estimates are wildly off. When people are forced to “downgrade” is when they will understand, not before.

The education and politics were rather close to collective rationality until the 1970s - perhaps not adequately close, but much much closer than now. The occasion of Reagan’s centennial gives an opportunity to look again, how things were changing then. The subject is politically charged, but here are a few facts that some people immediately paid attention to. Reagan not just made mockery of affirmative action, food stamps and federal job training projects, prenatal care and school lunch programs (with ketchup as vegetable to satisfy nutritional requirements). His appointments of Attorneys General and to the Environmental Protection and Interior Department agencies did selectively opposite of what they functions were supposed to be: civil rights undermined, natural resources auctioned. That is making the government a problem in full force. This turn in governing was drastic, but apparently well prepared and protected. We went a long way since then - Reagan’s type would be dismissed as unelectable now, as Sen. Graham (R-SC) observed.<br><br>So, political power picked its own interests and never looked back at pity concerns about growth limits. Was this provoked by intellectual envy? Was the political power that much sufficiently corrupted? Or was the global overshot a survival strategy (for power)? Why else were Clubs of Rome so suddenly ignored?<br><br>The situation of so many loosers (financially, in particular) does not make evolutionary sense. A big majority of people is supposed to be crafty in their own self-interest - yet there were never so many doomed as now. This is not evolution but con artistry on a global scale. You can see it in stock market and real estate bubbles, in nations and populations duped to astronomic debt, from information manipulation and pandering to supposed popular opinion. <br><br>Take, for example, Richard’s tip to the Saudi oil wikileak. It is freely reported in many places <a href=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/feb/08/saudi-oil-reserves-overstated-wikileaks rel=nofollow>if you look</a>. But not in the big media or public political circles. We have US officials concerned that Saidi oil reserves are grossly overstated - but this is not to be emphasized in public discourse. It is not so much that governments don’t want to be smarter than single human minds - it looks more like dumbing is where the effort lies.<br><br><a href=#c2000311282052933189 title="comment permalink">2/9/11, 10:27 PM</a><br><br>

The other major forms of "fuel" being topsoil and old-growth forests. Those may not take millions of years to replenish but they take long enough that past civilizations have consistently treated them like funds rather than flows, leading to eventual collapses. One explanation for the development of coal and oil technology, which I find convincing, is that Europeans had depleted their sources of wood for charcoal, so they turned to coal.

Surface area to volume ratio. If your house is small it obviously heats up faster, however it cannot contain its heat due to the higher surface area. The volume is inverse to the surface area, therefore a larger volume yields a smaller surface area, and a smaller surface area has less contact with the outside environment. So, logically this would explain why so much energy is being wasted on heat. We live in small houses! So would it make sense to live in mansions? No. Not unless it was a commune. After thinking about this dilemma I continually thought about the "hobbit homes" depicted in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Building a house in the ground would effectively utilize maximum volume and minimum surface area, so the issue of heating a "hobbit home" would require very little energy. And without houses burdening the landscape we could grow crops right over our heads, similar to the hill farming methods of the Incans and Mayans. The only problem I foresee would be the water trying to make way into the underground home, I don't know of any energy efficient methods of removing the water without a subpump. Perhaps making a windmill on top of the house that turns a giant Archimedes Drill?<br><br><a href=#c4557166832086764805 title="comment permalink">2/10/11, 6:45 AM</a><br><br>

I am reminded of it every time the family comes over to our place for a visit. They still don’t really get why we do what we do, and when my wife and I try to explain a new project and the reasons for doing it, the eyes of our family members collectively glaze over until they look almost zombie-like. What follows is silence, which I presume is some rather uncomfortable thoughts rolling through their heads, and then the sweeping proclamations that everything will be okay in the end, really, the nice government and the businesses that finance it will fix everything so that We The People can continue to consume poisoned food, plastic crap from the far ends of the world, and oh yes, the ever popular American land yacht will continue to function on a limitless basis. It is not just my family either; I see it all the time with co-workers and friends. The Force of market economics is strong, so much so in fact that it seems to cloud people's better judgment even though I know that deep down most realize something is seriously amiss and that the culture of consumption that is so common in the industrialized world cannot continue unabated forever. Yet they are fed the myth of progress on an almost daily basis. From the State of the Union address to the myriad of advertisements that intrude upon life in the industrialized world, if thoughts stray far from the goals of progress, even for a second, then there is always something or someone their just in time to sing a lullaby and place those ideas to rest. <br><br>Worried about the environment? Buy this and that "green" product, fresh off the boat from Taiwan. Think peak oil is a problem? Buy an electric car. Want to save the furry, cute animals? Donate to such and such organization. It drives me crazy that people continue to insist that the same systems that got us into this mess in the first place will somehow magically work to fix it in the end. It is the line of thinking that we can buy and spend our way out of anything that is a major part of the problem. <br><br>Perhaps it is fear of the unknown, fear of hard work, or fear that the "things" of their existence, which they think means so much, will disappear forever causing a vacuum of sorts as far as personal worth is concerned. When I think of how most people in today's industrialized world define themselves, which is usually based upon jobs and possessions, I cannot help but notice that if these elements of their existence were removed then, in their own minds anyway, any idea od self-worth that they had as a human being would be removed as well. They would essentially have no locus of control and I wonder if this isn’t at least part of the reason why, in the face of such overwhelming data, many go on living as if the earth can provide a burgeoning population base forever without any consequence or contraction. I believe that the urge to hang onto the comforts of industrial life is strong enough that even highly intelligent people will neglect data that contradicts their preconceived notion of the future, even though they know that the data does not lie and will not simply disappear. <br><br>I believe this is why so many cling to the idea that there will be more gadgets and gizmos in the future that will power industrial civilization forever. The mysterious cult known as "they" in modern parlance will come up with some solution because "they" always have. <br><br>With this level of collective cognitive dissonance in mind, I have to wholeheartedly agree with Cathy's point that we cannot teach those that do not want to learn, but we can do our best to preserve the skills and information that will be needed for the future so that when the time comes, we can help those who are in desperate need of assistance. While my family continues to insist that the world can be saved by simply shopping for "green" products at WalMart, we will continue to tend the gardens, clean the coops, and prepare.<br><br><a href=#c7386850897357425584 title="comment permalink">2/10/11, 10:00 AM</a><br><br>

It is also unclear how much time remains to access digital knowledge and discussion.

I have two example that I will explicate in an attempt to demonstrate the differences. My first example is the home veg garden. There are many ways to garden - raised beds, organic, conventional, irrigated, mulched, etc. Currently the rage in most of the eco-world is some variant of the intensive raised bed, often double-dug with large amounts of organic material. Managed properly such a garden can produce an impressive flow of vegetables from a small parcel of land. The unfortunate part of it is such a system's brittleness. It mandates annual or biennial additions of organic matter. It requires careful monitoring of soil moisture and immediate application of water before stress sets in on the plants. To make the best use of such heroic management and inputs plants are generally spaced closely together thereby allowing proponents of "intensivist methods" to claim they have the best "efficiency per unit of land in production". <br><br>Extensive gardens on the other hand would be familiar to our ancestors. Growing by this method one spaces plants much more widely, may perhaps do a slight raising of a bed by digging path dirt onto the growing bed but nothing crazy, and fertilizes as materials are available. Even in a spread out garden one must still import organic matter if the quality of the crops is to remain high. If one is intent on growing the compost on site too then an area roughly the size of the extensive garden must be turned over to organic material production in the form of a fast growing plant such as comfrey or bamboo. I have no idea how big an area would be needed to keep an intensive garden "in compost", but I imagine it must be large.<br><br>Intensive gardening may appear to produce huge returns from small areas, but in my experience it draws on hidden stocks of fertility. I guess if one only has a small piece of earth to grow in and has ready access to organic material then intensive gardening makes sense. For those of us in the country though it often is more reasonable to spread things out and avoid the need to water garden veggies often. I suspect that many sources of concentrated organic material are going to dry up once fossil fuels become scarce.<br><br><a href=#c2333878134173024359 title="comment permalink">2/10/11, 12:06 PM</a><br><br>

Those annual crops then get hauled to the cows, chopped by other big metal machines, and fed to the cows by big metal machines. After the cows have had their way with the feeds and turned in into a sloppier, smellier, browner, form it is again handled by big diesel powered hunks of metal. If one is willing to jump through the above hoops and has the right cows, one can produce mind-boggling volumes of milk.<br><br>The other of method of milk production allows the cows to do more of the work. It's called grazing. Good grazers make a lot less milk per acre of land in production as the intensivists do, but their costs are so much lower that often they are more profitable. To build a farm with a similar "flow" of milk produced, a grazing farm would need many more acres (twice? thrice?). The precise amount depends on the quality of the soils and other site specific factors. <br><br>I've simplified the examples somewhat. There are overlapping methods and options in both of my systems. Some extensive gardeners use organic material from the town leaf dump or a nearby brewery. Some grazers feed their cows grain thereby increasing their effective land base as well as their milk production per cow.<br><br>I suppose the point I'm coming to is that the intensive systems of food production which I'm familiar with have hidden subsidies of energy/materials/fertility that allow them to "produce more from less land". Extensive systems are more readily accessed in their production (flow) from their land base (stock of minerals).<br><br><a href=#c8613675802376273403 title="comment permalink">2/10/11, 12:26 PM</a><br><br>

I've founded a nonprofit, the Cultural Conservers Foundation, to encourage the preservation of knowledge in less vulnerable forms; once it gets its tax exempt status -- a process that's under way right now -- the board and I are hoping to get some initiatives under way in that direction.<br><br>Rhisiart, an excellent point!

Thus it's not a strategy for a fast turnaround. You might put some time into if if you have time to spare, but you're going to be playing for pocket change at first, since that's all you'll be able to afford; getting a handle on your spending has to take priority over everything else until you're past the cash crunch and can start taking small risks again. (And yes, all of that applies just as well to energy.) <br><br>EBrown, of course there's a place for extensive growing as well as intensive. The reason I tend to stress intensive growing is that most people just now have very small patches of land to work with, and a lot of sources of organic matter available, ranging from autumn leaves to composting toilets; also, it's what I know how to do. If you're in a different situation, use different methods. <br><br>Christopher, why not space? Let's see. Quadrillion-dollar investments we can't afford? Check. Huge resource and energy needs we can't spare? Check. All the disadvantages of the WWF plan, with even less chance of paying off any time soon? Check.

You truly are a treasure.<br><br>I ran your analogy past one of my 'hopeium' friends and they claimed it doesn't stand up for two reasons:<br><br>1. The assumption that the Lotto winner will necessarily exceed his/her means<br><br>2. The assumption that the Lotto winner can't ratchet back down without 'crashing'<br><br>If I maybe so bold, the analogy can be extended usefully. The Lotto winner is bombarded with suggestions to make life better &amp; easier - to spend less time working and therefore have more time for 'leisure'. This is, of course, your point about having so much cheap oil that people/companies just kept finding better ways to use it faster. So, it seems to me, the Lotto winner will, most certainly, be brainwashed into the need for 'labor saving' because other people stand to gain from this. He/she will therefore get fat, lazy, deskilled and burn through the fund at a higher rate than otherwise might have been - whilst having time for TV and golf.<br><br>Regarding my friend's point #2, the inability to prevent crashing, given the extent to which Lotto winner over time 'outsources' all physical work &amp; discomfort, he/she becomes soft and incapable. If, by 'crash' or 'collapse' we mean painful adjustment, then that's inevitable (working hard again, feeling discomfort, etc). However, it doesn't mean, for example, suicide for out Lotto winner. Though it might. I think that gets to your point about an ongoing collapse/adjustment (and Dmitry Orlov's essay pertaining to 'levels' of collapse and choices being available at each 'collapse floor' to prevent falling through to the lower floors).<br><br>Anyway, my thought is that one of the key entities our hypothetical Lotto winner would have paid for early on, when he/she felt flush, was for personal security. I mean, with all this new wealth, one needs protection, right? Later, when the fund is drying up and the providers are being let go, the security provider still wants its payola. Even if the Lotto winner may deem other needs more important, the security outfit will intimidate the other providers helping our, now sad and depressed former wealthy principal, to make sure they get their share first. All the way to the last red cent. We all know who will have dibs on the last vestiges of FF, no matter what! <br><br>Reader's maybe interested in a historic/chronological visual of JMG's flow/fund analogy on Folker Gunther's website. Mr Gunther refers to 'flow versus store'. See<br><br>http://www.holon.se/folke/kurs/logexp/logexp_en.shtml<br><br><a href=#c6823174530381129202 title="comment permalink">2/10/11, 5:33 PM</a><br><br>

It's quite good really, but completely irrepairable. I guess it buys some time - at most probably about 15 years.<br><br>Hey EBrown,<br><br>About your spacing advice for plants. That advice probably needs to be taken in context. <br><br>In Australia, I practice quite close spacing for both fruit trees (usually about 1 to 2 metres apart ie. 3 to 6 feet) and vegies (virtually on top of each other). <br><br>The reason for this is because of the harsh sun and higher general temperatures than you may experience in your climate. The closer spacing reduces evaporation and protects leaves during excessively hot days (I've seen 40 degrees celsius here on New Years Eve). You may want to think about this yourself if it hots up a bit where you are...<br><br>The other reason is that I'm aiming for a complete canopy of fruit trees. There is a lot of wildlife here who are all too happy to eat the nutrient rich produce. The wildlife will find an enclosed canopy confusing.<br><br>Also importing organic material is non negotiable if you are either starting or sending produce off site. <br><br>The reason this never occured in the past was that when produce left a farm, other produce would also be brought in. Also nothing organic would leave the farm. For example: you may produce a certain crop, but would have to buy in other organic products such as food for yourself or your animals. With no sewer or garbage collection to take waste elsewhere (like where I live), it all ends up in the soil.<br><br>Unless the nutrient flows are balanced and the top soil is improved you cannot farm long term. To do otherwise is strip mining.<br><br>Hey Rhisiart,<br><br>You can build a "snug" on a slightly larger scale. The house I'm building is small, but super insulated. The walls, roof, floor, and windows are all heavily insulated. It really reduces the flow of heat into and out of the house which is excellent for the climate I'm in. <br><br>I also had to build with bushfires in mind and reducing the flow of energy into the house is a very real concern. Have a look at the photo's in the paper from the recent fires in Perth and you'll get an idea of what it has to withstand.<br><br>There wouldn't be too many houses in the world that incorporate all of the strange things that I've had to build into it. Not to mention that I'm building it myself too - not contracting it out to others. <br><br>The great thing though, is that it requires very little energy to run on a day to day basis. Much like a snug! It is possible if it's designed an built correctly unlike most McMansions...<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c7829476102991090790 title="comment permalink">2/10/11, 11:21 PM</a><br><br>

In response to the oil shocks the government took measures such as super-insulating buildings, builing cycle lanes everywhere (and giving cyclists priority over car drivers at lights), putting in a huge district energy heating system and investing heavily in wind turbine technology. They even banned driving cars at weekends and nobody grumbled (imagine that!)<br><br>One island, Samsø, had even gone 'carbon negative' i.e. they export more energy than they use. How did the man who organised this massive project get people to participate? Simple, he offered them free beer. I guess you would call his approach pragmatic. <br><br>Americans (well, okay, everyone) who comes to live here are staggered to find out that you have to pay a 200% tax on cars - but the end result is clean air, no congestion and about 50% of city journeys made by bike.<br><br>Of course, Denmark is far from perfect (people generate more trash than any other European country) but the government has always been 'for the people' and is never riven by infighting when there is some kind of national threat, such as that posed by peak oil.<br><br>Saying that, after 30 years of holding out, I'd say that around 2001 (when a right wing government was shock elected as a direct result of 9/11) the country has been trying to make up for time lost in terms of abandoning its sense. Huge fancy buildings have gone up everywhere and, in the case of the Copenhagen Opera House, the owners are finding them too expensive to run as heating and other maintenence costs have escalated.<br><br>The Danes are probably more prepared than most for peak oil, but saying that, it might all count for nothing is this (low lying, flat) country is under water!<br><br><a href=#c5367697717859521624 title="comment permalink">2/11/11, 12:24 AM</a><br><br>

That is something to look more deeply into now. Perhaps laying an interior of pave stones insulated with dried mud would be a good foundation and use geothermal piping for heat?<br><br>Greg- Your math proves my point, the ratio of surface area to volume is inverse, and the larger the volume has less surface area. Although heat is lost from the surface one has to also take into consideration all the area inside the structure that is not exposed to the elements. I have lived in an apartment complex using electric heat and a countryside home using firewood. In the apartment complex it was always warm during the winter even when the heat was off. In the countryside home I can't say the same. Therefore, the larger complex might use more heat than a home overall, but it retained the heat very well and proportionately per person it used less energy for heating.<br><br><a href=#c6084838659156067369 title="comment permalink">2/11/11, 5:54 AM</a><br><br>

The reason for this is simple -- they will renew on the human timescale. Not necessarily a single lifetime (although you can get a pretty mature forest in good climates in 80 years), but within the timescales of human civilization. Old growth forests are typically on the order of 500 years old (natural disturbance cycles), the occasional multi-millennial stands being lucky outliers. Topsoil develops on a similar time scale, perhaps more like a few thousand years in particularly difficult situations. And though you cannot restore original soils or forests in your lifetime, you can grow wood, and you can grow soil, on a limited scale, with careful management. The real fossil resources take millions of years to replenish, far far longer than the time our species has been on earth, vastly greater than the lifespan of any human civilization. When they are gone they are flat gone, period, effectively forever. <br><br>Rsuusa -- I live in a 125 year old house in Tennessee. Weatherizing is a very long-term incremental project. I'm sure JMG will get in to this in great depth! An advantage of older houses is that they are usually built in such a way that they can be taken apart ant put back together without destroying their structural, architectural, and historic integrity. Anything that is broken or rotten can be replacedl; walls can be disassempled to put in insulation and then reassembled, etc. DON'T make the big mistake of replacing fixable older technologies (like clapboard siding, plaster, etc.) with disposable "modern" materials (like vinyl siding, drywall, etc.). Spruce up the old stuff and it'll last another 200 years, long after the vinyl siding and drywall are in the dump with no replacements available. <br><br>It's also good to focus on critical rooms and make them heatable, letting the rest of the house stay chilly until you can get to it. A house with a couple of 70 degree rooms surrounded by 45 degree rooms is a lot more comfortable to live in than a house that is 60 degrees in every room!<br><br><a href=#c960056631734408906 title="comment permalink">2/11/11, 6:22 AM</a><br><br>

Why would I want to savage half to death something that I admire and respect, and which does fine if I just bring it tribute, and otherwise leave it in peace? Masanobu Fukuoka rules, OK!).<br><br>The comfrey -- Lawrence Hills' famous 'Bocking 14' variety if you can get it, but any is good -- is planted out in odd holes-and-corners near to my beds, on land which I don't control formally, but which no-one uses, so no-one cares about. There's also lots more growing wild nearabouts here.<br><br>Any other waste hay, straw, leaves, manure, humanure, etc. that comes available goes onto the beds also as deep mulch/soil-creature-feasts, pretty well at any time of the year that it can be had. It will all rot down into the soil over time, and feed it.

I've never approached some of the Victorian specialist growers' achievements of over a hundred tons/acre/year of green foliage. But certainly there's always lots to feed and mulch the beds.<br><br>Incidentally, one drawback with truck-tyre-stacks for raised beds is that they can become rat-cities, in the lower reaches of the soil. Your have to think how you're going to approach that complication. I usually manage to get them to opt to leave, without persecuting them.

First, in the present case, the lotto winner in this case has already exceeded his means, and second, he has passed the point where he can ratchet down fast enough without going broke. <br><br>Chris, I should have said "when it breaks down." As long as it works, you might as well use the thing. <br><br>Jason, smaller countries have certain advantages in dealing with the mess we're facing. Sea level rise is another matter, of course; I wonder if it's time to start thinking about communities on pontoons? <br><br>Divelly, or the row houses in towns, which save even more energy by having two sides the cold air can't get to!

As our energy supplies begin to dwindle, I suspect we'll begin to figure out that a lot of the ideas we've inherited from the pre-oil world are a lot smarter than we thought...<br><br>JP, we're not that far from peak fissionable uranium, and you need to factor in the huge energy inputs nuclear power receives from fossil fuels -- mining, refining, and transporting the fuel, building and maintaining the reactor and the rest of the power plant, dealing with the spent fuel rods, and decommissioning the plant all involve a great deal of fossil fuel, and as that goes up in price, nuclear power is going to become increasingly unaffordable. <br><br>Rhisiart, we've got comfrey growing in our backyard garden -- that plus composted kitchen waste and yard waste, plus humanure once the composting toilets go in, ought to keep our intensive garden in very good shape!<br><br>Tom, that sounds like a good argument for matte solar panels!<br><br>Bobby, thanks for the link!

If anybody is doing so, I'd suggest that they go sit down with a copy of Darwin and read it until they grasp the fact that phrases like "evolutionary imperative" are simply handwaving. Evolution has no imperatives, destinies, or any such hogwash; it's simply a process by which living things adapt to their environments. <br><br>About three hundred years ago, in the process of adapting to its environment, our species stumbled across a way to vastly increase the energy available to it by raiding a fraction of the Earth's fossil carbon. That turned out to be a dead end, and the adaptations that grew up around it (broadly speaking, the human ecology of industrialism) don't have much shelf life left; as they break down, the human population is going to contract quite a bit. <br><br>Different versions of this same process have happened to many other organisms over Earth's evolutionary history, and they'll doubtless happen many times in the future as well. It's simply one of the things that happens over the course of evolution. My guess is that our species will come through the crisis, though with sharply reduced numbers, and the Earth has shrugged off cataclysms far more drastic than anything we can throw at her; she'll be fine long after we're part of the fossil record. <br><br>Bill, understood!

Our group flying to Egypt from Washington DC flies about 5800 miles non-stop, or about 11,600 miles return (Google Earth). The aircraft would then use about 58,000 gallons or 217,000 litres.<br><br>Now consider the Great Pyramid of Giza.<br><br>Possibly the largest component of the energy budget is the energy embodied in lifting stones from the base level up to their position in the pyramid. The pyramid is about 147 metres high with a square base of 231 metres. Each step (ie layer of stone) is about 1 metre high. So consider each layer in turn. At the top is one block about 1 metre square and 1 metre high. The stone has a density of about 2.5 so the block weighs about 2.5 tonnes. The amount of energy required to lift the stone from the surrounding plain is given by the formula<br><br>Energy (Joules) = mass (kilogram) x height(Metres) x g(accelaration due to gravity)<br><br>In this case it is 2500 x 147 x 10 = 3,675,000 Joules<br><br>The amount of energy in 1 litre of fuel is about 36,000,000 Joules (36 Mega Joules) which means that it would require 0.1 Litre of fuel to lift the stone from the base up to the top.<br><br>The next layer will be slightly larger but only 146 metres above the ground. etc Using a spreadsheet it is easy to calculate that the total energy embodied in lifting the stones from ground level is about 56,000 litres or about 14,900 US gallons. That is the energy embodied in the pyramid itself is about 25% of the single tourist flight. Of course more energy would be required to cut and shape the stone and transport the stone from the nearby quarries, although this could have been quite efficient using technology known at the time. <br><br>Thus it is quite easy to imagine that the total energy expended in building the Great Pyramid of Giza is less than the fuel used by a single tourist flight from the US.<br><br><a href=#c2489054712287738122 title="comment permalink">2/12/11, 12:51 AM</a><br><br>

Human beings like to believe they are in control of their destiny, but when the history of life on Earth is seen in perspective, the evolution of Homo sapiens is merely a transient episode that acts to redress the planet's energy balance."<br><br>He asserts that the species will not long outlast the use of fossil fuels. Price puts it this way,"If organic energy is sequestered in substantial reserves, as geological processes are bound to do, then the appearance of a species that can release it is all but assured. Such a species, evolved in the service of entropy ,quickly returns its planet to a lower energy level, in an evolutionary instant, it explodes and is gone."<br><br>He brings up many good points in the paper but it's a little over the top to wipe the species out over depletion. We'll continue in the service of entropy for quite some time methinks.<br><br>JMG, Catton, in "Overshoot" uses the comparison between the amount of energy released in the few minutes of the Saturn V's three stages and the building of the Great Pyramid at Cheops as an example of the illusion of limitlessness.

The streets look like Miami; too many grey-heads in too-white clothes; lots of grandmas pushing walkers, but few moms pushing strollers.<br><br>Portland tends to sprout localizing intiatives here and there, and I have to hope that some residents there feel better about themselves because of them. <br><br>As for "speed of crash" I get that much of the suddenness feared is apocalyptic residue in the cultural brainpan.

I also want to accomplish those two things without herculean efforts.<br><br>I live in a cool/cold temperate climate. My frost free growing season is only about 100 days. Peak temps during the summer occasionally climb into the 90s F, but not that often. I have never lived in a mediterranean, arid, desert, or tropical locale so the system I describe may have useful components, but lifting it wholesale into another climate is ill advised.<br><br>Before the days of inexpensive electric water pumps and city water utilities i.e. easy hose irrigation at virtually every house, home gardens spaced their plants more widely than is now recommended by most growers. There are two major advantages to this style of gardening. One is moisture availability. Contrary to popular opinion, the vast majority of moisture lost from the earth occurs via transpiration, not evaporation from a bare soil surface. This is even more the case if a thin layer of dust mulch is maintained with a light hoeing between rain events. By spacing plants widely to very widely dry spells don't pose much of a threat to the productivity of the garden even if the gardener is away for a few days. The capillarity of the soil keeps the plants in moisture for a good while. The fact that this type of management works well in a garden with wind breaks does NOT mean it translates appropriately to farm scale growing. The dust bowl of the 30s in the USA is a perfect example of people trying to give their crops moisture in exactly this way.<br><br>The other advantage of wide plant spacing has to do with plant nutrient uptake. Roots only absorb nutrients from very close to the tip, and the tips are always growing out. For plants to reach full potential they must not encounter much competition from other roots. They need to be able to expand until the near the day of harvest. It is possible to overcome the physiology of plants by providing super fertile soil and then a slightly stunted root system can take up the required nutrients for good growth. It is my belief though that it's better to provide both fertility and the space for full expression of genetic potential.<br><br>Continued -<br><br><a href=#c4996839533877165386 title="comment permalink">2/12/11, 9:05 AM</a><br><br>

I don't think it's possible to have a zero in-put garden. Veg crops are tender things that perform well in concert with human help. Even if every scrap of vegetation grown and all the humanure of the eaters goes back into the garden one still comes up with an organic matter deficit. Remember that dust mulch thing I just mentioned? It only works if there is sufficient organic matter in the soil to maintain tilth and prevent a hardpan layer from forming on the soil between veg plants. One must have an organic matter factory adjacent to the garden beds (comfrey or some other supremely productive plant), or an exogenous source like spent brewer's malt, town leaves, or large animal manure.<br><br>Fertility and organic matter are not synonomous. Howard, Rodale et al. did us a great service pointing out the short comings of industrial agriculture. However it is naive to believe that one has truly fertile soil simply by dumping giant loads of orgainc material onto a garden bed. Say you have a town leaf dump that provides all the rich dark compost you can possibly use. If you live in the eastern USA chances are better than not that rich dark compost does not have the proper balance of minerals to grow the most nutrient dense crops. The only way I know to ascertain whether one has really good dirt is to take a soil sample to a lab. In the eastern USA usually calcium is deficient as well as a number of trace elements. If one relies on local organic matter to supply trace elements those nutrients better be present in the local soils...<br><br>Finally, yes, it is in fact possible to have too much organic matter in a soil. Often a bed with too much organic matter will grow gorgeous flowers and lush veg plants. But a lush veg plant doesn't necessarily have the most bang for its buck, so to speak. As the great soil scientist William Albrecht routinely hammered home, quantity does not equal quality. As far as growing and maintaining a body is concerned.<br><br><a href=#c5389948983355413145 title="comment permalink">2/12/11, 9:06 AM</a><br><br>

It saddens me to think most of my country (The Netherlands) is running on energy funds even though we are made to believe they are endless flows. <br><br>In recent times, we have been given the technology to drill for natural gas in places we couldn't before, because it was not cost effective to do so. Environmentalists have been trying to warn our government about the implications for what little nature we have left, but any argument is discarded as ramblings of the "left-wing church". It will not be so bad, it will not be a problem, they keep telling us. They allow the drilling, they gradually increase maximum speed on our highways, they are preparing to build a new nuclear power plant, and so on. On the mainland, we have no nature except for the small patches of land we allow to remain, crammed in between highways, cities and industrial zones. And even those are under threat. If it hadn't been for the foresight of our founding father Willem van Oranje not allowing for certain patches of land to ever be sold, we would be in even worse shape today.<br><br>I am reminded of the answer given by a passer-by when asked by a reporter which he would prefer with regard to climate change:<br>a) a warmer climate and in a few generations we will all drown (we live below sea level), or<br>b) taking our consumerism back a few notches, and having a healthy environment.<br>His answer was "a", and with a smile he added, "I don't have any kids anyway." <br><br>I loved your post, JMG, and will definitely keep following your blog.

The reasons for this have not a dang thing to to with ecological upheavals. They have to do with two much more mundane reasons: hummingbird feeders and increasing observer awareness. A few western hummers have always been found on the gulf coast in winter ("always" meaning for as long as there have been birdwatchers looking for them). These birds are nearly always young-of-the-year birds in drab immature plumage which are not especially easy to identify and can easily be lost in the throngs of young Ruby-throated hummers (the only common eastern species) in the fall. What people farther north have figured out is that if you leave your hummingbird feeders up into the late fall and winter, after all the Ruby-throats have departed for tropical climes the lost western individuals stick around, gravitate to the feeders, and hence are much easier to spot. People have also learned a great deal more about how to actually identify these little buggers. Hence the explosion in records. 30 years ago these birds would have all starved to death after the hard freezes eliminated their natural food sources and caused the feeder watchers to take their hummingbird feeders indoors for the winter. They would never have been found, nor their whereabouts publicized on the (essentially non-existent) internet.<br><br>Anna's Hummingbird in particular has been expanding its range in the southwest, especially in to desert areas that once were the provence of the Costa's Hummingbird. Ecological upheaval? Yes, but not the sort you might envision. It's because of suburban expansion in the deserts with their associated irrigated plantings and their year-round hummingbird feeders. <br><br>Bird ranges are currently expanding and contracting to the north, south, east, and west, depending on the species. The big human effects on this are habitat change, human provided food sources (grain silos, feedlots, garbage dumps, bird feeders, etc.) and exotic species introductions. If there is a climate change signal yet, it is still much smaller. This is nothing new; it began when the first humans on this continent started setting fires to improve the habitat for desirable game animals thousands of years ago; it accelerated dramatically when the europeans and steel tools arrived many centuries ago. <br><br>No single incident is a meaningful sign of ANYTHING if you don't understand its context. That's just sound-bite hyperbole. You picked the wrong person to try to "wow" with a single out of range bird (follow my profile to get to my blog)!<br><br>Interesting biological note -- in fall migration there are always significant number of western birds that wind up in the east and eastern birds in the west; there are also smaller numbers of southern birds that wind up in the north. These provide vast amounts of excitement for birders; it's one of the things we look for in the fall. Research suggests that some of these are individuals that have inborn defects in their navigational systems and thus fly the wrong direction come migration time. Most of the time this takes them out of the gene pool, but occasionally it allows them to disperse into new areas and adapt to changes in the landscape.<br><br><a href=#c8548916341745640851 title="comment permalink">2/15/11, 7:13 AM</a><br><br>

Newfoundland is actually a famous trap for avian vagrants. As the easternmost large landmass of the continent, it is a funnel that collects those western wanderers heading east, as well as a first touchdown spot for european birds that have gotten off course and headed west across the Atlantic. So that wrong-way hummingbird is probably more likely to settle down there than in places closer to its "normal" range -- and perhaps cross paths with a european Common Swift when it gets there.

The fundamental one is still that people don't see the energy in what they do... Very interestingly... that also applies to the scientists who are paid to measure the energy consumed by things. About 80% of individual energy uses behind business products are naturally untraceable, using any method we could devise. Essentially supply chains have information barriers that create untraceable regions, you might consider as pockets of "dark energy". Discovering why results in an easy way anyone can estimate the true scale of energy use for most things. <br><br>The world economy’s annual consumption of fuels is used to produce annual GDP. That ratio will give you the world's average energy/$ = ~8000btu (1). What you get when is very different when you trace individual energy uses, using LCA or other professional methods. Tracing energy costs going into a dollar of wind power, for example, will only identify ~160btu!! The reason would make the discrepancy similar for other things too.<br><br>The largest hidden energy use is the "consumption for production" used in the services that businesses employ that don't leave energy receipts for their work to be traced. So you just can't trace them. <br><br>For example if you counted the energy costs of slaves carting the stones up the pyramid as technology you'd have receipts for all their housing and food costs, and so you could add those energy costs to the total energy budget. That’s how LCA works for technology too. If the slaves were paid to provide their own housing and food etc, there would be no receipts to count! Then that would get left out of the energy budget for the overseer (and LCA), but not out of the environmental energy costs for the pyramid. See what I'm getting at??<br><br>I bet you if you check your calc. for the energy to build pyramids it includes only the potential energy for lifting stone in the air and does not count the costs for supporting the slaves and other operations. That would be treating them as all self-employed and make their energy costs seem to disappear, just by not telling you what they spent their earnings on... <br><br>simple examples<br>1. http://www.synapse9.com/design/dollarshadow.htm<br>hard detailed example <br>2. http://www.synapse9.com/pub/SEA_EROIwind.pdf<br><br><a href=#c3171424917335644406 title="comment permalink">2/24/11, 5:46 PM</a><br><br>
