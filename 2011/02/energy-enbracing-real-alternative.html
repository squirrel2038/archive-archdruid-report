Maybe it’s just me, but it seems as though the pace of events has picked up significantly over the last few weeks. As I write these words, Libya is apparently poised on the brink of civil war, several other nations in the Middle East are facing mass uprisings, and the price of oil has soared to levels stratospheric enough that the global economy is gasping for breath – US$112 a barrel for benchmark Brent crude. For those who are keeping track, this is right around ten times what the same barrel would have brought in 1998, when today’s peak oil scene began to shake itself out of its post-Seventies hibernation.<br><br>Exactly where things will go from here is anybody’s guess, but the mostly US-backed dictatorships that have kept much of the Arab world locked in a state of sullen passivity while our SUVs burn their oil are clearly nothing like as stable as they once seemed. Soaring food and commodities prices, along with the impact of a global depression that has ended only in the imaginations of the Obama administration’s spin doctors, have shortened the fuse of popular discontent over large parts of the nonindustrial world. Those people in the industrial nations who have convinced themselves that the natural resources that support their lifestyle are conjured into being in corporate boardrooms are beginning to have to come to terms with their actual dependence on corners of the world where the comforts they take for granted are nowhere to be found.<br><br>It will be interesting to see what happens if the current round of crises turns into a full-blown energy crisis, as it well might, with oil prices spiking up past $200 or $300 a barrel, say, and the cost of gasoline and diesel fuel following the same upward trajectory until demand destruction puts a ceiling on them. No doubt there will be any number of attempts to blame it all on the oil companies, or the Arabs, or the Obama administration, or perhaps David Ickes’ imaginary space lizards; no doubt there will be at least as many proposals to rush another round of stimulus money the US government doesn’t have from the Fed’s already overworked printing presses and pour it into fusion power, cellulosic ethanol, and an assortment of other high-tech ratholes; no doubt there will be plenty of people insisting that we’d have all the energy we need if we just put the same amount of freshly printed money down some other set of ratholes. What interests me, though, is whether there will be any amount of attention, or even lip service, paid to the real alternative to petroleum.<br><br>There is one, you know. People in the contemporary industrial world rarely think about it, because our civilization is so obsessed with delusions of limitlessness that the only alternative to unlimited fossil fuels most of us can imagine is some other energy source that’s as least as abundant, convenient, and concentrated. The fact that no other energy source fits these specifications simply adds pathos to the fantasy, and motivates the sort of breezy optimism that insists that there must be some vast new source of energy waiting to be found because, basically, we want one, and will whine incessantly until we get it. Beyond the daydreams of cellulosic ethanol, algal biodiesel, and all the other attempts to insist that we can replace the value produced free of charge by half a billion years of prehistoric sunlight and geological heat and pressure with our own supposedly limitless cleverness, though, there’s a simple and relatively straightforward alternative waiting to take up the slack as petroleum goes from cheap and abundant to expensive and not nearly abundant enough.<br><br>What’s the alternative? Using a lot less energy.<br><br>The average American, it bears repeating, uses something like three times as much energy each year as the average European, to support a standard of living that by most of the usual measures isn’t nearly as high. Some of that extravagance is hardwired into the built environment of American society on a scale that individuals can’t readily change, but this is far from true of all; quite a bit is held in place by nothing more than habit and fashion, and can be changed readily, while a good deal more is built into our physical surroundings on a scale that can be changed by individual action.<br><br>It’s this latter dimension that I want to continue to address this week. Unless you live in New England, or one of a few other regions where oil-burning furnaces are still a common source of domestic heat, decreasing the amount of energy you use to heat your home won’t directly affect how well you’ll be able to weather a new oil spike. Indirectly, of course, anything that decreases the amount you have to pay out for one kind of energy will free up money for other uses; furthermore, as the price of petroleum continues to rise relative to natural gas, coal, and other energy sources, it’s a safe bet that other fuels will be used to substitute for petroleum in one way or another – there are already plenty of cars and buses that burn compressed natural gas, for example, and electric cars (running, of course, on electricity that’s mostly produced by burning natural gas or coal) are also beginning to hit the market.<br><br>Factor these conversions into the likely future price of natural gas and coal- or natural gas-fired electricity, and a petroleum price spike risks setting off a broader energy crisis, just as it did in the 1970s. The cost of home heating is as vulnerable to this knock-on effect as any other kind of energy use, and being able to make a given amount of heat go further becomes a crucial strategy.<br><br>With this in mind, it’s time to talk about insulation.<br><br>Most American homes leak heat like sieves. Part of that, as discussed last week, is a function of the fact that most American homes leak air like sieves, and as cold air leaks into your house and warm air leaks out of it, a portion of your heat bill goes for warming the great outdoors by some tiny fraction of a degree. Part of it, though, is a function of the fact that the ceilings, walls, and floors of most American homes offer inadequate resistance to the flow of heat. Put your hand flat against the inner surface of one of your home’s exterior walls some cold winter night; if the wall feels colder than the inside air – and in a lot of American homes these days, it will – you’re feeling the result of low resistance to heat flow.<br><br>Resistance to heat flow is measured by what, usefully enough, are called R-values. Every material has its own R-value, and the R-value of most construction materials isn’t very high – a half-inch thick sheet of plywood, for example, has an R-value around 0.62, which is actually less than the R-value of the thin layer of air that clings to the inside surface of each wall of your house. A wall of standard frame construction, without insulation, has an R-value averaging around 4.25. Insulate the same wall with a roll of standard glass-fiber insulation, and its R-value goes up to an average around 12.75, which means that heat takes three times as long to flow through it.<br><br>Putting insulation inside a wall can be a complicated operation if the wall is already built, though, and I’ve heard very mixed reports on the kinds of insulation that are pumped into an already-built wall through holes drilled for the purpose. Since this blog is focusing on retrofitting and other measures on a budget, you’ll want to consider this only if you’re already planning on ripping out the drywall or replacing the siding – there are rigid board insulation products you can put on the outside of your house, between the old sheathing and the new siding, with good results. You can also borrow a trick from the Middle Ages and use fabric hangings of various kinds to insulate your walls; we’ll discuss those in more detail next week.<br><br>If you don’t have major domestic surgery or fabric hangings in mind, though, your best options lie elsewhere. The first is right above your head. Heat rises, of course, and so most houses lose a great deal of heat through the ceiling and roof; walk around the neighborhood on a day after there’s been light snow, an inch or so, and you can often see a dramatic difference between the parts of roofs that have heated space beneath them and the parts that don’t, evidence of the amount of heat rising up into the atmosphere. In most cases, the best place to put your insulation is right above the ceiling of your upper floor (if you have more than one), working from the attic, and you want a lot of it – an R-value of 60 is not excessive in a cold climate. The reason you want to have the insulation just above the ceiling is threefold. First, since heat rises, you want as much as possible of it to stop rising while it’s still in your living space, rather than warming the cobwebs in the attic; second, your attic can then be vented, and if you live in a snowy area this will keep the roof cold and prevent the freeze-thaw cycles that generate ice dams along the eaves and potential repair bills in three or four figures; third, if you live in an area with hot summers, a vented attic and good insulation means that the solar heat that builds up under your roof can be vented out into the outside, while the insulation keeps it from trickling down and making your living space miserable in August.<br><br>If you have an unheated air space underneath the first floor, whether it’s a basement or a crawlspace, that’s another good area to insulate. Here your insulation should go right up under the floor, and you normally do this from underneath. Insulation with an R-factor of 19 or so is usually enough to keep the cold from creeping in. In most cases, if you caulk, weatherstrip, and insulate above the ceiling and under the floor, you’ll cut your annual heating bills by up to half, using your own unskilled labor and supplies your local hardware store will be happy to sell you. The one further step to add to the package is insulated window coverings, which we’ll be discussing next week – they provide a huge gain, since your ordinary single-pane window has an R-value around 1, but they’re complex enough to require a post of their own.<br><br>There’s a complicating factor with insulation, though, and that’s the effect of water vapor. The amount of water vapor that can be carried by a given amount of air depends on the temperature of the air, and as the temperature drops, the vapor turns back into liquid water and condenses onto any available surface. That’s where the drops on the outside of a bottle of cold beer come from – the air close to the bottle becomes chilled, and the water vapor contained in the air condenses out onto the glass. When it’s cold outside and warm indoors, you get a similar temperature drop in the middle of an insulated wall, and any water vapor that’s present will condense out onto your insulation. Water conducts heat much better than insulation does, so that condensed water causes a sharp decrease in the R-value of your insulation, and it can also lead to problems with mildew and dry rot in extreme cases.<br><br>You prevent this with vapor barriers. The standard vapor barrier these days, I’m sorry to say, is plastic sheeting, which is waterproof, moldproof, airtight, and cheap; finding a way to make something comparable from renewable materials would be a very worthwhile project. In the meantime, though, you need a vapor barrier if you’re going to insulate, and that means plastic sheeting, well overlapped and taped with duct tape. A crucial point you need to remember is that the vapor barrier always goes on the side of the insulation that’s going to be warmer – in other words, when you’re insulating the ceiling from the attic side, or the floor from the basement or crawlspace, the barrier goes in first and the insulation afterwards, but if you’ve torn out some drywall and are installing insulation, the insulation goes in first and the vapor barrier goes on over it, right beneath the new drywall.<br><br>Here again, if you have the money to spend, you can insulate the living bejesus out of a house and get it to the point that body heat, cooking, and a bit of additional boost on really cold days will take care of your heating needs. The Passive House system mentioned in last week’s post uses this as one of its ingredients, and it’s certainly an option, but it’s going to set you back a chunk of change. Those who don’t have that kind of money to spare – and they will likely be the very large minority over the decades to come – can still keep themselves, their families, and anybody willing to learn from them comfortably warm in winter on much less energy by using the simpler methods discussed here. Further on down the curve of the Long Descent, as current housing stock wears out, other techniques will need to evolve; with any luck, enough knowledge of how insulation works can be passed on through the upcoming crises to make that process easier than it would otherwise be.<br><br>It’s probably necessary to reiterate here that insulating your home is not going to save the world. For that matter, insulating all the homes in America won’t save the world, and that probably can’t be managed at this point anyway, if only because most Americans have gotten so tipsy on the fantasy of infinite energy that only a fairly modest fraction of the population is likely to be willing to put in the modest amount of labor and money needed to do the thing. Still, as I’ve suggested tolerably often in these posts, we are long past the point where any sort of grand organized project to stave off the Long Descent could still be carried out with any hope of success, even if the resource surplus still existed and the political will could be mustered. The window has closed, the surpluses are gone, and the political will to accomplish much of anything but handwaving and hunting for scapegoats went AWOL a long time ago; what remains is the hard but potentially rewarding project of adapting to a challenging future, and to that, simple steps such as home insulation have much to offer.<br><br><span style=font-size:130%>Resources</span><br><br>Here again, the best place to start is with the Master Conserver worksheets available online at the <a href=http://www.culturalconservers.org/library.php>Cultural Conservers Foundation</a> website; the papers you want are the ones titled "Home Insulation" and "Reducing Moisture Problems." Beyond that, just about any handbook on home repair and maintenance published in America from the 1960s onwards includes a section on how to install the usual kinds of insulation. Larry Gay’s <i>The Complete Book of Insulating</i> is a good reference for those who want to go the extra step or two.

No such luck, in fact I think many of them leak worse than ever. <br><br>My answer, since we live in a relatively clement part of the world in the winter, is to install a wood stove. DH finally said I could get one if I: had a contractor put in the stove pipe and got it properly permitted/inspected. Well, since I don't plan to cut the hole myself using my neighbor's method -- shooting a rifle through the roof and cutting a hole around the rifle hole, a contractor would be the logical option :)<br><br>As soon as we find out how much pain we'll be experiencing with the IRS I'll know how much I have to spend on a wood stove. I want one of the ones that has the bake oven on the bottom; I only make Naan in the summer but I bake bread weekly in the winter. <br><br>For summer, we're throwbacks. We got an Australian super energy efficient swamp cooler which we turn off faithfully as soon as outside temp equals inside. And I have an outdoor kitchen as well.

Events have indeed been accelerating in the Middle East, to such an extent that even the average dullard can hardly help but notice. Yet too many seem to put it all down to the allegedly liberating effects of Twitter, and too few to notice how the spread of "democracy" - or at any rate of revolution - will affect their lot by way of that region's throttle hold on energy. <br><br>This makes me wish I could build or buy my own place, but like so many I'm stuck with rented digs that scream for the treatment you're proposing but won't profit a landlord to install (why would he spend a dime for me and mine to save on heat?). So it looks like we're stuck with medieval drapes, which I'll be happy to hang if I can just get someone to weave a nice Bayeux pattern - or a couple of hundred square yards of discarded theatre curtains would do nicely.<br><br><a href=#c5336384209738488621 title="comment permalink">2/23/11, 9:28 PM</a><br><br>

I find myself totally agreeing with John Greer instead of my usual “sort of mostly” agreeing with him.<br><br>If there is any area where I might have put a different slant on things it would perhaps be being less dismissive of new/alternative energy sources. Sure, none are likely to replace oil and allow suburban shopping mall, giant SUV based society to continue, but some show promise of helping out enough to considerably soften the Long Descent, and maybe allow future, much more sensible societies to have pleasant lifestyles.<br><br>Of the two John mentioned, cellulosic ethanol has, I think, too many problems competing with food production while algal biodiesel could be useful if it can be gotten working well.<br><br>The Chinese, from what I read, seem to have picked a strategy of burning fossil fuels while they can to try to “crash through” to a technologically advanced economy, then switch to molten salt thorium reactors for base load for the next century or so while they develop whatever else comes up.<br><br>Given that we know thorium reactors work, there is plenty of thorium (for a few centuries) and we know they can be designed to be mass-produced, safe and produce far less radioactive waste, that is possibly the best option – for them. Funny how competent the old Chinese Communist party seems these days, now if only they could develop a relaxed and humorous attitude towards dissidents, at least the more harmless types…<br><br>P.S. There’s been some interesting developments in the “cold fusion” area recently. I use quotes because there is a suspicion what they have is more related to Blacklight Power’s stuff than any kind of fusion. Interesting physics, but I won’t be holding my breath waiting for it to actually do anything useful on an industrial scale.<br><br>That’s the problem with a lot of this stuff, shows promise – for next century.

The knowledge for this is based on my own house which is not connected to the electricity grid. I also wired up the system myself. <br><br>It also has a photo of my place which I built myself which can put me into some context for the readers. <br><br>It's kind of funny, but I insulate for the exact opposite reasons that you people in the US do (especially the Northern states) and that is to keep the heat out. It is also well sealed externally to keep out burning embers from bushfires which take out a lot of houses in my part of the world.<br><br>The house design is based on a late 1800's Australian farm house which were designed and built appropriately for their environment. It's been pretty much downhill in terms of design since then...<br><br>The series of articles may also interest aspiring Green Wizards because it'll end by showing people how to obtain components and wire them up so that you have an emergency power supply. I noticed that over the bushfires in 2009 and the floods this year that most people ran out of petrol (gas) and diesel for their generators which finished off pretty much most things that people take for granted. Hopefully people should get enough knowledge at the end of the series to be able to power a small fridge, lights, phones, radio etc...<br><br>Please drop a comment in to support this side project.

A couple of additions, if I may be permitted:<br>Energy conservation experts will enthusiastically agree with concerns about moisture and vapor; but will quibble "heat rises", arguing that it's warm air that rises; heat radiates in all directions. In a leaky house the movement of warm air up and out, replaced by cold air drawn in at lower levels, is so substantial that it's called the "chimney effect" or "stack effect" - and this means that even before insulating it is critical to find and block all the leaks. An "energy auditor" with a blower door and infra-red camera can document the leaks, and your local fire department (if you're in a small town, and nice) might be willing to bring their IR camera to your house. Without these devices, any fan blowing air into the attic or out some window can be your blower door, and you can walk around with incense or your wet hand to find the drafts. Anyway, air leaking up over the years through wiring chases, chimney chases, ceiling fixtures, etc., will be revealed as a dirty spot on the underside of your attic insulation. Use spray foam, but if a light fixture is likely to be hot (e.g. recessed light) then surround it with a big home-made metal can or box so there's good air space between the fixture and the insulation. I stopped up my chimney chase with rock wool which is dense and non-flammable.<br>The experts around here in VT and NH don't like fiberglass, as it is often quite a bit less effective than the R-value indicates for a number of reasons; we are mostly using cellulose, blown in. In a Boston area house with asbestos siding (since removed) the insulation company drilled 3" holes in the plaster walls and blew it in from indoors, patching the plaster holes expertly so they don't show under paint, in one 8-hour shift. Another point about attics is that in a frame house the joists (the 2x8's or other that hold up the ceiling) are like a radiator, very low R-value, "bridging" past the insulation and making the ceiling cold in winter and hot in summer despite insulation. When I worked for a large corporation (“I've Been Moved”) years ago I had a great surplus of moving cartons and stored them in the attic, in multiple layers. They were strong enough to crawl around on and store stuff on, and did a great job adding to the insulation. Cold ceilings, walls and windows will make you feel colder than the air temperature would indicate because your body radiates heat toward those surfaces, so in addition to losing heat to the outdoors you have to make your house warmer to feel comfortable. <br>Finally, some books I like are the "Builder's Guide to ___ Climates" series by Joseph Lstiburek (Building Science Press) and "Insulate and Weatherize" from Taunton Press. Read at least 3 books in their entirety. And I think Greer's theme over the last few months is most important - we are now entering a period during which what we learn about all kinds of practical matters is going to affect our future lives. Build soil and skills, make your community a resource (by being a mutually contributing part), buy tools. Make yourself a scientist, and engineer, a farmer, a fit laborer. Those investments will pay off. Once, in the Navy, our Captain told us that we "didn't have to know the entire operations order [book], but we had to know everything that we needed to know". Great line. If you’re 71 like me, do this work for the future – it creates optimism out of thin air.<br><br><a href=#c2694901816257038540 title="comment permalink">2/24/11, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>

I'll pass on my personal experience with insulating two old buildings this past year for anyone interested.<br> The first building is a bunkhouse which had no insulation. I removed the old wood siding and added fiberglass into the walls then put up the styrofoam wall board and new siding. I then took down the dry wall on the inside and put in radiant barrier foil/bubble/foil insulation and then put in new drywall. Heating this building went from $200-$250 per month previously to $75-$100 per month this winter.<br> The second building is my old farmhouse. Because of the cost/effort of getting fiberglass insulation and wall board up, I went with the blow-in insulation for the walls and also the attic. I heat the house with a wood stove. Previous winters I've used 7-8 cords of wood per winter. So far this year I used 3.5 cords. I'll probably end up using around 4.5 cords by May.<br> Based on my experience this past year, I'd strongly recommend to anyone to add vaporbarrier/fiberglass/wallboard combination if you can, but even if all you can do is the blow-in stuff, go for it-it'll still help.<br><br><a href=#c3579998931167327362 title="comment permalink">2/24/11, 9:26 AM</a><br><br>

If fiberglass is not installed in near-perfect conditions, its performance will be far less than advertised. Perfect conditions means a cavity which is sealed from any exterior air flow. This can be achieved in the lab, and in a very well constructed new house, but for those of us with old houses, the performance of fiberglass batts or roll is very poor. Dense blown-in cellulose will work better in old construction. Even better is foam (either board or sprayed,) which thoroughly seals. Do some careful research on this before spending money on something that works poorly. You only get one chance to do it right.<br>(Right now I'm sitting in a room of a 105yo house, insulated with 4" of foam board. It's 5 below outside, and the room is comfortably heated with the heat from my body and the computer.)<br><br><a href=#c1753122569500839895 title="comment permalink">2/24/11, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, if you can get insulation board (or any other useful thing) free or cheap used, that's the thing to do. <br><br>Sage, an airtight envelope around the outside of your house means that you fight constant problems with water vapor, and an airtight envelope at any point means that you're facing severe problems with indoor air quality. You can remediate both of those, in most cases, but it costs energy and requires technology that may not be around indefinitely -- and if you don't manage it, your house quickly becomes unlivable due to sick building syndrome or mold. (I got to see several very expensive houses in the Seattle area torn down to the ground because of toxic mold -- they were too well sealed, and vapor problems turned the inside of the walls into mold colonies.)

I fully admit to being in my element with a garden hoe in one hand, and a chicken in the other, but I am a green horn to the nth degree when it comes to major home improvements. I love how the projects you are describing can be undertaken by anyone, and you certainly don’t need a general contractor’s license to obtain results. As things come crashing down around us, this is the one area where I knew I needed to invest more time and energy, but the projects I have seen described up until now are more complex and thus I just didn’t know where to start. Now that I have a point of embarkation however, the ball is definitely rolling and gaining momentum. <br><br>Last weekend I went out and purchased a contractor’s pack of indoor/outdoor caulk and a complete set of gasket covers for all of my outlets and went to town. I was amazed at how cold to the touch most of the electrical outlets were, but with the addition of the gasket covers, I am happy to report that all are now at room temperature. I sealed up every crack and crevice that I could find around the house, and after this week’s post, I will be spending this weekend in the basement seeing what I can seal up down there as well. <br><br>I am also happy to report that the large bow window at the front of our house that was causing me so much grief was caulked as well, and as of Tuesday night the condensation that had been forming on it previously disappeared! This evening I girded my loins, lit a stick of incense, and went in to see if the smoke would beacon forth towards the panes as it did before I applied the caulk, but much to my delight the smoke rose to the ceiling! It seems as though the leak is sealed! <br><br>I think our attic is fairly well insulated and ventilated, but the walls are a much different story. I don’t have the funds to tear down and rebuild them with insulation at this point, so I will be eagerly awaiting next week’s discussion of tapestry coverings. <br><br>I also love that, like all of the gardening and various food projects that my wife and I have undertaken, these projects are simple enough for us to easily teach others who wish to learn. We are currently in the process of planning Earth Day activities at the school where I teach for the community-at-large, and aside from the lessons on gardening that I usually give from our school vegetable garden that we have discussed previously on another forum; I think I might add a discussion on simple home energy efficiency improvements of the type we are discussing here. As you know, I work with special needs students, many of whom live in families that are at or below the poverty line, and I think that spreading this information to them would be of great value. They are always willing to listen and learn, and I don’t know how many small vegetable plots exist in Baltimore City at this moment that are indirectly linked to the work you have done on this blog.<br><br>The energy improvements are just another piece of the puzzle, and I hope to disseminate this wisdom as well. While the old saying, “When the going get’s tough, the tough get going,” certainly applies in light of our current predicament, I also think that at the end of the day, it is important to thank those willing to fasten their belts, grip their hats, and press onward. So, thank you! Now...where’s that caulk gun?<br><br><a href=#c8656730952664176857 title="comment permalink">2/24/11, 6:14 PM</a><br><br>

It will be a moldy swamp. And all that moisture removal takes electricity. Humid climates have a tradition of open, airy houses all over the world. Do you think all those many generations of empiricists from many different cultures all happened to arrive at the same wrong answer?<br><br>Priorities, which are about the order in which JMG is presenting them -- air infiltration is the cheapest and easiest. Storm windows and doors are next easiest and next cheapest, but they have to be done right or they help little (aluminum frame prefabs are ugly junk and not very effective). Ceiling and crawlspace/basement insulation come next, and wall insulation is the most difficult and most expensive. <br><br>Another way to inlukate walls from the inside is cabinets and bookcases. Set them a bit away from the wall leaving a clsoed air space (you can even put in rigid board insulation if you like) and they cut down heat flow through the wall quite a bit. Even better if they have doors that close. Just beware of humidity if you are in a damp climate, especially for books. <br><br>Heat flow through a surface is proportional to its area times the temperature differential divided by the R value; Q = A*(T1-T2)/R. So if your uninsulated walls have an R of about 4, and your uninsulated windows have an R of about 1 (both typical values), but the windows cover 20% of the wall surface, then the heat loss through walls versus windows is about the same. <br><br>Also to note -- for older houses, it has been found that tearing out old windows and replacing them with new fancy quintuple pane super ultra low E contraptions (I exaggerate...) not only destroys your house's architectural integrity, it also is neither cost- effective nor energetically effective. It does make a lot of money for the window manufacturers, hence the heavy marketing. You can achieve nearly as much improvement for a fraction of the cost with tightly-fitted custom made wood-frame storm windows. Any garage carpenter who has a router and isn't afraid to use it can tackle this project easily. One thing they don't like to tell you about multiple pane windows is that those narrow gas spaces between the panes do not insulate as well as a wider space would. Up until about 4 inches, the insulating value of an enclosed space increases with its thickness (after that it is wide enough that the convective currents pretty much negate the advantage of additional space). So a single storm window fitted outside an existing single-pane window, with a couple of inches of sealed air space, plus a thorough pass with the caulking gun, will give you better results than a new double pane window.<br><br><a href=#c7442701337825186003 title="comment permalink">2/25/11, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>

Some are rated at around 25 watts, but most are around 50 watts.

They use 11 watts and don't convert nearly as much energy into heat. As you'd expect, they may not fit your halogen electrical fittings. I think the brand is megaman and I have used them - they're widely available. The difference is the light is slightly in the bluer spectrum and they take a little while to warm up (about half a minute or so). Well worth it when you check out your bill though.<br><br>Halogen downlights are a disaster because people used to use only a single incandescent globe to light a room, but they tend to put in multiple downlights and end up using more power than previously!<br><br>Regards.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c3133479360840399246 title="comment permalink">2/25/11, 2:37 PM</a><br><br>

One idea that we incorporated into our house design and can possibly be used for apartments or retrofit is to put storage on the outside walls.

Bookcases with solid backs (that lovely bubble wrap on the back of it?) can help, too, especially in a temporary apartment situation.<br>Adding a lean-to storage room on the outside will save money (over a stand alone bldg)and add some wind and temp moderation, if you need the space anyway.<br>Air lock entries or mudrooms that double as cool storage would help. <br>I can't remember if you have ever talked about windbreaks and planned shade- trees or climbing vines.

Still, it might be worth a look. <br><br>Bill, in my experience new windows can be a good choice or a bad one depending on the house in question. If your existing windows are ill-fitting and leak like anything, as some old (or recently replaced) ones do, a new set of inexpensive double-pane windows well installed and caulked can improve things dramatically -- though anything fancier is a waste of money, granted.

I pointed out that since he had sealed his house up the only way that air could be drawn in for his stove was DOWN our shared chimney. (This emulates a primitive way of venting underground mines - dig 2 shafts and light a fire at the bottom of one. Don't try this at home.)<br><br><a href=#c5215650932624067704 title="comment permalink">2/26/11, 1:52 AM</a><br><br>

One of my additional concerns, and one that gets short shrift in most of the greenie world (including, I'm afraid to say, in these pages), is architectural preservation and the associated issues of aesthetics, design, and integrity. Many retrofits are done with little or no care towards the original aesthetic or functional concept of the house. Much new "greenie" construction ranges from just boring to downright hideous. Every old house is a snapshot of a moment in time and the mind of an individual architect from an earlier era, even the simplest period vernacular house. Unlike modern slapdash crap, these houses were created with a unifying underlying concept for their look, feel, and function. When one is demolished or defaced it is the same as if that were done to a book (every copy of it, as old houses are one-offs), a sculpture, or a painting. Replacing windows is one of the most frequent assaults on old houses, and is more often than not unnecessary to achieve the desired results. <br><br>There's another more material issue with much "upgrade" and "renovation." What happens when these new materials wear out, which they inevitably will? When your modular windows outlive their factory-designed lifespan sometime later in the century, will you be able to repair them? Not bloody likely; almost nothing now is made to be repairable. Will you (or your descendants) be able to buy new ones? Fat chance. Same with things like vinyl/aluminum siding, etc. Wood and glass will be around for a very very long time, and they are extremely repairable and replaceable when they break and wear out. Anyone with basic tools and knowledge can work with them. <br><br>I've said it before: I don't want to live in a future that is ugly, no matter how energy efficient it might be.<br><br><a href=#c3270915614552374535 title="comment permalink">2/26/11, 5:46 AM</a><br><br>

I'm at the end of a long energy line here, and the house is pretty substandard, so it wouldn't surprise me if the quality of the power I receive were iffy. Anyway, I seem to blow a lot of CFs, at least as often as incandescents. I have decided, in fact, to not buy anymore. Just looking at one tells you that there is a lot more embodied energy in a CF, and if you have to replace them as often as before, there goes the energy savings.<br><br>It just struck me after having yet another go out, that this is just another example of trying to solve problems of complexity by adding more complexity.

We're supposed to treat them as toxic wastes when they go out, but in my backwards part of the world, there isn't any household toxic disposal. Anyway, I doubt if a very large fraction of CFs are disposed of properly anywhere. Supposedly, the amount of Hg in one of these is less than you get from burning coal to generate the extra electricity used by the incandescent over the "average" life of the CF, but that sort of falls apart if the CF doesn't last as long as it's supposed to.<br><br>I suppose now the problem will be finding incandescents.<br><br><a href=#c9091912030273677156 title="comment permalink">2/26/11, 7:33 AM</a><br><br>

You omitted the best insulation that is far superior to all others:spray closed cell polyurethane. It is ideal in new construction especially in cold climates like where I live. It is the only one that should be used IMO. It is its own vapor barrier. The colder the climate, the more important the barrier and as a builder I can tell you doing a perfect vapor barrier is very time consuming and difficult to execute reliably. Spray foam can be combined with batt insulation in moderate climates. It is sprayed on the inside of the walls to several inches and then batts are added. You mentioned adding insulated foam board outside the building shell under the siding. That is a relatively easy thing to do. In fact in passivhouses it is commonly done. Some of the readers may not know of heat lost through the house wood studs. A 2x6 wall amay have a theoretical R of 19 with batt insulation. In fact it is more like R12. Placing foam outside the studs mitigates that bridging loss. Foam board can be placed on the inside walls as well, a bit more work with outlets, window door openings. A second stud wall can be placed inside or outside as well. Fine Homebuilding magazine has been doing a good job with these energy retrofits for the past few years. I push spray foam to everyone. Above ground wall use is usually polyiso use giving about R7 costing about 65 cents a board foot, extruded polystyrene (blueboard) is usually below ground and runs 55 cents. Spray polyurethane is 60-80 cents and is the gold standard. It is highly structural as well and adds amazing rigidity and strength to ceilings and walls and is used in some aircraft wings for that reason. Yet one final problem with batt insulation is that it loses R value the colder it is. At -30 it has lost 30- 50%. This little factoid was in Fine Homebuilding some time ago.

We dated the house to 1859 or 1860 by the still legible newspaper embedded in the wall paper.<br><br>The building is an interesting confluence of materials. The skeleton is four moderate size hand hewn timbeframe bents. The rest of the main materials were imported from somewhere, even if down the road at the local sawmill. This frame was then sheathed vertically in 1.5 inch thick pine planks ranging in width from 10 to 18 inches (that's what we wanted to save before the rot got too deep). On the outside clapboard siding, on the inside lathe and plaster and wallpaper. That's it. No air gap, no insulation. I live in zone 4.

I cannot thrive in an ugly space, and have no interest in materials I cannot work with myself. We spent 11 years restoring an 1825 farm house, only to be driven out be unchecked development in 2002. Now we live in an odd old house in the hills – once it was a poor man's hardscrabble farm, but it is reasonably protected from development. Turns out that won't be the issue after all though.<br><br>That interest in old houses and ways of doing things helped me to understand that all our efforts and all materials are temporary, and just how rapid was the pace of change throughout the last few hundred years. That's all the more ironic since we all seem to look back over that period as if it was a time when things were constant and unchanging. How many hours have I spent laboring over some project redoing something done by workers long dead, and wondering how some future craftsman would regard my work? Often I wonder who they were, what were their concerns, and how they got on in their lives, and now often I wonder about who will come next. <br><br>I am less focused on maximizing efficiency, and more on things that work, hold up reasonably well, and can be used, repaired and maintained by future generations without access to fossil fuel energy. So if I spend a great deal of time and effort on a project I cannot see it wasted on cheap materials, nor would I feel good leaving a mess for future inhabitants through shoddy work or lousy parts. I think that the older system of apprenticeship led to tradesmen with more skill, and a continuity of practices and techniques. This really began to fall apart around mid 20th century when mass production and new materials came on the scene, and the older craftsmen began to die out. I hope that learning and preserving the knowledge of how to work with more basic materials people are likely to be valuable to future generations, even my paltry level of skill.<br><br><a href=#c5474652857562467203 title="comment permalink">2/28/11, 10:43 AM</a><br><br>

When we built our house, we used a double stud wall, which consisted of 2 2x4 walls separated by a 3.5" gap, allowing for 3 layers of mineral wool insulation. We heat with a tankless hot water heater running an infloor radiant heat and a single woodstove, currently using about 1 cord of wood and about 1500L of propane a year (which also includes hot water and cooking). We oriented the house to the south to take advantage of passive solar gain and put up overhangs to block the sun during the summer and only have a couple of windows on the north side of the house. We also built into the side of a hill, so the north part of the house only has one story exposed to the elements. You can see a photoblog of the construction at <a href=http://www.ownerbuilder.ca rel=nofollow>www.ownerbuilder.ca</a><br><br>Just one comment on sealing the vapor barrier. In Canada we have a product called Tuck Tape, which is specifically for sealing vapor barrier. It has a very high adhesion and will not dry out and loose adhesion like duct tape would.<br><br><a href=#c8480800163117456592 title="comment permalink">3/1/11, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

The point was that once the gap gets that wide, it won't get any more effective if it gets even wider. So 1" works better than 1/8", and 4" works better than 1", but 8" is no additional improvement. It has to do with boundary layers, friction, and fluid dynamics. <br><br>I've used inside storm windows also, they work well. The only advantage of the outside mounting is that you have the tightly-sealed, non-leaky window on the side that is exposed to the wind. With the old leaky window on the outside, the wind will push cold air into the space between the windows. Your inside storm window should keep this cold air out of the house, so it will still be a substantial improvement.<br><br><a href=#c5718933014707135592 title="comment permalink">3/1/11, 9:59 AM</a><br><br>

It seems that it would make the task of putting them up and taking them down much easier, at least if there weren't a lot of drapes or blinds in the way. And it would allow opening a window for ventilation during the winter, say if there was an unseasonably warm winter day, without struggling with an exterior storm that is intended to stay in place all winter.<br><br>This blog is amazing...a flood of new ideas.<br><br>BTW, first post...great work JMG!<br><br><a href=#c2060605273369549415 title="comment permalink">3/2/11, 10:48 AM</a><br><br>
