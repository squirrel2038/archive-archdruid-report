Readers of mine with sufficiently long memories may be wondering if the evening news somehow accidentally got swapped for archived footage of a performance of that durable Sixties folk number <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiuUqRc4vME">The Merry Minuet</a>, with its lines about rioting in Africa and global mayhem in general. Certainly that was the thought that occurred to me as news from Egypt and Tunisia jostled the category 5 cyclone (we’d say "hurricane" on this side of the planet) that just walloped Australia, and the far more modest but still impressive winter storm that’s sweeping across America as I write this.<br><br>Looked at in isolation, each of these stories are business as usual. Political turmoil in Third World nations is common enough, and big storms are a fact of life in Australia as well as the United States. Still, it’s exactly that habit of looking at news stories in isolation that fosters the blindness to history as it’s happening that I’ve discussed here repeatedly. Remember that the world is a whole system and put the news into context accordingly, and troubling patterns appear.<br><br>Let’s start with the revolution in Tunisia and the ongoing turmoil in Egypt. Behind the explosion of popular resentments that’s putting once-secure governments at risk is the simple fact that in both countries, and across the Third World more generally, people are having an increasingly hard time getting enough to eat as food prices climb past records set during the last spike in 2008. Plenty of factors feed into the surge in food costs, but one major factor is a string of failed harvests in some of the world’s important grain-producing regions, which in turn has been caused by increasingly unstable weather. Pundits in the US media talk earnestly about the end of an era of cheap food, but what that means in practice is that over a growing fraction of the world, incomes are failing to keep pace with food costs, and as the number of hungry and desperate people grows, so does the pressure toward political explosions.<br><br>The context of this week’s two big storms is just as easily missed from media reports. For more than a decade now, the insurance industry has been warning that the annual cost of weather-related disasters has been rising at a dramatic rate – fast enough, according to a study released early last decade, that it will equal the gross domestic product of the entire planet by 2060. (Take a moment to think through the implications of that little detail; if the entire economic output of the world has to go to make up for repairing the costs of weather-related disasters, what about the other things economies are supposed to provide?) Here again, there are plenty of factors feeding into that soaring economic burden, but the destabilization of the world’s climate is one major factor. Whether or not dumping billions of tons of CO2 every year from our tailpipes and smokestacks is the sole cause of this destabilization is really beside the point; if you happen to be sitting next to a sleeping grizzly bear, the fact that the bear may have its own reasons for waking up in a bad mood is not a good argument in favor of poking it repeatedly with a stick.<br><br>Now of course the American way of life, and more generally the way of life common to most of the world’s industrial nations, might best be described as an elaborate arrangement to poke nature’s sleeping bears with as many sticks as possible. The business-as-usual end of the green movement has been insisting for decades that we can stop doing that and still maintain something like a modern industrial society, but whether or not their elaborate schemes for doing this could work at all – a complicated question I don’t propose to address here – the political will needed to do anything of the kind went AWOL at the end of the Seventies and hasn’t been seen since. Thus the most likely future ahead of us is one in which sleeping bears keep being poked with sticks, and increasingly often rouse themselves to bash in a head or two: in less metaphoric terms, that is, a future in which increasingly unstable climates load additional burdens on the global economy and drive a rising tide of political unrest that will probably not remain restricted to comfortably distant continents.<br><br>The fact that we don’t normally put the events of the day into their proper contexts, and draw such logical conclusions from them as the inadvisability of poking bears with sticks, has a context of its own. It can be credited to the simple fact that Americans are stupid about systems.<br><br>There’s really no gentler way to put it. Week after week, I can count on fielding at least one comment insisting that my post is just plain wrong because science, technology, progress, the free market, the space brothers, or some other convenient deus ex machina – you name it, somebody’s probably invoked it in an email to me – will allow Americans to continue to extract an ever-increasing supply of energy and raw materials from a finite planet without ever running short, and find places to dump the correspondingly rising tide of waste somewhere or other without having it turn up again to give us problems. Now of course it’s possible that some of that comes from bloggers-for-hire pushing the agenda of some corporate or political pressure group – there’s a lot of that online these days – but the illogic is pervasive enough in our culture that I suspect a lot of it comes from ordinary Americans who basically haven’t yet noticed that the world isn’t flat.<br><br>Watch what passes for political and economic debate in America these days and you can count on hearing much the same thing. Take "sustainable growth," the mantra of a large fraction of the business-as-usual end of the green movement already mentioned. Even the most elementary grasp of systems theory makes it instantly clear that there’s no meaningful sense of the adjective "sustainable" that can cohabit with any meaningful sense of the noun "growth." In a system – any system, anywhere – growth is always unsustainable. Some systems have internal limits that cut in at a certain point and stop growth before it becomes pathological, while some rely on external limits, but the limits are always there, and those who think there are no limits to a given pattern of growth are deluding themselves. Mind you, such delusions are always popular – the tech-stock and real estate bubbles that enlivened economic life in the United States during the last decade and a bit are good examples – but the consequences, when growth crashes into the limits that nobody saw coming, are rarely pleasant.<br><br>The fixation on the fantasy of perpetual growth is only one of the system-related stupidities that infest contemporary American public life, though it’s arguably the most egregious. I’ve commented before in this blog about the way that popular attitudes assume that raw materials appear out of Santa Claus’ sleigh when wanted and then simply "go away" when we’re done with them. For a good example, consider the way that the American livestock industry pumps animals full of chemicals that make them gain weight at an unnatural pace, and then feeds meat from those animals to people. Does anybody wonder whether these same chemicals, stored up in animal tissues and thus inserted into the human food chain, might have anything to do with the fact that Americans are gaining weight at an unnatural pace? Surely you jest.<br><br>A basic grasp of systems thinking would make it easier to get past follies of that sort, but that same grasp would also make it impossible to pretend that Americans can go on living their current lifestyles much longer. That’s an important reason why systems thinking was dropped like a hot rock in the early 1980s and why, outside of a narrow range of practical applications where it remains essential, it’s been shut out of the collective conversation of our society ever since.<br><br>For the aspiring green wizard, on the other hand, there are few habits of thought more important than thinking in terms of whole systems. Most of what we’ve been talking about for the last eight months, when it hasn’t been strictly practical in nature, has been oriented toward systems thinking, and a great deal of the practical material is simply the application of a systems approach to some aspect of working with nature. The practical instructions in the weeks and months ahead, as we turn to conservation and homebuilt alternative energy systems, will be even more dependent on having a clear sense of the way whole systems work. The one real limiting factor is that it’s a bit of a challenge to recommend a good clear nontechnical guide to systems thinking to those of you who are working through the Green Wizard program in earnest.<br><br>To the best of my knowledge, nobody in the Seventies or early Eighties wrote such a textbook. A truly magnificent book on the subject was already in circulation then, and indeed it had a burst of popularity during those years; the one complicating factor is that very few people seem to have realized then, and even fewer realize now, that the book in question is in fact an introductory textbook of systems thinking.<br><br>The book we’re discussing? Lao Tsu’s <i>Tao Te Ching</i>.<br><br>The <i>Tao Te Ching</i> has been translated into English more often than any other book, and the title has received nearly an equal diversity of renderings. I’m convinced that most of this diversity comes out of our own culture’s stupidity about systems, for when it’s approached from a systems perspective the title – and indeed the book – becomes immediately clear. <i>Tao</i> comes from a verb meaning "to lead forth," and in ancient times took on a range of related meanings – "path," "method," "teaching," "art." The word that most closely captures its meaning, and not incidentally comes from a similar root, is "process." <i>Te</i> is used for the character, nature, or "insistent particularity" of any given thing; "wholeness" or "integrity" are good English equivalents. <i>Ching</i> is "authoritative text," perhaps equivalent to "classic" or "scripture" in English, though the capitalized "Book" captures the flavor as well as anything. "The Book of Integral Process" is a good translation of the title.<br><br>Replace the early Chinese philosophical terminology with equivalent terms from systems theory and the point of the text becomes equally clear. Here’s chapter I:<br><blockquote>A process as described is not the process as it exists;<br>The terms used to describe it are not the things they describe.<br>That which evades description is the wholeness of the system;<br>The act of description is merely a listing of its parts.<br>Without intentionality, you can experience the whole system;<br>With intentionality, you can comprehend its effects.<br>These two approach the same reality in different ways,<br>And the result appears confusing;<br>But accepting the apparent confusion<br>Gives access to the whole system. </blockquote>It would be useful if somebody were to do a complete translation of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> in systems language one of these days – though in saying that, I get the uncomfortable feeling that it’s probably going to be me. In the meantime, prospective Green Wizards could do worse than to pick up any of the existing translations that suit their tastes, and try to think through the eighty-one short chapters of the book as guides to working with whole systems.<br><br>While you’re at it, I’d like to ask that you try a slightly more practical experiment in systems thinking, which leads straight to the theme of next week’s post. Using pen and paper, make a list of the ways that heat comes into your home during the winter months, when it’s colder outside than inside, and then make a corresponding list of the ways that heat leaves your home during those same months. Make both lists as complete as possible; those of my readers who’ve downloaded the <a href=http://culturalconservers.org/library.php>Master Conservers</a> handouts from the Cultural Conservers Foundation website can certainly use the home survey handout as a guide.<br><br>Finally, I’m pleased to announce that my forthcoming book <i>The Wealth of Nature: Economics As If Survival Mattered</i> is available for <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/4093>preorders from the publisher</a> at a 20% discount, and will be on bookstore shelves in June of this year. Longtime readers will recognize many of the concepts in this book from their first appearance in essays posted on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, and quite a few of the arguments have been improved as a result of discussions here. Many thanks to all!

Humor is quite an effective tool at getting people to read what is not written.<br><br>I've been working inside the business-as-usual green movement for a few years, and I agree with your assessment of some of its superficial claims. But I can also assure you that some of us can glimpse the larger systems at work. <br><br>We do what we can using the established resources and influence of our respective and respectable organizations. Organizations that are large, historied, well-connected and relatively unthreatening. The small battles and concessions from industry that we're able to win these days are still meaningful to the people and communities that they protect. <br><br>But behind the scenes and off the record, many of us are quietly making preparations, spreading ideas and creating networks, using our organizing skills to prepare for the day when we take on the business-as-usury model itself. <br><br>I think you would agree--that day is not today, at least not here in the USA. We'd be squashed like pests, scapegoated for the current economic-political-earth crisis du jour, detested in the hearts and minds of the public. Perhaps that day will not come in my lifetime. And perhaps our job will be done for us, by the crumbling of Empire itself, sooner than even we can imagine. <br>Either way, I believe building cross-community ties and information sharing networks will be an integral part of 21st century survival in what is now an atomized society. You must too, as that is what you are fostering with this blog and its followers. <br>If we're really blessed, maybe those ties will be the begginning of the lore of the Fourth Age, an age that gives rebirth to a new ecological morality.<br><br>And as for the rising tides you mentioned, maybe you and some of your readers would be interested in taking a look-see:<br><br>http://www.risingtidenorthamerica.org/wordpress/what-is-rising-tide/<br><br><a href=#c8020302309712264667 title="comment permalink">2/2/11, 11:45 PM</a><br><br>

Her attempt to imagine Buddhist cosmology as an ecosystem of interconnectedness is, as I learned in college, a novel reinterpretation of Buddhism, but it's also a truly deep message she has drawn out of tao and dharma, and one that might blossom some generations from now into a coherent replacement for our worship of economic growth.<br><br><a href=#c3331391753699831414 title="comment permalink">2/2/11, 11:46 PM</a><br><br>

It was big and nasty.<br><br>If anyone is interested you can check out some pictures and coverage here:<br>http://www.theage.com.au/environment/cyclone-yasi<br><br>I'm 3,000km south of where the cyclone made landfall and apparently I'm getting the tail end of it this weekend. Some places are predicting another pounding for this area of 220mm rain, whilst others are predicting only a little bit. All I know is that the spiders have commenced a migration into the house en masse. They aren't usually wrong.<br><br>Strangely enough, systems thinking is lost on the Australian politcal system. The federal government announced recently that they would implement a levy (ie. tax) to help fund the rebuilding of flood and cyclone affected areas. Remember that recently a massive flood has also done some pretty serious damage to our third major city (Brisbane) and surrounding areas.<br><br>The funny thing about the levy (tax) is that it impacts people with a higher income. You've never seen a bigger stink in the media as the well funded are now coming out to sulk their socks off. <br><br>The thing I don't understand is, the areas affected are vast producers of agricultural produce and also contain quite a few mines that export huge quantities of coal which is our second biggest export item.<br><br>Where do they think their personal incomes are derived from? Where do they think their food comes from? It's sad really that this is being questioned at all. Someone somewhere has to pay for it, it doesn't magically get rebuilt on the backs of volunteers.<br><br>People have lost the ability to plan long term, if they had it at all.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>Chris.<br><br><a href=#c6357887479662108219 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 1:42 AM</a><br><br>

I have been lucky not to have been flooded or subjected to a cyclone this summer. The irony of Queensland's situation is remarkable in my view. One of its major $$ earners is exporting coal, obviously a major contributor to global warming. Whether the storms and floods are linked to climate change or not, we are likely to see more events in the future. The irony comes in with Queensland's requirement to get the coal exports flowing (damaged railways, mines etc) so that it can pay for the rebuilding. The BAU response to these events is to rebuild and return things to 'normal.' This is unfortunate as these events, in my opinion, are likely to trigger, or at least set the pre conditions for a step down in the catabolic collapse process. If only this was the prism that our leaders saw the world through!<br><br><a href=#c4264750040289358433 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 2:44 AM</a><br><br>

It fell just short of Category 5 criteria. <br><br>Now to the actual point... there's not any need for increasing frequency or intensity of the natural events themselves in order for the "disasters" (their impacts on human societies) to intensify. As our build up of infrastructure and other capital (e.g. cities, houses, roads, bridges) increases, the intensity of the disasters increases even if the intensity of the triggering events does not. It actually fits neatly in to your catabolic model. <br><br>Actual data on the frequency of "extreme" weather events show a barely significant slight increase in recent decades, in contrast to skyrocketing damage costs (fatality rates, though, at least in the developed world with warning systems, have declined). And of course there has been no increase in earthquake frequency or intensity (sorry 2012-ers and other End-Of-The_World aficionados, but they haven't), yet "disaster costs" continue to increase on that front as well. <br><br>Re: systems thinking -- traditionally, hasn't religion been one of the primary means by which people have learned and comprehended this? To my mind perhaps the first skill one needs here is the understanding that the idea of the thing is not the thing itself. Our mainstream mass religions in our present culture have largely lost sight of this concept.<br><br><a href=#c8124044212759962180 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 5:22 AM</a><br><br>

I can think of at least two occasions where I have pointed this out to two different intelligent friends and they both replied with something like, oh no, growth doesn't mean what you think it means and therefore sustainable growth is possible. I suppose that sustainable doesn't mean what I think it means either. In any case, their faith in growth, sustainable or otherwise was unshaken.<br>Back in grad school I took a course in thermodynamics. Boring stuff, lots of partial differential equations and graphs of cycles consisting of heat being pumped in and out of closed systems. I don't remember much of it but did walk away with a solid understanding that you can't get more out of a system than you put into it, that there are definite physical limits to what is possible and that no amount of magical thinking can overcome them. If someone has a perpetual motion machine, look for the wire sneaking in that keeps the motor running.<br>Similarly, systems tend toward equilibrium, that is, heat spreads out evenly till it becomes useless. Living systems operate far from equilibrium and are kept there by an external source of heat, in our case, the sun. <br>Anyway, you have covered all this in your posts on this site. <br>So in one of my hopeful moods, I thought, what if we made the teaching of some sort of basic thermodynamics mandatory in our schools. You wouldn't need all the math, just the basic principles so that the next time somebody said sustainable growth, the whole class would shout out in unison, "bullshit". <br>But this probably won't happen. How can you teach cornucopian economics in one building of your university and the limits of growth in another? Clearly some accommodation has been reached. The economists can go up to the podium and claim their Nobel prizes safe in the knowledge that the physicists that are going up to claim theirs will not say anything bad about economics because the physicists are counting on exponential growth of the economy to keep their retirement funds solvent.<br><br><a href=#c9182976432819683112 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>

As a Navy engineer, all of our training was geared toward understanding the complex systems we were charged with maintaining and operating. Of special concern was understanding how systems react when things go wrong; what is going to happen if I turn this valve or flip this switch? In my experience, few were able to make the transition from understanding properly functioning systems to groking the same systems that were malfunctioning or failing. <br><br>Next step: damage control. This is where we humans now find ourselves; realizing the 'chasing-your-ass' aspect of trying to patch together systems that have become too hypercomplex and corrupt.<br><br>What we have now is a bit like a garden that has become too large, where the gardener can't cope with what he has planted over the years, and one by one, sections of his creation seek their own balance, free of the careful tending that once kept things in check, eventually encroaching on and affecting other parts of the system that the gardener is still trying to maintain. <br><br>This is why I try to keep things simple, regarding my Green Wizzard path. While I have a tendency to over-think things and look for technical solutions,( the <i>'I can make this better/easier'</i> meme) I often have to pull back from making things more complex. This morning I am reminded of the wisdom of this approach as the sun shines into our greatroom, warming the floor. What could be more simple and easier to maintain than passive solar and thermal mass? Avoiding complex solutions has become a primary factor in my systems thinking.<br><br><a href=#c8459537960124345965 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 7:39 AM</a><br><br>

The oxymoronic nature of "sustainable growth" is only evident when what is growing is a physical entity. In this world what we want to grow is "value". The "value" might consist of a tangible quantity, like a gallon of gas or a pound of flour, but it could just as well be an hour making music with friends. In this culture we like to monetize everything so we can compare the pound of flour with the hour of music making, so that we can then add it all up into the GDP - which is what we want to grow in the capitalist system. The point is that the value embedded in new ideas and culture, e.g. your new book or music making, need not have physical limits. "Different", "unique" and "fresh" have value that we will pay for and can be reflected in ever growing cultural value. Is it possible to transition from an economy that runs on growing physical consumption to one that runs on growing cultural consumption?

This month marks the 10th anniversary of her untimely death.<br><br>For those of your readers who aren't familiar with her she was the founder of the Sustainability Institute, a professor at Dartmouth College, a long-time organic farmer, a journalist, and a systems analyst. She was recognized as a MacArthur ("genius") Fellow, too. She's probably best known to the larger world as a part of the MIT team that produced Limits to Growth (1972)or as the originator of the "If the world were a village of 100 people" (1990), but I believe her strongest work was "Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System" (1990). It describes what types of interventions in a system (of any kind) are most effective, and which are least.<br><br>There's a public, accessible collection online at the Sustainability Institute. Check out the tools section, too (the video on it of her is very compelling)<br><br>http://www.sustainer.org/dhm_archive/index.php<br> <br>Here's the way she ends the Leverage essay~~ It will resonate with this posting and the swirl of this past week's events.<br><br>"Magical leverage points are not easily accessible, even if we know where they are and which direction to push on them. There are no cheap tricks to mastery. You have to work at it, whether that means rigorously analyzing a system or rigorously casting off your own paradigms and throwing yourself off into the humility of Not Knowing. In the end, it seems that power has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with strategically, profoundly, madly letting go."<br><br><a href=#c2766326592248297531 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 10:44 AM</a><br><br>

One of the core implications of the catabolic collapse theory is that as decline sets in, a civilization will try to use all available resources to prop up the current state of affairs, and thereby cut off resources that might otherwise be used to build a bridge to a sustainable future.

Mainstream media tend to overstate the intensity and extent of weather events, and then be repeated in authoritative-sounding manner without ever being corrected. <br><br>The two statements about extreme events are not in conflict. Extreme weather events are by definition rare and erratic. A 38% increase in extreme precipitation is also barely statistically significant, because precipitation is always highly variable. The heaviest 24-hour rain of the year around here historically varies between less than 2" and over 7"; it's even more variable in the midwest. The distribution is also not normal (in the statistical sense), it is highly skewed. So even a doubling of the average of this number would be hard to detect statistically until you have several decades of the trend. The apparent upward trend in this number is just barely becoming statistically significant at this point. When you figure in that these sorts of analyses generally break several of the underlying assumptions of assessing statistical significance (for instance, we did not begin with an a priori assumption before the data were ever looked at or even collected; the data were "snooped" in by everyone on earth looking for apparent trends and then these trends were assessed, a big no-no for rigorous statistical testing) you want a better trend than that before you will firmly call it "real." Hey, we had in our own backyard a 29-hour total of 14.3" (that's rain, not snow...) not even a year ago, but I'm not gonna conclude global patterns from personal experience. <br><br>Sorry to be a recurring nag about your climate data, but these poor little numbers have been horribly misused in every direction in recent decades. Similar approaches to similar data (and their exaggeration in the mainstream media) lead to the "An Ice Age Is Coming!" stuff of the 1970s and 1980s.<br><br><a href=#c3364900829714705583 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 12:09 PM</a><br><br>

I am sure it will be as intriguing as your other works and I for one cannot wait to receive my copy. <br><br>Interesting that you bring up systems theory in connection with this week's post. Having cut my teeth in political systems theory as an undergrad, your thoughts made me think about the works of political scientist David Easton that came out of his research from the 1950's, especially as they relate to the Middle East/Africa and some of the larger problems that are currently dawning on the industrial world. Easton's work on systemic cybernetics was applied specifically to the function of political systems and as such, I think that the overall framework of his analysis could serve as a utility for mapping the impacts of climate change and peak oil. <br><br>Basically, Easton suggests that political systems operate smoothly when they are able to properly transition variables that enter the system from the environment in a way that does not disturb the systemic functions. What is interesting is that while Easton charts out a specific systemic course for these interactions in a closed-loop system, much of the global economy as we know it is instead linear. For instance, take the means of production that keep most of the Western world afloat. The processes of materials extraction, production, distribution, consumption, and disposal that keep capitalist economies humming do not conform to a closed-loop model, but instead behave in a linear pattern from the time when the metals are extracted from the ground to the time when they wind up in the local landfill. From a political systems standpoint, the fact that the economies of so many countries behave in a way that is truly abhorrent to nature (since in fact nature is a closed-loop system), did not matter because their inherent systemic costs could be covered up by the age of cheap oil and abundance. In essence, the system absorbed these costs and moved forward by transitioning the variables. Out of the industrial age stuff accumulated, people were fed, life was good. You know, the whole chicken in every pot and car in every garage deal. In an age of abundance this is not an issue. <br><br>Now however the situation is drastically altered. Political systems the world over are in no shape to transition the multiple independent variables that seem to be throwing sand in the cogs of the machine on a nearly weekly basis. The system as it is built cannot respond effectively, especially since the materials that are required to maintain the homeostasis of systemic function are increasingly more expensive and difficult to come by. This is precisely why regimes in the Middle East/Africa are poised to fall like dominos. Most of these governments, propped up by petrodollars and silver-tongued promises from the West, will become extinct as they outgrow the hard limits of their political system. There is no doubt that food prices played a role in the recent turmoil in Tunisia, it has a fair enough to do with the uprising in Egypt, and has the potential to spill over into other places such as Qatar, Syria, and perhaps most frighteningly for the industrial world, Saudi Arabia. I can only imagine the folks over at the State Department's Middle East desk are sitting on egg shells right now trying to figure out what to do if Riyadh follows a similar trajectory as Cairo. . <br><br>The problem of course is that in an age of global-scale economics, what happens in the Middle East and northern Africa has serious repercussions for the industrialized world since this region is also running headlong against systemic restraints of its own. This is why Washington is treading very carefully at the moment with respect to Egypt because it is crucial for The United States to have unfettered access to the Suez Canal. The systemic repercussions of a disrupted global oil supply chain, which provides the industrial junkie economies their crack-cocaine, would be immediate, numerous, and unprecedented.<br><br><a href=#c910195240713921712 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 12:45 PM</a><br><br>

I agree, not a good idea to poke it at all, but I think the real point is that if you do wake it up (or it wakes up on its own) it will be angrier and more destructive than anyone can ever remember.

Thing is -- essentially everything we care about in the world is an emergent property of a very complex system -- culture, weather, life, narratives, politics, cuisine, agriculture, music, revolution, carpentry, electricity, etc. etc. etc. Even the great reductionistic achievements of science in the last few centuries (e.g. Newtonian Mechanics, Chemistry) that "describe" the macroscopic, sensible world in which we live... well they turn out to themselves be emergent properties of complex quantum mechanical systems and are not truly fundamental reduced properties of the universe. And of course, some are beginning to suspect (including me) that this quantum world is itself an emergent phenomenon from some other, very different, as-yet entirely uncomprehended system underneath it. Personally, I am beginning to suspect that this unknown foundation for the quantum world, if it could be identified and studied, would also turn out to be an emergent phenomenon of a still deeper level, and so on and so on, ad infinitum. Turtles all the way down...<br><br>Anyway, when you begin to think of pretty much everything we know as emergent behavior of complex systems, attributable to no single "thing," then your ideas about cause and effect, meaning, responsibility, and most everything else are fundamentally altered!<br><br><a href=#c5878290683745326564 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 2:56 PM</a><br><br>

My wife, brother and his wife co-purchased a farm at the end of 2009 where we are prepping for the coming transition to low energy life. We bought a hill farm with only a bit of flat land because it has great water potential. This fall we praised to the gods of rental equipment and diesel fuel while we dug in and buried 3000 feet of gravity feed waterline. I don't see how agricultural output is going to be maintained in the coming decades without many thousands of infrastructure projects like ours, and at the same time I see no one else putting time and money into such endevours. Around here grid electricity is fairly relieable and still not hugely expensive. Water pumps are therefore are normally in operation. However we chose to go a slightly more capital intensive route for watering our livestock in the pasture. It cost a bit more up front, but now I sleep well at night knowing that there will always be water pressure in my hydrants.<br><br><a href=#c190876971413112668 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 3:00 PM</a><br><br>

A major consideration is the state of the watershed. Land degradation increases flooding because less of the water soaks into the soil and more runs off. Buildings and roads are the extreme examples because they're impervious, but soil degradation does the same thing. Healthy soil with high organic matter will absorb more rain. Droughts are worse in degraded soil as well because less water absorbed during rain means less of a moisture bank in the soil for the dry periods. Draining wetlands also increases flooding because wetlands are teh sponges of the landscape.<br><br>As for floods in Iowa now being summer events, I'm sure the same amount of rain would have produced far less flooding back when the state was predominantly prairie. Snowmelt floods happen pretty readily even with healthy land, but summer flooding would still be much less severe in Iowa if it weren't for the fact that af all the states, Iowa has the most percentage of its land under cultivation, mostly in vast monocrops. Of course, some areas have much more runoff even in their natural state, such as mountainous areas with rock outcroppings and this soils, but that doesn't describe Iowa. I used to live in Southern Minnesota, similar to Iowa in that corn and soybeans predominate. However, there was a state park near me with pretty mature woods. I went there one June when all the rivers and creeks in the area were flooding and were dirty brown, however there's a small intermittent creek in this park that's whole watershed is in the park. During this flood period, it was higher than normal, but not over its banks, and most tellingly of all, it was not muddy but crystal clear. That contrast was a striking reminder of how awfully we treat our soil.<br><br><a href=#c8846141886140220101 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 7:19 PM</a><br><br>

It's especially a must-have if you're in an arid or semi-arid climate, but even if like myself you're in a humid climate, it's still worth reading. He discovered that the conventional wisdom on the causes of desertification were mostly wrong, and has multitudes of experience and examples provided to prove it. His expertise is on animal grazing, he shows that by following the patterns of wild flocks of animals, the land can actually support lots of animals and grow healthier, while resting the land from animal impact can ruin dry grasslands and savannas, them all having evolved in the presence of wild herds.<br><br>The reason I thought of this at this time is that he shows the land degradation connection to flooding/drought. He says in many places people say "The rains aren't what they used to be" when it's really the land's reduced capacity to absorb them that's resulting in more droughts (and flooding).<br><br>This could factor into Wyoming's comment, some of that increase in natural disasters could be induced by land degradation. I do think global warming is a very real and serious issue but it doesn't mean there aren't other factors involved, and if you're managing any land you can help restore a functioning water cycle on that land.<br><br><a href=#c6526029202655627648 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 8:17 PM</a><br><br>

Paleoclimatology shows that the world's climate can change very suddenly and very drastically, with or without CO2 forcing. That being the case, adding additional imbalance to an already unstable system -- even if the addition turns out to be a minor factor -- is a very, very bad idea. The exact reasons why the bear might be inspired to bash your head in if it wakes up is considerably less important than the need to do nothing that might wake it up!<br><br>Matt and Jess, I've seen that, though I haven't read it. I'll give it a look. <br><br>Bill, it's a crucial point. Did you ever read Laszlo's <i>Introduction to Systems Philosophy</i>? IIRC he does a lot with emergence. As for turtles, well, I'm with the mystics on this one; I'd suggest that all apparently concrete phenomena are emergent properties of consciousness...<br><br>EBrown, excellent! It's exactly personal projects like yours that have the biggest chance of making a difference where it counts. <br><br>Jonathan, it's been a long time and there are a lot of books under that heading! Other than the Gerald Weinberg and Ervin Laszlo books already discussed, your best bet is probably to go to your university library and bring home an armfull from Q295 -- that's the LOC location for general systems theory. <br><br>Cascadian, a population that could do that would also be far too likely to see the flaws in its own favored pipe dreams. We do a lot of stealing from ourselves, you know. <br><br>Mark, I noted those same bits of jargon, but took it in a different way. I think most people in the US literally have no idea what a disaster is any more. It hasn't occurred to them that not being able to play video games for a few hours might not be the very worst thing that could happen to them. I suspect many of them will find out otherwise down the road...<br><br>Bobby, many thanks! The local university library has both of them, conveniently enough. <br><br>Wyoming, good. Yes, that's a solid argument. <br><br>Richard, and of course that's also a valid point. As with any complex phenomenon, disasters are generally overdetermined. <br><br>Steve, the term "Third World" originally referred to those nations that weren't part of either of the two major power blocs. I don't use it as a synonym for "developing nations," since most nations in the Third World will never experience industrial development -- the fossil fuel surplus that's the basis allowing anybody to undergo industrial development is depleting very quickly. Since it's a clear, readily understood term, and I've never seen the point to the American political fixation on tampering with language, I'll continue to use it -- and if that means I "lose you," well, that's what it means.<br><br><a href=#c8870925711972763513 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 8:25 PM</a><br><br>

Those turtles, again.<br><br>Re: Climate change and JMG, Wyoming, Richard, and Richard...<br><br>Climate change is actually a lot more complicated than just CO2 and the other greenhouse gases. The atmo-hydro-geo-biosphere system is very complex and climate is one of those emergent properties of it. As such pulling on any single thread and saying "this is what causes that" is iffy at best.<br><br>At the present time, perhaps an even more important contributor to observed climate changes than CO2 et al is "land cover change," as Richard #2 points out. Conversion of forest to cropland, topsoil loss, pavement and rooftops, etc. etc. have huge effects not just directly on flooding but on all the complex flows of heat and water. The "human volcano" effect from particulate loading is also a significant factor. These all contribute to positive and negative feedbacks -- for instance absence of forest cover lowers evapotranspiration, which lowers precipitation, which dries the soil and lowers evapotranspiration again. We're poking that atmospheric grizzly with a whole lot of sticks, not just the one made of CO2. The effects of CO2 may become clearly dominant in coming decades, but right now urban heat islands are actually still a stronger signal in the populous latitudes. <br><br>Climate scientists are inherently systems thinkers, by and large. The complex web of links and loops is second nature to them; unexpected outcomes don't surprise them at all. Perhaps this is part of the problem they have had communicating with the masses, who for the most part don't like to (or know how to) think about complex systems.<br><br><a href=#c1526385848767227347 title="comment permalink">2/3/11, 9:05 PM</a><br><br>

I keep telling people around here to increase the insured amount of their buildings so that if they have to rebuild, they will be able to do so. Some people take me seriously and others don't.

Of course this was politically unfeasible, so instead what it became was a massive program that insures flood-prone areas than no private insurer will touch, thus encouraging rampant development in coastal and floodplain areas, and paying for rebuilding of these properties after they are hit (at taxpayer expense).

Hear!<br> I heartily second your recommendation to read Savory's work. It also is salient to this post because I consider him a powerful systems thinker. He managed to see through the desertification-overgrazing-fire dogma and recognize that plant and soil communities depend on the rest periods between disturbances to maintain their health. It is not simply a matter of stocking rate or the heat of a burn, rather it is the timing of the disturbance in relation to the plants' life cycle. <br> The title to his work exemplfies his system bent as "Holisitic Management" emphasizes that one cannot understand a complex thing such as an ecosystem by studying single components in isolation. <br> Have you read Andre Voison's book, "Grass Productivity"? Savory credits him with the idea of examining rest periods... It's pretty technical as Voison was a scientist as much as a farmer, but it is invaluable as a resource. He lived in a humid climate (as I do), which adds to the work's direct applicability.<br><br><a href=#c7055484643105098035 title="comment permalink">2/4/11, 6:11 AM</a><br><br>

I think it's at least partly rooted in the fact that so many Americans are so far removed from the rhythm of the seasons. Their daily activities don't change with the seasons: they go to the same cubicle to work every morning and come home in the evening and then, as JMG mentions, they sit down in front of the tube to play video games or watch the latest episode of their favorite vapid network program. They have been conditioned to think that anything that might inconvenience them, such as a snowfall, is equivalent to a major disaster. As JMG says, they have no idea what a real disaster is. And, further, most Americans, who after all have bought into the myth of progress, don't like being reminded that humans can't control nature.<br><br>None of them, apparently, have ever read Whittier's "Snowbound."<br><br>Another reason, I think, is related to most Americans' utter dependence on automotive transportation. Automobiles require clean and preferably dry payment to be used. A snowstorm severely affects peoples' ability to get around, and, I think, has become the chief cause of the incessant complaints about winter weather that one hears so frequently. In pre-industrial times, people just stayed home, or, if they had to go out, they strapped on their snowshoes when the snow was deep. But we can't do that anymore.<br><br>It's almost humorous to watch the local TV news here in Columbus, Ohio, during a snowstorm, or even whenever a significant snowfall is predicted. Each storm, it seems, becomes the storm of the century, and the news team will station reporters in front of the mounds of road salt, or out along a lonely stretch of highway, apparently to count the snowflakes as they come down. :)<br><br>And of course, each local station tries to outdo their competitor stations to be the first to bring the latest "breaking news" about the current manifestation of "snowmageddon."<br><br><a href=#c8694487782093658025 title="comment permalink">2/4/11, 11:17 AM</a><br><br>

I believe this is related to people's discomfort with change. We don't like change but we know it happens, so we create the illusion of a world that is mostly constant, except for moments when things happen. A fantasy of a world where change is a discrete process, rather than a continuous one. Also, we imagine past times when things were a certain way, though in reality these were but moments in a continuously changing world.<br><br>When “events” happen we see these as anomalies which must have a distinct identifiable cause (preferably only one). This distortion allows us to cling to the possibility of a return to a comfortable, constant world without change once the reasons for the changes are dealt with. I see this habit of thought as particularly dangerous, as it leads people to make gross errors in their understanding of why things happen, and what to expect next. Everything that happens is considered as if it is something new, something discrete, rather than the end result of a chain of previous happenings – and then a hunt begins to find “the cause”. Eventually a palatable single explanation is found, resulting little real understanding and a high probability of repeating mistakes.<br><br><a href=#c2263433866193530973 title="comment permalink">2/4/11, 12:20 PM</a><br><br>

In a society that converts everything into money, the fact that it costs too much to rebuild is your signal that the resources for rebuilding aren't there in adequate supply any more. <br><br>Seb, oh, granted, there are plenty of better ways to phrase it. Might be useful to try to work out a very clean, simple, easily grasped formulation to be spread as widely as possible. <br><br>Earthling, most interesting. The only thing by Capra I ever read was <i>The Tao of Physics</i>, and I found it very disappointing -- like most books of that type, it cherrypicked concepts out of the wildly diverse philosophies of a couple of Asian cultures to produce a mishmash "wisdom of the East," and then equated it with quantum physics in what I thought was a very simplistic way. Still, if he's done better stuff since then, that's good -- and I should probably at least glance at it. <br><br>Pat, a lot of the old translations didn't have a good grasp of the jargon of traditional Chinese philosophy, which takes some getting used to -- and there's also the not minor fact that what Lao Tsu was saying contradicts many of the core assumptions of Western thought, and so a lot of translators unconsciously edit the contradictions out in a variety of ways. <br><br>Subgenius, the old Arthr Waley translation used "power" to translate <i>te</i>, and it's certainly one option, but it tends to lead Western thinkers into a variety of blind alleys. Our concept of power has connotations that differ in almost every conceivable way from <i>te</i>. <br><br>Robin, actually, there is a Second World. Global politics for the last four centuries or so has fallen out into a First World, consisting of the primary global hegemon and its allies; a Second World, consisting of the hegemon's primary rival and its allies; and a Third World that's unaligned, and usually more or less victimized by both. Today the First World is the US and its allies in Europe and Japan; the Second World is a loose alliance centered on China, and including India, Russia, and Brazil (the so-called BRIC countries); and the Third World is the rest. India used to be Third World, and now is Second; give it a couple of centuries and it may just be First for a while.<br><br><a href=#c8246480456658706660 title="comment permalink">2/4/11, 9:15 PM</a><br><br>

Scientists ought to be among the first to see the writing on the wall; most often these days, though, they're cheerleading the profoundly irrational cornucopian agenda. What gives?</i><br><br> There are two parts to this. First, there is a pervasive belief that science improves the quality of life and drives economic growth. The evidence does not support this interpretation:<br><br> The scientific revolution started about two hundred years before the industrial revolution. Standards of living didn't improve substantial in the 200 year interlude nor did economic output. The industrial revolution needed science and coal to get going. Science was a necessary but not sufficient condition that we spuriously attributed as the sole driver of growth. Even though this explanation only fits half of the data set our short memories like it because it fits the most recent half.<br><br>Second, The institution of scientific research has lost much of its former integrity.

The state and federal governments here also lack the political will to move / compensate people out of flood or fire prone areas.<br><br>The government's response to bushfires was to make new homes less combustible. I have what can be best described as zombie proof windows and doors! This is in addition to some very unusual cladding, roof etc. I can see them now clamouring for brains, while I sit in comfort having a solar powered coffee...<br><br>However, the recent floods affected over 20x the number of dwellings that the Black Saturday bushfires did. As a society we simply can't afford to make that number of houses flood resistant, so they'll simply rebuild until the next flood event.<br><br>There will come a time when they won't be able to rebuild though and the land returns to flood planes, billabong's etc.<br><br>Household insurance here also does not usually cover things like floods, yet they will cover bushfires. It should be noted though the incidence of house fires is far greater in city areas than in bushfires.<br><br>I also have to agree with you about the heat island effect.

More and more often I hear people blame whatever "unprecedented" weather event on global warming, when it's unprecedented at all, sometimes not even close. Certain things are unprecedented (at least in historical time) such as last year's heat wave in Russia, but I cringe when people say things like "Katrina was caused by global warming." when the historical record shows plenty of stronger hurricanes before fossil fuel emissions became prominent. I have seen some research suggesting a like between global warming and more intense hurricanes in recent years, but that should only lead to a statement such as "Global warming increases the likelihood of major hurricanes such as Katrina."<br><br>On the subject of whether weather events are unprecedented, many people don't realize that individual record lows or highs don't signal anything crazy going on with the weather. If a station has 120 years of data, you could expect about 3 daily record lows (and highs) on average a year. Many stations have fewer years of data than this, and can thus expect even more daily records each year.<br><br>In 2010 much was made by some people of the cold snap in January which really didn't set many record lows outside of Florida. The extreme warmth in April set many more record highs along the East Coast and great lakes regions than the cold. In early April, Caribou, Maine, about as far north as you can go in the East, hit 82 degrees, breaking their old record of 58. Of course, individual weather events don't make a trend, but it does make me think, how often does a record get broken by 24 degrees, that one might really be in the unprecedented category or at least close.<br><br><a href=#c7108382721389255891 title="comment permalink">2/6/11, 5:24 PM</a><br><br>
