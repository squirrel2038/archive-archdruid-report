There are moments when the things nobody wants to talk about brush the surface, like deepwater fish rising briefly to catch the sun on their backs before plunging again into the underwater shadows. Two of those moments happened in the last few days, and I’d like to discuss them briefly before we get back into the practicalities of life in an age of declining energy availability.<br><br>One of those moments was set in motion by something that was almost certainly meant to have the opposite effect. This was <a href=http://bubblemeter.blogspot.com/2011/02/warren-buffett-on-us-economy.html>the recent pronouncement from umpty-billionaire Warren Buffett</a>, who clambered into the media pulpit last week to insist that the United States is not in decline, and indeed that its best days are still ahead of it. A man with Buffett’s income can be forgiven for believing this; the last few decades, after all, have been inordinately good for umpty-billionaires, though they’ve been rather noticeably less so for the other 99-plus per cent of the American people. As long as the current order of affairs remains welded in place in Washington DC and elsewhere, it’s entirely possible that the days of billion-dollar bonuses for the guys at the top are not quite over yet.<br><br>Still, from any other perspective, Buffett’s utterance bears an uncanny similarity to the fine art of whistling past the graveyard. Nations in the rising curve of their history do not need to hear platitudes from obscenely rich pundits to recognize that better days are ahead. Empires on the way down, on the other hand, can count on hearing plenty of pronouncements of this sort, from plenty of people of Buffett’s kind; the British media was brimfull of such utterances by titled statesmen and overpaid financiers all through the period when the British empire was coming apart at the seams. There’s also more than a little echo of the organized reassurance John Kenneth Galbraith chronicled so gleefully in <i>The Great Crash 1929</i>, the efforts by the very rich in the wake of the 1929 crash to insist that the market and the economy were just fine when, by every objective measure, they weren’t.<br><br>The second moment I’d like to mention may have helped to cause the first. This was <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704615504576172700977248380.html?mod=rss_whats_news_us">a quiet little article in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal</a> commenting, in measured tones, that for the first time in living memory an international crisis has sent investment money running away from US dollar-denominated investments rather than toward them. For decades now, as most of my readers will doubtless be aware, the US dollar has had the reputation of a safe haven for investments, and wars, revolutions, and financial crises overseas have reliably sparked flows of money into investments denominated in dollars, most of them here in the United States. That’s one of the factors that have kept America’s interest rates down and its trade deficit manageable, at least so far, in the face of the federal government’s epic mismanagement of the public purse.<br><br>Those days may just be over. The article just mentioned notes that since the current round of troubles hit North Africa and the Middle East, money has been flowing away from the dollar, heading toward other relatively stable currencies such as the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. Even the euro, which has its own drastic problems, has benefited noticeably from the flight from the dollar. It’s hard to be sure exactly what’s behind this epochal shift, but it’s hard to ignore the possibility that what currently carries the engagingly timid moniker “quantitative easing” – that is, the United States government’s current practice of paying for its deficit spending by having the Federal Reserve print money to buy treasury bills nobody else is willing to take – has started to spook overseas investors.<br><br>If so, they’re right to be spooked. When a nation starts funding deficit spending via the printing press, its currency’s days are numbered. It’s true, of course, as plenty of thoughtful people have pointed out in the peak oil blogosphere, that the US money supply in its broadest sense – including all forms of debt, which count as money in our current hallucinatory economy – has contracted sharply in the wake of the 2008 housing-bubble crash, and would have contracted a great deal more if the government hadn’t basically encouraged banks to pretend that the mountains of worthless mortgage-backed securities in their vaults still had the value credited to them, at least in the delusions of real estate promoters, circa 2006. Still, it’s not often remembered that the value of a currency isn’t a function of the money supply alone; like every other measure of value, it’s a function of the relationship between supply and demand, and a currency that’s contracting can still tip over into inflation, even hyperinflation, if the demand for it drops faster than the supply.<br><br>For what it’s worth, my best guess at the moment – which is all that any observer of the economy can offer – is that we’re headed for what I’ve called hyperstagflation, more or less 1970s-style stagflation on steroids, complete with a bad case of ‘roid rage. The ingredients for that are already in place: soaring commodity prices, a US economy in freefall, and interruptions in the free flow of petroleum caused, to make the sense of deja vu complete, by troubles in the Middle East. Still, a good deal depends on just how hyperactive the Fed’s printing presses get in the months ahead. If the current shift away from dollar-denominated investments turns into a panic, as it might, and the stock market crashes in response, as it could, and the Obama administration decides to respond with yet another "quantitative easing" program to prop up the market with a flood of freshly printed money, as recent experience suggests it very likely would – well, you can do the math for yourself.<br><br>One way or another, though, whatever income my readers happen to have coming their way in the months and years ahead is likely to buy quite a bit less energy than the same amount of money buys at present. That makes finding ways to make less energy do more work crucial just now – and that, in turn, leads to windows.<br><br>If you’ve caulked and weatherstripped your home, and have a decently thick layer of insulation in the attic, your windows are where the largest fraction of your remaining heating bills go dancing out into the great outdoors. Window glass has an R-value (R means resistance to heat flow, remember?) right around 1 per layer of glass, so a double-pane window has an R-value of 2, or maybe a bit more: that is to say, not much. Interestingly, this is true no matter how fancy or expensive the windows happen to be: you get an R-value of 2 or so from an old-fashioned single-pane window with storm windows slapped on the outside, and you also get an R-value right around 2 from a very expensive vinyl-framed double-pane window with the space between the panes pumped full of inert gas, or what have you. If you want a higher R-value, glass is not going to give it to you.<br><br>One point worth taking home from this last comment is that if you’ve got windows that don’t serve a useful purpose, getting rid of them, permanently or temporarily, may be your best option. It takes a certain amount of skill at carpentry to take out a window and seal up the opening so that the resulting wall is weathertight and well insulated; if you don’t happen to have the skills, your friendly local handyperson can do the job in a day or so, and it’s often money well worth spending. If you don’t feel confident in doing anything so drastic, get some rigid-board insulation from your local lumber store, cut it to fit exactly into the window opening from inside, and then cut a sheet of hardboard to fit the same opening, inside the insulation; glue the insulation to the hardboard, paint the hardboard to match the wall, weatherstrip the edges of the hardboard so that you’ve got a good tight seal around the sides, top, and bottom to prevent air leaks, slide it into place and you’re good to go. If you live in a place with cold winters, closing up half a dozen windows in this way during the cold season can save you quite a bit on your heating bills.<br><br>What if you want something more easily movable, so you can catch the rays of the winter sun when it’s out but close things up easily at night? Here we come to one of the great forgotten secrets of the Seventies appropriate-tech movement, the fine art of insulated window coverings.<br><br>I had the chance to learn about those personally in my teen years. In 1977, my family moved from a rental house in a down-at-heels Seattle suburb to a larger and more comfortable place we actually owned – well, subject to mortgage and all that, but you get the idea. The one drawback was that the new place was expensive to heat, and that was mostly because most of the main floor’s walls facing southeast, toward a stunning view of the Cascade Mountains, consisted of single-pane windows. Insulated window coverings were much talked about in those days of high energy costs and state-funded conservation programs; my stepmother found a pattern, fired up her sewing machine, and made what amounted to a set of inexpensive quilts – faced inside and out with the ornately printed sheets popular in those days, and filled with polyester batting – rigged to slide up and down like Roman blinds. They went up in the morning and down with the sun, and the monthly heating bills dropped by a very noticeable fraction.<br><br>There are dozens of designs for insulated window coverings – or, more precisely, there <i>were</i> dozens of designs. It will take you a bit of searching to find them nowadays, as a result of the thirty-year vacation from reality American society took in 1980 or thereabouts. All the designs have certain things in common. The first, obviously enough, is that they put a bunch of additional insulation over the window. How much? A good rule of thumb is that your windows, with window coverings in place, should be as well insulated as the wall on either side – for an uninsulated wall of normal American housing construction, this means around R-5, and up from there as your level of insulation improves.<br><br>The second common feature is that the window covering should be sealed around the window, especially at top and bottom. Conventional curtains, open at top and bottom, can actually increase your heat loss by convection: air up against the window glass is chilled and flows out the bottom opening, making a draft across the floor, while warm air gets drawn in through the bottom opening and flows across the glass, cooling as it goes. Stop that "flue effect" and you instantly make the room more comfortable. The insulated shades my stepmother made were pressed right up against the wall above the windows, and had little magnets sewn in along the edges to hold them against metal strips in the wall beside and below the windows; there were many other tricks used to do the same thing.<br><br>The third common feature is that the window covering should contain a vapor barrier. Ours didn’t, which meant that the windows were thick with condensation when the shades went up in the morning, and often had to be mopped off with a rag. A layer of something waterproof, on the side of the insulation closest to the interior space, will prevent that, and avoid problems with mold, water damage, and the like.<br><br>Beyond these three points, the options are nearly unlimited. It’s entirely possible to use something like ordinary curtains to get the same effect, as long as they have something holding them tight against the wall on all sides of the window opening. Shades were a very common approach, and so were shutters of various kinds, hinged or sliding or even concealed within pockets built out from the walls. One of the most elegant examples I know involved built-in bookcases along a northern wall; there was a gap behind them just wide enough to make room for sliding shutters, and at night the homeowner simply pulled two inconspicuous handles together and turned the window into an R-12 wall.<br><br>These same techniques can be used in two additional ways to help save energy. The first is to use insulated coverings inside a solar greenhouse at night. The same clear surfaces that let sunlight into a greenhouse lose plenty of heat at night; equip your greenhouse with some sort of movable insulation to cover the glazing at night, and it becomes possible to run a solar greenhouse much more efficiently in cold weather. The other is the old medieval custom of using cloth hangings, a few inches out from the wall, to insulate an otherwise chilly space. That’s what all those tapestries were doing in medieval castles; insulated wall hangings can function exactly the same way in a modern house, so long as they extend from floor to ceiling on exterior walls, and have both a reasonable amount of insulation in them and a couple of inches of air space between the fabric and the wall.<br><br>None of these things are particularly difficult or expensive to make. If you have some basic facility with a sewing machine – and if you don’t, getting it might be a worthwhile project sometime very soon – you can knock together a good set of insulated window coverings for a couple of rooms in a couple of hours, using storebought sheets and some quilt batting as your raw materials. If you know how to handle a saw, a screwdriver, and a carpenter’s square – again, these are skills worth acquiring soon if you don’t have them already – it won’t take any longer to turn some lumber, hardboard, and rigid board insulation into good sturdy insulated shutters.<br><br>The time to get these skills, and get your window insulation in place, is now. Just as the inhabitants of dying empires in the past used to listen nervously for the distant sound of hoofbeats that told them the barbarians were on the way, those who are paying attention to the predicament of our own time need to get used to listening for the cracks and judderings of an overburdened system as it lurches down the slope of its own decline and fall. Those faint noises and brief glimpses may be the closest thing to a warning that we’ll get.<br><br><span style=font-size:130%>Resources</span><br><br>Once again, the Master Conservers papers at<a href=http://www.culturalconservers.org/library.php> the Cultural Conservers Foundation</a> website provide a good introduction; the paper you want for this week’s topic is titled, not surprisingly, "Insulated Window Coverings." There were also several very good books on the subject published back in the day; far and away my favorite is William K. Langdon’s <i>Movable Insulation</i>, but William Shurcliff’s <i>Thermal Shades and Shutters</i> and Judy Lindahl’s <i>Energy Saving Decorating</i> are also worth a look if you can find them,

Quite effective too!<br><br>It's a funny thing reading these window and insulation blogs from down under (no offence intended). The reason I find it funny is because all of my windows on my place had to be built not to resist the transfer of heat from the inside out, but the other way around from the outside in! That is, they had to be designed, tested and built to withstand fire.<br><br>Needless to say, because of the cost, which quite scared me, I have 8 windows in the house in total! No large wall of windows which seem to be such a feature of new houses these days.<br><br>On the plus side the house is very temperate! If you can remove windows per JMG's advice it really is money well spent.<br><br>I've seen a bit of press here about the fears in the US over US$4 per gallon fuel. <br><br>We pay about AU$1.40 per litre (there are about 3.8 litres to a gallon) and it's not really the end of the world, although things are starting to get expensive...

<div class="avtb a_61c74c" id=c442861324575051072></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/02333438671130100114 rel=nofollow>Bill Pulliam</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>We've found that warm window coverings make a big difference in our house. We cover the top of the "chimney" by making a separate strip of material that lies horizontally across the space between the wall and the curtain, with the curtain hung a few inches out from the wall. As for condensation, with a storm window installed also I usually find that the temperature of the interior glass surface stays warm enough that this is not a routine problem. But Tennessee is not Seattle, and our wintertime dew points average considerably lower! We did have this problem in semiarid Colorado on windows without storm windows, Even just a pane of safety glazing nailed up over the outside of the window without any weatherstripping was enough to make it go away in that climate. <br><br>A few small points about R-values for windows... there are other contributions than just the R-value of the glass panes themselves. The air space between the panes also contributes, as does the boundary layer of air on the surfaces that is affected in its movement by friction with the window. This latter effect is extremely dependent on wind speed, and is one of two reasons why windows are colder on windy days (the other being infiltration). The boundary layer on the indoor side is important, too, and "indoor winds" break it down and increase heat flow also. This is part of what happens with the "chimney" effect behind the curtain. It also happens when you have fans blowing in a room. So if you put in a ceiling fan to mix the air in a room and keep the hot air from all pooling at the ceiling (generally a good idea) but you do not have curtains with "chimney blocks" to keep this wind from blowing across your windows, you will increase the heat loss from the house.<br><br><a href=sound-of-distant-hoofbeats.html#c442861324575051072 title="comment permalink">3/3/11, 5:23 AM</a><br><br>

My point is that windowology is very climate specific. Having been fortunate enough to design and build our own home (with the mindset that it will be our last earthly home), its design is very site specific: no northern exposure (earth bermed from northeast to northwest); maximum glass to the south; overhangs appropriate to the seasons. Glorious light and passive solar. Let the sun in!<br><br>We use thermal curtains during the few months that we actually need to insulate the windows. A nearby hotel was sold and remodeled and we were able to get more than enough insulated commercial curtains to do every window for $50 US. While some cutting and sewing was required in the bedrooms, I consider this to be one of my best scrounging scores. We even like the green striped pattern. <br><br>I too lived in Seatle for a time, though as a 'Son of the South' I found the battle with seasonal affective disorder sapped my personal energy too much. I prefer to wear a sweater, stock an extra cord of wood, and let the light in. Opening and closing curtains has become a routine habit, along with other everyday chores.<br><br>I look forward to more discussion on passive heating, passive cooling, and adapting to moderate interior temperature swings. We have become acustomed to meeting the seasons halfway.<br><br>Spring has arrived in the South and soon we will open all of the windows, replace the screens, and feel the breezes that waft through our home until October arrives again. Best to all.<br><br><a href=sound-of-distant-hoofbeats.html#c8089352380553441246 title="comment permalink">3/3/11, 6:14 AM</a><br><br>

I remember the outside walls had, underneath the wallpaper, a layer of expanded polystyrene. It was only about one millimeter thick and came in rolls of a similar size to wallpaper. I also remember that above each window was a topper of wood. It was cloth covered - a matching color to the walls. Inside it, some fairly rigid fabric brushed against the top of the curtains, so much so that it could be a pain opening the curtains if curtain liners (a second, lighter curtain behind the first) were also hung. Back in those days, I thought it was for decoration, to hide the curtain rail. Reading this post, I immediately saw that the purpose was to make it harder for warm air to enter at the top. <br>We also had net curtains in the windows. I used to think they were for privacy but I can see how the extra layer trapped air near the window and reduces heat loss.<br><br>We’re replacing our windows at present. Currently they are single pane and the temperature difference near them is noticeable. There are some nice rebates for energy efficient windows which reduce the cost. <br><br>On a completely different note, Barbra picked up a 19th century pie safe at a recent auction, in almost perfect condition. I finally learned why one of the cupboards we had as a kid had punched tin vents in the side.<br><br><a href=sound-of-distant-hoofbeats.html#c5458789938020172584 title="comment permalink">3/3/11, 8:25 AM</a><br><br>

You know, Hell Fire and Brimstone $0, Human Suffering $0, Food shortages $0, for everything else, there's MasterCard. Rolls eyes. Sometimes you just can’t make this stuff up.<br><br>Window coverings are something that I have thinking about and researching for the past few months. I have curtains that cover the two biggest windows in the house, but I will be taking heed of the warning about the "chimney effect" and will be working to create some sort of valance to lay over the top as Bill suggested. <br><br>As for my other windows, my house has some of those crazy plastic fake shudders that were designed for looks, and not practical application, during the three-decade long energy orgy that is about to come to a close. It really is sad to see something that was once a staple of an energy-efficient building relegated to the role of house pox, designed for aesthetics but nothing more. I am going to be working on replacing these with some real-deal insulated shudders this summer so that they will be ready to go next fall/winter. I am also working on some window covers of the type Heffer mentioned in his reply. With both of these improvements in place, I think I will be able to raise my R-value considerably. <br><br>On a side note, I found a very good copy of Rainbook at a local consignment shop last weekend! I was browsing through the history section, and there it was, calling out to me. I grabbed it up, and immediately marched to the counter in order to purchase it. The people in the store probably though I was nuts as I am sure that my death grip on the book was evident but hey, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.<br><br><a href=sound-of-distant-hoofbeats.html#c9095779083703354736 title="comment permalink">3/3/11, 11:54 AM</a><br><br>

Native traditional garb in hot humid places is generally pretty skimpy; almost nonexistent in some cases.

It can serve as a temporary measure while you come up with something more aesthetically pleasing and long lasting, too. <br><br>All you need is a roll of bubble wrap (I got enough to do my house - with a lot of glass - at Staples for $24CDN) and a spray bottle filled with water or vinegar &amp; water or windexy stuff.<br><br>Cut a piece of bubble wrap to fit the glass (just the glass). Spray the glass with the spray bottle, and smoosh the bubble wrap against the glass (bubble side to the glass). It'll stick. That's it, you're done. <br><br>If it peels off (we live in DRY Alberta and usually one or two come off the windows spontaneously over the course of the winter) just respray and reapply. SolarGary has great info on this (and other ideas) at BuildItSolar.com. One nice thing about this solution is that it does not trap moisture anywhere, so if you have condensation issues, this may be a good option.<br><br>For the windows we need to see out of (to check the animals, mostly) we splurged and bought a cling-film coating at Home Depot (expensive - about $30 CDN for a piece about the size of a patio door). It is barely visible when in place and supposedly blocks incoming heat in the summer as well (not enough of a problem for us, so I haven't really checked).<br><br>Almost all the windows have curtains that go floor to ceiling (to prevent the chimney effect - I see now I need some valances over the others!) and the difference is amazing. We got our heavy cotton duck drapes at Ikea.<br><br>We have a 'point and shoot' thermometer, so I just measured: uncovered glass is 2-4 degrees C cooler than the glass covered with bubble wrap/expensive sticky stuff, and the space between window and curtain is 2-4 degrees C cooler than the temperature of the curtain facing the room. So bubble wrap plus standard cotton duck drapes (single layer, not insulated) buffers between 4 and 8 degrees C, which is significant. We leave the bubble wrap on from Remembrance Day to Easter, generally - the cling film stuff stays all year, as it's see-through. In the spring, just roll up the pieces, label them for which window they fit, and put 'em back up next year. Mine are on winter #3 and show no signs of deterioration.<br><br>We do like our south facing glass - the house warms up a good 4 degrees C or more even on a really cold winter day, just from the sunlight (even with the bubble wrap on), and with so little winter daylight, we appreciate the sunshine!<br><br><a href=sound-of-distant-hoofbeats.html#c4426666709410058003 title="comment permalink">3/4/11, 11:49 AM</a><br><br>

We plant various fast growing annual vines (beans, morning glory, peas, cardinal vine, etc.) which provide shade yet let the air through. We put planters on our essentially flat roof and grow cucumbers and squash on the roof.<br><br>High ceilings; Our living space has a 15 foot ceiling with windows near the top that stay open all summer. Natural convection and a ceiling fan pull hot air up and out.<br><br>Fans; I grew up in Georgia (USA) without air conditioning. All of the homes had 'attic fans' that ran at night evacuating warm air, replacing it with cool (lower rel. humidity) air. By morning the house would be quite cool and remain so for most of the day. One caveat is that interior doors need to be left open (when did folks get so private anyway?). Door stops were common to keep them open.<br><br>Fans; Feng shui types say that ceiling fans shouldn't be over beds. Poppycock. We have a fan over our bed and I have trouble sleeping now, without its gentle breeze and quiet wisper. Removable window fans in bedrooms are nice as well, especially for those who insist on closing bedroom doors.<br><br>Covered porches; as Bill P. and others have mentioned, porches/screened porches are wonderful places to hang out in the evenings until things cool down indoors. Growing up in the South, most homes had porches; an important center of family life in Summer. Grow seasonal plants and vines around the porch for cool shade, beauty, and edibles. An outdoor rated ceiling fan is a nice addition.<br><br>Proper clothing; This one's a no-brainer but loose cotton is great. I have a collection of oversized t-shirts for Summer. I also like bib overalls. I buy them a bit too large so I can wear sweaters in winter, nice and loose in summer, and they can be worn without a shirt. Requires a well established personality/moderate ego :-) Love the pockets, especially in the garden, and needing no belt is nice; lets air circulate.<br><br>Cold showers in the evening or a dip in a cool stream or pond. Again, nothing new here.<br><br>Acclimatize your body for the seasons. I'm not sure what to say to folks who work all day in an air conditioned office. When I stopped working in an air conditioned space most of the time, all sorts of ailments disapeared. Sinus and alergy problems decreased and the hottest days became much less stressful. Try an evening walk to allow your body to adjust. I usually work in the garden during the cooler evenings and eat a very lite supper. <b>Lose weight</b> Fat people are hot people.<br><br>Summer kitchens are fun and keep the heat outdoors. A grill and small sink on the porch can suffice.<br><br>Adjust habits around the house to keep it cool; Folks are used to keeping warm/cool with the push of a button. Programable thermostats are great for a high energy lifestyle; set and forget. Maintaining comfort in a low energy lifestyle requires active management. Learn when to turn fans on/off. Simple timers and fan thermostats are great but good habits are better. Knowing when to open/close windows and curtains becomes second nature. Replacing screens and planting shade producing annuals is a spring ritual at our home, as is filling the wood shed in the fall.<br><br>Those of you who live in heat sink cities have a special set of problems. Keeping one or two rooms cool and spending evenings outdoors helps, as do fans. Use AC only to reduce the humidity and fans to cool your bodies. Saves money/resources/energy. Given a chance, most bodies will adapt.<br><br>A nice cold Gin and Tonic or iced tea works wonders when things get sweltering......don't forget the lime ;-)<br><br><a href=sound-of-distant-hoofbeats.html#c2980586021688200011 title="comment permalink">3/5/11, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>

The house consisted of a wide central hall/room the entire length of the house (outside doors at both ends, in other words), oriented to catch the prevailing breeze. The other rooms were arrayed on each side of this central hall. It was a very hot humid day, and the central room was very comfortable with a breeze. <br><br>Here in not-as-hot Colorado, we have two large openable skylights.

The test setup: old single-pane wood sash double hung windows with exterior storm windows, caulked and weather stripped. Two sets of curtains on each window, an inner set that is thin, sheer, and lacy, plus an outer set that is multiple layered, thick, and insulated. Curtains hang from near the ceiling to the floor. Test metric: the air temperature near the inside surface of the windows, in the gap between window and curtain if the curtains are closed (i.e. a thermometer sitting on top of the lower sash). The idea here is that the colder the air is right up against the inner window, the less heat will be flowing through the total window assembly to the outside world.<br><br>Results -- the most important thing appears to be to cut off air flow across the window, even if this is done by just a thin single-layer curtain. Closing just the inner sheer curtain dropped the temperature behind it substantially. Closing the outer insulated curtain resulted in an additional, but much smaller drop in the temperature. Removing the fabric "chimney block" from the top of the curtains caused a very sharp increase in temperature, meaning a very large increase in heat loss, as the air began cirulating behind the curtains. Just closing the thin sheer curtain with the "chimney block" in place was better (lower temperature) than closing both sets of curtains (including the thick insulated ones) without the "chimney block" installed. <br><br>Tucking and taping the curtains to the wall to make a tighter fit did give some slight additional improvement, but is was pretty small.<br><br>So, my little results suggest that, doing the most effective things first, these would be the priorities:<br><br>First, put up any curtains at all and block off the air space at the top so that room air will no longer circulate across the windows. Even thin flimsy curtains will help if they block the air. <br><br>Then, work on thicker insulating curtains.<br><br>Finally, if you like, work on making a tight fit at the sides and bottoms of the curtains.<br><br><a href=sound-of-distant-hoofbeats.html#c3642613362347896984 title="comment permalink">3/6/11, 12:41 PM</a><br><br>

Maybe you're just concerned about making it through the next two or three decades, but what about beyond that? Also, don't we really need to change some fundamental features of our habitations so as to exist--persist?--in the long run? I'm thinking, for example, of why humans insist on living on the surface of the earth. Why not underground, where heating and cooling have quite different features and requirements than living on the surface.

That's the one that you install in a centrally located ceiling to exhaust the air from the living space into the attic, and then out the attic vents (fresh air is drawn through windows and doors into the living space). Technically the true "attic fan" is a fan that exhausts hot air from the attic and draws fresh air into the attic through the attic vents; it does not move the air in the living space. It can be confusing when you start looking online for the equipment and installation info. <br><br>I grew up with "attic fans" = whole house exhaust fans, and installed one in our present house very soon after buying it. They use little electricity and move a huge amount of air. I actually use ours quite often for heating as well as cooling; on warm early spring days when the house retains a winter chill, the fan can blow out winter and suck in spring really fast.

We'd open our bedroom windows and put a doorstop in to keep the doors open, and the bedrooms cooled beautifully. All the warm air headed towards that fan - so you wanted it as far away from where you were sleeping as possible.<br><br>Later, we moved to a house that had an attic doorway right in the hallway outside the bedrooms. Dad made a frame that fit in the attic door, wired a switch to the hallway, and laid the box fan in the attic door opening (with a set of louvres below - a later edition of the same system used a square of the plastic 'egg crate grate' for fluorescent lights). You flipped the switch and the fan sucked air out of the house and up into the attic (which was, of course, not airtight and had ventilation gaps at the eaves). By 2 or 3 in the morning, you almost always have to turn the fan off as the house gets too cold (mind you, outdoors is pretty chilly most summer nights).<br><br>In the fall, you take the fan and set it in the attic, and replace the insulated attic door.

No scientific opinion, but my take has always been that outside of tropical rainforests, biochar is not needed for soil quality improvement or retention. If I actually had some evidence-at-hand that the biochar argiculturalists of Amazonia had become farmers elsewhere and were adapting to their new conditions -instead of just presuming it from what little I have read about their behavior- then maybe my take WOULD be -a little- scientific ;).<br><br>Oh, and for what its worth, the Amazonian biochar folks were also more silviculture focused than most of today's would-be biocharistos will likely be.

They can be bought from various suppliers online for very reasonable prices. Mine has been trouble-free. <br><br>One problem they create is the big uninsulated hole in the ceiling; even when the louvers are closed they don't block heat flow very well. I made an insulated door that closes over the bottom of the fan (it swings down into the living space, not up into the attic), rigged it so that it could be latched open or closed, and painted both sides to match the ceiling. It is just a layer of rigid foam insulation between two sheets of plywood with a wooden frame -- very easy to make. I also wired the fan so that it turns on and off with a wall switch rather than using the dangling pull cord provided (I still use the pull cord to adjust the speed between low and high). <br><br>Re: biochar -- the specific Amazonian circumstances it evolved in were deep sands in very hot and rainy environments that had little capacity to hold on to nutrients (tropical spodosols for the technically minded). The charcoal provides nutrient holding capacity. If your soil already contains some clay and organic matter (the large majority of soils do), or is not in a high-rainfall climate with the resulting soil leaching, biochar is likely no better than a bunch of other more readily available soil amendments -- like compost and manure!<br><br><a href=sound-of-distant-hoofbeats.html#c6499567953527178 title="comment permalink">3/7/11, 3:45 PM</a><br><br>

I wonder whether it would actually be beneficial to my situation at all. I too believe its primary track record is in the tropics and I live in a cold temperate climate (-35 to 32 degrees C). <br><br>Speaking from imperfect knowledge on the matter here are my thoughts. Generally speaking organic matter as a percent of total soil increases as one moves from warm to cool. Soil organic matter in southern Missouri is going to be something like 2.5% while in Minnesota it could be around 5%. For plant health the important thing is the rate of breakdown of carbonaceous material and its concomitant release of nutrients. The rate of both plant growth and organic material decomposition is highly temperature dependent. In a cool soil decomposition occurs more slowly, thus nature provides that a larger stock of carbon builds in the soil to the point that the total breakdown of material in Minnesota roughly equals that of a similar soil type in Missouri. <br><br>Carbon based molecules have many benefits in the soil as readers of this blog are surely aware. I suspect that highly weathered soils such as are found in the tropics have more to gain from the addition of stable carbon that nitrogen and other nutrients adhere to than less weathered, more fertile, cooler soils do. Perhaps in moist, hot climates the rate of decomposition is so high that even fecund growth can't keep up with total breakdown. Also, I can see there being some sort of special adsorbing property of biochar that hold on to plant essentials more effectively than the clay colloids do in the face of copious rain. In some places loss of nutrients to leaching is less of an issue than in others. Perhaps if I lived in a wet part of Oregon or Washington I'd be a little more excited about trying biochar in a cool climate...<br><br><a href=sound-of-distant-hoofbeats.html#c4108677217836249098 title="comment permalink">3/7/11, 6:40 PM</a><br><br>

Our consumerist society has spent a LOT of time and $$$ convincing us that 'products' are key to everything. "Buy a new 'product' and your problems are fixed!" As, in my opinion, the whole idea behind Green Wizardry is to try to break away from this mindset, I advise everyone to rethink the idea of replacing your windows. <br><br>Yes, there are better insulated windows available, and they make sense in some situations, but we can get just as far by making sure they are up to snuff, and addressing the window treatments and storm windows / shutters mentioned in this discourse. <br>New windows are expensive, and often ruin the aesthetics of your building for many reasons. The least of which is that they usually don't fit. (Harry Lerwill's statement about installing smaller windows makes me cringe. No offense, and it could be your best option, but I've seen this done so many times and it usually looks horrible)<br><br>We have lost all our "craftsmen" in america. All we are left with are construction workers that install products. New windows are a quick fix with a short track record. The old single pane windows in my 1768 farm house are still in good shape with service every 1/4 to 1/2 century. And yes they can be weatherized to eliminate drafts. People weren't stupid just because they didn't use petroleum plastics, rubbers, and foams. The Anderson double pane windows in my 1970's built apartment (on the same property) are now drafty, the plastic seals are breaking, some double panes are cloudy inside, and they have to be propped up with sticks (just like the 1768 windows) due to the mechanisms breaking. NONE of it is serviceable. I have to install an entire new window to fix any of these problems. <br><br>How will you construct yourself a double pane replacement in the future we're worried about? How will you fix the plastic parts that are out of production? Mine already are and it has nothing to do with collapse… The windows were top of the line and are only 30 years old! <br><br>The advantage of a double pane window is what? Insulation? We're addressing that in this blog. Drafts? Drafts can be addressed. Old windows aren't hard to fix properly. In the meantime, a quick fix is to use clay rope sold especially for the purpose. I've used the Mortite brand from my local hardware store. Cost? $4-$5 <br>Quick search = http://www.toolboxsupply.com/productdetails.aspx?sku=10537048&amp;source=GoogleBase<br><br>To find out more about windows and how to rehab them, check out John Leeke's Historic Homeworks website, forum and books:<br>www.historichomeworks.com<br><br>As a side note, anyone looking to "update" their old house should browse this forum first to familiarize themselves with the possible perils of using new building techniques on old buildings. Old buildings were built the way they were for a reason. It's important to know "why" before making a decision about changing them.<br><br>Michael is building a new house and it makes sense to try to get the best window in that situation. I'm simply suggesting that weatherizing, storm windows, and the treatments suggested here can get you as close or better than a new window alone. Put the money you save in windows toward something else!<br><br><a href=sound-of-distant-hoofbeats.html#c7681223103407080855 title="comment permalink">3/8/11, 11:09 AM</a><br><br>
