One of the bits of mental flotsam that very often drifts to the surface in discussions of peak oil is the assumption, as common among diehard peakniks as it is among the most delusionally cornucopian of their opponents, that the “lottle” principle applies to energy: that is, if a little is good, a lot’ll always be better. Widespread though this belief may be, I’ve come to doubt it, and those doubts crystallized as I rode the train from my home in western Maryland to Minneapolis and back during the interval between this <i>Archdruid Report</i> and the last.<br><br>Yes, I took the train. To most North Americans – people on other continents tend to be more realistic on the subject – that’s a shocking thought, though these days the surprise often gives way to nostalgic wistfulness. The United States once had the world’s biggest and best rail system, and Canada’s wasn’t far behind. Quite a few people alive today still remember the days when fast, efficient rail service connected all but the smallest towns here in America. These days, you have to choose your location carefully to benefit from the scraps that still remain; one of the reasons my spouse and I selected the old red brick mill town where we now live was that, unlike dozens of equally pleasant towns nearby, it has daily train service on a major route connecting the east coast and the Midwest.<br><br>The reach of rail service even across North American distances in the first half of the twentieth century was made possible by the simple fact that on land, at least, rail transit is more energy-efficient than any other mode of transportation. Diesel-electric locomotives, the standard type in service nowadays, use essentially the same technology as a modern hybrid car, and since they don’t have to make sudden starts and stops, whip around sharp turns, or climb steep grades, the energy content of their diesel fuel goes a very long ways; as a rule of thumb, a locomotive can pull a ton of goods or passengers for not much less than a thousand miles on one gallon of diesel. That means, among other things, that it took less petroleum to get me from Cumberland, Maryland to Minneapolis than it takes a yuppie driving alone in a big SUV to go shopping at the local mall.<br><br>Still, the energy efficiency of train travel is only part of the picture. Another is the simple fact that train travel, even in these days of reduced budgets and limited routes, is among the few really civilized modes of travel left. Take a car and you can count on doing battle with traffic hour after hour on one freeway after another; take a plane and, after you trudge through the lines and get ogled or groped by government functionaries who apparently believe that the Fourth Amendment can be suspended by executive order, you get to experience the joys of being stuffed into a winged sardine tin, breathing your fellow passengers’ stale exhalations, and staring at blank cloudscape, for however many hours it takes to get where you’re going.<br><br>On a train, by contrast, there’s plenty of room and fresh air; you can sit back, put your feet up, watch the scenery roll by, and enjoy the experience. If the child two rows ahead gets fussy, you’re not stuck listening; there’s always the lounge car, where you can duck downstairs, pick up a beer at the cafe, and sit at one of the tables and read while four old guys at another table play pinochle. The food in the diner car’s on a par with most roadside restaurants and better than most of what you’ll find at an airport, and if you spring for a cabin in one of the sleeper cars – on long runs, I highly recommend this – the meals are included.<br><br>If all this suggests that I’m an unabashed partisan of train travel, well, that’s a fair assessment. There are good reasons for that just now, starting with the very high energy efficiency of rail travel, and the advantages of a mature technology that could be redeployed in a hurry without the bottlenecks and dead ends that are an inevitable part of bringing any new technology on line. Most of the world’s other industrial societies, and quite a few of the nonindustrialized nations, won’t even have to go through the redeployment process; they had the common sense to keep their rail networks intact when the United States was busy selling most of its own for scrap, and thus may end up with a critical economic advantage in the difficult years immediately ahead of us.<br><br>Here in America, by contrast, whenever passenger rail travel is discussed, two objections come up as reliably as a greasy airport breakfast on a rough flight. The first, mostly heard from the current crop of pseudoconservatives, is the insistence that passenger trains are creatures of government subsidies and should be abolished as a money-saving measure. This argument would have a bit more force if the modes of transport such people prefer didn’t get far more in the way of government largesse than the railroads do. Air travel is economically viable in the United States, for example, only because every level of government from the federal government right down to individual counties and cities carries much of the financial burden of the airports, air traffic control, and other services that make it possible, and subsidize aircraft manufacturers into the bargain.<br><br>As for automobiles, drivers pay only a tiny fraction of the cost of building and maintaining the network of streets, roads, and highways; they aren’t billed for the government money that goes to keep auto manufacturers afloat, and they don’t get charged for the immense direct and indirect government subsidies that prop up the oil industry. These subsidies include, of course, the costs of repeated military interventions in the Middle East; it will not have escaped the attention of my readers, I trust, that nations selected for liberation from tyranny by the United States and its allies are inevitably those who happen to sit atop large amounts of fossil fuels. If car owners had to pay all these costs themselves, you’d see very few cars on the roads, just as air travel would still be a prerogative of the “jet set” if corporate lobbying hadn’t pushed so many of the costs onto the government. Myself, I’d be happy to see all government subsidies for transportation abolished, and just as happy if they were set at a fixed sum per passenger mile and shared out on that basis among all transport modes; either way, trains would win hands down.<br><br>The second objection is not limited to any one end of the political scene; it’s found straight across the spectrum, and though it seems really rather frivolous at first glance, it leads into territory not often explored in the last century or so. This is the claim that train travel is too slow. It’s true, to be sure, that it took longer for me to get to Minneapolis from Cumberland by train than it would have taken by air. Counting a layover in Chicago long enough to meet a local friend for lunch, I was traveling some twenty-seven hours each way. It’s hard to judge exact times by air, since the Cumberland airport hasn’t had commercial service for nearly a decade, but before then, a puddle-jumper to Pittsburgh or Cleveland and a direct flight from there to Minneapolis, counting the likely layover, might have taken eight hours each way; add in two hours to get through security and the rest of it, and it’s still a good deal faster than climbing aboard the westbound train at 7 o’clock one evening and rolling into Minneapolis around ten o’clock the next night.<br><br>Granted, then, it takes more time. The upside, as mentioned earlier, is that the time you spend is less of a waste, since twenty-seven hours of train travel is on average less exhausting, more productive, and a good deal more enjoyable than ten hours of air travel. It’s an interesting situation. In theory, it would be possible to make air travel as pleasant as train travel, and once upon a time the attempt was even made – I recall airline ads from my youth that boasted about the amount of legroom passengers were allotted and the quality of the meals they were served, rather than talking solely about destinations, as they generally do today, and trying to make potential passengers forget about the unpleasant process of getting there and back. In practice, a flying experience more or less as comfortable as an ordinary coach ticket on a train will cost you close to an order of magnitude more.<br><br>It’s entirely possible that this is in large part an effect of industrial civilization’s overshoot of its energy resource base. In the realm of energy economics, after all, the primary differences between rail travel and air travel are first, that the latter uses a great deal more concentrated energy than the former – the equivalent in jet fuel of the fraction of a gallon of diesel that brought me to Minneapolis, after all, might not even have gotten me off the ground if I’d taken a plane – and second, that the latter technology is a great deal more complex than the former and thus demands much more in the way of energy and resource inputs. As resource limits clamp down, the more energy- and resource-intensive a technology is, the more likely it is to show the economic strain first; in the case of air travel, that strain shows up in the form of crowded seats, dwindling amenities, and repeated fiscal crises for air carriers.<br><br>If the same logic works on a broader scale, and it’s hard to think of a good reason why it wouldn’t, it may be possible to anticipate which industries will be hardest hit by the opening rounds of energy supply contraction by paying attention right now to which industries are slashing the quality of their products and services fastest. In an age when media spin and doctored statistics make it hard to see through the fog, this may be an early warning system worth cultivating.<br><br>Still, there’s another issue at work here, one that I’m still only beginning to explore. Most things in life have an optimum which is found considerably below the maximum. At some point in adolescence, for example, most of us find out that there’s such a thing as drinking too much beer. Most of us have eaten too much food at one time or another, and information overload – the point at which taking in more information becomes an obstacle to understanding instead of a help – is a familar state to many of us. Sort through the other activities of life, and pretty consistently there’s a point at which adding more takes away from the experience rather than adding to it.<br><br>Today’s economic orthodoxy, to be sure, denies this common human experience, and treats every increment as a benefit. That’s one of the reasons that Americans have created the first civilization in human history where storage units to stash all the things people buy and never get around to enjoying is a significant industry. Heretical as though it may be, though, I’d like to suggest the possibility that there is such a thing as too much energy per capita, and that America may well have been in that territory for a good many decades now.<br><br>I’ve mentioned before, and it’s worth repeating, that the average European uses around a third as much energy per capita as the average American, and has a better standard living by most of the usual measures. Until recently – more specifically, until I mulled over the subject while looking out the window of the lounge car while the woods and plains of Wisconsin rolled by – I’d assumed that this was simply a function of waste and mismanagement on our part, and a more efficient use of limited resources on theirs. Still, I find myself wondering if there’s a more direct connection between these two factors. Is it possible that Europeans have, by and large, a better standard of living <i>because</i> they use less energy, not in spite of that fact?<br><br>Ask the question and it’s not hard to find obvious examples. Consider the way that so many Americans buy gasoline-powered riding lawnmowers, and suffer the health impacts of a flaccid middle age – with attendant costs to the economic system – that could have been avoided by the moderate exercise gotten by using a push mower. Consider how much of the industrial world’s intractable unemployment has been driven by the replacement of skilled human labor with machines made possible by the availability of cheap abundant energy. For that matter, consider the way that the availability of energy correlates with the civilian death toll in wars. Before the age of fossil fuels, the annihilation of the entire population of a city happened relatively rarely, and took an extraordinary amount of hard labor on the part of the attackers. By the twentieth century it was relatively easy, and therefore routine.<br><br>Yet my sense – and it’s no more than an inchoate sense as yet, needing further exploration and definition – is that these examples don’t touch the core of the issues involved. Those of my readers who have put into practice some of the ideas discussed here in the green wizardry posts of the last eight months or so, or who didn’t need those reminders to try out some of the practices in question, have already come closer to that core. I have yet to meet anyone outside of an advertisement who was exhilarated by the act of cranking up the thermostat when it gets cold, say, or getting groceries from a store. I have known quite a few people who were exhilarated, and more, when a passive solar panel or a garden bed that was the work of their own hands warmed a house or contributed to a meal.<br><br>It may simply be that evolution didn’t prepare our species for the impact of our brief and self-limiting encounter with the Earth’s carbon reserves. Doubtless, as industrial civilization gradually comes apart and the flow of energy to individuals and communities falters, most of us will find ourselves at least as far below the optimum level of energy per capita as today’s SUV drivers are above it, and a good many will find themselves facing, abruptly or slowly, that zero-energy-per-capita state we normally call death. Still, for those who are willing to consider the possibility, there’s a chance that learning to use a lot less energy on a daily basis may have compensations at least as great as those involved in taking a few more hours to ride the train.

In the United States we seem to make a fetish of the pursuit of consumption as a measure of well being, with conspicuous consumption of energy as a natural concomitant. The quest for glut is also something of an exercise in status-seeking. For many Americans a car isn't just a vehicle, it's an ego-vehicle, as in the phrase "you are what you drive." <br><br>We're also prone to the delusion that the hovel we live in now is a just a stepping stone on our way to better things, as implied by the term "starter home," often used by real estate agents to describe modest dwellings purchased by young families. I suspect this cultural compulsion is one reason Americans tend move so much more than Europeans, typically in pursuit of career. I noticed while in Italy that people there who live in tenements try to make them as pleasant and habitable as possible, rather than treating them as dumps to be left behind on some imagined road to Beverly Hills. <br><br>I hope I get the chance learn to live with less energy rather than with none at all.<br><br><a href=#c8154331032053097774 title="comment permalink">3/30/11, 10:51 PM</a><br><br>

Your ode to trains is right on the mark as well-- I live in Japan where trains are an everyday part of the landscape, and the affordable comfort of the shinkansen (no sleeper cars, it gets you anywhere in the country within 5 hours) impresses me frequently. These are perfect examples of overlooked solutions, the sort of things that could change entire worldviews. But I don't think mere education will change people's minds about the imagined benefits of subsidizing air travel or keeping gas cheap. There needs to be a paradigm shift, either from following the example of observers like yourself, or with new guidelines and a little social engineering from political leaders or respected people at the top.<br><br><a href=#c8210189003377298850 title="comment permalink">3/30/11, 11:30 PM</a><br><br>

I too am a great fan of riding the iron rail. Indeed, a decade ago, my wife and I set out from England with the intention of making it to Asia solely on trains (we faltered somewhere around Iran and had to take a winged sardine can). At the risk of boring your readers, here's something I wrote at the time about travelling on Cambodia's decrepit rail system - a post I called 'The slowest, friendliest train on Earth'.<br><br>http://www.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/jasonhep/1/1255374088/tpod.html<br><br>Fast forward a decade and we decided to take the train down to the south of France last summer with our two kids, instead of catching a flight. The cost was roughly the same as flying or driving (approx 900 euros in total or $1,300 at today's exchange rate, for four people) but ... what an adventure. <br><br>Travelling from Copenhagen, where we live, we were allocated our own sleeper car. No security check-in, no limits on baggage and no feeling cramped. Rolling through Germany with the window down and watching the sunset as a peak-capped (slightly befuddled) conductor brought us our evening meal and a glass of wine ... how could planes possibly compete? Oh, and along the way we effectively got two free nights' accommodation and two 'mini breaks' of several hours in Hamburg and Geneva. Needless to say, the kids want to do the whole thing again and have no desire to go on a plane again.<br><br>My only gripe with many modern trains is that, inside, they are too sterile and are beginning to resemble airplanes, which they must compete with. <br><br>I'm sure many of your readers will have heard of The Man in Seat 61 before, but here's a link to his site anyway for those who haven't:<br><br>http://www.seat61.com/<br><br><a href=#c3179594907271715363 title="comment permalink">3/30/11, 11:47 PM</a><br><br>

I've followed the Archdruid Report for about a year and a half and I find it to be the most helpful and sensible blog, both in understanding and anticipating civilizational decline in a broad historical context, as well as the more practical matters involving getting dirt under one's fingernails. <br><br>I live on a small Canadian island off Vancouver Island with a year-round population of about 400. The entire island is off-the-grid and people use modest amounts of electricity from solar panels and micro-hydro (supplemented by gasoline generators for some). The island is serviced by a passenger only ferry that runs three times a day, five days a week. Living here has been a lesson on getting by on modest flows of energy. While not always easy or convenient, I find the quality of life here to be better than any community I've lived in.<br><br>Professor Vaclav Smil, of the University of Manitoba, while not so much in the peak oil camp, has written about energy use per capita and the quality of life. In one study, he shows that for countries all around the world, quality of life indicators (such as infant mortality, female life expectancy, and nutrition levels) rise sharply along with per capita energy use until about 50 or 60 gigaJoules per year. Beyond that level of energy use, the indicators rise less steeply. Beyond about 110 GJ per capita, Smil finds no quality of life gains and that pushing beyond 200 GJ per capita is counterproductive. In comparison, the per capita energy use in Canada and USA is well over 300 GJ per year, and even the efficient Japanese use close to 200 GJ per capita. Somehow this reminds me of Tainter's thesis of diminishing returns and eventually negative returns on increasing complexity (and energy consumption). It seems clear that we in North America have reached the point of negative returns on energy consumption. That is, our quality of life is now in decline while our per capita energy use is at its peak.<br><br>The Smil article I referenced can be found at http://www.vaclavsmil.com/publications/<br>Smil, V. 2010. Science, energy, ethics, and civilization.<br>This is a PDF document. The section on energy use and quality of life is on pages 14-19.<br><br><a href=#c1851579878014245543 title="comment permalink">3/31/11, 12:24 AM</a><br><br>

The wonderful train system is just the beginning. Energy in all forms is much more expensive in Germany -- Germans don't drive if they walk -- so there is almost always at least one bakery, market, bank, restaurant, grade school, church, community center, and town woods within a few blocks of every home. Children don't have unlimited access to TV, video games, and year-round indoor climates set artificially to 72 degrees, so they play outside more. Homes are smaller with less storage space, so people tend to have a few things of very good quality instead of great quantities of junk.

The book "The Paradox of Choice" also argues this Less is More thesis regarding consumer choice (consider just how many kinds of STRAWBERRY jelly there are in a typical supermarket, let alone all things that a person might spread on a piece of bread). I do think our mental health has suffered immeasurably by our species discovering fossil fuels, which has in turn led to our sick and dying society: "Growth" and "Consumption" are seen as more worthy of attention and measurement than "Joy" or "Peace of Mind" or (gods forbid)"Love." This comic is a favorite of mine regarding our consumer-obsessed culture: http://xkcd.com/662/<br>Finally, while evolutionary psychology has its limits and problems, it seems logical that - in the absence of speed, strength, climbing ability, camouflage, etc. - humans evolved a powerful, multi-purpose brain to allow us to survive. Unfortunately, one of the characteristics of that brain that served us quite well until recently is GREED. Just as a fondness for salt or sugar may have had an evolutionary advantage before those substances became so easily available as to cause us health problems, a relentless striving for more and better and faster and more efficient ways of meeting our needs probably helped our species kill the meat, find the plants, and build the shelters and tools that kept us alive. I believe that that DRIVE (what used to be called the libido, before Freud fell out of fashion) is what has led us to the current predicament. It is even possible that those who first fled Europe to "found" America had more of this drive than the people they left behind, and created a governmental and economic system EXPLICITLY based on the notion that humans are innately selfish (we are, but we are also innately altruistic, a trait suppressed by this system). Now, of course, generations (and the discovery of fossil fuels) later, the culture simply feeds on itself, co-opting that drive so that millions of perfectly sane babies grow up having this drive channeled into a desire to Possess and Take and Use, rather than Be and Give and Make (this is called "School"). Extreme speculation, to be sure, but America does seem to be notable in its consistent abuse of anything and everything: energy, drugs, food, guns - you name it, we will find a way to overuse it until people are literally marching in the streets demanding it be taken away from us forcibly. Well, now it is all going to be taken away, but not at all in a way anyone wants.

CSX (rail freight) advertises that they move a ton of freight 442 miles on a gallon of diesel fuel. I don't think they have any motive to low-ball this figure. Your thousand miles is a bit of a stretch.<br><br>Europeans move most of their freight by truck. Here in North America most long distance freight still moves on trains. It's a lot cheaper. <br><br>All rail passenger service is subsidized. More rational societies than mine (Yay, yay, U.S.A.){note sarcasm} do so because of the social and economic benefits of passenger rail.<br><br>150 years ago the U.S. was becoming a continental (sea to shining sea) empire and needed reliable, fast long distance transport to hold it together. The Federal Government offered the railroads free land along the route if they'd build and operate the lines. One of the conditions was that they railroads must offer passenger service.<br><br>For a century the railroads subsidized passenger service losses with part of their freight profits. In the 1950's they successfully lobbied to be released from the passenger service requirement. Part of their argument was that the build out of Eisenhower's new National Highways system made rail service redundant.<br><br>In terms of fuel per pound moved it takes _roughly_ the same amount of fuel to ship (by ship, not plane) cargo across the ocean, down the railroad track, down the highway, and finally home to my house in my car. That is, each step takes roughly the same amount of fuel as the previous one for successively shorter distances.<br><br>This may mean a period in the reduced energy future when import and export is largely limited to regions within 50 miles of a major port.

We need to focus once again on trains. Both you and Kunstler agree on this.<br><br>I only had the occasion to ride Amtrak once in my life. I had only driven, taken a bus, or flown previously and wanted to have the experience of riding a train. It was the mid-1980s and I was in my 20s. I lived in Montana and I was going to visit relatives in Los Angeles.<br><br>It took a long time. I checked the current schedule which seems to be different from what I remember, as we actually got into LA in the afternoon then, not later at night like now.<br><br>Day 1: Bus trip from Helena to Big Sandy took a day, from just before dawn, and what with bus changes and stops, and waiting for the train for about 4 hours once I got there. The train arrived at sunset. It was the "Empire Builder." It is advertised heavily for its route through Glacier National Park. Unfortunately it was nighttime when we got there and pitch black outside. We rode all night on the train until dawn in Seattle, where I changed trains to head south to LA. It wasn't too crowded and I found a quiet row to sleep in. Add 24 hours (running total in transit 48 hours).<br><br>Day 2: Arrive Seattle at dawn. Boarded the "Coast Starlighter" from Seattle to LA. 35 hours of train travel. Another night sleeping, this time more crowded so upright, like on a plane. Dawn in Oakland I think. <br><br>Day 3: Oakland and more industrial zones. The only actual coast I actually saw on the Coast Starlighter going south was starting at San Luis Obispo for a couple of hours. Then we crashed into a semi running a crossing signal and killed the truckdriver and injured the engineer. Took a few hours to clean up that mess. Rolled into LA three hours later than the scheduled 35 hours from Seattle to LA. <br><br>Total from Helena to Los Angeles via bus/train = 24+24+38= 86 hours (about 3 1/2 days)<br><br>Total from Helena to LA via Grayhound = 48 hours (2 days; due to 6 hour stop in Salt Lake City and other stops along the way)<br><br>Total from Helena to LA via private car = varies but less than 24 hours worth of driving at highway speeds, with whatever stops one wants/needs. So if it's just you, it can take 2 days with a motel break, or even more if look at stuff along the way, but switching drivers, you can make it in 24 hours or so.<br><br>Total from Helena to LA via jet = No direct flight, but with change at Seattle or SLC, about 6 hours flying time, plus 2 hours of lines, security, waiting at departure gate = 8 hours or so.<br><br>Anyways, except for the train trip, I have made those other versions of the trip in my younger days dozens of times and am pretty familiar with all the pros and cons. <br><br>My own one-time experience with the train?<br>The food was very expensive and limited in choice. I wish I had had the money to get a sleeping bunk. Interesting people to talk to, you can walk around and hang out in different cars. The price of the ticket was as expensive as a jet, but the trip took almost 4 days instead of 1 day, each way. More room and easier to sleep on a plane but 4 days trapped anywhere in constant transit is pushing it. If you don't have a car, the bus is cheaper than a plane and faster than a train. Of course the social scene on a bus can be -ahem- interesting.<br><br>I am glad I did the train thing and I agree we need to focus on trains for the future. But they really need to build out more connecting passenger service routes in the West if they expect more people to travel that way very much, at least as long as people have alternatives in the jet or car, or even bus. Of course when there are no alternatives, people will do what they have to do.<br><br><a href=#c6962507834180772718 title="comment permalink">3/31/11, 11:15 AM</a><br><br>

It's presented mostly as a parenting manual, but it all builds on a central theme that I think can be applied much more broadly to understand this idea you're talking about here, that maximum energy does not equal maximum quality of life. <br><br>The Continuum Concept is based on the idea that all animals, including humans, are most contented when doing the things their species has evolved to do. Horses like to run, dogs like to chew things and chase squirrels, cats like to sharpen their claws and stalk small animals, and so on. When they're prevented from doing these things, they're unhappy and may exhibit odd, even neurotic behaviors. Today's house cats will "sharpen" their clawless paws and chase around a red dot from a laser pointer in lieu of any more suitable prey. <br><br>The same applies to humans. A curious example is the plethora of farming-themed video games currently available. You take a fundamentally human behavior--digging in the dirt and growing food--and make an electronic simulation of that to be experienced by apartment dwellers while seated comfortably in front of a computer, and it occupies people for hours. It's the same as giving a caged bird a cuttlebone to peck at.<br><br>How much happier would these people be with the opportunity to garden a small allotment? I'm guessing the video game would lose most of its appeal.<br><br>There is a balance point, of course. Most of any species' adaptive behaviors exist for the purpose of survival, and they're a lot more fun when your survival isn't dependent on them. <br><br>Indeed, I took exception to your two examples of what doesn't exhilarate people--turning up the thermostat and buying groceries--because I've lived in situations where I didn't have these luxuries. I once lived in a dilapidated, uninsulated house with only a very inefficient wood stove for heat. It was so cold that I remember once leaving a pot of beans to soak by the fire overnight, and in the morning they were frozen. When I moved out of there into an apartment with central heat, it was a thrill to lie in bed and hear and feel the warmth automatically blowing out of the vent, coming down like rain after a drought. <br><br>Likewise, I lived for a few months in an "efficiency" apartment that had no cooking facilities and no refrigerator. We had what was essentially a coffee maker that we used to heat water to cook noodles. If we wanted fresh food, I had to hike a mile to the store, purchase amounts small enough that we wouldn't have leftovers to refrigerate, and pack the food home on my back. When I finally had a full kitchen and my own car to transport all the groceries I could buy, I felt ridiculously wealthy. It was an exhilarating feeling. But now, years later, now that shopping has gotten to be a chore and most of the things in the store are full of ingredients I'm trying to avoid...it's not so thrilling anymore. I prefer gardening and foraging.<br><br>So there's a balance point in there. If we want a good standard of living, we need enough bounty that we don't feel anxious about our survival, but still have enough of those survival-driven behaviors (like finding food, building shelter, etc.) in our lives to make them fulfilling. I think this is the appeal of camping. Given the choice, most people wouldn't choose to sleep on a hard, damp cellar floor getting eaten by insects. But erect a tent and build a fire out in the woods or someplace equally scenic, and people consider it a privilege to be able to sleep in those conditions. It's because our energy saturated lifestyles have cut us off from what instinctively feels right to us, and getting to reconnect with nature--our own human nature--helps put us back into balance.<br><br><a href=#c5798259614727250147 title="comment permalink">3/31/11, 12:30 PM</a><br><br>

There is a little town, surrounded by farms, and then a few more farms around the next little town. From the centre of either town, you could get to the farms on a bicycle quite easily (or with horses, which would presumably be how it originally worked). This kind of arrangement means that the stuff you need is actually within easy reach, and with the longer growing season, those few farms can probably support the population of the towns they are near.<br>Look at a Google Map image of northern Alberta in comparison. Towns are far, far apart, and it would be a big trip to get to the nearest 'central city' without a vehicle. Admittedly, it was done - our part of the world was populated before cars were common, too, and back then there were spur rail lines linking smaller towns to the larger ones, and one big rail line east to west across the southern part of Canada - it's still there, and I travelled the whole thing once ... delightful way to travel, I agree. <br>Back when you took the train or a horse cart for the 'big trips', people planned their shopping runs a couple of times a year, or had things shipped in (old Eatons catalogues are fascinating!). I suspect that with our climate we need more acres to feed a town, and that accounts for some of our sparser population. I'm just guessing, though.<br>Both geographies can work in a low-energy world (they worked fine a hundred years ago), but they work differently. If things are all nearby, you can walk and shop every day, getting food as you need it. If things are spread out, you need to do more for yourself (mixed farm, garden, etc) and plan carefully for what you don't produce yourself (it's not like you can just walk to town and get it), and you need excellent storage. The advantage way up here, I suppose, is that Mother Nature provides a deep freeze for half the year! ;)<br><br><a href=#c2468541325467198211 title="comment permalink">3/31/11, 12:42 PM</a><br><br>

I prefer to think of it as "Korean-style Permaculture". It was a pleasant jolt to suddenly find one of Master Cho's farming principles articulated in this week’s Archdruid report! One of the Natural Farming principles is to respect the life energy of your flocks and crops by NOT pushing them to the maximum possible yields. Practically speaking it means adjusting the feed of a flock chickens if they are bearing too many eggs so that they bear no more than 75% of the size of the flock per day (9 eggs from 12 chickens per day; try substituting wheat mill run and more greens for some of your corn mash); planting rice (or other crops) sparsely to minimize competition between plants; plucking unripe fruit from overbearing cherry tomatoes or apples so they are bearing three-quarters as much. These are all a rule of thumb; you need to be in communication with your plants and animals. The goal is higher quality produce, longer lived plants and animals and less pest or nutrient problems because of less stress from overproduction. As Stephan wrote quality of life goes up with energy use and income to a certain point then declines (Have you read the book “Your Money of Your Life?”). So too does the quality, and some times the ultimate quantity, of agricultural produce. <br><br>Michael<br>hornofamaltheia.blogspot.com<br><br><a href=#c6515823721966527979 title="comment permalink">3/31/11, 1:59 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not sure if one should compare access to energy to standard of living or quality of life, nor really how to define them. It's easy enough to see a connection between access to energy, a more sedentary lifestyle and decreasing physical fitness. But what about a more direct connection? <br><br>I think that perhaps one candidate would be that access to too much energy brings isolation and destruction of cultures and social structures. Once you have enough energy to satisfy your basic needs and a bit extra, further access means more isolation - to the point where today we need very little interaction. With that goes the local cultures that had evolved, to be replaced by artificially generated alternatives that are wholly dependent on energy (and will disappear along with it).<br><br>What brings real happiness are the moments we can connect with others and with the world around us, and access to too much energy blocks that.<br><br><a href=#c1935394222954175267 title="comment permalink">3/31/11, 5:00 PM</a><br><br>

The apparent velocity of the automobile gives you a rewarding feeling, and offers you some options, but ultimately you pay for it at the back-end of the deal. Cars are not a way to get around the law of conservation of energy.<br>Train (and bus) travel is a little bit different.

The wonderful train system is just the beginning. Energy in all forms is much more expensive in Germany -- Germans don't drive if they walk -- so there is almost always at least one bakery, market, bank, restaurant, grade school, church, community center, and town woods within a few blocks of every home. Children don't have unlimited access to TV, video games, and year-round indoor climates set artificially to 72 degrees, so they play outside more. Homes are smaller with less storage space, so people tend to have a few things of very good quality instead of great quantities of junk. Life is slower there -- people congregate in outdoor cafes, take long walks in the local woods, shop at the weekly farmers' market, and gossip with their neighbors over a glass of liquid bread.<br><br> There is a lot we could learn from our European friends . . .</i><br><br>I still live in Germany (over 10 years now) and can confirm that this way of life continues.<br><br>I will soon be traveling by train from Munich to Leipzig for a "Fiber Arts Festival" where weavers, spinners and vendors of hand dyed wool will be present.<br><br>Six of us will be traveling comfortably by train (and of course will have our knitting projects with us).<br><br><a href=#c809685298997270264 title="comment permalink">4/1/11, 1:57 AM</a><br><br>

St. Paul is in the process of renovating the WWI era depot which has been mothballed for 40 years, and turning it into a rail/bus hub for the whole metro area. The new light rail line connecting downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul will terminate there, Amtrak will have a station there, and most east metro buses will make stops there as well.

It hadn't gone very well, and I was looking forward to being back in a cold, but friendly environment. I had to fly to Miami, but then took Amtrak back to Minneapolis, via Washington DC and Chicago. The trip took a little over two days if I remember, but it was a wonderful way to see a part of the country that was new to me, and to ease back into the cold and grey, after four months in the tropics.<br><br>What I'm up to now is at:<br>http://eighthacrefarm.blogspot.com/<br><br><a href=#c3421305906479463896 title="comment permalink">4/1/11, 7:55 PM</a><br><br>

See Wikipedia for an overview of what has become an ever-broadening inquiry. The evidence all seems to be pointing to over-cleanliness, in the sense of keeping kids from playing around in the dirt, as being the cause of numerous diseases for both children and, later in life, for adults. This quite possibly means that The Long Descent is much less to be feared in the medical sense, as it appears a challenged immune system is a healthy immune system. A rapid descent, OTOH, would be less pretty, since you'd see lots more people with compromised immune systems that suddenly had the medical support-system rug pulled out from underneath them.<br><br><a href=#c4035416436861041473 title="comment permalink">4/2/11, 7:40 PM</a><br><br>

Meaning, when culture produces artistic forms that can reliably do a certain job, they are just as much resources as a farming method or an Ostrom-style CPR arrangement.<br><br>You probably know that, on the purely aesthetic question, you have more than just Nietzsche for company here. A favourite statement of these principles:<br><br><i>The more art is controlled, limited, worked over, the more it is free... If everything is permissible to me, the best and the worst; if nothing offers me any resistance, then any effort is inconceivable, and I cannot use anything as a basis, and consequently every undertaking becomes futile... I have no use for theoretic freedom. Let me have something finite, definite—matter that can lend itself to my operation only insofar as it is commensurate with my possibilities. And such matter presents itself to me together with its limitations. I must in turn impose mine upon it. So here we are, whether we like it or not, in the realm of necessity. And yet which of us has ever heard talk of art as other than a realm of freedom? This sort of heresy is uniformally widespread because it is imagined that art is outside the bounds of ordinary activity. Well, in art as in everything else, one can build only upon a resisting foundation: whatever constantly gives way to pressure, constantly renders movement impossible.<br><br>My freedom thus consists in my moving about within the narrow frame that I have assigned myself for each one of my undertakings.<br>I shall go even further: my freedom will be so much the greater and more meaningful the more narrowly I limit my field of action and the more I surround myself with obstacles.

The problem is that usable or not, at whatever speed - there just isn't any. For the hardy, desperate or otherwise non risk averse, hoping the freight has always been an option. But for most of us such extra-legal arrangements are not on the radar - yet.<br><br>Perhaps too much speed is just another manifestation of the problem of too much energy. Even if there were many times more track connecting much more of the (sub)urban build out of the recent past, how much passenger capacity is really needed. Some, to be sure; but how much traveling to distant or even relatively nearby places do we, and more importantly will we, really need to do? Surely the primary purpose for trains will remain freight transport, and accommodating travelers but a secondary concern. Moreover, the necessary speed of those journeys is probably relative to the other options available, say an animal drawn coach or wagon over rough road with few facilities or protections, or perhaps with a few other riders on the backs of animals, or alone, or by the means of one's own feet. A couple of months wages for a space and maybe a seat in a re-purposed box car attached to a train that takes the better part of two weeks to go from Cumberland to Minneapolis will seem like a fantastic opportunity. And for those with enough disposable income to afford such luxury, it will be.<br><br>So, as much as I appreciate even the marginal level of passenger service currently available in the US, I think we might be less concerned with wishing for something that few now see as either desirable or necessary, and that might not actually be all that viable in our inevitably much reduced individual and collective circumstance. However, an expansion of rail service in general, but primarily for freight, will doubtless enhance our options for dealing with a range of collapse scenarios. The initial rail build out in the USA was a national security objective, it bound widely separated population centers economically and politically into one nation. A useful mental exercise is to step back from the very possibly ephemeral internet age and remember that trains were once also a communication conduit, a means for delivering correspondence and news. While it may be difficult for the USA to retain its' current configuration, without a functioning national transportation system dissolution seems a near certainty. Regardless of where one stands on the ultimate disposition of the present political union, retention of the best aspects of our cultural heritage very probably will depend on maintaining our ability to communicate with one another.<br><br><a href=#c2537672854246196970 title="comment permalink">4/4/11, 8:08 PM</a><br><br>

One aspect that he deals with are the ways that higher-speed modes of transit crowd out more efficient and 'democratic' modes, not just in terms of energy but also of time and space.

This caution applies to solar, as much as to wind and other renewable energy sources.<br><br>I want to see full, comprehensive environmental impact assessments for all energy projects (renewable or otherwise) and a programme of constant observation and research, as we move along, to ensure that we aren't simply creating another AGW scale problem for future generations.<br><br><a href=#c4598731430373551266 title="comment permalink">4/7/11, 4:36 PM</a><br><br>

You can see the numbers here: http://cta.ornl.gov/data/index.shtml table 2.12, BTU per passenger mile. Cars are 3437, air is 2995, and intercity rail is 2398. Rail is best, but not by a lot (is uses 70% of what a car does, 80% compared to air). In past years they've had intercity bus, but they didn't for this report -- but when recorded it was considerably more efficient than rail.<br><br>It is a reasonable argument that rail is inefficient because there's little incentive to be efficient, and rail is no less apt to waste energy than anyone else when it is convenient. So perhaps it could be efficient if they tried. But for right now, they aren't.<br><br><a href=#c1058539017886321692 title="comment permalink">5/5/11, 12:25 AM</a><br><br>
