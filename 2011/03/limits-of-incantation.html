Since I started talking about the end of the industrial age in this blog, not quite five years ago, a fair number of my readers have had some difficulty imagining what industrial decline would look like in practice. That’s been a hard question to answer, not least because the notion that the only possible futures are progress or catastrophe has been repeated so often that it’s become integral to most contemporary worldviews.<br><br>Still, events have taken care of the matter. Readers of this blog who still want to know what the decline of an industrial civilization looks like need only take a good look at the latest news.<br><br>I could pull out any number of examples from the ongoing flurry of current affairs, but the ones that come readiest to hand are also the ones on most people’s minds these days. The cascading series of disasters in Japan is first on the list, of course. Poised unsteadily on a set of volcanic islands in one of the world’s most tectonically active areas, the Japanese have been hammered by massive earthquakes and tsunamis at regular intervals since before the dawn of recorded history, with a commensurate cost in death and human suffering; there are good reasons why Japanese culture so insistently stresses the impermanence of life and the transience of worldly things.<br><br>This time, though, the ordinary convulsions of the earth and sea intersected with an aging and brittle technostructure in ways that are amplifying the damage. Exhibit A, of course, is the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Built in the early 1960s using a design now considered dubiously safe, and pushed past the safe limits of its working life for the usual economic reasons, the plant turned out to be just that little bit too fragile to deal with the tsunami. A breakdown in the cooling system launched a series of cascading systems failures; as I write these words, it’s anyone’s guess whether the emergency crews who are risking their lives in the face of potentially lethal radiation will be able to get the crisis under control, or whether a chunk of northeastern Japan will get a dusting of high-level nuclear waste.<br><br>Meanwhile large sections of the global economy are quietly grinding to a halt as products and components from the shattered factory belt of northeastern Japan vanish from the world’s shelves. Global supply chains and just-in-time ordering turned out to have the same problem as every other attempt to improve efficiency by eliminating redundancy: they work great, until something goes wrong and you need a fallback option. Another object lesson in the hazards of too much interconnection is coming from global stock markets, which have been slapped silly by the sensible decision of millions of Japanese to cash in their foreign investments and get some liquidity in place where it counts right now, at home. The yen is up, most stock indexes are down, and another layer of instability has been added to a global economy staggering under the blows it’s already received.<br><br>Instability of another kind comes from the Middle East. In Libya, what looked like yet another canned “color revolution” suddenly had the script torn up by Col. Moammar Gaddafi’s unwillingness to play along. Whatever his failings as a person and a head of state, a lack of resolve is clearly not one of them; while Western politicians were smugly dismissing him as a has-been, Gaddafi marshalled his remaining forces, consolidated his position, and then launched a forceful military response that seems to have turned the civil war in his favor. Proponents of nouveau internet insurgencies take note: tanks, fighter planes, and infantry may be hopelessly old-fashioned, but that doesn’t make them ineffective.<br><br>The ruling house of Bahrain turned to similar methods when the insurgent flashmob occupying large sections of the capital turned violent. A call for help to neighboring monarchs brought in troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who promptly crushed the rising. The Saudis themselves had gotten on top of a similar rising at a much earlier stage; Western reporters in Saudi Arabia have noted with some discomfort that anyone who tried to organize protest rallies on the internet or the cell phone network could not be contacted shortly thereafter. It’s not unreasonable to be appalled at such methods of repression, but it’s worth remembering that the Western heads of state who denounce them, if they were faced with the prospect of an armed insurgency in their own countries, would do exactly the same things.<br><br>Behind the spread of insurgencies across the Arab world, in turn, lies the simple mathematics of food prices. Last month the cost of food worldwide passed the previous record set in 2008. To most people in America, where food accounts for a small portion of the family budget, that’s an inconvenience; to most people in the nonindustrial world, where it’s not uncommon for families to spend half their income putting food on the table, it’s an existential threat. Starving people do desperate things, such as trying to overthrow the local government. Autocratic governments with their backs to the wall do equally desperate things, such as calling in air strikes, or shoving dissidents out the back end of a van in the middle of the Arabian desert a couple of hundred miles from the nearest water source, doubtless with a pious wish that Allah will protect the virtuous.<br><br>So we’ve got technological crises, economic crises, and political crises, all driving a variety of feedback loops that intersect with other dimensions of the predicament of industrial society in ways that are hard to predict. Those of my readers who want a model for the long twilight of the industrial age may find this one useful; rinse and repeat, with occasional pauses and intensifications, and you’ve probably got a decent model of the next couple of centuries. Still, there’s another factor in play that’s worth a comment or two.<br><br>When Gaddafi refused to bow out and the insurgency in Libya tipped over into civil war, my readers will have noticed, President Obama’s response was simply to proclaim, as loudly as possible, “Gaddafi must go.” He had plenty of company in saying those words, but neither he nor any of his fellow heads of state did anything noticeable to make Gaddafi’s departure happen. Meanwhile, Gaddafi’s tanks and planes continued to pound the insurgents.<br><br>It’s not as though the western powers don’t have options, either, at least in theory. Any European nation much larger than Belgium could easily stop Gaddafi’s offensive in its tracks and take out his air force into the bargain, and we won’t even talk about what a spare US carrier group could do. For that matter, a few well-packed planeloads of munitions landing at Benghazi would probably be enough to turn the tide of the civil war back in the insurgency’s favor. The problem is that the situation in the Middle East as a whole is risky enough that any intervention, anywhere, could trigger drastic and highly unwelcome shifts in the balance of power.<br><br>At this point, after all, in the wake of the West’s abandonment of longtime ally Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, the Arab nations that produce most of the world’s oil have got to be asking themselves whether a sudden shift in allegiances might be in their best interests, and Western support of the Libyan insurgents would put ample frosting on top of that cake. If the Saudi monarch were to pick up the phone one fine morning, dial Beijing, and inquire about the possibility of a mutual defense pact, I doubt he’d be put on hold for long An awareness of this possibility has to be on the minds of policymakers in Washington and Brussels. This likely has much to do with the fact that the titular commander in chief of the world’s most expensive military machine has been reduced to mouthing “Gaddafi must go” as though it was an incantation.<br><br>Most of the way around the world, in Japan, the same reliance on incantation is playing a significant role in the Kan administration’s response to the Fukushima disaster. Right now, to be fair, the only factors that actually matter are the small team of beleaguered technicians who are struggling there at the plant, on the one hand, and the remorseless laws of nuclear physics on the other, so officials in Tokyo really have few other options. Incantations have long counted among the fine arts in Japan – it bears remembering, for example, that the imperial broadcast that announced surrender at the end of the Second World War referred to Japan’s total defeat in that conflict by saying, “the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan’s advantage.” When a high government official announced a few days ago that one of the containment vessels at Fukushima Daiishi was “not necessarily intact,” in other words, those who were paying attention knew that it was time to worry – or to relocate.<br><br>Still, far and away the most colorful use of incantations in response to the Fukushima disaster has been in the media and the blogosphere here in America, where proponents of nuclear power have worked overtime to try to put their particular spin on a situation that seems to take a perverse pleasure in frustrating their efforts. It’s likely that much of this is being bought and paid for by the nuclear industry; using paid internet flacks to saturate social media with a desired message has already become a standard tactic in the worlds of politics and big business.<br><br>Still, whether they’ve issued from paid cyberflacks or unpaid true believers, the incantations in question make an intriguing spectacle. They started out, in the early days of the crisis, presenting rosy estimates of the situation, even claiming that the results of the tsunami showed just how safe nuclear power is. When reactor buildings started blowing up and made that last claim a bit hard to defend, insisting that the problem was a matter of one obsolete reactor design, and trotting out various pieces of untested vaporware as the wave of the future became the order of the day. When the situation started really spiralling downhill, it was time for rants about the evils of coal, as though that’s the only alternative, and then, inevitably, claims that the only alternative to nuclear power is to slink back to the caves.<br><br>There is, of course, another alternative. It’s the alternative that we’re all going to take anyway, as fossil fuels deplete and the various subsidies that make nuclear power and most of the other alternatives look economically viable go away forever. That alternative is to use much less energy than we do today. Here in the United States, it bears repeating, we use three times as much energy per capita as people in most European countries, to prop up a standard of living that by most measures isn’t as good. Fairly modest conservation measures, of the sort discussed in recent posts here, could render every nuclear power plant in America surplus if they were applied nationwide; a more serious national effort aimed at getting down to European levels of consumption could probably manage to turn most of the coal-fired plants into museum pieces as well.<br><br>Again, this is what we’re going to do anyway, whether we choose that route or not. The vast government subsidies that currently prop up not only nuclear power, but most of the rest of America’s energy production and consumption, are not going to be sustainable for all that much longer; neither, of course, are the “energy subsidies” that every other energy source derives from the immense quantities of cheap petroleum that are used to mine, transport, and provide raw materials for everything from solar panels to nuclear power plants. Equally, the American imperial presence in the Middle East and elsewhere, which currently backstops a global economic system that provides the 5% of us who live in America with 25% of the world’s energy resources and around 33% of its raw materials and industrial product, has a relatively short shelf life ahead of it, and as that comes unraveled, we are all going to have to learn to live with much less.<br><br>Faced with these unpalatable prospects, and a distinct shortage of practical options for doing anything about them, it’s not surprising that incantation has become the order of the day. In the twilight years of civilizations, as political, economic, and technological systems failures hamstring the ability of leaders and pressure groups alike to get their way, it’s a fairly common experience. Still, as an archdruid, I have a certain professional interest in incantations, and I find it disappointing to see them applied in situations where they’re not going to accomplish anything – say, to unseat a dictator who’s proven his willingness to use more robust means to keep himself wedged in place, or to make a brittle, dangerous, unsustainable, overcentralized, and fantastically expensive technology like nuclear power meet the needs of a declining industrial civilization. If any of the people involved would like to learn something about the proper uses and limits of incantations, I’d be happy to provide some tips.<br><br>********************<br><br>On a brighter note, I’m delighted to report that choreographer Valerie Green and Dance Entropy, a New York City-based experimental dance troupe, will shortly be premiering a new work, “Rise and Fall,” inspired in part by my book <i>The Long Descent</i>, with music by nonconventional industrial group the Tone Casualties. Green writes:<br><br>“’Rise and Fall’ is an abstract dance for five performers based on the cycle of a civilization. This experimental dance work is comprised of multiple sections running the course of the following cycle: a new beginning, tracing footprints and remnants of the past, on to a developing population, agriculture, industrialization, modernization, awareness, gross consumption, terror, decline, population dissipation, and knowledge to begin again. The inspiration from this book cane from a recent visit to the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, and the book <i>The Long Descent</i> by John Michael Greer...I have found the above ideas thought provoking and an inspiration in the development of a non-traditional movement vocabulary, and a compelling work of dance.”<br><br>Readers of this blog in the NYC area can see “Rise and Fall” at <a href=http://dixonplace.org/index2.html>Dixon Place Experimental Theater</a> at 7:30 pm, March 31, or at the <a href=http://www.greenspacestudio.org/GreenSpaceBlooms.html>Green Space Studio</a> at 8 pm, April 8 and 17.

I'm going with keeping it for now, because I think we've finally hit the inflection point. I'll be expanding some more recent tod postings for now when time permits, but can't really dedicate the kind of time you do to the project at this point, but hopefully that will change in the future.<br><br><a href=limits-of-incantation.html#c9060218042793800946 title="comment permalink">3/16/11, 9:42 PM</a><br><br>

Francis Heins</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>"The Alternative That We’re All Going to Take Anyway" is a song that needs to be re-sung into the collective unconscious.<br><br>My personal hope is that out of the Fukushima disaster -whatever order of magnitude it may, in the end, take- a real shift in popular attitudes toward the "Atomic Age" end of the Progress Utopia spectrum might occur.<br><br>A -relatively- small problem within the Peak Energy Predicament, as I see it, is Nuclear Waste, whether it be so-called or called "Power Plants" or "Strategic Weapons" or even "Medical Waste". <br><br>I think this meets the Y2k-crisis standard of a definite timeline within which to solve a definite problem. We have until fossil fuel shortages make it impossible to use the current industrial and social capacity to decommission all fission electrical plants, stand-down and "warehouse" all nuclear weapons and weapons platforms reactors (aircraft carriers, submarines), and either store them in one or a few places to mitigate the impact of their sure leakage, or attempt to mitigate that same danger through the use of as-yet-unproven Thorium Fission reactors.<br><br>A consensus that this can and needs be done seems to be growing -if Germany's loud proclamations of its existing decommission plans and China's quieter brakes-pressing on Big Nuke's new cash cow can be take as such. But whether that is true yet or not, I think that just leaving the Nukes to rot has been effectively taken off many a table.<br><br>Can we, as a people, do this one little thing? To make sure that the techno-hubris of our grandfathers stands as little of a chance as possible of skewing the patterns of evolutionary Life off course -perhaps- for much of the half-billion years of time left to terrestrial life at all?<br><br>I'd like to think so, and I'd very much like to know what you and the regulars here think as well.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>-Francis.<br><br>P.S.

Few there are, that hear and heed the call of energy conservation. Strong indeed is the magic and I see it's assault on people and the environment, everyday and everywhere. Few envision inconvenience to themselves in the near to far future. I fear change will be forced on all sooner or later and it will be driven by the fossil fuel subsidies in the food chain.<br><br>I can't think of a more useless occupation than cyberflunky. I've encountered them in my own efforts and they sap energy and distract people from the big picture. Also an interesting technique they employ, is that they latch onto one aspect (often very minor) of a larger picture. They then set about discrediting it rightly or wrongly. This technique is used to empower themselves and distract people from the central message. You see it used in climate change debates all the time. I feel sorry for them, as they criticise that which they themselves lack the wit to build.<br><br>Incidentally, Australia having large resources of uranium has reconsidered publicly debating nuclear energy as an option due to recent events. We are still under pressure to sell yellow cake to India, who incidentally haven't signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty.<br><br>Interesting times.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=limits-of-incantation.html#c4207398462424088085 title="comment permalink">3/17/11, 2:24 AM</a><br><br>

Otherwise intelligent, sensitive people can't imagine the world being run differently than it's run today, and especially the idea of less power is beyond them. I think their emotions, rather than pushing them toward what in this case would be a fairly reasonable rethinking of nuclear power, push them toward denial. They think of nuclear power as part of the magical techno-world that they are a part of, and so it's indispensable. It's a "risk we can't afford not to take". They think because we have airplanes (temporary as that may be), we should have nukes. I want to believe it's just an industry line, but the sheer scale of it and hearing the line from people around me makes me think otherwise.<br><br>I have to thank my parents for raising me with hiking and going to beach on vacation, and for living somewhere with a fair amount of woods for me to play in. I look at these things, or the moon in the sky, and realize that our powers are terrible but very finite. The real world is not what shows on the computer screen.<br><br>Speaking of Japanese art and the realization of the transience of things, have you read "Hojoki", otherwise called "An Accout of My Hut"? It's a quick read, you can find a passable English version online, and I think you would like it.<br><br>Of course, modern Japan favors the apocalyptic, but sometimes I wonder if they aren't just two faces of the same realization - that all things fade in time.<br><br><a href=limits-of-incantation.html#c1352223289559534622 title="comment permalink">3/17/11, 3:09 AM</a><br><br>

Still, I think it's a good deal more likely that there won't be enough of a consensus until the resources to do that don't exist any longer, and so our descendants for the next ten thousand years or so will have to get used to the fact that there are places you can't go, water you can't touch, etc. <br><br>Chris, the obsession with growth is exactly what has to be confronted, as often and directly as possible. <br><br>Adamatari, granted, there are a lot of true believers as well. It's just been fascinating to see the sudden flurry of posts on various forums from brand new posters, all with their carefully polished arguing points, who vanish without a trace when somebody calls them on an inaccuracy. As for <i>Hojoki</i>, I haven't -- I'll check it out. Many thanks!<br><br>Tubaplayer, nice!<br><br>DIYer, many thanks. <br><br>Phil, yes, it's off-topic, but I can't help but reflect just now that the more people study disciplines like sacred geometry, instead of figuring out new ways to generate and waste electricity, the better off we'll all be.

It's a simple concept and I have to wonder why some seem to not understand it. The major exceptions to that are the climate change resulting from fossil fuel use, and the general burden on our planet's ecosystems that our energy-driven overpopulation is causing. However, nuclear power is doing nothing to alleviate either of those situations. <br><br>Note that it is not just the failures of nuclear power that have long term negative consequences, it is the refinement and concentration of nuclear materials period. We have no means to deal with this concentrated radioactive material after it has been used, and there is zero possibility that we will be able to maintain a society with sufficient skills to handle such material even as well as we do now for as long as would be required. Therefore, what will ultimately happen to all of this material is exactly what you see happening now - it will disbursed over the surface of the earth, eventually to be returned to a much more distributed state as it was when we found it. We have concentrated this material, and entropy will ensure that it becomes less concentrated again.”<br><br>Since posting that I realized there is another possibility – that life forms will accumulate the material effectively using solar energy to maintain its concentration, or at least to delay its redistribution.<br><br><a href=limits-of-incantation.html#c9038940337090987257 title="comment permalink">3/17/11, 5:42 AM</a><br><br>

An amusing 'marker' of a color revolution is the presence of expensive large-scale video arrays at the central square where events unfold... the Spectacle in it's most blatant form!<br><br>Starting with the self-immolation of a young Tunisian street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, the Arab Revolution instead has the earmarks of an unplanned popular insurrection -- vanguard parties caught unawares, self-organization, emergent leadership, and strategy created on-the-fly.<br><br>The reason the difference makes a difference is that 'color revolutions' are not deeply rooted, and are easily dispersed by their paymasters when they no longer have utility. <br><br>Popular insurrections don't dissolve so easily. With the uprisings crushed in Bahrain and Libya, and an army-lead counter-revolution in Egypt, I expect the Arab Revolution will disappear as a mass democratically-oriented protest movement... but in being crushed it may well give rise to new armed underground groups, further destabilizing the region.<br><br>In addition to defining the fate of the generation of hopeful young people who created the uprisings, this will also prevent anything resembling a return to autocratic 'normality' in the Middle East. The current regimes may cling to power, but that power will be brittle and repeatedly challenged, and the region will be far less governable than in the past.<br><br>Democratization might have released social pressure and slowed the pace of collapse in the region.

We had a great laugh when Rick Steves introduced Lisbon by saying that an earthquake ruined the city in 1755 and it never recovered. Of course it was also the way he said it, but to spoiled Americans who had only experienced the 1980s and 1990s, it seemed so completely ridiculous that it became something of an inside joke. Who could imagine one earthquake knocking out a city for 250 years?<br><br>Such is the shortcoming of pop history to focus on a single event. Viewed from the broader perspective of empire, however, it makes much more sense. Perhaps in 1755 Lisbon SEEMED a great and mighty city of a great and mighty empire, but the empire is always kaput long before anyone will admit it, and keeping up appearances is much easier than actually maintaining the mighty empire. No doubt Portugal was on its last legs for some time beforehand. Thus the earthquake was all it took to push it over the edge, although a gnat's wing might have done the same.<br><br>I would guess Japan is probably in the same position today. Anyone familiar with recent financial history knows that ever since the Japanese economy took a nosedive around 1990, it has never been the same. Don't underestimate the power of our modern industrial countries to "coast" and pretend that nothing's wrong. I would not be surprised if Japan nevers recovers from this.<br><br>If that's the case, the simple-minded historians of tomorrow may blame the earthquake itself for Japan's demise, but I'm sure the more discerning minds will trace it back at least two decades earlier to the great debt bubble which signified the beginning of the end, and, of course, the broader picture of global overshoot due to the limits to growth. The way things are arranged these days, every industrialized country is an overextended empire, is it not? <br><br>We here in the USA are probably only a few years behind Japan. "Extend and pretend" is a common enough phrase in the banking industry today. Our leaders and most of the world media still maintain the illusion that the USA is invincible.<br><br><a href=limits-of-incantation.html#c419554144090980276 title="comment permalink">3/17/11, 9:43 AM</a><br><br>

We would do well to follow their example.<br><br>I've found it telling that in both the Gulf Oil disaster and this Fukushima nuclear disaster, the source of most information about what's going on is a corporation. In the first case, that corporation took steps to ensure as much as possible that others could not find out what's going on. In the second, the danger of the situation itself is keeping others away. The stranglehold that corporations have on technology and information is an aspect of modern life that is truly malignant.<br><br>I've been reading _Thinking in Systems: A Primer_ by Donella H. Meadows, a book that was recommended a number of weeks ago in the comments of this blog. It is excellent. It's clear and appropriately paced for the layman. But I think the really great thing about the book is that for each abstract concept she gives specific illustrative examples drawn from a wide variety of disciplines, such as agriculture, small or large business, forest management, the biology of disease, macroeconomics, city crime levels, bathtub water levels, and home heating, among others. Therefore, even if you don't have a clue about some of the disciplines, you probably have personal experience with at least one of them. This makes a potentially difficult subject easy to grasp for just about anyone. I'll add my high recommendations to those already expressed.<br><br>Here is a quote that seems to express our worldwide predicament very well: "There will always be limits to growth. They can be self-imposed. If they aren't, they will be system-imposed. No physical entity can grow forever. If company managers, city governments, the human population do not choose and enforce their own limits to keep growth within the capacity of the supporting environment, then the environment will choose and enforce limits."

Lost in the desert of today's Morocco and low on water (and ale), a Roman legion partly consisting of Germanic auxiliaries, chanted an incantation to the local deity 'Gwa-gwa' - does that remind of 'aqua'? - to make rain. Their plea was so successful that the whole plain became inundated at once.

Those old monster movies are looking a bit prescient at the moment, too. <br><br>Chris, faith in progress is the religion of our society, and the nuclear reactor has long been one of its central totems -- as well as one of the main target of faith-based notions about a future of perpetually abundant energy, now that fossil fuels are pretty clearly not going to provide that. Expect a lot of irrationality on the subject from here on in. <br><br>Fleecenik, the one thing to keep in mind is that you can only rinse and repeat a few times before the fabric starts going to shreds or the soap runs out.<br><br>Don, funny you should mention that. I was thinking the same thing. <br><br>Twilight, nicely put. <br><br>Professor, basically, yes. The myth of progress and its surrounding mythology have become dysfunctional, so what we need are other myths that make more sense of the universe of our experience. <br><br>Loveandlight, my guess is that it's going to be a case of too little and too late. Gaddafi needs about 72 more hours to finish the job he's started, and it will take more than a no-fly zone to stop him. <br><br>Adrian, I've gotten the same sense -- as Ghan-buri-Ghan put it, "wind is changing." We may see some unexpected and welcome shifts in the years just ahead. <br><br>Guamanian, it's a heck of a good question just how spontaneous the latest round of revolutions in the Arab world is. The manuals developed by the CIA et al. for color revolutions have gotten into wider circulation at this point, and almost anybody -- foreign or domestic -- might be using the same stratagems; equally, though, since they're based on experience from relatively spontaneous risings, it's hard to tell.<br><br>Richard, no question, it's going to be a mess. It will be interesting to see in hindsight whether the electrical power now permanently offline in Japan ever gets replaced. <br><br>Mark, this is why I don't put a lot of faith in PV systems. Sunlight is diffuse enough that converting it into anything but heat is a losing game. Leave it as low grade heat, though, and it'll heat your home and your bathwater, and cook your meals very nicely on sunny days. More on this in next week's post!<br><br>Gabriel, those are basically the reasons I don't think we'll have nuclear power around for long once cheap fossil fuels become a thing of the past. The waste, unfortunately, is with us for much longer. <br><br>Alchemy, I was thinking something of the sort!<br><br>Carver, that's par for the course.

Thanks for the link!<br><br>Andrea, northeast Japan is a major factory belt, and there were plenty of industrial facilities right down close to the shore, where they could load and unload from freighters. As the situation becomes clearer, you're going to find plenty of destroyed chemical factories, too. Arsenic may be forever, btw, but it takes a lot less plutonium to kill you. <br><br>Blue Sun, excellent! You get today's gold star for paying attention to history. You're quite correct; a natural disaster near the inflection point in a declining society can cause a sudden speedup to the decline, to the extent that the damage never gets made good. <br><br>Chris, that's a subject for a book in itself. The key concept, though, is to remember -- in the jargon I studied back in the day -- is that "the planes are discrete and not continuous." That is to say, incantations are good at what we might as well call magic, that is, the art and science of causing changes in consciousness in accordance with will; even on that plane, they can be countered by a sufficiently strong or skilled counter-incantation; and down on the plane of matter, where fuel rods heat up at their own inexorable pace, they don't do much. Again, this is a very brief overview of a very complex subject; I may have to post something at length on the subject one of these days. <br><br>Francis, the First Nations of the Puget Sound area have legends going back to the reflooding of Puget Sound at the end of the last ice age, so oral history can last for a very long time. My guess is that in age after age, people will tell their children whispered tales of the Accursed Place, heavily reinforced by the fact that those who ignore the tales -- and there will be a few in each century or two -- die of sudden and incurable disease. That's the future we've made for our descendants. <br><br>Greatblue, thank you. The Meadows quote is of course dead on. <br><br>Raven, most of the ants I know are armed; many of the grasshoppers are not. That does change the odds a bit. <br><br>Lagedargent, I'll have to go look it up -- you might try searching for the words "incantation" of "magic" on the blog search function.

It was quite a spectacle; I kept on pointing out the economic limits to the internet, and a lot of the people who commented literally pretended that I hadn't said anything about that; they kept on talking about ways that it might be technically possible to maintain an internet in a deindustrial future, since after all we have to have an internet, and avoided the economics as though the issue had never been raised. I ended up posting an all-out rant, and deleting every single comment that didn't address the issue I was raising. It was educational to see just how many people will do their level best not to think about the very real limits to that hugely expensive and energy-intensive technology. <br><br>Rsven, er, you need to read fewer bad future-dystopia novels. In the US, at least, the military's way ahead of the curve -- they've been talking peak oil for years now, and there's a reason the Air Force has a large biofuels program -- and it'll be an interesting question who controls who as we slide further down the long ragged curve of decline.

You've touched on the driving force behind a lot of the pro-nuclear sloganeering -- the notion that we have to have a replacement for oil.

This was an outstanding bit of observation on their part over many generations. The areas were taboo and considered to be places inhabited by evil spirits. Top work.<br><br>I always despair when I hear about people promoting some sort of apocalyptic fervour. I'm left wondering how much of their desire for such a condition is a result of their domestic situations and their secret desire to not have to go to work on Monday... Controversial, but I can't see why people would keep harking back to this, do they actually understand what they are longing for? Me thinks not. Even de-industrialisation would mean lots of very hungry, cold, desperate people.<br><br>I am unaware that any large scale nuclear reactor has actually been completely decommissioned. <br><br>I'm also not sure that a large scale nuclear reactor building program will ever get off the ground anyway. There are a couple of reasons for this: <br><br>The fossil fuel subsidies for nuclear as you quite rightly point out will become more difficult to justify with each year; but more importantly<br><br>Who is going to pay for the building of the new nuclear reactors? It can't be ignored that Western societies produce less tangible goods each year. For a new reactor to make financial sense, the energy has to be used to produce materials or goods which can be sold overseas, otherwise it is simply for peoples comfort. Has anyone considered the level of foreign debt in the US? Japan's foreign debt is 200% of it's GDP and they are also a large holder of US bond debt. It's pretty hard to get insurance in an earthquake zone, so they'll be financing their reconstruction by selling off US debt. Printing money in the US wasn't a good idea, but the world will be flowing shortly with US bond debt. There are only so many buyers for such large amounts. Building nuclear reactors takes real world wealth.<br><br>In the West we have neglected to invest in our common infrastructure for many years now. What did we do instead? We voted ourselves in tax breaks and spent far less on commodities than their actual cost. Basically it was a big party and I reckon the bill is coming soon.<br><br>With each successive crisis we move one step further down the ladder.

Thinking of life as something separate from Earth is wrong." -Tim Flannery, Here on Earth: A Natural History of the Planet (2010).<br><br><a href=limits-of-incantation.html#c7181011738908016135 title="comment permalink">3/18/11, 6:17 PM</a><br><br>

As for Vermont, I trust the horse teams will be available to haul away the cables in good time, too. <br><br>Chris, that's an excellent point, and applies more generally: who is going to cover the cost, in money, resources, and skilled labor, for any of the grandiose plans being floated to keep energy supplies increasing?<br><br>RD, it's important to feel and give voice to the tragedy, even at the cost of some sleep; it's an experience I've had tolerably often as well. It's also important to remember that every civilization ends this way, its larger dreams and hopes unfulfilled for the usual and profoundly human reasons. My guess is that within a hundred light years or so, there's at least one other world where at least one other intelligent being, probably unrecognizable to us, is wishing that it could do whatever its species does in place of sleeping as it contemplates a similar tragedy. "One always knew," wrote Robinson Jeffers, "that life's end is death." <br><br>Still, there's another side to the picture. We may never be able to have the shining future we imagined, but we can make the future that's barrelling toward us a good deal less ghastly than it might otherwise be, by making sure that as much as possible makes it through the twilight of this civilization and gets to the waiting hands of the cultures that will come after ours. As one of the technically literate, you have a lot to offer in that struggle, and I hope you'll put your abilities to good use in the years just ahead. <br><br>Loveandlight, that's probably a very large part of it. I plan on flogging the issue further in posts down the road. <br><br>Andrew, I recently picked up Sutton's book, but haven't had the spare time to work with it. Still, glad to hear it's a good choice. I'm planning a book on the subject of sacred geometry a couple of years down the road, for whatever that's worth. <br><br>Ric, yes, I heard about that. What a crock of crap. <br><br>Douglas, I haven't read the book in question so can't comment specifically on it. My main objection to nukes in general isn't waste alone; it's that all existing nuclear technologies, as distinct from untested vaporware, have massive problems on many different levels, and it's therefore most likely that the untested ones will also have similarly massive problems once we've poured enough billions of dollars (that we don't have) into building enough prototypes and testbeds to find out. Fusion power was supposed to be a done deal, remember, and the existing fission technologies were promoted by earlier generations of pro-nuke types as safe, clean, and so cheap they'd make electricity too cheap to meter. <br><br>Chris, by confronting I mean first of all bringing up the alternative -- that is, getting by with less energy -- when the point comes up for discussion, on the internet and elsewhere. Second, I mean doing the thing oneself, so that those who insist it can't be done short of a return to the caves face living counterexamples. This is going to have to be done one person at a time, but since energy prices have been on a ragged upward curve for more than a decade now, as that and economic factors bite deeply, my guess is that many more people are going to find a sudden interest in saving money by saving energy.

For civilian economies in the third world, they're already running out -- check the energy news from Pakistan one of these days -- and they'll be rationed by price here and elsewhere for some time yet, so that you'll still be able to get plenty of gas as long as you've got enough money. A good working guess is that there'll be some petroleum and petroleum products available for the next fifty years or so, but at rising prices -- as in unaffordable for most of us within a couple of decades -- and the infrastructure for using them, especially highways and gas stations, is already coming unraveled in physically and economically peripheral areas. So it's not as though nature's flipping the off switch; it's a matter of turning down the volume year after year until you can't hear the song at all. <br><br>Goedeck, good.

You're dead on about the blindness to using less, though; that's the great legacy of the 1970s -- the fact that it's possible, using off-the-shelf technology, to have a comfortable life on a fraction of the energy people in the industrial world think they have to have -- and I think it's high time for that to be pointed out a little more forcefully once again.

It is very easy to design test systems that optimize results but do not in any way reflect real world conditions, nor allow direct comparison with numbers from other sources. A common type of trick would be to have results that show effective R values ranging from 3 to 9 depending on wind speed and orientation of the window, and to only report the 9 in your advertising, forgetting about the 3... or to only run the test under the conditions you know are likely to produce the highest values.
