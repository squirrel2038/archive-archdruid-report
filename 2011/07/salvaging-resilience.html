Regular readers of this blog will know by this point that my efforts to make sense of the shape of the emerging deindustrial future involve the occasional odd detour, and one of those is central to this week’s post. Mind you, those same regular readers may be wondering if the detour in question has to do with Ben Bernanke’s secret name as a Sith Lord, a point which occupied some space in comments on a recent <i>Archdruid Report</i>. (The best proposal so far, in case you’re wondering, was Darth Flation – think (in)Vader, (in)Sidious, etc.)<br><br>Still, that tempting topic will have to be left for another week. Instead, I’m going to have to clear up the confusions surrounding a bit of jargon popular in the current peak oil blogosphere. That process is more than a little reminiscent of fishing scrap metal out of a swamp; in the present case, the word that needs to be hauled from the muck, hosed off, and restored to its former usefulness, is “resilience.”<br><br>The rise of this term to its present popularity in green circles has a history worth noting. A year or two ago, the word “sustainability” began to lose its privileged place in the jargon of the time, as it began to sink in that no matter how much manhandling was applied to that much-abused term, it couldn’t be combined with the phrase “modern middle-class lifestyle” without resulting in total absurdity. Enter “resilience,” as another way to talk about what too many people nowadays want to talk about, generally to the exclusion of more useful conversations: the pretense that a set of lifestyles, social habits, and technologies that were born in an age of unparalleled extravagance can be maintained as the material basis for that extravagance trickles away.<br><br>The word “sustainability,” it bears remembering, has a perfectly clear meaning. It means, as the word itself suggests, the ability of something to be sustained, either for a set period of time – “sustainable over a twenty year period,” for example – or indefinitely. That was its problem as a green buzzword, because next to nobody wanted to talk about just how long the current crop of “sustainable” tech was actually likely to stay viable (hint: not very long), and even fewer were willing to grapple with the immense challenges facing any attempt to sustain any of today’s technologies into the indefinite future.<br><br>The problem with “resilience,” though, is that it also has a perfectly clear meaning. Once people figure out what that is, it’s a safe bet that they’ll be hunting for another buzzword in short order, because resilience can be defined very precisely: it’s the opposite of efficiency.<br><br>Okay, now that you’ve stopped spluttering, let me explain.<br><br>We can define efficiency informally as doing the most with the least. An efficient use of resources is thus one that puts as few resources as possible into places where they sit around doing nothing. The just-in-time ordering process that’s now standard in manufacturing and retail, for example, was hailed as a huge increase in efficiency when it was introduced; instead of having stockpiles sitting around in warehouses, items could be ordered electronically from a database so that they would be made and shipped just in time to go onto the assembly line or the store shelf. What nobody asked, and very few people have asked even yet, is what happens when something goes wrong.<br><br>The great Tohoku tsunami a few months back provided a wakeup call in that direction, as factories across Japan and around the world suddenly discovered that the shipment of parts they needed just in time for next month’s production runs had been delivered instead to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. In the inefficient old days, when parts jobbers scattered all over the industrial world had warehouses full of parts being produced by an equally dispersed array of small factories, that would have given nobody sleepless nights, since the stock of spares on hand would be enough to tide things over until factories could run some extra shifts and make up the demand. Since production had been efficiently centralized in very few factories, or in some cases only one, and the warehouses full of parts had been rendered obsolete by efficient new ordering systems, knock-on costs that would have been negligible in 1970 are proving to be very substantial today.<br><br>Efficiency, in other words, is not resilient. What makes a system resilient is the presence of unused resources, and these are inefficient by definition. A bridge is resilient, for example, if it contains a good deal more steel and concrete than is actually needed to support its normal maximum load; that way, when some outside factor such as a hurricane puts unexpected stresses on the bridge, the previously unnecessary structural strength of all that extra steel and concrete comes into play, and keeps the bridge from falling down. Most bridges are designed and built with that sort of inefficiency in place, because the downside of too little efficiency (the bridge costs more to build) is a good deal less troubling than the downside of too little resiliency (the bridge collapses in a storm). Like every project worth doing, a good bridge has to strike a balance between many conflicting factors, no one of which can be maximized except at the expense of others of equal importance.<br><br>This is something that one of the iconic figures of the Seventies, Buckminster Fuller, never quite grasped. For me, Fuller is what another iconic Seventies figure called a worthy opponent; his writings constantly force me to reexamine my own ideas, because they grate on my nerves so reliably. Partly that’s a function of Fuller’s insouciant assurance that technology inevitably one-ups everything else in the cosmos – Theodore Roszak’s apt gibe, “I would not be surprised to hear (Fuller) announce someday that he had invented a better tree,” comes to mind – and partly it’s his insistence that the universe had to make the kind of sense he wanted it to make – this is a man, remember, who spent much of his life insisting that pi couldn’t <i>really</i> be an irrational number – but the issue that comes to mind right now is his consistent preference for efficiency at the cost of resilience.<br><br>That’s not to say that Fuller didn’t score some major successes. If my house was in a good location for a wind turbine, I’d almost certainly use Fuller’s octet truss design for the tower, and a lot of very sturdy geodesic domes have been built using his patents. Still, it’s worth noting that not even Fuller was able to live for long in a dome house made to his own designs; if it had been perfectly caulked, it would have provided a comfortable home with very efficient use of materials, but since caulking is never perfect in the real world, it leaked like a sieve whenever it rained. That’s one of the reasons why Lloyd Kahn, the compiler of <i>Domebooks</i> I and II and a major proponent of geodesic domes back in the day, backpedaled in his 1973 compilation <i>Shelter</i>. That very worthwhile piece of Green Wizard literature talked at length about the problems with geodesic dome construction, and put most of its space into vernacular building from cultures around the world, from yurts and tipis to good sturdy old-fashioned carpentry that holds off the rain.<br><br>Most of the troubles that saddled Fuller with the label “failure-prone” were, like the vast number of leaky geodesic dome houses that sprang up in the Sixties, the product of too much efficiency and too little resilience. The Dymaxion car of 1933 is a case in point. In most respects it was a brilliant design, maneuverable and ultraefficient, but its career came to a sudden halt when one of the three prototypes got bumped by another car on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, flipped, and rolled, killing the driver and seriously injuring everybody else on board. Fuller designed the car with a narrow wheelbase relative to its length for the sake of maneuverability, and a high center of gravity to provide a smoother ride on rough roads. Both those choices made the Dymaxion car more efficient but less stable, and at highway speeds that’s not a safe tradeoff to make.<br><br>Thus efficiency is not resilient, and resilience is not efficient. Just-in-time ordering is conceptually the same as the Dymaxion car’s narrow wheelbase and high center of gravity: a great idea, as long as nothing goes wrong. Since it may have occurred to you, dear reader, that today’s industrial civilization seems to have a lot in common just now with these examples of high efficiency and low resilience, you may be thinking that it might turn out to be necessary to accept a lower degree of efficiency, in order to provide our civilization with the backlog of unused resources that will give it resilience.<br><br>Ah, but here’s where things get difficult.<br><br>There’s a reason why contemporary industrial culture is obsessed with efficiency, and it’s not because we’re smarter than our grandparents. Every civilization, as it nears the limits of its resource base, has to deal with the mismatch between habits evolved during times of relative abundance and the onset of shortages driven by too much exploitation of that abundance. Nearly always, the outcome is a shift in the direction of greater efficiency. Local governments give way to centralized ones; economies move as far toward mass production as the underlying technology will permit; precise management becomes the order of the day; waste gets cut and so, inevitably, do corners. All this leads to increased efficiency and thus decreased resilience, and sets things up for the statistically inevitable accident that will push things just past the limits of the civilization’s remaining resilience, and launch the downward spiral that ends with sheep grazing among ruins.<br><br>Trying to build resilience into a system that’s already gotten itself into this bind is a difficult project at best. The point of these efficiency drives, after all, is to free up resources to support the standards of living of the privileged classes. Since these same privileged classes are the ones who have to sign off on any project to redirect resources toward resilience, the difficulties in convincing them to act against their immediate self-interest are not hard to imagine. Since efficiency tends to take an aura of sanctity in such cases – privileged classes, after all, are as prone as anyone else to convince themselves that what’s good for them is good for everyone – proponents of resilience face an uphill fight against deeply rooted assumptions. After all, who wants to go on record in support of inefficiency?<br><br>And of course that’s exactly what we’ve seen in recent decades in industrial society. The Glass-Steagall Act, which imposed resilience on the US banking system at the cost of a fair amount of inefficiency, is a good example; it was gutted by an enthusiastically bipartisan majority, giving us the highly efficient but hopelessly brittle financial system we have today. Many other measures that put resilience into the system were also scrapped in the name of “competitiveness,” though it’s worth noticing that America’s ability to compete in any arena that doesn’t involve blowing large chunks of a Third World country to kingdom come has gone down steadily while these allegedly competitive measures have been at work. All of it, slogans aside, served to free up resources to maintain living standards for America’s privileged classes – a category that extends well down into the middle class, please note, and includes a great many people who like to denounce the existing order of American society in heated terms.<br><br>That’s our version of the trap that closes around every society that overshoots its resource base. The struggle to sustain the unsustainable – to maintain levels of consumption the remaining resource base won’t support indefinitely – always seems to drive the sort of short-term expedients that make for long-term disasters. I’ve come to think that a great many of the recent improvements in efficiency in the industrial world have their roots in this process. Loudly ballyhooed as great leaps forward, they may well actually be signs of the tightening noose of resource constraints that, in the long run, will choke the life out of our civilization.<br><br>Thus it’s a great idea in the abstract to demand a society-wide push for resilience, but in practice, that would involve loading a great many inefficiencies onto the economy. Things would cost more, and fewer people would be able to afford them, since the costs of resilience have to be paid, and the short term benefits of excessive efficiency have to be foregone. That’s not a recipe for winning an election or outcompeting a foreign rival, and the fact that it might just get us through the waning years of the industrial age pays nobody’s salary today. It may well turn out that burning through the available resources, and then crashing into ruin, is simply the most efficient way for a civilization to go.<br><br>Where does that leave those of us who would like to find a way through the crisis of our time and hand down some part of the legacy of our civilization to the future? The same principles apply, though it’s fortunately true that individuals, families, and local communities often have an easier time looking past the conventional wisdom of their era and doing something sensible even when it’s not popular. The first thing that has to be grasped, it seems to me, is that trying to maintain the comfortable lifestyles of the recent past is a fool’s errand. It’s only by making steep cuts in our personal demand for resources that it’s possible to make room for inefficiency, and therefore resilience.<br><br>Most of the steps proposed in these essays, in turn, are inefficient – indeed, deliberately so. It’s unquestionably nefficient in terms of your personal time and resources to dig up your back yard and turn it into a garden; that inefficiency, however, means that if anything happens to the hypercomplex system that provides you with your food – a process that reaches beyond growers, shippers and stores to the worlds of high finance, petroleum production, resource politics, and much more – you still get to eat. It’s inefficient to generate your own electricity, to retrofit your home for conservation, to do all the other things we’ve discussed. Those inefficiencies, in turn, are measures of resilience; they define your fallback options, the extra strength you build into the bridge to your future, so that it can hope to stand up to the approaching tempests.<br><br>The emerging patterns of the salvage economy that have been discussed here over the last few weeks feed into this same quest for resilience. Many older technologies, of the sort that might readily be salvaged and put to use, are a good deal less efficient than their modern replacements, and therefore much more resilient.<br><br>Here’s an example. There’s been plenty of talk in recent years about the risk of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack against the United States. It’s been the subject of Congressional hearings, a popular novel, and a great deal of hoopla in the media. There’s some reason for all this concern, as a single modest nuclear warhead detonated up in the ionosphere above the northern Midwest would generate a pulse that would fry electronic equipment over most of the continental United States, and it’s been argued that any of several non-nuclear technologies could do the same thing on a more local scale. There’s been a great deal of backing and forthing about how to shield national infrastructure against such an attack, but it’s only occasionally been noted that electronic technologies that are very nearly invulnerable to EMP already exist, and can be found in antique malls across the country.<br><br>The secret to those technologies? The old-fashioned vacuum tube. Vacuum tubes use plenty of power and convert most of it into heat, and the sturdy structure made necessary by that inefficiency makes tubes shrug off sudden transient pulses of the sort an EMP generates. Modern integrated circuits are many orders of magnitude more efficient, and so those same transient pulses go right into the heart of an IC chip and destroy it. If you plan on using a tube-based radio for communication in the event of an EMP attack, mind you, you need to be sure that it doesn’t have first-generation solid state components such as selenium rectifiers, or replace those with diode tubes, and you’d probably better do the sensible thing and get your amateur radio license, too, so you can get in some practice with your rig in advance. Still, it’s a viable approach, and a good deal cheaper than the alternatives – and it would be just as viable, and just as cheap, if the US government were to do the smart thing and arrange for a couple of midsized domestic electronics firms to start manufacturing reliable tube-based electronics as backups for critical infrastructure across the country.<br><br>There are countless other examples. By and large, older technologies are less efficient, because they were made in an age when efficiency wasn’t as overvalued as it is today. That means, in turn, that older technologies are by and large more resilient, and those who are concerned about resilience will often find that older, simpler, sturdier technologies are a better bet than the current state of the art. By and large, in turn, making use of those technologies means accepting downscaled expectations; a tube-based radio is easy, a tube-based television is challenging, and a tube-based video game would be around the size of a double-wide mobile home and use as much power as a five-story office building. This is why, sixty years ago, radios were common and cheap, televisions were less common and pricey, and games were played on brightly colored boards on the kitchen table or the family room floor without any electronics at all.<br><br>Still, downscaled expectations will be among the most common themes of the decades ahead of us, and those who have the uncommon sense to figure this out in advance and start getting ready for a less efficient future will very likely benefit from the increased resilience that will provide. Over the weeks to come, as I finish up the discussion of salvage and prepare to wrap up the entire series of posts on green wizardry that have been central to this blog’s project for more than a year now, I hope to be able to suggest a few more options for resilience along these same lines.

It's late and I have to get up early, so I'll make my excuses for the disjointed comments and get on with it.<br><br>First question: How long did you work in industry ?<br><br>I think that it has been mentioned before, but The Resilaint Gardener by Carol Deppe is a thought provoking book. <br><br>I'm not sure that resilaince is the opposite of efficiency. We need to close nutrient cycles to continue to produce food in a sustainable manner. That level of recycling seems very efficient. Same with weather stripping, insulation and caulking, they all mean cutting less wood. <br><br>JIT is not effiecient. Let one part of the system break down and the entire process goes haywire. That idle time can not be made up by resuming deliveries of whichever widget went AWOL. <br><br>Please make the connections between quality, energy, resiliance and efficiency.<br><br>I think that you need to remember that Bucky was working with pre 1970 technology and ideas. He was an engineer, not a philosopher. Ayn Rand anyone ?<br><br>The problem today is that lowest cost/price is the only thing that is valued. It drives ecverything. It is not efficient to buy a new car because you can't afford to repair (or replace the parts) the old one. It is simply the lowest short term cost. The most efficeint way own a car is to absolutely drive a car into the ground. The longer it lasts, the more efficient it is.<br><br>The rub is that the efficient modern model makes it possible to afford resiliance. It is hard to square that. <br><br>Counting on the hypercomplex system that provides our food, the soil, has broken down this year with the extremely variable weather.

I haven't finished reading this week's post and my mind is already buzzing with enlightening thought....Thanks!<br><br>As a teen in the '70s, I was at first fascinated by Fuller and his unique(?) perspectives, along with Frank Lloyd Wright's. Sometime back then, it occured to me that Fuller was simply building better mouse traps, reinventing wheels. I moved on (still an admirer,, of Wright as well). When most of my contemporaries were specializing, I remained the stubborn generalist, trading efficiency for resilience it seems. <br><br>The discussion of Fuller brought to mind something one of my favorite authors wrote a few years ago:<br><br><i>A culture, any culture, embodies a particular range of human possibility, and like everything else, it suffers from the law of diminishing returns. Sooner or later, everything that can be done from within the worldview of a culture – everything religious, philosophical, intellectual, artistic, social, political, you name it – has basically been done, and the culture fossilizes into a civilization. Thereafter the same things get repeated over and over again in endless combinations; disaffected intellectuals no longer capable of creativity settle for mere novelty or, worse still, simple shock value; artistic and intellectual traditions from other cultures get imported to fill the widening void; technology progresses in a kind of mechanical forward lurch until the social structures capable of supporting it fall away from underneath it.</i><br>JMG-Wednesday, December 26, 2007<br><br>Pop culture is an excellent barometer of cultural stagnation, as of late especially.

Nothing new...<br><br>Anyway, back to the above quote:<br><br><i>..artistic and intellectual traditions from other cultures get imported to fill the widening void..</i><br><br>Isn't that what we're doing now? Trying to fill voids?

Look at Cloud Computing for example. When everything is on your own hard drive, if the Interweb goes down you'll at least still have your programs and data. If you depend on the Cloud and the web goes down, you'll lose everything. Oops...<br><br>All this "efficiency" came about for perfectly justifiable reasons; If your company can outproduce the competition, or at least cut costs by implementing techniques like JIT delivery, you'll be able to gain market share at the expense of the competitors who still do things the old-fashioned way, and they'll have to play the game by your new rules or else they'll go out of business. In the end, everybody has to adapt.<br><br>After reading <i>One Second After</i> I actually downloaded (and read) the EMP Commission report to see if all the scary hype was warranted. The potential effect on automobiles would probably be less than everyone worries about; however, the real damage from an EMP attack would be to the network of computers that control everything from from the electric grid to the natural gas pipeline system to the inventory and delivery systems for every major wholesaler and retailer, to the air traffic control system to the banking networks that allow you to swipe your credit card at the gas pump (assuming the pumps still work after the local electric grid goes down)...<br><br>In other words, we'd be screwed. The probability of a bolt-from-the-blue EMP attack is pretty low, but even a relatively small series of terrorist attacks or natural disasters hitting the right targets could ruin big parts of our economy for years. We are just too vulnerable. Remember that classic science fiction story <i>The Machine Stops</i>?<br><br>So, what to do?<br><br>The problem, as you have pointed out, is that it is economically non-competitive (and thus money-losing) to deploy and rely on more robust technologies when the rest of the world is becoming more "efficient." I recall some comments in recent weeks about the expense of raising horses, for example. <br><br>We all know that a hundred years from now we're going to need lots of hay burners to replace the current fleet of gas guzzlers, and cowboys will come back into vogue in much of the areas currently devoted to fossil fuel-based row agriculture in places like Nebraska and Kansas, but getting a head start on a horse-based transportation system right now will merely drive you into bankruptcy.<br><br>It seems to me that only serious hobbyists or people with sufficient disposable income can afford to do the kinds of things that will make a real difference in a timely manner.<br><br><a href=#c7735132240648511452 title="comment permalink">7/20/11, 9:24 PM</a><br><br>

Try as I might, I don't think that resiliency and efficiency are natural opposites. Rather I think it is an effect of the MBA take over of most company management the last few decades that give this illusion.<br><br>Efficiency after all is a human concept; it attempts to minimize some inputs to a process. Which inputs are considered most valuable and get minimized in the name of efficiency is entirely a human decision. <br><br>Over the last three decades, the MBA mindset has ruled, and the asset most valued was money. Our efficiency was synonymous with reducing the cost of goods and services. In an age of cheap energy and resources it meant that using more energy and resources was usually the cheaper alternative and thus more efficient. A similar logic is behind the move that sent overseas most of the local manufacturing jobs(cheap labor).<br><br>There is no reason efficiency cannot be aligned with resiliency. And in fact they will likely be natural allies in the future, when resources and energy are not cheap inputs that can be thrown at any problem to solve it. It is perfectly natural (and was for many centuries prior to this age) for a process to be efficient when it minimizes the use of rare and expensive inputs, thereby saving the supply of those inputs for future needs. <br><br>There is no reason that a "more efficient" process cannot produce a more expensive product that lasts longer, works better, and so on. It is only the MBA mindset of the day that has made "more efficient" synonymous with cheaper.<br><br>I would argue that it is not efficiency which is the enemy of resiliency, but the mindset that values money over resources, human labor and even quality of product.<br><br><a href=#c6363721118547558064 title="comment permalink">7/20/11, 9:39 PM</a><br><br>

Please let us know if you want us to take it off line.<br><br>Bill,<br><br>Climate Change.<br><br> I was just giving the general picture for those not familiar with the patterns. I'm familiar with the relative latitudes, and don't expect the latitude of the NW to have anything to do with differences between it and the East or interior of the continent. Just being immediately downwind of the Pacific.<br><br>Europe will have problems if the reductions in Arctic Salinity as the polar cap melts shut off the thermohaline circulation boosting the Gulf Stream. The Pacific equivalent is the Kurishio Current, which due to lack of thermohaline circulation, is much weaker, but still brings us considerable moderation. The difference in the sizes of the two oceans and the Atlantic's thermohaline circulation is why Europe is warmer for a given latitude than the West Coast of North America. Not much, but it's noticable.<br><br>Mind you, I'm not betting the farm, as you say, on any of this. We've seen quite a lot of _normal_ climate variation here in the last decade. We plant a wide variety accordingly, and accept the failures as well as the successes. My wife' mantra is "more cold frames, bigger greenhouse."<br><br>Mudslides and flooding are not a problem in our neighborhood, my biggest concern is forest fire, but it's been so damp here the last 50 years it hasn't been a problem in this county. If things do dry, we'll have to cut our perimeters further back and install a dig a pond with a firepump.<br><br>I suppose it's the devil you know rather than the one you don't. I'm comfortable building to decent seismic standards, and the local volcanoes are comfortably far away. I'm actually looking forward to our next big subduction quake if it happens in my life. Should rationalize a lot of bad architecture around here real quick.<br><br>Don Mason,<br><br>One reason I find it difficult to take invasion by starving hordes by land or sea too seriously is the way human nature tends to work. By the time people realize they're going to starve if they stay where they are, they don't usually have the resources to go far. Unless the U.S. collapses first, and surviving foriegn governments supply and equip said hordes, they just won't be able to get here.<br> How well can a person fight who is faint from hunger? They may be desparate, but not very effective.<br><br>Having concluded that the Eastern U.S. can't hold onto the West Coast in a post industrial world, you then consign us to invasion and civil war. Sounds like sour grapes at losing your transcontinental empire to me.<br><br> While I don't personally hate the East, I certainly won't miss it much if it lets us go.<br><br>Glenn<br><br>Marrowstone Island<br><br><a href=#c1129558818093119306 title="comment permalink">7/20/11, 9:40 PM</a><br><br>

They can be very sturdy, and last for hundreds of years (unlike the current ticky-tacky tract houses or McMansions). Now all we need is some money and some land...<br><br>JMG:<br><br>I just finished reading <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>, so here is my first contribution to the dissensus:<br><br>I think we need to bring our scattered relatives (and selected friends) together into extended families living in fairly close proximity, just like our great grandparents did. We need to practice old-fashioned home economics, with not only goats and chickens and a vegetable garden and a nice kitchen for canning food, but also studios and workshops and other amenities that could allow us to have one or more small family businesses, or at least be self-sufficient in things like clothing and home-made soap. <br><br>One or more people can work at outside jobs (while jobs are still available), while others do the farming and construction and maintenance and cleaning and cooking and taking care of Grandma (that would be me). I envision something like one of those family compounds like they have in Afghanistan or Pakistan, or a manor house in the south of England (without the servants quarters or the Agatha Christie murders during fox hunting season)) that can stay in the family for generations. <br><br>That last point is very important: without a large inheritance or a winning lottery ticket, it will take generations to turn a small farmstead into a relatively self-sufficient family enterprise with the home-made windmills and four-season greenhouses and humanure composting and methane-generating waste recycling system, etc, that will permit it to be sustainable over the long run. <br><br>In the first few decades, while the fossil-fuel-based industrial economy is still sputtering along, we will still have access to jobs and the Internet and money. This would be the time to build up a library of reference books and get the garden going and caulk those leaky windows. <br><br>While the electric grid is still up and running, we could use power tools to build the workshop in which we could later build the solar panels and wind mills to generate our own inefficient (but very resiliant) electricity after the grid goes down. After I'm gone (I want to be buried in my rose garden), the next generation will have a base from which to do whatever needs to be done next, and so on, unto the Nth generation. <br><br>A hundred years from now, my great-great-grandkids may be raising draft horses for the Yellow Cab company in the nearest big town, or manufacturing small electric generators from salvaged truck alternators for all the neighbors (my son, the gun nut, wants to make gunpowder using the traditional recipe of saltpeter, charcoal and sulfur).<br><br>We want to be land owners, not renters or refugees (who knows, maybe only land owners will get to vote in a future society, just like 200 years ago). In a thousand years or so, it would be so much better to be landed gentry than serfs, in whatever kind of society that develops. Land, especially agricultural land, has been the traditional basis for wealth and power for thousands of years, and after the last drop of oil is pumped out of the ground, it's going to be like that for thousands of years to come.<br><br>Now all we have to do is prevent some future child from losing the family estate in a poker game (that's the kind of thing I worry about sometimes after reading all those historical romance novels)...<br><br><a href=#c1304587325017497248 title="comment permalink">7/20/11, 11:00 PM</a><br><br>

People don't get it - yet. I get strange comments from people regarding the diversity and number of fruit trees here.<br><br>I grow 250+ different fruit trees, essentially because I like home grown organic fruit, but also years ago I realised that the climate was extremely variable from year to year and that unexpected things can happen such as locust plagues - with little warning.<br><br>Without the huge diversity, it would be a very risky venture relying on that fruit production. I'm unsure how mono cultures succeed without large inputs of fertiliser, water and pesticides.<br><br>But with the diversity I can shrug off shocks. Some years yellow stone fruit do better than white stone fruit etc. Sometimes the high humidity encourages fungal growths. Sometimes low humidity produces small intensely flavoured fruit (higher sugar levels) but you have the risk of bush fire.<br><br>The same principles can be applied to chooks. There's about 7 different varieties in the chook run so I get eggs all year - even today in the middle of winter - love the Silkies. If I only had Isa Browns, there'd be no eggs for the next few weeks until the days get longer.<br><br>You can do the same with vegetables, don't grow one sort, grow 50 sorts and stick to heritage varieties as you'll be able to collect the seed and breed up strains that suit your area, soil and climate.<br><br>Power systems are the same and I'm thinking about adding a small wind turbine to supplement the solar PV over winter.<br><br>Resiliency may also mean only having two lights on in the house over winter to reduce your power usage though. Like today after three days of sitting in a cloud...<br><br>As to EMP, well people were asking me about this in relation to solar PV power generation. Basically the inverter and the regulator in such a system would be stuffed. However the panels and batteries should be OK. Some panels have a diode which may be fried, but this can be bypassed. The diode (which works by letting energy flow in one direction only) is there to stop power leaking out into space at night through the panel from the batteries. You could still have a useful system without the other two components - it may be a bit manual though - I'm not sure what you'd connect up to that system though unless you had some more resilient form of appliance such as a valve radio. I'd think one of the small thermoelectric fridges would probably be OK too as they're pretty simple.<br><br>If your area was hit by an EMP pulse get back to basics straight away and there's still plenty of biological systems and basic tools that would still mean that you could have an OK life. Plenty of people lived in pre-Industrial times. <br><br>My advice to people is stop worrying and get on and do something productive.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c4721894957365347460 title="comment permalink">7/21/11, 1:10 AM</a><br><br>

I suspect the post was established as a knee-jerk to 9-11. Even in the relatively good times, I had no budget to go with the role. I wasn’t allowed to disrupt routine business to test ‘resilience’ in exercises, but the series of incidents – power cuts lasting days, IT networks failing for a week, water cut off, gas leaks, flooding, severe weather, and even pestilence, in the form of Swine Flu, all provided me with abundant real-world material for Lessons Identified papers (as distinct from Lessons Learned) which I would dutifully offer to those above me. Whereupon they would receive a Good Stiff Ignoring, as the particular crisis had just passed.<br><br>I think much of the problem I had in convincing these so-called managers, preoccupied with efficiency drives and tactical firefighting, was to think strategically, ten years out, and properly consider the likely disruptions over that timescale. For a business, loss of people, equipment, premises, power, information or reputation just about covers it all. Still, there’s no benefit in strategic and negative thinking when the next Quarter’s results are due in and highly visible tactical efficiency drives are all the rage, and nobody ever got Brownie Points for preventing a crisis unseen, only for overtly solving one that had already blown up. <br><br>Anyway, I could see that my caring employer was in long term decline and accordingly made my own plans, and thankfully, I no longer work there. Since I left, they’ve concentrated onto a single site, endured severe budget cuts and reputational attacks, and their decline trajectory has deepened somewhat. Sadly, the same is true of the Business Continuity specialism in general, invariably seen as an add-on and not remotely connected to the survival of a business. <br><br>These days, I still apply Business Continuity principles in my domestic setting. Meanwhile, over at FEMA...<br><br>At his first all-staff meeting with FEMA employees, Fugate asked for a show of hands: “How many people here have your family disaster plan ready to go? [If you don’t], you just failed your first test … If you’re going to be an emergency manager, the first place you start is at home..”<br><br>Water, meds, light, heating, food, information (car radio), cash, bug-out bag in case of a family crisis, and so on. Check. I recently did some simple business continuity exercises here at Chateau Moutarde – checking my email account worked on the local library computers, and going through emergency equipment and papers in the car. How many people check the pressure of the spare tyre..?

It's exactly what you are talking about. It annoys me hugely that I had to throw out a washing machine last month, because the "efficient" and "smart" electronic controls had died in our last, very cold, winter. The mechanics and the motor were perfectly sound. Replacing the chips would have cost almost as much as a new machine. <br><br>One of the projects I have here is to learn about mechanics.

(The finance system went along with that.) Could well be a correct hypothesis.<br>Another fine example I see close to my home on the Scottish Border, is that technological marvel the John Deere tractor. They do not break down often, but if they need a spare part, an electronic message to Texas brings the part on the afternoon plane. These marvels do make for timely cultivations and harvests - you can do most of a large farm in a few days, and with our weather that means a great deal for crop yields. Now we could make do with less efficient machines (we did) or even with horses. One farm near here in living memory had 26 pairs of Shires, but these dear creatures could only work hard 8 hours a day and needed a lot of ground to feed them.<br>The equivalent I suppose to valve radios in farming is very sturdy ICE-based machinery that can be blacksmithed and run on local oil-seed diesel. But even then, a robust diesel motor is a very sophisticated piece of kit. <br>It will be a very different world for us if we have to live on salvage like many parts of present 3rd World. We will still need those bags of grain and legumes even in our buttoned down little howf with a vigorous veggie and fruit garden. <br>Lucky perhaps they restored the old Water Mill down the road as a tourist attraction! :)<br>I think I am joking. More significantly, we can actually each reduce our personal 'demands' and get by better, as you say, investing time 'profitsably' if 'inefficiently', on the house and garden and any manner of apparently daft projects. <br>phil<br><br><a href=#c7751845737571873539 title="comment permalink">7/21/11, 3:23 AM</a><br><br>

The question of trust runs through it to some degree. For example, in the last 50 years food production has largely moved out of backyards and local farms to regional, national and now overseas markets without a lot of hand-wringing about whether we should trust all these people we don’t know to feed us. Same with manufacturing, customer services, banking, etc. We’ve been quite comfortable in trusting “the system” to provide. Astonishing, really, for a species that isn’t always that great at getting along with the neighbors. <br><br>I think people believe on some level that “the system” is more trust-worthy, reliable, and resilient than what they can do locally, and that it provides lower cost, more choice and more fallback. At some point in the evolution of these markets that was probably all true. But as the systems matured and became more dependent on a few weak transportation links they became more brittle. But I don’t think most people have realized that yet and in the meantime they don’t trust themselves to do much locally anymore. So we have to lose trust in the system, while building it back up in ourselves. That will be a neat trick.<br><br>On a related topic, it’s amazing how much resiliency there is baked into one of the key enablers of all this efficiency – the information technology infrastructure. Redundant network connections, onsite power generators, fallback data centers, hot and cold failover systems and backup services of all kinds. When I was doing IT for a living, we could think of all kinds of reasons why the computers might fail, and how they would need to be double and triple protected, but we didn’t give quite so much thought to the risks inherent in moving the accounting department to India.

There are things we can do along those lines, such as substituting labor for automation, and I've managed to get some of that adopted. <br><br>Still, we use electronic components from a complex global supply chain. It's not been lost on me that it's impossible for such an activity to become truly resilient. But maybe the idea will stick with some, and that was really the reason I introduced it anyway. <br>completely agree with your ideas of salvaging resiliency, and it's well known that older products were designed with much more margin, as without computer aided design one could not design so close to the edge. Now that extra is considered waste, as people cannot seem to imagine the role it was playing - until it fails. However, I don't put much stock in the whole EMP thing - sure it would destroy many electronic circuits, but probably not the ones I design. There are many good standards in existence now that test how products will perform when subjected to various transients and surges. You certainly can protect against such things, but of course it always depends on just how hard you hit it, so there would be a lot of variability depending on location. And most products do not carry those costs.<br><br><a href=#c7575642417763386830 title="comment permalink">7/21/11, 4:34 AM</a><br><br>

But I am certain that “having money” is certainly necessary; greed and hoarding are good, particularly when you don’t spend it and wake up every morning to count the beans. Why? Because of the possibility extreme, unexpected events. You just need a larger buffer than we are told by the fools. You need redundancy. A lot of redundancy.<br><br>Complex systems tend to optimize –therefore become more fragile. Electricity grids (Barabasi, 2003) optimize to the point of not coping with unexpected surges –Barabasi warned us of the possibility of a NYC blackout like the one we had in 2003. Quite prophetic, the fellow. Electricity kept getting more and more efficient since, particularly in the UK. No slack.<br><br>Only idiots (such as Banks) optimize, not realizing that a simple model error can blow through their capital (it just did). Goldman Sachs experienced 24 x the daily transaction volume in August 2007 –would 29 times have blown up the system? The only weak point I know of financial markets is their ability to drive people &amp; companies to “efficiency” against risks of extreme events.<br><br>I was in a hotel room in Istanbul when the internet cable connection died. I called the operator who connected me to a gentleman who had a strong Indian accent –“I see, sir, that rrrrooooom 223 should now have a connection, sir, now, go, sir, connect again, sir”. I asked him out of curiosity if there were many Indian techies in Istanbul (I was also impressed with his non-Mediterranean politeness). “No, sir, I am not in Istanbul, sir”, he replied. He was in India and could tell that room 223 was now connected. So efficiency is driving us to use Bangalore (etc.) as our IT because it is very optimal. But what happens to the world if there is a problem there? Are we equipped?<br><br>Option-theoretic analysis: redundancy is like long an option. You certainly pay for it, but it may be worth it.<br><br>Biology: Complex systems, like the human body, and mother nature, are NOT optimized. They harbor plenty of duplicate pathways, plenty of redundancies.<br><br><a href=#c1342997582407422208 title="comment permalink">7/21/11, 5:06 AM</a><br><br>

It’s helpful to think of it as an either/or, because then my choice is clear: resilience is the goal. It also helps clarify the tradeoffs of public infrastructure, in a way that I might be able to use when discussing with friends. <br><br><i>It may well turn out that burning through the available resources, and then crashing into ruin, is simply the most efficient way for a civilization to go.</i> Well, dang – efficient till the end… what a way to go! ;-}<br><br>But even so, sometimes it seems my lower-level tools are more efficient than the tech ones. For example, it’s great to be able to grab my scythe and whack down the few taller weeds in my front yard, rather than starting the mower just for those weeds. It takes a couple minutes; I don’t have to wonder if it’s “tuned up” and it’s quiet and easy &amp; quick to put away! No stink either. :-)<br><br><i>it would be just as viable, and just as cheap, if the US government were to do the smart thing and arrange for a couple of midsized domestic electronics firms to start manufacturing reliable tube-based electronics as backups for critical infrastructure across the country. </i><br><br>This sounds like a great new job for someone who’s good with glass and basic radio – making “survival sets” to sell to all those who are now aware of the danger and want to have a backup!!<br><br>@GHung: <i>When most of my contemporaries were specializing, I remained the stubborn generalist, trading efficiency for resilience it seems.</i> <br><br>Yes, I couldn’t stick with specialization, and blamed myself for being unfocused. But it’s quite probable that some inner gut feeling was pushing me to keep a little skill of each type.

I've enjoyed it over the years and my India Pale Ale with homegrown hops is getting better with each batch. While I agree that a good homebrew beer will always be in demand during decline, making that same brew could be a problem. I live in Napa, CA and we grow a lot of grapes (all dependent on electric provided irrigation), but no barley or wheat (though in the early 1900's our hills were covered in winter wheat and this area was the biggest supplier of wheat west of the Mississippi). Without supplies of malt extract coming into my homebrew shop from around the world, my brew days would be numbered. Bags of barley could be stored, but that would only be a short term solution and not sustainable with about 10 lbs needed for an all grain batch of beer. I don't even think barely is raised in CA on a comerical scale. So seeing my beer making days limited without a reliable source of barley, I've recently taken up mead or "honey wine" making. <br><br>As I'm sure you know, mead has been around for thousands of year and predates beer and wine in Africa. It was very popular in pre-Roman Europe (the Romans wanted wine and beer made as they could tax the grapes and barley, but harder to tax wild honey) and was made everywhere honey was found. So with a good supply of honey, which is available locally, I can be making a tasty fermented alcoholic beverage that would be in demand when beer and wine is in short supply. <br><br>Well that's the plan so far to have more resiliency in the future. Thank you for all of your ideas and time over the years. I've also recently bought your Druidry Handbook and I'm looking forward to my next ceremony on August 1st.<br>Carl<br><br><a href=#c3716108280738144880 title="comment permalink">7/21/11, 8:56 AM</a><br><br>

Before I made it into print, I worked in what Reagan-era Republicans used to call "high paying service jobs" (that is to say, minimum wage scut work) and did a stint as a househusband. As for efficiency and resilience, I don't think you're paying attention to what the words actually mean. Saying that just-in-time systems are inefficient because they break down when challenged, for example misses the entire point of my post, and makes hash out of the meanings of the words. <br><br>Ghung, you're welcome -- and you're quite right; none of this is new. Just the names have been changed. <br><br>Apple Jack, exactly. It's a matter of moving in the direction of resilience, focusing on what you can do now with what you have, and then taking the next step from there. <br><br>Marc, well, yes, but it's not just that. A narrow wheelbase and a high center of gravity means that you roll very easily. <br><br>Susan, bingo. Hobbyists -- that is, people who do something for reasons other than economics -- are one of the only hopes we've got at this point. "Help me, basement inventor! You're my only hope." <br><br>Steve, that's a different issue. It's also a relevant one, but I don't think you've grasped my point. Whatever the resource that is being conserved by efficiency, the more efficient an object or process is, the less margin for error that object or process has in relation to whatever that resource is needed to do -- whether it's structural strength in a bridge, or whatever. To make something resilient, it has to have that margin for error, which it can only have if resources are used in a less than efficient way. <br><br>Don, exactly. It's Fuller's ability to reason brilliantly from hopelessly wrong preconceptions that makes him worth studying. <br><br>Nate, true, and so is survival.

I'm not the only one, either, to have this sort of reaction to these changes. When one is dealing with human lives, increasing the level of stress on nurses and other direct care providers does not do the patient a bit of good, and indeed can do a good bit of harm. Witness the increase in *serious* medication errors reported on the national news recently. One nurse committed suicide after just such an error which killed a preemie. <br><br>I see this as a direct result of 1. putting cost efficiency before people and 2. valuing management over the line staff that make management's jobs possible. <br><br>anognostic: your aladdin lamps DO in fact depend on fossil fuels. They don't work without the paraffin or kerosene to fuel them. I have several kerosene lamps and one aladdin lamp, which burns many times the fuel my kerosene lamps do - it also gives off much more light and heat, so we do use it in winter for the benefits. They have their issues though. Olive oil (or other vegetable oil) does NOT work in those lamps. They only became possible as a result of fossil fuels - do some research on what they used before paraffin and kerosene. It's pretty ugly. <br><br>Rechargeable solar lamps may not last several lifetimes as a kerosene lamp has already done, but they will last for many years. By the time they no longer work, we will be back to plain old oil (not fuel oil, vegetable oil) lamps and less agreeable alternatives. Frankly, it's better if you just plan on going to bed and getting up with the sun.

You'll want to have a spare in a metal box somewhere, or replace it with a diode tube. Solar flares are a different matter -- they don't produce the sudden pulse that fries solid state electronics; with a big flare, we have to worry about the electrical grid turning into a giant antenna and picking up voltages that will fry every grid transformer in North America. <br><br>As for nobody being on the air, that's why I push ham radio -- there'll be plenty of retired engineers with old "boatanchor" rigs on the air all over the amateur bands, setting up emergency communication nets and expanding the old message traffic system, because that's what hams do. I've met guys to whom you could hand a heap of old electronic junk, and thirty minutes later they'll have built a transceiver, powered it off an old car battery, strung a dipole antenna, and be tapping out a message in Morse code to somebody in Botswana.

Here's a secret that may make you plenty of money (or get you plenty of bartered goods) down the road: learn how to tear out the electronics from washing machines, and other useful devices, and replace them with cheap, sturdy, old-fahioned mechanical timers and the like.

They have a visionary quality that strongly appeals to me. They were popular at a time when it seemed we could make a better world with material prosperity for everyone on the planet, in direct contradiction to grim Malthusian and social Darwinist ideas. His "more-with-less-ing" technology, which was indeed all about efficiency in the use of materials and energy, really seemed like it might achieve that. Whether it would have worked if implemented on a global scale at that time, I don't know. It was all predicated on using industrial technologies and economies of scale which now appear to be stretched to their breaking point. <br><br>The one statement Fuller pretty consistently made with which I've always disagreed is that overpopulatioon isn't a problem. I am quite sure that it is. <br><br>As you know I'm very interested in domes and a have a geodesic project of my own in the works. As with his other inventions, Fuller meant these to be built using the most advanced technology of the time - viz., aerospace technology. That's probably why enthusiastic hippie carpenters have had trouble with them. It's my impression that the lowest level of tech with which one can build a viable (i.e., non-leaky) geodesic is ship-building technology. A dome must be made like the hull of a boat, able to withstand exceptional stresses and to resist leakage. With a little luck, I hope to soon be putting this proposition to the test. <br><br>To return to the theme of universal prosperity: the last time I can recall having heard this idea put forth by a figure of any prominence was when West German Chancellor Willy Brandt proposed that the wealthy nations of the world institute a program to help out poor countries with meaningful economic and technical development, in a spirit more or less diametrically opposed to that of the IMF. That was in the first half of the 1980s. Since then that sort of idealism seems to have evaporated. I really miss it. Now it seems that we'll scarcely be able to enjoy a tolerable standard of living even when viewed from a narrowly selfish and nationalistic standpoint. Idealism bites the dust. <br><br>I've always heartily agreed with your suggestion that the 80s were when it all went wrong and short-sighted greed brought us low.<br><br><a href=#c6010824432326367839 title="comment permalink">7/21/11, 11:58 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks.<br><br>Here is the word origin for resilience: 1620s, from L. resiliens, prp. of resilire "to rebound, recoil," from re- "back" + salire "to jump, leap" (see salient). Cf. result.<br><br>so it means "to jump back". In conjunction with your discussion today it seems that as we "jump back" in energy time so to speak we will need to be able to "jump back" in technologies as well. Resilience gives us that ability. Interesting that there are all kinds of examples of this kind of thing happening right now. Take the Space Shuttle as an example. We currently have no ability to put any of our astronauts into space. And it seems that we have no option for doing so anytime soon. Is this part of our "push for efficiency". I think so. <br><br>Seems to me that we are going to "jump backwards" over the next couple decades without the ability to "jump back".<br><br><a href=#c4519201171536976983 title="comment permalink">7/21/11, 1:37 PM</a><br><br>

A resistant system is adapted to tolerating a high degree of forcing without losing its basic structure and function; a resilient system is one that is able to restore structure and function rapidly after a disturbance disrupts them. For a resistant ecosystem, imagine a coastal forest adapted to tolerate strong winds and salt intrusions so that winds and tides from storms do not cause major disturbances to it. For a resilient system imagine a chaparral, which is adapted to burn completely to the ground during a wildfire, but then regrow rapidly afterwards so that things like biomass and primary productivity are rapidly restored. <br><br>The two are not necessarily tradeoffs; alpine tundra, for example, is neither resistant nor resilient. Trample it and it dies and takes a very long time to grow back. Fire-adapted southeastern pinelands might be seen as both resistant and resilient, at least in terms of fire -- most fires burn through and cause little disruption; when the occasional severe fire kills the trees new pines regrow quite rapidly (maybe part of why these ecosystems have been so easily and extensively exploited for commercial short-rotation timber production). <br><br>Since human societies and households are nothing but ecosystems with a big human component, perhaps the same pair of ideas might be useful there, too<br><br><a href=#c5374223599626379050 title="comment permalink">7/21/11, 2:51 PM</a><br><br>

Very good. You're quite right that resilience isn't simply redundancy, though that's a key part of it; flexibility, which can also be thought of as a capacity for redundancy in the choice of paths, is important; so is feeding the wider system -- what you're doing with your pollinator plants, and I'm doing with mine. <br><br>Zach, and of course that's also a crucial point. The financial system we have right now, for example, is very efficient at making money for its upper management, and hopelessly inefficient when measured by any other metric you care to name. <br><br>Cathy, that's a good point, and mirror's Zach's point in a way. A lawn mower may be more efficient at cutting grass, but less efficient at using your time.

Malting your own grains isn't that hard if you take the time to learn how to do it -- I've known homebrewers who did it, and sparged the result to make an excellent wort and fine beer.

Reliability and repair-ability are design and manufacturing criteria. In the planned obsolescence world, a product's life cycle is intentionally short. To be resilient, equipment would have to self-repair. <br><br>Resilience is, to my mind, the ability to take an unexpected hit and bounce back. It is adaptability to changes in the environment that go beyond the normal range. It is biological/organic, not mechanical. <br><br>Adaptation is done by individuals and communities. They will be limited if their technological tools turn into bricks, but the creative are not stymied. Still survival can not be taken for granted. <br><br>For humans resilience includes mental toughness and faith, in addition to the ability to improvise for short term and/or long term survival. Long term we survive based on community.<br><br>Modern engineering efficiency creates advantages within systems of its own making. There are also limits that risk management studies point out. This is where management needs to be truly honest and listen to the engineers and the greater community. <br><br>Nuclear energy was going to produce electricity so cheaply that it wouldn't have to be metered. Ultimate total system costs were minimized/ignored. Such "failure of intelligence" seems to occur wherever unbridled optimism meets unwanted scenarios. Too good to be true is a tough standard. <br><br>Given the vast debt in the world, private and public, plus unfunded liabilities, the future I see is retrenchment. We are headed back to the 1950's where deferred gratification was known and practiced. <br><br>People saved to buy what they wanted; they waited. As a child, you'd circle ten things in the Christmas catalog and be happy to get one. In the new 1950's there will be racial and gender equality, communications technology to minimize isolation, but a necessary leanness for most. <br><br>True resilience is something that isn't known until tested.

Increase the fuel to the engine, watch the revolutions or power increase. Efficiency. Increase rate of buying mortgaged homes, watch the capitalized mortgaged-backed securities bubble expand.<br><br>The difference, I think, is one of focus. Efficiency is amount of change in desired output with respect to change in expected input. Resilience examines changes in output with respect to unexpected inputs. I think robustness is very similar to resilience.<br><br>Too much single-focus "efficiency" tends to degrade resilience. This is an amateur, unprofessional example of lack of engineering (design to cost) skills. I note that resilience <em>without</em> efficiency is worthless - the system isn't producing anything, thus wasting all inputs.<br><br><br>@ Cathy McGuire,<br><br>I hope you reach your goal of learning to crow soon!

They had over 100 employees and used a paper system called a Kalamazoo. But it was basically a manual cash book, payroll, debtors ledger. Easy.<br><br>As a confession, I converted them to an electronic accounting system, but wouldn't have been able to do this if I hadn't understood the manual system first. I'm not convinced many people understand the fundamentals anymore and I've had plenty of first hand experience with numerous graduates (I ran a graduate program for a few years at a big business - it was fun and rewarding). <br><br>Also interestingly a manual system is less able to have transactions pushed away into rat holes like suspense accounts (a very stupid idea). There's a place for everything in a manual system and everything is generally in it's place.<br><br>The other thing that I keep seeing in comments is people saying that setting up a garden or orchard is expensive. I can't imagine Johnny Apple Seed cared too much about expense. <br><br>The reason I say this is because people have forgotten that every time you cut open fruit you see seeds. You can plant them out and the trees are often hardier to drought / cold / flood than grafted trees because they have bigger roots and generally aren't transplanted. They may not grow 100% true to the parent but in most cases they're close enough. Collecting heritage variety veggie seeds is almost 100% idiot proof. If you have to buy seeds in firstly, they really don't cost that much at all.<br><br>As to waste, every time you flush the toilet or take out the garbage then there is all manner of organic product leaving your property. If you composted these so called wastes and put them back into the soil you won't even have to bring in organic matter from a garden supply place. <br><br>The problems we have are of our own making. It takes more effort to do all of these things, but if you don't then you are totally dependant on the system to supply them and you have to work to pay for this supply. You might just also miss out on the entertainment from a family of Blue Wrens cruising through your veggie beds cleaning up the bugs - which is happening as I write this.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superb_Fairy-wren<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c674106143244234860 title="comment permalink">7/21/11, 8:27 PM</a><br><br>

Try raised garden beds for vegetables. We had record rainfall this year and the raised beds here just shook it off. As for an orchard, build up the soil humus to avoid the roots of the trees drowning. Also don't grow fruit trees below a dam (pond?). Dams always leak.<br><br>Hi Steve in Colorado,<br><br>Your comments about the MBA mindset are a sweeping generalisation. Not everyone with an MBA thinks the way you think they do. I've noticed a growing general lack of regard for education in recent years. Even if you disagree with the specifics of an education, it still teaches you a lot of things. I have a favourite saying in these circumstances, "I went to the school of hard knocks too, but I also went to university". Don't knock it until you've tried it.<br><br>Hi Glenn,<br><br>As to forest fires and your dam and pump. Make sure that the pump is close to the house because most houses burn down from ember attack which happens before and after the fire front has passed. The fire front usually passes within a few minutes and serves to heat up all of the available fuel (inside and outside) via radiant heat. The embers are what sets a house burning though. A good reason to seriously think about caulking the house and roof.<br><br>Also have a think about what type of pump you're going to put in. Petrol (gas?) pumps vaporise the air/fuel mix and cut out in high air temperatures. Diesel seems more resilient in these conditions. Electric pumps must have an independent power supply (good luck with the grid in a forest fire). The old timers used to use knapsacks which are a 5 gallon tank on their backs with a hand pump to pressurise it - it's more effective than you'd think. Also don't wear synthetics, always stick to heavy wool or cotton at a pinch. Don't be outside when the fire front hits. Good luck!<br><br>Hey Cathy M,<br><br>Good on ya for keeping a rooster. Too many people only keep hens and it's a real genetic risk. Sure they're noisy, but they're also great watch dogs too.

If you do passive solar to help heat the house in the winter, make absolutely certain that it won’t add to the heat load in the summer.<br><br>About 20 years ago, we built a super-insulated, passive solar house in Northern Illinois. After many years of living there, my conclusion was that the south-facing windows didn’t help as much as we had hoped in the winter because the winters here are so cloudy – but even though an overhang prevented direct sunlight from coming in during the summer, enough was reflected inside that it added some unwanted heat. (Building insulated shutters with reflective foil inside helped a lot with that problem, though.)<br><br>We used 16” deep, double-stud exterior walls filled with fiberglass. I would definitely use super-insulation if I ever build a house from the ground up again (which I probably won’t – I’m getting too old and may not be able to finish the job. Rehabbing our current houses is slow enough.)<br><br>Even though the saying is “The last inch of insulation is never cost-efficient”, I like the resiliency that massive amounts of insulation gives you going into the future: no matter what the climate does in the coming decades – hotter or colder, tropical or New Ice Age – the additional insulation will always help to moderate how it affects you. Insulation is simple and not real sexy, but it works.<br><br>So my advice is: insulate, insulate, insulate. And when you’re done insulating, insulate some more. Then think about solar heating – and in your climate, be real careful about summer overheating.<br><br><a href=#c446493442601003536 title="comment permalink">7/21/11, 8:29 PM</a><br><br>

A screwdriver is resilient if you can use it hard, even for things it's not quite designed for, without breaking it. Self-repair is one specific strategy to achieve resilience. As for the new 1950s, we don't have enough fossil fuels left to plateau out at that level; think 1880s if we're lucky and smart, 1820s if we're not. <br><br>Richard, true enough. That's one of the reasons I'm pleased to have old jars full of bolts and nails in the basement.

While working in IT, I was (am still?) always a bit flummoxed by arriving at a site and fixing a problem in a few hours or, at worst, days, that specialists have been working on for weeks or even months. <br>As soon as a problem deviates even slightly from the specialist's area of knowledge, they're toast.<br>And I couldn't even guess how often I have seen this happen. Each time, it just reinforces for me that it's good to be the generalist.<br>On the unexpected joys of gardening (thanks to you all that have shared), I was on the way, with last night's apple peel, to the chook shed this morning and heard a noise right next to my ear as I was going under the arbour. Stop, look, try and focus that close (getting more and more difficult as time goes on) and it's a rainbow lorikeet telling me off. Normally they wouldn't let me get within three metres. And this one just stares me down. So I reach up to touch it and get a gentle nibble on the end of my finger. I guess it's the hungry time for these guys just now, not much fruiting or flowering. So I proffer a bit of apple core. Her mate is yelling at her from the tree across the garden, but as soon as he sees she's eating, he's right next to her, sharing in the bounty.<br>Bliss.<br>I would never have thought they would be so easily tameable (not that I would do such a thing – at some point I am going to find some idiot who still believes in growth economics to buy this place – the last things these guys need is to be depending on me).<br><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Lorikeet rel=nofollow>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Lorikeet</a><br>Cheers,<br>Les<br><br><a href=#c9096051680011629646 title="comment permalink">7/22/11, 5:37 AM</a><br><br>

That grid must be well designed and planned. We aren’t looking for a transmission system that is bulletproof or “gold-plated”, as some have suggested; rather, we want a system that is solid and stable. In this high-tech world, we are highly dependent on stable electricity flows, and the bulk transmission system is key to ensuring those stable flows. <br><br>We also have to recognize that our current transmission system, the largest machine in the world, is aging and was never built or designed to do what we are asking it to do today. The electric utility industry has done a tremendous job maintaining and adapting the transmission infrastructure we have today to meet the needs of consumers and the economy the best it can. But I am reminded of my time on the farm where we could sometimes hold a piece of machinery together for a long time with some baling wire. This is becoming ever more difficult to do with an increasingly old transmission grid - the average age of our substation transformers is over 42 years, and we have poles and cross beams out there that are nearly 100 years old. We’re depending on these aging assets to keep the grid in balance in sub-second time increments."<br><br>http://www.ferc.gov/media/statements-speeches/norris/2011/07-21-11-norris-E-6.asp<br><br>Sometimes truth lurks in the strangest places...not that those who speak it always understand its implications.<br><br>The result here could be to downshift and figure out what needs really need to be met and how best to do it. <br><br>Instead, a 620-page behemoth of a ruling follows that puts all sorts of new requirements on electric utilities to get busy "building and modernizing" the grid.<br><br><a href=#c1963265866333546153 title="comment permalink">7/22/11, 8:56 AM</a><br><br>

And that's saying something, since I haven't seen a bad one yet. Never considered that efficiency might be worth questioning, or that its headlong pursuit could even reinforce the peak resource argument. But you're right! It's hard to preach a message of inefficiency in this culture! People always ask us why we have to do everything "the hard way."<br><br>So what about system designs that improve both resilience AND efficiency? Currently I spend about 10 hours a week spot watering the 115 fruit-bearing woody perennials I planted this spring - everything from blueberries and kiwis to olives and pomegranates. But before next season we hope to install a water catchment system on the barn uphill from the garden, and install drip tape irrigation on all the perennials in the upper sections, at least. That would save me well more than half of that time spent spot watering, AND provide a backup water supply requiring less energy to operate than the well. Just open a spigot at the right spot and go do something else!<br><br>Surely that is the goal of the permaculturalist. Both resilience and efficiency.

We actually faced the situation you described when the power went out, and had little old ladies who really needed to get their prescriptions RIGHT NOW!!! <br><br>We worked out a plan whereby we would write down the UPC and price, calculate the sales tax, and do an "illegal" transaction in exchange for cash or check only, and then make it "legal" after the electricity came back on. It was sort of like the drugstore scene in <i>One Second After</i>.<br><br>Concerning what level of technology at which we can stabilize, I expect we'll see a mirror image of the development on the upside of Hubbert's Peak. A hundred years ago, heavier than air flight was in its infancy. A hundred years in the future, the military may still have some planes and zeppelins, but the rest of us will be riding mostly trains and horses.<br><br>My husband is a great railfan and model railroader, and he thinks (or at least hopes) we'll see a big resurgence in rail travel. The earliest trains were pulled by horses. Then came wood-powered steam engines, followed by coal-powered steam engines, followed by diesels. Each transition happened because the new fuel was more efficient (there's that word again) than the previous one. <br><br>So, just as with airplanes, a hundred years from now we will see a lot fewer people in private automobiles and more people riding the rails. 150 years ago, during the Civil War, all of the locomotives were powered by burning cordwood. This wasn't as good as using coal, but the fuel actually did grow on trees, and could theoretically last a long time, assuming the forests were allowed to regenerate themselves like in Japan (unfortunately, this didn't happen 150 years ago in Europe and America, which is one reason they switched to coal, but there is always hope we can learn at least some lessons from the past).<br><br>As a side note, I remember riding on the Mike Fink keelboats at Disneyland. Over the next century or two, we'll probably see lots of pole boats and sail boats and horse-drawn canal boats on the waterways, plus a restructuring of population centers to be closer to the lakes and rivers and canals and remaining rail lines. <br><br>So, assuming a stable population, we could very well stabilize at an early 19th century level (plus some electricity and modern medicine) and stay there for a long time. That wouldn't be so bad...<br><br>And on a completely different note, I have this global warming fantasy vision of a future naval war between Canada and Russia over the newly ice-free Arctic Ocean, fought between fleets of sailing ships just like they had during the Napoleonic Wars (the newly independent nation of Alaska would probably play a pivital role in this conflict, possibly aided by the neighboring city-state of Ecotopia)...<br><br><a href=#c427959886318021504 title="comment permalink">7/22/11, 11:14 AM</a><br><br>

Even in the solar hot water and PV business. Here's just one example...<br><br>The latest "fad" in solar hot water is "evacuated tube" collectors. I won't go into details but suffice it to say that under some conditions they are more efficient than flat plate solar hot water collectors. <br><br>Evacuated tube collectors are tubes of glass that hold a vacuum. Inside the tube is a collector surface. Fluid in the tube vaporizes, rises to the top of the tube, condenses (and heats a manifold) and falls to the bottom of the tube to start the cycle over again. The tubes are light-weight and about 3" in diameter. Installers like them because they can carry up one or two tubes at a time without assistance. And, typically, takes only one person to install the roof hardware. <br><br>The installers sell the systems by touting their improved ability to convert sunlight to hot water (efficiency) but the real efficiency is the lower labor costs and greater profits to the installer. The efficiency benefit is not for the customer, its for the installer.<br><br>People seem to forget however, that "Nature abhors a vacuum" and that traditional solar hot water panels (called "flat plate collectors" by installers) last for decades.<br><br>In fact, we regularly service solar hot water systems with flat plate collectors that have been in use since Jimmy Carter was president (the late 1970s).(Flat plate collectors are just an aluminum box with a black collector surface and some piping inside and a glass front.)<br><br>Does anybody really think that evacuated tube collectors will be functioning in 40 years or that the extra efficiency is a worthy tradeoff. I promise you that the extra efficiency over their life will not make up for the 30 or 40 years of extra production (resiliency) you'll get out of the flat plate collectors.<br><br>Footnote: Whenever we remove vintage collectors, there is always someone interested in repurposing them - we just list them on Craigs List or Freecycle. I have a friend who's uses a pair to heat bio-diesel oil to make it easier to filter out the french fry and McNugget crumbs! I have another friend who built a parabolic mirror structure aimed at pair of flat plate collectors to make super hot fluid (he actually destroyed some vacuum tube collectors by overheating them with the same mirrors). And, I have a pair of vintage collectors soon to be deployed on a solar space heating project.<br><br><a href=#c6054586079281564423 title="comment permalink">7/22/11, 8:42 PM</a><br><br>

In Ireland we may be able to do a deal directly with Libya or similar to get oil in exchange for cattle for instance (we feed 100 million europeans with beef)but we have little oil of our own. I see direct agreements happening.<br><br>Regarding efficiency versus resiliance, yea I broadly agree, but be careful to avoid binary thinking here: It is good to be resiliant (plenty of spare capacity, and using systems that are not dependent on complexity and centralization) but also to be efficient with resource use, just like the k selected old growth forests.

I don't do modern medicine, by and large, so wasn't looking at Lasik anyway. <br><br>Sofistek, to get much past 30% you're pushing at thermodynamic limits, and that would involve complex (and therefore brittle) technology. There's your greater efficiency and less resilience!<br><br>AK, and of course that's another part of the puzzle. Efficiency always has to be defined by saying what's being used efficiently, and efficient with money isn't necessarily efficient with fuel, or time, or anything else. <br><br>Bill, I stand corrected.<br><br>Mark, thanks for the example! I'm certainly planning on flat plate collectors when we finish raising the funds for our solar water heating system. <br><br>Marek, no, the next sere is scarcity industrialism. That's the efficient (and less resilient) sere under current and near future conditions. Under those conditions, the salvage economy is less efficient -- which is why it's more resilient; when it becomes the most efficient economy available, once fossil fuel supplies are gone, then it'll begin to show its own lack of resilience (for example, what happens when the salvage runs out?) and the next sere, the ecotechnic sere, will start to emerge in places where resilience matters. <br><br>Z, I've already covered the downside of the Hubbert curve, in terms not too different from the ones you've used, in discussions of scarcity industrialism. As for the tradeoffs between efficiency and resilience, of course you can leverage efficiency in one system, or according to one measure, to get resilience in another system or measure -- and vice versa. The direct tradeoff between efficiency and resilience applies to a single system measured according to the same parameter.<br><br><a href=#c5415184552770642016 title="comment permalink">7/23/11, 5:44 AM</a><br><br>

It seems to me a logical extension of the idea might be found in modern systems of formal schooling. I'm thinking for example of my parents both of whom at midcentury learned Latin in school. Teaching Latin these days would be considered woefully inefficient: not 'just in time' enough to be directly serviceable for particular job requirements. Who wants to pay for a bunch of classics teachers and "frills" such as dead languages? Yet that knowledge base lends itself toward a degree of resilence in the sense that in circumstances of communications breakdown where, say, one encounters a word one doesn't know, one can often guess its meaning with a fair degree of accuracy. This then would be but one example of a bit of resilience that's been eliminated from standard school curricula in favor of efficiency.<br><br>Extrapolating for all of this, it seems to me we can make an analogous critique of our educ. system generally. We see an increasing drive for direct, immediate and short-term relevance in the form of specific job skills and a concomitant decline in a commitment to less efficient but--ex hypothesi--more resilient instruction in arts and humanities, history, etc. One might even add instruction in basic math and science rather than "technology." <br><br>I can't help but feel that this narrow vocationalism typical of recent educational experience is making us more brittle--less resilient--in the face of the coming challenges. On an even larger scale, we can think of what a more truly resilient education would mean, not just for children but for all of us. The sorts of things many of us are trying to accomplish presently, e.g., analogous to the vacuum radio tubes, re-learning the lost skills of so many kinds we are going to need when the lights go out. <br><br>So...what do you think? Is applying the notion of resilience to education like this an overextension of the idea? Or a fruitful avenue for inquiry? It seems like it may be a helfpul notion in this area.

One popular gimmick for marketers for a long time now are what I like to call "pseudocrafts" -- activities where most of what you do is spend money, but you put a few pieces together or follow some instructions for the final step or two, and then, hey! You tell yourself you did it all yourself. Gardening gets that as much as anything. As far as I'm concerned, if you start with anything but soil, seeds, hand tools, and compost you make yourself, you're spending too much money and not learning the skills you need. Now of course I'm biased!<br><br>Grrl, ouch. More efficient, but definitely less resilient. <br><br>Sofistek, I disagree. If you're measuring the same system in the same way, and in terms of the same value, resilience and efficiency are inversely related; it's when those conditions don't get met that it looks as though you can have both. <br><br>Zach, it sounds as though this could best be modeled by defining a third factor. As efficiency increases, resilience necessarily decreases; as resilience increases, efficiency necessarily decreases; but efficiency and resilience can both decrease in a system at the same time. What increases in proportion to those decreases? My intuitive guess is "waste," but it's an interesting point.<br><br>Tom, of course an age of human unity and cooperation would be very helpful, but unless you have some way of making one of those happen -- and the ways that have been tried so far have consistently failed, and not uncommonly produced spectacular body counts -- it's probably more useful to assume that human beings are what they are, and plan accordingly. <br><br>Hawlkeye, that's an excellent example.

Indeed, during the summer, our forests are not that different in physiognomy from forests of the humid tropics. Birds of closed forests worldwide are notoriously difficult to get good looks at.

It just seems to me that there are examples in which efficiency is not the opposite of resilience, whilst not, at all, detracting from JMG's argument in his article.<br><br>A general class of examples might be how one uses tools, let's say a scythe (but it could be an axe, a digging fork, a saw, and so on). Certain techniques are not very efficient and can both tire you out or make you sore much more quickly than other techniques. Or some techniques take longer to complete the job than other techniques. It may be the way you set up the scythe, hold the scythe swing the scythe, how often you hone the blade, or whatever. Increasing effiency doesn't seem to decrease resilience to me. In some cases, perhaps with woodworking or metal work, your techniques may use less material, thereby increasing the efficiency of the use of materials and increasing resiliency (because there are less resources consumed to replace).<br><br>Sorry to belabour the point. I agree with your article - it was brilliant - but Steve in Colorado's post just made me think that it is not always as straightforward as one might think. There are some cases where increased efficiency doesn't reduce resilience.<br><br>Oh, I just thought of another example with setting a fire. A local organics magazine mentioned this - an upside down fire. The fire is prepared the opposite way to convention - i.e. empty the grate, stack wood fairly tightly on the bottom, then some smaller kindling, some tinder wood on that and finally something to start it off, say strips of newspaper. In this way the fire burns more slowly and more efficiently, with less soot. It seems to work. I can't think how resilience is compromised there, either.<br><br><a href=#c7888692873185749699 title="comment permalink">7/24/11, 4:45 PM</a><br><br>

Given it's late summer where a lot of commenters are, there's comments about watering fruit trees.<br><br>It can get pretty hot and dry here over summer. As a general rule though, because of limited water supplies, I only water the fruit trees when there will be two weeks of temperatures in excess of mid 35 degrees celsius with no rainfall. <br><br>Even then, I only give them a bucket or so of water - just enough to get through.<br><br>The reason for this is because it encourages resilience in the trees. Over a number of years they start to develop deeper root systems. If you water them regularly during these periods, the trees become dependant on this service and keep their shallow root systems. This resilience is another reason I encourage people to plant seedling fruit trees because they have naturally deeper and more extensive root systems.<br><br>The main reason for grafted fruit trees is to reduce the mature size of the tree through using rootstock which has a smaller root system ie. it deliberately slows the amount of nutrients available to the tree. Smaller root systems means the end tree is less able to scavenge water and nutrients in extreme conditions though.

Glad that extension of the idea resonates. I love the Latin point and am always happy to defend the most obscure sorts of scholarship! To me the classicists--and by extension medievalists--are one of our canaries in the coalmine. What a great idea to atrophy our cultural memory to make a quick buck! At my university the focus is now wholly on grant-getting, which mostly boils down to as direct as possible servicing of short-term corporate and political interests. Not a great environment for history or my own pathetic little field, philosophy. <br><br>It does strike me that 'resilience' may offer a more concrete and convincing rallying point for defending a more holistic conception of educ., not just traditional liberal arts but also the "good" kind of vocational educ., elements of which can be found in certain 'progressives' of yesteryear such as John Dewey, one of those figure imho so often cited but not really attended to. It's a kind of cultural resilience at both the individual and collective levels. An inherently holistic notion more congenial to a more defensible vision of human flourishing than educ. as hyperspecialization, where we become mere appendages to tech-aided capital accumulation.<br><br>I suppose one counter consideration could be that when we're talking about mass societies, whether it be human beings or, say, ant colonies, there are contexts where efficiency and resilience are not so neatly opposed. Take ants. (See Mark Moffett's wonderful work.) It seems to me that these massive ant colonies, often with millions of individuals, achieve a high degree of resilience via a high degree of specialization-driven efficiency. It's more about the distribution of the efficiencies across the community rather than efficiency per se. So you could destroy half an ant colony and it would be able to build itself back up in short order. But if, say, all the ants with Function X were all located together and could all be destroyed, then sans Function X the colony would die. So I'm thinking that resilience and efficiency aren't necessarily opposed. It's that there is an optimum level of efficiency where, if it's distributed in a certain way, actually enhances resilience. But then there's a point of diminishing returns, and then a point where efficiency is actually inimical to resilience.<br><br><a href=#c3112618228978190043 title="comment permalink">7/25/11, 6:31 AM</a><br><br>

The discussion has certainly enlarged my personal conceptualization.<br><br>Also, what about the term “convenience”? It seems that in everyday life we think that something is efficient if it’s “convenient”—which often involves immense amounts of inconvenience for other people and the ecosystem. The folks living in mountaintop removal areas are deeply inconvenienced--to put it mildly--so we can "conveniently" and "efficiently" power our lights and computers. It’s more “efficient”, e.g. “convenient,” to take “disposable” plates, etc. on a picnic.

I used the example of tools with less metal because it allowed me to focus on the specific point I've been trying to make all along. As for Cohen, well, if you find his writing useful, by all means!<br><br>Cherokee, it <i>is</i> a Ponzi scheme. Once politicians realized they could buy reelection by spending money now and pushing the bills off on the future, most of the industrial world backed itself into a corner from which there is no way out. <br><br>Marek, no, for heaven's sake, that's not what I'm saying at all. Scarcity industrialism isn't a "transition state;" it's a stage in its own right, like abundance industrialism, the salvage economy or the ecotechnic economy. Like the other stages, it will blur into those before and after it, and last longer in some places than in others; that's one of the reasons why it's possible, for those who want to do so, to leapfrog to a less efficient but more resilient stage in advance. <br><br>BTW, the two comments you tried to make on the issue of efficiency versus resilience simply rehashed misunderstandings I've already addressed half a dozen times already. See the note above the comments window about hammering on a point already addressed!<br><br>David, are you at all familiar with Ernesto Grassi's very interesting work, some decades old at this point, on rhetoric in Italian humanism as a mode of philosophy? Donald Verene and James Goetsch also had some useful things to say along the same lines, mostly with regard to Vico. A good deal of my current work -- and some of the forthcoming post on education -- riffs off some of the points they raised. <br><br>Cathy, glad to hear it. <br><br>Adrian, I hope that you and the other educators here aren't too offended by my comments. I have some very harsh things to say about the state of education in America these days, and though I'm not interested in pointing fingers, some of my proposals tend to upset people in the industry about as thoroughly as my ideas about economics upset economists. <br><br>Jason, yes, that was basically my take. Caramelizing that beetroot is a much better plan -- or weeding the garden; we had a break in the heat this morning, and I was out there with a hoe for a couple of hours. <br><br>Adrian, I tend to define "convenience" as "privilege" -- something is convenient if someone else does the work. <br><br>RPS, here again, you're not measuring resilience and efficiency in the same terms or with reference to the same specific system. I wonder why it's so difficult for so many people to get past using those words vaguely, and evading the specific sense I've defined repeatedly here? It's rather reminiscent of the way that netheads used to insist on talking about something else whenever I pointed out that the internet has to pay for itself. <br><br>Phil, I think it was Upton Sinclair who pointed out that it's very hard to get someone to understand something if their salary depends on not understanding it.<br><br><a href=#c2781897937507661234 title="comment permalink">7/25/11, 11:54 AM</a><br><br>

We could also cross today’s trophy horses—Friesians, European Warmbloods, Gypsy Vanners--on our abundant supply of Quarter Horse mares. Connemaras and Welsh Cobs might blend in too. Plus, we need to reclaim our remaining old style Morgans.<br> <br>Smaller ride/drive/pull horses strike me as a better fit for future ecotechnic farms than any of the current purebred draft breeds. <br><br>“We don't usually want to put horses to work until they are mature, about age four, for draft horses. Drafts mature slower, and may continue growing through age five or six, but about age four most of the important skeletal growth points have been achieved, and even more importantly, the brain or mind achieves a mature level.”<br><br>Mental maturity is one of the main reasons the Spanish Riding School waits until four. Using their model, I didn’t start riding my Anglo-Arabs until four, and even then the first year was light work. Unlike the SRS horses though, my youngsters spent their first years learning to accept tack, follow voice commands, and ground drive through obstacles and down the road. <br> <br>Until I read Ph.D. bone paleontologist Deb Bennett’s books and articles, I too thought breeds/types matured at different rates. Bennett, formerly of the Smithsonian and now a full-time horseman, convinced me otherwise. She says horses of all breeds and types mature at five and that the problems incurred by early use often don’t start where we think they start. Here’s a link to a revision of her famous “Ranger” article, which still circulates on the Internet: <a href=http://www.equinestudies.org/ranger_2008/ranger_piece_2008_pdf1.pdf rel=nofollow>“Timing and Rate of Skeletal Maturation in Horses: With Comments on Starting Young Horses and the State of the Industry."</a><br><br>“The average life spans of horses vary, as do the number of useful working years.”<br><br>Not only do the life spans vary by type and breed, they vary by bloodline. Decades ago, I noticed one line of Arabians where old meant fifteen and eighteen meant dead. On the other hand, I still expect Arabians with considerable Abu Farwa (1940-1972) in their pedigrees to be hard at work in their 20s. <br><br>“Some horses are typically used very hard, and retired early . . . . “ <br><br>Retired. Nice euphemism. The average three year old Thoroughbred racer is dinner in Japan and France. The same's true for many well-bred cutting and reining Quarter Horses. It’s telling that auctions of “well started” two year old cutting horses include full sets of X-rays. <br><br>“Many modern horses live unnecessarily shortened lives because they are overfed.”<br><br>Americans foist their eating habits onto their animals. In horses, our ignorant kindness brings on epiphysitis and laminitis—deformities, pain, and death. <br> <br>Of course, as hay becomes more expensive, more and more horses are likely to score 3 or 4 on the Henneke scale rather than 8 or 9. Abandonments and starvation are in the horse news daily. <br><br>“But, in general, I imagine the Yellow Cab company of the future will use the draft horses for group hauling, and lighter breeds or crosses for quicker and lighter uses.”<br><br>Out of curiosity, I just checked <a href=http://www.yellowcabchicago.com/our-history.html rel=nofollow>“History of Yellow Cab"</a> and confirmed their business was and is only a car/cab business. <br><br>How about we start a company for the future: Green Wizard Cab, Coach, and Dray?<br><br>Houyhnhnm<br><br><a href=#c3103082133430566389 title="comment permalink">7/25/11, 2:40 PM</a><br><br>

As an agnostic-cum-something-akin-to-a-pantheistic-animist, I can't help but wonder if a cohesive group "religion" of one sort or another is the norm for humans, and that regular access to knowledge that can convince us that the god we learn about in Sunday School doesn't exist, and that evolution is both an elegant and convincing alternative, is quite anomalous and temporal.<br><br>Many industrial humans were never "bothered" by such thoughts, and so might cruise right through the period of human origin enlightenment without a dent in their cultural armor. But for those of us who do hold that knowledge, this understanding makes us cultural outcasts, to one degree or another. Especially here in the US southeast.<br><br>From your esteemed vantage point, can you offer some insight as to whether or not a lower energy future might have the effect of "reining in" the "wayward" intellectuals? At least as the generations become more removed from access to that knowledge? I'm not suggesting that we will all go back to being baptists, or become inquisitors, but do you think it likely that some local spiritual tradition will become more ubiquitous as we move away from electron micrographs and genome analysis? <br><br>Scale is everything in this matter, and I could very easily see neo-tribalism often organizing itself along the lines of cohesive spiritual traditions. Perhaps one of those new tribes in any given region could remain the agnostic tribe, but, at least in my area, that seems like a recipe for imminent annihilation by a neighboring group of, um, less tolerant souls.<br><br>Any advice on riding the slide in terms of group spirituality? Do you feel safe, being who you are, in a crowd of narrow-minded folks potentially looking for a "Satan" to root out so that everything can return to "normal"?

As for languages, no argument there; I'd be happier if every American in school was expected to learn one modern foreign language, one ancient language, and the Native American language spoken in the place they now live. That way they'd actually be able to think their way out of a paper bag, without getting tangled up in the kind of nonsense that comes from being trapped in the worldview of a single language. <br><br>PG, it's useful -- more useful than you think, in fact. I'm doing a lot of study in the fields of strategy and geopolitics right now, with an eye toward anticipating the messy future of American global hegemony, and this is a data point worth having. <br><br>Dancegirl, thank you!

The fact that something would be nice doesn't make it possible, much less likely -- and so it makes a great deal more sense to plan on human beings being human beings, i.e., as likely to quarrel and cheat as to cooperate, and easily swayed one way or another by unpredictable factors.

Bwahahaha, etc. <br><br>Trippticket, that's an exceedingly complex question with no simple answers. The degree to which human societies expect religious conformity of their members varies drastically from case to case, and the hot tempers on both sides of the current Darwinist vs. fundamentalist split actually have very little to do with religion as such -- in a society where social caste is as off limits in polite company as sex was in Victorian England, surrogate markers such as religion get put to use as targets for class hatred on all sides. As for me, I've had no trouble at all, though that's partly because Cumberland MD is about as cosmopolitan as a small city in the north central Appalachians is likely to get -- there's an annual drag queen pageant here, for heaven's sake. <br><br>X, thanks for the link!

For beginners I actually think the Peterson guides are the easiest (just make sure you have the right one, east vs west). I am not fond of online identification resources, and rarely like the field guides based on photographs rather than illustrations by skilled artists. Most important of all is to get an idea of what the common species in your area are, and learn them. eBird (ebird.org) can give you a bar graph checklist for whatever county you live in, provided you don't live in a very rural area from which little or no data have been contributed. Go to "View and Explore data," pick "bar graph" then select country, state, and county. Note the species that have big fat lines; these will be the large majority of the birds you spot. Don't get bogged down in all the dozens and dozens of others with the skinny and irregular lines until you know the common ones well. Also very important is to remember that any given species comes in multiple plumages depending on age and gender. In the upcoming post nesting and fall migration seasons, only a small portion of the birds will be adult males. Most will be young-of-the-year, which are often plainer and less distinctive.<br><br><a href=#c6138980487612924312 title="comment permalink">7/26/11, 9:37 AM</a><br><br>

The advantage to homeschooling is you can customize to the child and pick what works. Alternatively, public school can be balanced by home life.<br><br>As it happens, at one time I taught young children at an arts-based school. We used Montessori and Waldorf elements, but also included other teaching methods and materials. Any educational system based on the ideas of one person can be overly rigid and can foster a "true believer" mode not unlike some of the conservative religious schools. No one educational method has all the answers. <br><br>Much depends on the teachers and administrators. Much also depends on the parents--and the children.<br><br>When they were too old for that school, my children went to public school, which is in a decent system, and which was well-balanced by our home life. We made sure we were involved parents. <br><br>It wasn't perfect, and we had our bad moments, but the children turned out ok. They had some truly dedicated teachers (and also some less so). Had the school system been worse, I would have homeschooled.<br><br>Waldorf's emphasis on nurturing imagination and love of the earth is laudable. Looping is great. There are other aspects I would question, such as not using printed books for younger age-groups. Also, how does anthroposophy fit in with your family's spiritual beliefs?<br><br>I guess what I'm trying to say here, is that what's most important for a child's education (in a holistic sense) is what happens at home, and how interests and talents are nurtured in the context of the family culture.

Last November I was asked to do a talk on home-scale poultry systems at the south regional Georgia Organics conference. Some lovely local folks attended my talk and offered us a place to live with plenty of acreage to do basically what we pleased with. After a full three years of "down-teching," simplifying, and increasing our food production capacity, we are damn near making a living out of our garden and have trimmed our monthly bills down to ~$150 total (none of which we couldn't live without, excepting perhaps refrigeration, for the moment). And that's without using any alternative energy supply. We feel we're now in a position to replace what little bit of electricity we use with PV solar, and some of the direct mechanical technology we discuss here. At least for a few crucial functions.<br><br>Back to your question, we have been receiving food stamps for the last two years, because we don't make or spend very much money (we've been paying off debt despite making 20% of what we were making 4 years ago when we acquired that debt), and we tend to spend a fair chunk of it on seed stock - potatoes, garlic, beans, etc - and have become self-reliant in these seed stocks. And we now have about half an acre in intensive permaculture production, plus some diffuse livestock systems on larger acreages (our Jersey cow is a huge boon), with plans to be a source of regional genetic stock to repopulate this area with magnificent biodiversity, and to be a provider of human scale jobs in a gasping industrial landscape, as the opportunities arise. Our model is basically "we did all this by directing our meager government support budget away from looking for work in a collapsing system, and into procreative, regenerative human ecosystem support structures, and you can too (if you hurry)."<br><br>Ship's going down, man. I don't see any way around it. You paid into the good ship USS America for years and will never see any of it back if you don't take it wherever you can get it, and do it now. There are plenty who will argue with that approach, as if your statistically-non-existent allotment is responsible for bringing down the house (trust me on this one), but if you are directing it in such a way as to provide real, long-term human resources, if you are using it to repair natural capital - the only kind that matters in the long view, then I for one think you should take the pittance and put it to good use. <br><br>I sleep really well at night knowing that I am taking a pocketful of decaying currency, based on a completely unsustainable model, and turning it into something of actual value. Within two years we'll be producing more food than my entire extended family, and all of our friends, could possibly eat, and doing it without a fossil fuel subsidy of any kind. Socially, accepting food stamps is a hard choice; ecologically, it's a no-brainer.<br><br><a href=#c7775694012311006285 title="comment permalink">7/26/11, 8:17 PM</a><br><br>

I don't really understand the details in US government system. <br><br>I had a flash of insight that I wanted to share and get your thoughts on - sorry it's late in the weekly cycle.<br><br>Over here there's been a debate about a carbon tax scheme which should get through Parliament and be enacted as law soon-ish.<br><br>I was wondering though about the focus on climate change over say other pressing issues such as peak oil or peak resources for example. It occurred to me that from a political perspective climate change is a good issue to focus on because the details and specifics are unknown whilst the generalities are known. It is also a bit fuzzy on the timing of the particular climate changes. As well as this, and as much as people dislike tax in general they're not unfamiliar with tax and it isn't a request to change their lifestyles.<br><br>However, with other issues such as peak oil or peak resources, it would be politically unpalatable to acknowledge either issue. To do so would mean that politicians would have to acknowledge that there is an end game to business as usual.<br><br>It seems quite a difference to me.<br><br>PS: The Australian dollar is rising as currency traders are fleeing the US$ and the Euro. Word on the street is that they consider the Australian dollar as a defacto purchase of commodities.<br><br>Actually the fall of the US$ will put immense pressure on the ability of the US to import oil. It may not be a bad thing from a big picture perspective though.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c7986780004475170729 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 1:56 AM</a><br><br>

I'm growing some of the same plant species here as they are also quite drought hardy. Australia used to have rainforest covering about 1/3rd of the land mass before people came along and upset the equilibrium. So it can grow here in very low rainfall areas. They're amazing plants and worthwhile keeping.<br><br>Yikes! 73inches. I thought it was wet here last year and we received a record 55 inches! The ground must have never dried out...<br><br>Hey Bill,<br><br>Actually the drier areas here also have the most diverse flora and fauna - just like your area. My interest in rainforests here is to reduce evaporation over summer, provide more shade than the eucalyptus canopy and reduce the overall flammability of the forest. As we have a boom and bust cycle - which I don't think you people in the Northern hemisphere can quite empathise with - most of the rainforest trees are quite adapted to both really wet and really dry years which is a major advantage. The closest exotic trees I have seen to them in terms of survivability in extreme conditions are oak trees which seem to shake off drought conditions quite easily. They do here anyway.<br><br>Regards.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c4422656866216596039 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 2:10 AM</a><br><br>

I left Academia after realizing it was no longer the home of the Scholar, and had been replaced by yet another home for the Salesman. The old guard, who were scholars, did not seem fully aware that this had happened. Not having a salesman's temperament, it was clear there was no happy career path for me there. So I became a trucker, a simple and marketable trade where I provided a service that was undeniably in demand and left my mind free to explore the universe. You can think about all sorts of things while you spend 10 hours a day watching an ever-changing panoramic view of the world and society from your rolling office and its picture window, and you get to see all the backstage ugliness that keeps the grand pageant of American middle class life going. The show is never the same when you have seen all the actors without their corsets or makeup, pitching tantrums while spilling their whiskey on themselves, surrounded by rickety scaffolding and frayed ropes among cardboard props and plywood sets. <br><br>I am not sure where the home for the scholar is in America at the present. A few who manage to combine both the scholar's and salesman's temperaments endure in Academia, but I am very uncertain what has happened to the bulk of us.<br><br><a href=#c8296598710668368273 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 4:59 AM</a><br><br>

So even though they may endure a drier climate, without irrigation I would be surprised if they would actually grow well there. As for evaporative losses, in most situations plants from wetter climates are LESS conservative in terms of transpiration than those from dry climates, not more. So again I would expect that in order for them to actually grow, they would need to transpire more water than semiarid trees. Also, a denser canopy can likely only be maintained with more water in the long run. Now as for reducing flammability, that's definitely a good point.<br><br>I might suggest considering a different tack -- in your semiarid climate, there must be SOME native non-eucalypt trees, even if only a few species. If these are less flammable you might try replacing the eucalypts with them. If you have some irrigation water to spare you can likely get a denser canopy cover. But in natural forests, leaf area index (the total square meters of leaves found over 1 square meter of ground, including overlapping strata) is pretty well correlated with water availability. I doubt you will be able to support a much denser canopy long-term without providing more water.<br><br><a href=#c2578443290321750633 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 6:29 AM</a><br><br>

Things have been tight since '08 when both my wife and I lost our full time jobs 3 weeks apart (company folded, and no unemployment for me). Thanks to our frugal lifestyle, savings and part time/side jobs, we've made it OK so far, otherwise we'd have been sunk. My wife landed a solid job last winter, albeit part time, &gt;1/2 her previous pay. Taking an 80% cut in household (formal economy) income overnight was, IMO, analogous to a major step down for the economy to come.<br><br>I would like to think the last three years have only been a dress rehearsal for the future, but it's beginning to look like we've gotten a headstart on many of you in more ways than one ;-)<br><br>Despite our best efforts, this year's harvest looks to be mediocre at best, mainly due to the heat and a major outbreak of chinese stink bugs. Many crops did well early, but declined quickly once the heat set in. My cukes produced well, then crashed (they usually produce through August). Tomatoes refuse to ripen in the heat, so I've been picking mostly green and bringing them indoors to finish ripening. Summer greens and edamame were a no go this year, while corn and okra seem to be ok. Shallots did well, but the onions went to seed early refusing to respond to nipping. They are still nice, though small. Herbs doing well as always. Garlic crashed; leaving in ground through next spring. Squash and peppers are still doing well, especially the hot peppers.<br>The blackberries had a bumper crop, raspberries ok, blueberries didn't like the heat it seems. Beans got tough; having to pick young (heat?). My potatos in bags seem to be doing well. We tested one bag of young Yukons last week: Superb! About 14 pounds from one feed sack. I think the technique is a keeper.<br><br>I'm hoping for good fall crops, cloning tomato plants for a late crop and planting another round of dry beans and field peas.<br><br>One high note on cukes and tomatoes: We planted a variety of heirlooms and this is a good experiment to determine what varieties will do better as the world heats up. The hybrids resist bugs and blight better but seem to have a narrower heat range than some of the old timers.<br><br>I urge you growers to keep a log/diary so to keep track of what does well where, when, and under different conditions. Get used to planting a wide variety, and stick to it.<br><br>Anyone have a good source for, or any advice regarding Japanese Rice (as featured in JMG's "Adam's Story")? We have a small wetland (not the environmentally sensitive type) below our smaller pond. Paddies would be very doable.<br>Thanks!<br><br><a href=#c8344413041011324647 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 6:30 AM</a><br><br>

Here are some more thoughts.<br><br>re Montessori: The episcopal Montessori might be ok, depending on how it's run (is it flexible or rigid? Does it include playtime and the arts? Are the teachers friendly, loving, and caring?). <br><br>Your daughter would not experience it as "work," and having a friend there would be a big plus. It might also be helpful to you and your friends, in terms of shared family cultures and school involvement. <br><br>Maria Montessori used the word "work" in a particular sense relating to the child's real task of growth and maturation--not in the pejorative sense that many adults attach to the word. (Not saying you do! You obviously love your work.)<br><br>She wrote some worthwhile books, such as <i>The Secret of Childhood</i> that I'd recommend to any parent, whether or not the aim is to send the child to a Montessori school. Many of her ideas make a great deal of sense.<br><br>Setting up a village school sounds good--but is a full-time job for whoever does it and it takes real commitment. Some folks I know have set up a Friends (Quaker) school and that has become their real work. Homeschooling requires less administration/overhead/funding--but still requires a serious time commitment from someone.<br><br><a href=#c3259704976168404978 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 7:24 AM</a><br><br>

Nil, though some folks will counter; <i>"What if everybody went on food stamps?"</i>.... <br><br>As you suggested, combined contributions from my wife and me are now well into high six figures, perhaps seven, all things considered. She owned and ran a business for ~20 years, employed many people,,,so we only need do the math. She was "eliminated" by large corporations pushing the small folks out via changes in State licensing requirements. She couldn't even sell her business after 20 years. Her long-time clients threw her a party, some wept over loosing her services and the prospect of having to do business with the impersonal corporate beasts. But that is long in the past.....<br><br>Brad K.: Thanks as well. Read Tripp's response, above, to get a sense of where we are in our thinking. Our lifetime, and especially the last 15 years of above average self-reliance won't be upset by accepting a small return on our investment into the collective (mess) that is our tax system. Our annual realized benefit would be roughly equal to our property taxes. Of course, if the Govt. will just give us back half of what we've put in, we'll be glad to call it a wash and put it to good use.<br> <br>I'm 53 and my wife is 56. We're the baby boomers you read about who are 'fixin' to get screwed out of most/all of the entitlements we've been promised, payed for. As I've said, this ain't no party. Unlike many folks out there, we're already comfortable making tough choices. <br><br>BTW: I'll be glad to trade food stamps for a good job any day, preferably one that doesn't contribute to the madness. Meantime, I have weeds to pull, wood to cut, and veggies to deliver to the church food pantry.<br><br><a href=#c5972390968181047053 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 7:46 AM</a><br><br>

I survived as long as I did there by drawing on the survival skills -- including the arts of deception -- that I learned from my grandparents and great-grandparents when I was a 'teen, and from the stories they told of their earlier lives and the lives of their impoverished ancestors.

We have not had any debts for the last 25 years -- that's a really important point! We are too old and creaky to do the heavy work of raising all our own food, but we are very rich in much younger good friends who are able to do that kind of work. And we have very many half-forgotten useful skills, as well as several uncommon resources, that put us in a good position to barter for food. (And old people do not need as much food as young ones do.) We expect to survive long enough to pass on these useful skills to a few young people in the next generation.<br><br>And then we die. In any forest, generally speaking, the old trees must die if the young saplings are to grow to their full stature and the forest is to live. Being at peace with one's own impending death also counts as a "survival skill," not for the individual tree, but for the forest. You can cultivate this skill even if you do not believe in any sort of individual survival after death.<br><br><br>@JMG: I agree, the book you said I should write might be of interest. However, I think institutional higher education will collapse soon enough without my help. A rotten tree will fall in a strong wind, even if no axe is laid to its root.

Where I live in Missouri the dominant forest trees are a number of species of oaks and hickories, although there is much diversity in the area, oaks still comprise over half of the large trees in the majority of the forests. <br><br>This is the fourth year I have lived here, the first two years I wondered why so many of the trees from further east were absent or uncommon here. For example, we have no tulip poplars, although I have seen planted ones that are healthy and even seeeded themselves in a few areas, and we have some maples (sugar and red) here and there but they tend to stay on cool, moist ravines and northern slopes and never reach the stature they do in the north and east.<br><br>2008 and 2009 were wetter and cooler than normal summers. I received my answer about why the oaks and hickories are such dominants these past two summers, which have been hot and dry, this year on pace to be worse than last year. The oaks and hickories, along with redcedar and shortleaf pine which are abundant in some areas here too, have shrugged off the dry conditions, while maples, elms (except winged elms), mulberries, serviceberries, and many other trees look visibly stressed. So I'm in agreement with Chris about oaks. Fires in the past reinforced the natural tendencies, as the more drought tolerant trees are also more fire resistant, with the exception of cedar.<br><br>Although I did my research on the climate before moving here, I did not realize some important factors. I had lived in the northeast, southern Appalachians and Minnesota and knew those climates well, and when I looked at the averages for my area of southern Missouri, we get about 44 inches of rain in an average year, with a peak in May and a smaller one in the fall, and a dip in July/August and winter. What it took me a but to realize was the whole feast or famine phenomenon with the rain here. This year we had around 17 inches of rain in a two-week period in late April/early May, with lots of flooding, but have only had one rain event over a half inch in the past two months. Being from cooler climates, the speed at which the intense heat sucks the moisture out of the ground still amazes me. Combine this all with the thin soils common around here, and the ozarks are much more drought prone than other places I've lived, even places with significantly less average precipitation. If you're planning on relocating, be aware of all these factors.<br><br><a href=#c2120528505666735428 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 1:47 PM</a><br><br>

Evaluating and responding to high-risk events seems smart, but is not the point of resilience. <br><br>The reason resilience is so often spoken of as redundancy, and therefore as being inefficient, is that you want to increase your flexibility in responding to a large number of unknown and likely unpredictable events. Lovin's third way helps. Braungart and McDonough talk about Bad, Less Bad and Good.<br><br>Maybe another way to think about things is as failsafes. When an escalator fails, it is till stairs. When an elevator fails it may be a death trap. So is a fuel-efficient car like an escalator or an elevator?<br><br><a href=#c2837691911534253394 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 1:59 PM</a><br><br>

There are other scattered original forest remnants (many VERY small) throughout appalachia and the southeast. It is humbling to remember that in many cases these remnants got left because these were the SMALL trees that were not worth logging! We have an original growth white oak near our house. It was not logged because its bole forks too close to the ground to have been considered good for anything but firewood. It is of course now the largest tree (by diameter) on our entire property. <br><br>About oaks -- it needs to be remembered that there are many species of oaks in North America, and that they vary enormously in their ecology. Some are trees of dry rocky uplands, some are trees of swamps that expect to have their roots flooded for many weeks each year. Some grow tall, fast, and straight, some grow short, slowly, and gnarly. Some have edible acorns, some do not. Just here on our own 40 acres we have 8 species of oaks (along with 3 species of hickory, another diverse genus); several others grow in the vicinity but just not on our land. <br><br>Ozark -- there are a whole suite of Appalachian species that don't make it to the Ozarks, mostly because of (as you noted) the more variable, continental climate there. Tulip Poplar is a biggie to be missing; it is one of our most useful native trees for structural lumber. Our house is built almost entirely of lumber made from the first cut, old-growth tulip poplar on this land. Some others of these appalachian trees make it as far west as where we live (we still have Sourwoods, which are ALREADY turning crimson in the ongoing dry spell) but drop out just to our west and don't cross the Mississippi.<br><br><a href=#c3092551076311844047 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 2:24 PM</a><br><br>

I notice a huge difference in water retention in my garden soil in areas with higher organic matter compared to lower areas. If rainforest used to cover more much more of Australia, I wonder if the rainforest trees build soil better than the eucalypts and thus over time build an environment better suited to perpetuating themselves. I have noticed differences over here in the soil beneath different types of trees. Improved soil means more moisture storage, meaning more moisture-demanding plants can thrive, which also tend to transpire more. If enough area was changed in this manner, rainfall would likely begin to increase. On the other hand, land degradation leads to the downward spiral that's all too common in the present time. The soil is one of the foundations for our own existence and health, it's about time it was granted more attention.<br><br>I do believe that the idea of planting very densely to shade the soil and reduce moisture loss is misguided. It's pretty obvious in my garden that plants with more space don't need as much watering, and crowded ones dry out fast. It's the same as the pattern in nature, where plants space themselves out more and/or are smaller in drier areas. Transpiration by plants tends to take more moisture out of the soil than evaporation, although I have noticed a huge difference in how much water different species suck out of the soil. I had a patch this year that I hoed up in late May to plant, but didn't get to actually plant it for over three weeks, in which there was almost no rain, so the top was dusty and no weeds sprouted. However, when I came to plant it, it was pretty moist a couple inches down, while nearby grassy and weedy areas were dry to the depth of a shovel. Leaving bare soil for an extended time isn't the best thing because the organic matter slowly gets depleted, but if you break up the top inch or two to stop capillary action to the sun-baked and windswept surface, it actually retains its moisture during dry periods very well because of no transpiration.<br><br>If you build soil that retains more moisture, that land may be able to support a more dense planting, however that dense planting still uses more water than a sparser planting of the same species. For the short-term, sparser plantings conserve water. However for the long-term health of the soil, there needs to be enough biomass growing from it and then recycled back into it to keep the soil healthy.<br><br>Along this line, global warming can be thought of as not simply an increase of carbon in the atmosphere, but also a shortage of carbon in the soil. Any method that puts it back into the soil is good for the soil and the atmosphere.<br><br><a href=#c5916281894136489317 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 2:25 PM</a><br><br>

Consider it, rather, a limiting inequality. So, I would rewrite your expression as '(efficiency + resilience &lt;= some constant)'.<br><br>This fits your example nicely, where efficiency is decreased without providing a corresponding increase in resilience. What you need to provide, though, to disprove JMG's point, is an example where increasing resilience does <i>not</i> decrease efficiency (or conversely, where efficiency can be improved without reducing resilience).<br><br>Actually, as I think about it some more, the inequality/third term model would cover examples of that sort -- but, the very fact that you could improve both resilience and efficiency would demonstrate that the system had 'slack' in it that gave room for that improvement (in other words, there was sheer waste to be eliminated, or the quality was poor).

Not that I can do any better - maybe it's not possible to do any better.<br><br>One thing that occurred to me is that the argument implies that the first version of any thing or process is the best that can be done. You can't make it work better (increase the efficiency of the process or product) without increasing the risk of breakage but can't increase the resilience without making it less efficient. However, I don't think that's a reasonable thing to infer. There is no "optimal" condition for a process or product, there is just what is the best for our particular circumstances at any one time. So the first version can be improved, either in efficiency or in resilience, but not both and which way you go depends on what you want to achieve. If it looks like you've done both, perhaps you haven't taken everything into consideration.<br><br>The only exception seems to be technique. Humans can wield a tool more or less efficiently and wielding it more efficiently can increase resilience, whether that's because your body lasts longer and better or because the tool lasts longer as a result or because using the tool efficiently cuts down on waste.<br><br><a href=#c251841730276076292 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 9:18 PM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately, I'm no clearer following your, sometimes impatient, exchange with Marek. I'm not suggesting that resilience and efficiency are not opposites, only that I still don't quite get what you mean by efficiency in terms of seres. You appeared to be saying that a more efficient sere will out-compete and replace the current sere, until we get to a sustainable climax sere. Sustainable seems to be the most resilient one, so I'm clearly missing something that your exchange with Marek hasn't really cleared up.<br><br>Are you likely to post on this any time soon, as I don't think a few lines in a comment section is likely to help much?<br><br>Sorry to be so stupid.<br><br><a href=#c8928308664114330047 title="comment permalink">7/31/11, 3:03 PM</a><br><br>

For example the very sturdy resilient bridge vs the very efficient but much weaker bridge. Or we could compare a 1950's massive chainsaw that requires a Bunyan to wield it and is unbreakable but uses far more fuel than today's light mostly plastic machines.<br><br>OTOH, if one compares different tools that do the same job, more efficiency and more resiliency can co-exist. The chainsaw compared to the handsaw, for example. The handsaw is much easier to keep operational, and runs on the same fuel as the human body. More time is required, but still arguably doing more with less of what is scarce.<br><br><a href=#c5302515208221991000 title="comment permalink">9/7/11, 6:01 AM</a><br><br>
