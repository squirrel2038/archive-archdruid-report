The other day, courtesy of the public library system here in Cumberland, I had the chance to curl up on the couch with a copy of Canadian journalist Jonathan Kay’s survey of American conspiracy theorists, <i>Among the Truthers</i>. I’m sorry to say it was a disappointing read. Kay’s an engaging writer and the book has some good moments, but on the whole it was a depressing reminder of the reasons that the word “journalistic” has become a synonym for “facile and tendentious.”<br><br>This is doubly unfortunate, because the issues Kay was trying to raise are worth discussing. Over the last couple of decades, ordinary political discourse in America has been drowned out by a torrent of hatred and rage—there is really no other way to describe it—directed by people on nearly every part of the political spectrum against their perceived opponents. These days it’s become a commonplace of American political culture to insist that the world’s problems result from the deliberate malevolence of some group of people or other, whose intentions and historical role are portrayed with a degree of moral extremism that would make a third-century Gnostic gulp in disbelief. How many times, dear reader, have you seen blog posts and newspaper articles—we don’t even need to bring in the gutterslop that sloshes through talk radio these days—that flatten out the complex ambiguities of industrial civilization’s spiralling crises into an insistence that somebody or other is wrecking the world out of pure personal wickedness? This is the sort of thing I mean.<br><br>The bipartisan rise of this sort of hate politics in America, in turn, provides an exact parallel to the rise of the conspiracy theory movement that Kay tried to examine. Insist that George W. Bush was the puppet of a cabal of fascists plotting to conquer the world, or that Barack Obama is a socialist out to reduce Americans to slavery under a global dictatorship, and then it’s hardly a leap to go on to argue that Bush’s handlers masterminded the 9/11 attacks or that Obama is a Muslim illegal immigrant with a forged birth certificate. Argue for either of these latter, in turn, and you can use it to bolster your case for the limitless wickedness of your <i>bête du jour</i>.<br><br>It would take a book considerably more substantial than Kay’s to sort out the tangled roots of this twin pandemic of hatred and paranoia. For the moment, I want to focus on just one of the many factors involved, both because it’s not usually discussed in this context and because it’s deeply relevant to the project of this blog.<br><br>Every June, across America, a couple of million high school seniors go through graduation ceremonies in our nation’s public schools and receive the diploma that, once upon a time, certified that they had completed the general course of education proper to the citizen of a democracy. Nowadays, a sizable fraction of those graduates are functionally illiterate. More than half of them have no real notion how their government works and what the rest of the world is like, and have never had more than a passing glimpse of the major works of art, literature, and music that define America’s cultural heritage. All but a tiny fraction of them have never learned how to reason from premises to a conclusion or check the credentials of a fact.<br><br>I’m not at all sure how many of my readers outside the United States have any idea just how bad the state of education has gotten here. A pervasive philosophy of education that reduces its role to that of job training, cultural squabbles that have stripped curriculums of most of their meaningful content, reforms that made the careers of teachers and the finances of districts depend on standardized test scores and thus guaranteed that teaching students how to score high on those tests would be given priority over everything else, budget cuts that always get taken out of classroom expenses rather than administrative costs—well, you can do the math yourself. There are exceptions, but on the whole the public schools in America do a miserably poor job of teaching anything but contempt for learning.<br><br>Higher education is a more complex situation but, in some ways, an even more toxic one. Where the public schools trudge implacably onwards under the iron law of bureaucracy, colleges and universities have become an industry, governed by ethics no better than any other American business. It’s possible to get a good education from an American university if you’re lucky, smart and ruthless, but there are significant downsides to the experiment. The most important are, first, that the university system is more or less designed to leave you a quarter million dollars or so in debt by the time you finish your degree program, without the option of bankruptcy—college loans are federally guaranteed, meaning that the courts can’t discharge them—and, second, while the academic industry presents itself as a ticket to high-paying careers, the great majority of college degree programs don’t do anything of the kind. It’s been shown repeatedly that the vast majority of high school seniors who enter university now will never recover financially from the economic burden of paying off their student loans.<br><br>No doubt a case could be made, and no doubt it will be made, that the exposure to learning that comes from a college education is worth a lifetime of financial impoverishment. The difficulty with such claims is that the philosophy of education as job training that helped gut America’s public schools has done much the same thing to higher education, even in fields—such as the humanities—that sometimes claim to be exempt from the trend. In most of today’s American universities, despite a certain amount of lip service, humanities programs no longer fulfill their historic role of giving students a broad introduction to humanity’s cultural and intellectual heritage. Their focus instead is on the job training needed by future professors in one or another narrow subspecialty. Departments have to justify their existence in today’s academic industry by maximizing enrollment, however, and this means that degree programs in the humanities not only admit, but actively recruit, far more students every year than are needed to meet the demand for new professors of film studies, postcolonial literature, comparative history of ideas, and the like. That’s the reason why, as the joke goes, the first thing a liberal arts major says when he or she goes to work after graduation is “Would you like fries with that?”<br><br>Now factor in the multiple economic impacts of peak oil on a sprawling, dysfunctional collection of government bureacracies, on the one hand, and a corrupt and rapacious industry totally dependent on abundant credit and government loan guarantees, on the other. At the least, it’s a recipe for the end of American education as it’s currently practiced, and it’s not implausible that unless something else gets patched together in a hurry, it could mean the end of American education, period.<br><br>Like the rest of America’s bureaucracies and industries, education in this country got onto its current trajectory of metastatic growth in the aftermath of the Second World War, when oceans of cheap fossil fuel energy and the considerable benefits of global hegemony made no price tag look too big. When the wave of homegrown fossil fuel crested in the early 1970s, in turn, Americans—who even then were willing to blame almost anything for their troubles, other than the irritating unwillingness of the laws of physics to give them a limitless supply of energy—decided to double down and bluff, for all the world as though acting out the fantasy that we’d have plenty of energy and resources in the future would force the bluff to turn into reality.<br><br>The realization most Americans are frantically trying to stave off just now is that nature has called our bluff. That limitless new supply of energy most of us were waiting for hasn’t appeared, and there are good reasons, founded in the laws of physics, to think that it never will. In the meantime, our decision to double down has left us burdened with, among other things, a public school system and a collection of colleges and universities even more gargantuan and unaffordable than the ones we had before we doubled down, and a psychology of previous investment that all but guarantees that our society will keep on throwing good money after bad until there’s nothing left to throw. Politicians and ordinary people alike have taken to insisting, along these lines, that the solution to joblessness is to send people to college to get job training, on the assumption that this will somehow make jobs appear for them. To call this magical thinking is an insult to honest sorcerers, but it’s likely to be increasingly common in the years to come—at least until the bottom drops out completely.<br><br>Well before that happens, a system that’s already largely irrelevant to the needs of the present shows every sign of making itself completely irrelevant to the even more pressing challenges of the future. If anything is going to be salvaged from the wreckage, it’s going to have to be done by individuals who commit themselves to the task on their own time. To make sense of such a project, though, it’s going to be necessary to face a far more basic question: what, exactly, is the point of education?<br><br>That’s a far more complex question than it seems, because American culture has spent the last few decades at the far end of a pendulum swing between two sharply different understandings of education—and indeed of human knowledge itself. Call them abstraction and reflection. Abstraction is the view that holds that behind the hubbub and confusion of everyday life lies a fundamental order that can be known by the human mind, and accurately expressed by means of abstract generalizations—E=MC2, the law of supply and demand, the theory of evolution, or what have you. In an age dominated by abstraction, knowledge tends to be equated with these abstract generalizations, and education becomes a matter of teaching students to memorize them, apply them, and maybe add to the sum total of known generalizations.<br><br>Abstraction tends to predominate when civilizations are expanding. It’s a confident viewpoint, both in its faith that the human mind is capable of knowing the inner workings of the cosmos, and in its claims that its method for generating abstractions is applicable to all subjects and that its particular set of abstract generalizations equate to objective truth. Of course the faith and the claims run into trouble sooner or later; whatever method the civilization uses to determine truth—classical logic in ancient Greece, Christian theology in medieval Europe, experimental science in modern America—eventually ends up in paradox and self-contradiction, and the irreducible cussedness of nature turns the first elegant generalizations into clanking, overburdened theoretical machinery that eventually falls apart of its own weight. Meanwhile Utopian hopes of a society of reason and enlightenment, which partisans of abstraction always seem to cherish, run headlong into the hard realities of human nature: after Athens’ golden age, the Peloponnesian War and the self-destruction of Greek democracy; after the Gothic cathedrals and the great medieval summae, the Black Death and the Hundred Years War; after the brilliant trajectory of science from Galileo to Einstein—well, we’ll be around to see the opening stages of that.<br><br>That’s when reflection comes into play. Reflection is the view that recognizes that human ideas of the order of the cosmos are, in the final analysis, just another set of human ideas, and that the hubbub and confusion of everyday life is the only reality we can be sure of. In an age dominated by reflection, Giambattista Vico’s great maxim—“we can truly know only what we make”—takes center stage, and humanity rather than the cosmos becomes the core subject of knowledge. It’s not a knowledge that can be extracted in the form of abstract generalizations, either; it’s a personal, tacit knowledge, a knowledge woven of examples, intuitions, and things felt rather than things defined. From the standpoint of abstraction, of course, this isn’t knowledge at all, but in practical application it works surprisingly well; a sensitivity to circumstances and a memory well stocked with good examples and concrete maxims tend, if anything, to be more useful in the real world than an uncritical reliance on the constructions of current theory.<br><br>This is why Greek intellectual culture, with its focus on logic, mathematics, physics, and speculative philosophy, gave way to Roman intellectual culture, which focused instead on literature, history, jurisprudence, and ethical philosophy. It’s also why the culture of the high Middle Ages, with its soaring ambition to understand the cosmos by interpreting religious revelation in the light of reason, gave way to the <i>humaniores litterae</i>—literally, the more human writings—of the Renaissance, which focused attention back on humanity, not as an object under the not-yet-invented microscope, but as a subject capable of knowing and acting in a complex, unpredictable world. It’s by way of reference to those “more human writings” that we still call the characteristic interests of Renaissance culture “the humanities.”<br><br>Next week’s post will follow the most recent swing of the pendulum over to the side of abstraction, since that has to be understood in order to sort out what can be saved from contemporary science. Here, though, I want to spare a few moments for the almost completely neglected issue of the value of the humanities in an age of collapse. Modern American culture is so deeply invested in abstraction that the very suggestion that reflection, as I’ve defined it, could have pragmatic value as a way of knowledge seems ludicrous to most people. Still, given that we’ve landed ourselves in the usual trap that comes with overcommitment to abstraction—we can determine beyond a shadow of a doubt what has to be done, and prove that it has to be done, but we’ve become completely incapable of motivating people to do it—a strong case could be made that we need to pay more attention to that aspect of knowledge and culture that deals directly with human existence in its actual context of complexity and rootedness, an aspect that offers no general laws but many practical insights.<br><br>There’s another reason why it may be worthwhile to refocus on reflection rather than abstraction in the years ahead of us. As already mentioned, the partisans of abstraction have a hard time finding any value at all in reflection; Plato’s insistence that poets ought to be chucked out the gates of his Republic, John Scotus Erigena’s dismissal of core elements of the humanities because “they do not appear to have to do with the nature of things,” Descartes’ irritable condemnation of literary studies, and the fulminations of today’s scientific pundits against any dimension of human experience that can’t be measured on some kind of dial, all come from this habit of thought. Curiously, though, the reverse is rarely the case. In ages when reflection predominates, the sciences tend to be preserved and transmitted to the future along with the humanities, because the sciences are also products of human thought and culture; they can be studied as much for what they reveal about humanity as for what they reveal about nature. That shift has already been taking place; when the late Carl Sagan spun his compelling “We are star-stuff” myth for the viewers of <i>Cosmos</i>, for example, he was engaging in reflection rather than abstraction. Hs goal was not to communicate an abstract rule but to weave a narrative of meaning that provided a context within which human life can be lived.<br><br>The modern American educational system is by and large the last place on earth to try to pursue or communicate any such vision, whether undergirded by Saganism or some more traditional religion. Equally, though, as I’ve already pointed out, the modern American educational system is very poorly positioned indeed to deal with the impacts of peak oil, and the rest of the smorgasbord of crises the bad decisions of the last few decades have set out for us. The question that remains is what might replace it. What will come after the public schools is already taking shape, in the form of a lively and successful homeschooling movement that routinely turns out the sort of educated young people public schools once did; the replacement for what’s left of America’s once thriving trade schools is less well organized and defined as yet, but is emerging as craftspeople take on apprentices and people interested in a dizzying array of crafts form networks of mutual support. What we don’t yet have is a replacement for what the universities used to offer—some form of organized activity, however decentralized, informal, and inexpensive, that will see to the preservation and transmission of the intellectual heritage of our age.<br><br>What form such a thing might take is a challenging question, and one for which I don’t have any immediate answers. Still, it’s an issue that needs to be addressed. The pervasive spread of paranoiac conspiracy theories in contemporary American culture, which I mentioned toward the beginning of this post, is only one of several signs that too many people in this country have never learned how to doublecheck the validity of their own thinking, either against the principles of logic—a core element of the cultural heritage of abstraction—or against that attentiveness to circumstances and human motives that comes from “more human writings”—a core element of the cultural heritage of reflection. The people who chant “Drill, baby, drill,” as though it’s an incantation that will summon barrels of oil from thin air, are doing just as poor a job of reasoning about the world and reflecting on their motivations as the people who use the unprepossessing individuals teetering on the upper end of our political class as inkblots on which to project their need for scapegoats and their fantasies of absolute evil.<br><br>Working out the first rough sketch of a replacement for the American academic industry won’t stop the incantations or the scapegoating any time soon, and arguably won't stop it at all. Many other forces, as I suggested earlier, drive the contemporary flight from the muddled complexities of civil society into a comic-book world of supervillains whose alleged malignity is so clearly a product of the believer’s need to find someone to blame. Yet the tasks facing those of us who are trying to get ready for the unraveling of industrial America, and the comparable tasks our grandchildren and our grandchildren’s grandchildren will face, will demand plenty of clear, perceptive, well-informed thinking, guided both by abstraction’s useful generalizations and by reflection’s sharpened sensitivities. Doing something to salvage learning, while there’s still a chance to do so, is one potentially crucial way to help that happen.

I'm sure we still graduate our share of dolts and sheeple, but it seems to me that everyone at least has a chance to discover how to think and reason and learn. University educations are much more expensive than they used to be, making the return on investment for tuition much more challenging now. I have encouraged my son to pursue a trade (he wants to be an electrician, with a focus on alternative energy systems like solar and wind for rural homes like ours). He's not academically minded, though he is borderline gifted - he wants to be doing things with his hands, not reading more books and writing more papers, so a trade is perfect for him. If he were deeply interested in academic learning, though, we'd probably try to find a way to make it possible ... the future world will still need thinkers and writers and doctors and teachers, though he's far more likely to 'find his fortune' putting solar panels on cabin roofs than anything a university degree would prepare him for, so I'm quite relieved by his choice, to be honest.<br>I confess to being utterly baffled by American politics and all the shouting and noise. Canadians mostly ignore their politicians, it seems, and I couldn't even begin to guess who most of the people I know might have voted for in the last election. I do think that having a multi-party system helps with that - we actually have a spectrum of choices (well, in theory) and nobody expects that just because you believe in X this guarantees that you also believe in Y (as, oddly, seems to be the case with American politics). <br>I've no idea how one might go about repairing the political mess you've got down there ..

While I don't contest your observations about the failures of our educational system, I do wonder if there's not some generational bias reflected in your comments. Every generation seems to decry the thoroughgoing inadequacies of the next generation. It's perhaps worth noting that a large percentage of my grandfather's generation never made it to high school to receive the rather limited education offered to the class of 1918. Again, I'm not saying you're wrong, but maybe overstating the degree to which the education of the current generation of kids deviates from some sort of historical "norm" for this country. Which is pathetic.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c3415000405933795972 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 8:48 PM</a><br><br>

Many of my high school classmates got high-paying jobs as shop rats working on the line in Dearborn and Flint and River Rouge (just as their parents and grandparents had), and they did quite well with only high school diplomas. That was then...<br><br>It was enormously helpful that Detroit dominated the auto industry in the decades following World War II, as the industrial bases of Japan and Europe had been literally destroyed and had to be rebuilt. Of course, once the Japanese and Germans built modern factories they were able to eat our lunch beginning in the 1970s, and the Detroit I grew up in is now gone.<br><br>Now, programmers in Russia and call centers in India are eating our kids' lunches, and Doctors in the Philippines are reading X-rays from our local hospitals. <br><br>The more things change... Yes, we need job training to keep up with a changing world, but what we really need is to learn how to learn (and keep doing it for as long as we live), and how to think critically and objectively, which too many colleges are evidently not teaching any more (which may be why so many successful entrepreneurs dropped out). <br><br>I hated "lit crit" in my English classes in college; it was all just so much pretentious, pseudo-intellectual BS as far as I could tell. And don't even get me started about gender studies and all the rest of what passes for higher education these days. That's why I'm perfectly happy to let my son learn a practical trade like gunsmithing. He reads voraciously, and knows more about history than most of his teachers, and if he wants to learn something he goes to the library...<br><br>I think a case can be made that most, if not all, of the "reflective" knowledge that we can learn has been fairly well understood for centuries. The Bible (Old and New Testaments) and various other religious texts from other traditions contain a lot of wisdom (independent of all that God stuff). Virtually every modern novel and movie is merely a variation on a theme originally penned by Shakespeare hundreds of years ago.<br><br>All the people leaving high-tax states like Illinois and New York in order to move to low-tax states like Texas merely confirm what Aesop wrote about in the Fable of the Goose that laid the Golden Eggs: if the government squeezes too hard, those golden eggs just sort of go away. Aesop wrote his Fables about 2,400 years ago! <br><br>There's nothing new under the sun (now, where did I read that?).<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c8626480207401380346 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 8:57 PM</a><br><br>

Of course you'll find people of any ideology who spout nonsense. But we expect more from our leaders. That is, what fraction of GOP congressmen expressed doubts about Obama's citizenship vs. what fraction of Dem congressmen expressed concerns that Bush or Cheney planned 9/11? If you look at the record, it's not even close - the GOP has entertained conspiracies and vitriol at a level far beyond Dems.<br><br>Of course, maybe you'll see this comment as just another example of the problem (and you might not believe this, but I'm a registered independent and find both parties wanting).

Mostly it's been the study of human behavior, and the realization that the powerful classes likely follow similar behavior patterns as the rest of us, even if there's an over-representation of certain ambitious personality types, they're still human and follow human behavior patterns. When discussions of 9/11 are brought up now I just say that I don't know the truth of what happened on that day, and focusing on 9/11 isn't really going to do much to help our situation.<br><br>For myself, even back when I was more of a conspiracy theorist, part of me realized that many of them were unlikely, it's just that once you realize that society is going the wrong way, it was actually hopeful for me to believe that it was a small group of wicked evil people perpetuating the madness, and if we could just raise awareness of that fact and throw them out of power, the masses would choose a better choice. The reality is more depressing, that mass idiocy rules American culture. By self-reflection I have realized that I have a tendency to interpret malice from others in situations where stupidity is really to blame, because the level of stupidity is sometimes so unbelievable.<br><br>Although there are many different reasons for the popularity of conspiracy theories, I think the inability to come to terms with the mass stupidity around us is a reason that many intelligent people turn to demonization, and thus they project malice when it's really incompetence.

I have chaffed against the huge number of people I meet who can’t seem to reason enough to see the gaping flaws in much of the hate rhetoric. It makes me want to volunteer to teach a class in rational thinking! However, having had years of the humanities, and remembering the novels I’ve read, I wonder if there hasn’t always been a large contingent of humanity that lack this ability. Dickens’ novels have many such characters; Dostoyevsky’s novels also (just to mention two). Authors writing of their own time usually seem to describe people who live lives of unexamined reactions to Life. There’s just so many more people alive, and with access to media, it might seem like it’s gotten worse.<br><br><i>Over the last couple of decades, ordinary political discourse in America has been drowned out by a torrent of hatred and rage—there is really no other way to describe it—directed by people on nearly every part of the political spectrum against their perceived opponents.</i><br><br>What I’ve witnessed is that many have gotten so fed up with the perceived lack of ability of the “other side” to listen that they are raging; feeling so very unheard that they’ve “upped the volume”. Unfortunately, the time for the kind of lengthy discussions that allow the reasoning that would hash out the various gaps in logic and perhaps lead to more understanding is not available. I don’t know how many times I start a discussion at a gathering and quickly realize that there is <b>no way</b> that in 15 minutes I’d be able to present my perceptions of a topic, let alone work through a bunch of differing views! I do remember one wonderful question posed by a conflict resolution specialist that can often get to the heart quickly, “What – other than being agreed with – will make you believe you have been heard by them?” Most people can’t answer that question! They equate agreement with “being heard.” <br><br><i>Nowadays, a sizable fraction of those graduates are functionally illiterate. More than half of them have no real notion how their government works and what the rest of the world is like, and have never had more than a passing glimpse of the major works of art, literature, and music that define America’s cultural heritage.</i><br><br>I’ve been reading pioneer interviews, and it certainly sounds like a large portion of those students didn’t have any of that, either – so what timeframe are you referring to? Also, my recollection of the grammar and high school curricula in past decades was that the emphasis was on memorization, not reasoning – that was supposed to be taught in college. But I will totally agree that education today is totally insufficient to prepare students for our culture or their adult lives. <br><br><i>educational system is very poorly positioned indeed to deal with the impacts of peak oil, and the rest of the smorgasbord of crises the bad decisions of the last few decades have set out for us</i><br><br>That’s true of the system, but individual schools are doing some really cool things. There are more than 200 Green Schools in Oregon, that are teaching kids to garden and then cooking the food for school lunches and composting the scraps back into the garden. They are getting kids to be in charge of saving energy, recycling everything that can be recycled- but also learning to use sparingly in the first place. Some schools have water-gathering systems, solar panels, have cut their garbage in half, have cut their electricity use significantly. And it’s the kids who have to come up with the plan and follow through. I have to believe some of that gets carried home, and carried with them as they grow up.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c5407148765782735467 title="comment permalink">7/27/11, 9:43 PM</a><br><br>

No way to express their paranoia to thousands or even millions of others. They may have been thinking roughly the same things as today's clueless, but they did so in some degree of isolation.

But ending up doing a humanities course (it was the only course that would have me) probably allowed me to dodge a bullet, looking at it retrospectively. Friends who studied more 'hard nosed' courses are mostly now being slowly crushed by their mortgage burdens and fretting over the security of their jobs. <br><br>I was the first person in our family to attend university and my parents were proud of that fact. Nevertheless, I'll probably be the last, as I won't be encouraging my two daughters to attend unless it's for something practical that won't end up with them sitting on a mountain of debt and wisfully looking out of an office window wishing they had followed their interests rather than the dictates of short-sighted careers advisors.<br><br>Being myself somewhat autodidactic in nature I have never got on very well with taught courses. Perhaps that's the difference between self-learning and being taught. For me at least, having the freedom to toss an idea around in my mind while I go for a walk ends up with a far deeper understanding than I would probably have gained from being told the same thing in a lecture. There is also intuitive knowledge, of course, but this isn't often useful for the industrial system we find ourselves in and there is no section for it on the average CV.<br><br>As for news media, well I just shake my head.

Not all conspiracies are figments of over-heated imagination. Perhaps you could have a private think about lumping in the question of who really did 9/11, and -- geopolitikally-speaking -- why, with the space lizards, and the Illuminatibergers' world-domination conspiracy.<br><br>There's an ocean of dreck, and deliberate black disinformation around the matter of 11 September 01, by now. And Mike Ruppert is probably right when he says that the window of opportunity to do anything effective and relevant about nailing the truth and the true perpetrators, and the question of why, has now closed conclusively.<br><br>But still, it jars me to see a thinker as unusually self-disciplined and perspicacious as you casually -- and may I say mistakenly -- lumping that real, made-in-America conspiracy in with the delusional ones.<br><br>Can I just offer that there are now some reliably high-quality places that you can visit, to see where a decade of courageous and high-principled volunteer effort has got in uncovering the truth which the official agencies charged with such responsibilities have so conspicuously failed to do -- or perhaps have evaded doing -- on the matter of 9/11. I can recommend Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth -- of which I'm a member -- as one such reliable place. I see what a workload you've given yourself.

I reckon you are on the money. It's a game that's not going according to the traditional model established after WWII.<br><br>As to this weeks comment, I am a great believer in formal education, although I am biased on this subject holding both a university degree and post graduate qualification.<br><br>On reflection though, I would say that the education delivered to individuals is a reflection of societies aspirations and demands.<br><br>Interestingly enough before the early 1970's in Australia it was only the wealthy who could attend university - in both time and fees. University here is not like college over in the US as few people live on campus - campus is a place for learning.<br><br>In a spate of generosity, university education was provided free of charge between 1973 and 1988. After 1989 though, student loans were provided at very good rates by the government and are paid off through the taxation system. If you don't earn any income, you don't have to pay off the loan (it doesn't go away though). The only student loans making it into the six figure category would be medicine.<br><br>I gave a bit of history so that you can understand the differences in our cultures. Australia is a small country, so University here has always been vocationally based. It has never pretended to be otherwise. Research has generally been undertaken by government bodies such as the CSIRO - Universities are small time players.<br><br>Now having said all this, I work in a profession that requires both a degree and a post graduate in order to get an operating licence. I've spoken in the past about professional capture and here is a great example:<br><br>Also getting back to education as a reflection of societies demands and aspirations, older people in my profession entered the profession through an apprenticeship. To join the professional body, they paid a $50 membership fee. This was a very different experience to myself who sometimes has a mental image of myself as a rat in a tread mill and no matter how fast you spin the wheel, you're still in the same place. By the way the older professionals are still more than my equal.<br><br>On the other hand pursuing the education (which acts as a barrier to entry) also teaches you how to learn, how to reason, how to apply that learning (and reason) and also how to finish tasks. These are important life skills which seem to me to be in short supply.<br><br>You can see that the skills are in short supply because the community discourse has descended into catchy sound bites and messages of blame and hate. Emotions win over reason every time.<br><br>I don't worry about such things though because as the available energy reduces, the ability to spread these types of messages is reduced. Also people will start to have to worry about their day to day needs instead and if we survive, we'll all end up reverting back into the peasants that we actually are.<br><br>Regards.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c6609355176638208561 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 1:48 AM</a><br><br>

Back in ‘95, my then caring employer pressganged my whole department onto an Open University accounts course. I scraped the exam, but from that shaky foundation, went on to complete a Management Diploma. Part time distance learning, thankfully at little personal cost. And being only halfway to an MBA meant I wasn’t fully assimilated into the then fashionable mantras about ‘what gets measured gets managed’. <br><br>Still, the course was quite useful in replacing a general sense of unease into specific concerns about my own toxic corporate cubicle dweller environment. As another poster recently observed here, the Dilbert cartoons are based on solid (mis)management realities - and these strips even occasionally turned up in the course material. The best part of that course for me was motivational studies and people management, which prompted me to examine some of the literature on happiness and positive psychology. And the diploma probably got me a promotion a couple of years later, so It’s All Good, as some of you still claim over there. <br> <br>My separate concerns about dependencies, from my disaster planner insights, led me to instantly ‘get’ the Peak Oil argument back in 2006. So, recently freed of my corporate shackles, I decided to go back to the Open University this year, to complete a course in Sustainable Energy. This time, I’m doing it for myself - I study nuclear science, I love my classes..! Trouble is the course material is ten years old, and in the ever changing energy scene, that’s a long time. Still, we can easily quote current sources, and it’s been good so far – for example, my essays have referenced Nicole Foss’ superb paper on the collapse of Eastern European Nuclear industry, and the OilDrum is always a useful source. At one point, my assignment deadline loomed large, but I was able to quickly write 1200 coherent words about the pros and cons of biofuels without referring to the textbooks, and still got good marks. That’s what an informal internet education can do for you. <br> <br>Last week, the Open University announced they are about to dramatically increase course fees, owing to Government subsidy cuts being applied to all English Universities. My current course was around $1000, but for those not enrolling soon or continuing their education, that’s likely to be $4000. Ouch. Though, being currently enrolled, I do still have the option of carrying on a while to complete a bargain Degree. But that’s only going to be worthwhile if I can identify courses which are relevant to my future needs, as it’s really only a piece of paper now. <br> <br>If I don’t pursue the degree, I’ll very happily settle for your excellent writings as part of my ongoing informal education, if I may. Along with Dmitry Orlov, Sharon Astyk, the Oil Drum et al. Though Jim Kunstler’s polemics - (...“deliberate malevolence of some group of people or other” ...? “insistence that somebody or other is wrecking the world out of pure personal wickedness” ..?) only count as entertainment. <br> <br>Cheers<br><br>Mustard<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c8785576339811464722 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 2:51 AM</a><br><br>

The Peak Oil community is filled with angry, contentious and die-hard rationalist scientists that will jeer at you whenever you dare come up with anything (mostly philosophical or mystical arguments) that does not supervene upon their pragmatical world view where science is believed to explain everything.<br>In their own way, they are reproducing with a vengeance the paradigm they are fighting against, and it is really saddening to observe how subservient they actually are to the laws of the system.<br><br>The AR, on the other hand, is deeply rooted in history, philosophy and classical critique, which makes it so much above everything else written on the subject. Once you are aware of the problem of Peal Oil and deindustrialization, I fail to see the point of endlessly attempting to find more proofs that will support your worldview, just so that you can discuss lengthily (while always repeating yourself) how the world is going to the dogs, how we are all doomed, and above all, how horrible the human species is.<br><br>For being able to eschew this particular pitfall, you have my thanks.<br><br>As far as I am concerned, I am currently in college, in a double major in Liberal Arts, and I am completely aware that this will probably never land me a good high profile job. Still, since in the country where I live education is affordable and does not require for me to take a loan, I am doing it, if only for my own pleasure. I believe it is worth doing so, peak oil or not, change of paradigm or not, job or not. The knowledge I thus gain and the acquaintance I thus make are paying me back for my time with interest.<br><br>On a side note, have you read Jean Baudrillard?

A bit like banning Larry Niven now. ^_^ (Or Spielberg and Cameron.) Anyway Plato left the doorway open for poetry to justify itself -- it would have been strange if he hadn't, considering his own artistic gifts. What he meant was it had to take account of reality, in modern terms mundane sf for example. Forget the dream we know it all.<br><br>A question: if downslopes continue to value abstraction methods, would the ability to keep the 'humanities' in mind on the <i>upslope</i> not constitute one way of remaining in touch with reality -- seeing as how upslopes in the West normally seem to end up unsupported out in the middle of empty air, just like the abstractionist theories do?<br><br>It seems to me that Spengler would be a good example there, and since you mention Vico, so would anything perhaps that tried to see a pattern to events. I saw a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Matter-Heart-Extraordinary-Journey-C-G/dp/B00028G6LC/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311855639&amp;sr=1-1" rel=nofollow>DVD</a> last night of Carl Jung memorably saying exactly what you are here -- and adding that the abstractionism removes vital context and understanding which anyone needs to ground him- or herself. As soon as someone says 'wait, I see a bigger pattern here' during a boomtime, it is as if they are ruining everyone's party, because on the upslope people seem to need to believe they are making the pattern rather than being made by it.

The second is not too terribly interested in the traditional academic path, and wants to focus on agriculture or aquaculture or something similar (hurrah!). The third is younger but is showing an interest in alternative healing (promising). So we’ll see; but avoiding debt and maximizing practical skills is uppermost in our minds at the moment. <br><br>The local school system basically seems to be a college-resume stuffing operation, with a lot of focus on things that supposedly look good on paper but which don’t actually have much substance behind them. Another version of “let’s pretend”. The resulting kids are incredibly confident and full of self-esteem though; they’re going to be great at playing by the old rules, but I don’t think they will do so well improvising through all of the messes and break-downs they are going to face.

The phrase itself has become a tool for demonizing people and ideas, and for shutting down thought and discussion of ideas that are unacceptable for one reason or another. I've seen it lead people into positions so extreme as to state that people do not conspire, when in fact it's a very common human behavior – to recognize that is not to say you believe in space lizards.<br><br>I liked the theme of the tension between abstraction and reflection. I'm the son of an electrical engineering professor and an English teacher and artist. Dad is a theoretical guy into complex math, but I became a nuts-and-bolts circuit designer. However, I work naturally using an intuitive approach, and for a long time I tried to suppress this – it seemed out of place in an engineering environment and I thought it a liability. But as I grew older I came to recognize that there were advantages to combining intuition with analysis, and now I am comfortable with it.<br><br>So it is with abstraction and reflection. In recent years my interests have moved markedly toward topics considered to be humanities, and it has greatly enhanced my understanding of the world and what is happening. Some people focus on technical analysis of peak oil and rates of depletion, etc. I find this interesting and useful for determining where we stand, but I have become more interested in what the effects of these things will be upon humans and societies. Conversely I read articles from people who are very knowledgeable about politics and see what is happening in the world from that viewpoint exclusively. Their analysis ends up flawed because they don't see the energy and physical resource limitations that drive the effects they sense. As always, it seems to me that a position on the extreme of either abstraction or reflection gives a distorted view of the world, but it is in the balance of the two that one can find understanding.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c3807799589618902333 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 5:49 AM</a><br><br>

In John Taylor Gatto’s” The Underground History of American Education” he traces the problems back at least another one hundred years. Here’s a few sample quotes:<br><br>“In New England and the Atlantic Colonies, where reading was especially valued, literacy was universal. The printed word was also valued in the South, where literacy was common, if not universal. In fact, it was general literacy among all classes that spurred the explosive growth of colleges in nineteenth century America, where even ordinary folks hungered for advanced forms of learning.”Page 31<br><br>“Looking back, abundant data exists from states like Connecticut and Massachusetts to show that by 1840 the incidence of complex literacy in the United States was between 93 and 100 percent wherever such things mattered. According to the Connecticut census of 1840, only one citizen out of every 579 was illiterate and you probably don’t want to know, not really, what people in those days considered literate; it’s too embarrassing.”Page 52<br><br>Actually, things have been going steadily downhill since Horace Mann took a trip to Prussian and came back to promote the idea of copying their system here in America , starting with compulsory schooling laws.<br><br>Education is a subject close to my heart. I went back to school in my mid-forties, when the US Department of Education was running TV ads to encourage more people to go into teaching due to anticipated teacher shortages in the mid-1990’s, to become “certified” as a teacher. After many interviews and no contract offers my brother-in-law, a school principal, told me the reason I wasn’t being offered a contract was because I had too many undergraduate credits (essentially two degrees in Biology and Geology) and they would have had to pay me more than someone fresh out of college with only 120credits.<br><br>Our educational system has been messed up for some time. The current system with its consolidated school districts, huge schools and reliance on the yellow bus to get kids there is physically unsustainable in an era of declining energy resources. Yet when the topic of education comes up, that simple fact is ignored. Usually when the topic of education does come up in everyday conversations it almost always mutates into a discussion about teachers and how much their paid. Any thought for the children quickly gets lost. <br><br>I am an active member of the Green Party and even their plank on education is basically indistinguishable from that of the Democrats. So I would very much appreciate somewhere down the line having you and your readers expand on what education should look like in the era of Salvage Industrialism and beyond.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c8514567073525412329 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 6:48 AM</a><br><br>

While an undergraduate at a liberal arts college (as a computer science/geography double major), I was very much supportive of the idea of liberal arts education and broadening the mind. I went on to graduate school to get both MA and PhD degrees in geography (not computer science) in part because of this ideal. <br><br>While teaching at a similar private liberal arts college in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during a time when I first began to grasp climate change (and the first inklings of peak oil, although at the time I didn't know it), my viewpoint began to shift toward the idea of more professional preparation that students should receive. The idea of needing more crafts people and people with more than book smarts only.<br><br>Working today as a registrar at a graduate school seminary, and therefore dealing with post-undergraduate students only, I've come to be even more in support of the idea of higher education being oriented primarily toward professional development of practitioners. With the economy as it is, and student-loan debt being the noose that it is and definitely will be, I believe people who do go on to post-secondary education need to make the most of that time and money. Currently to me that means practical training as making the most sense. Part of this notion I have goes all the way back to graduate school, when I began to see how esoteric much of the research that I saw going on around me seemed to be. Interesting stuff when you have the time to waste, but generally seemingly useless knowledge. And every now and then, when I think about rejoining the national academic geography society I used to belong to, I look at the indexes to their journals, and you know, nothing seems to have changed, and in fact the research for the most part seems even more esoteric and useless. I can certainly see your point about higher education being an economy of its own that needs to keep propping itself up. A lot of colleges and universities are going to be hurting when students can no longer afford to go to school.<br><br>But I am probably all wet and thinking too short term.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c311686591522342354 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 7:10 AM</a><br><br>

Trying to sort out how the education system in the US has arrived at this point always spawns one of those small back-of-the-head-aches which begs to be free to wreck the critical thinking required to even begin to understand this chicken or egg problem. Is our educational system a reflection of the overall hyper-complex system of which it is a part, or is our overall system, such as it is, a reflection of the devolution of our educational system? Scrambled eggs for breakfast this morning :-/<br><br>My stepdad was an English teacher, highschool principle, at one point acting superintendent of a major southern city school system (during the early days of racial integration, no less), eventually becoming Dean of Educational Administration, Educational Law and School Accredidation at a major southern university. Masters in English and Phylosophy; PhD, English Lit., Columbia. He also worked with the Governments of Haiti, The Dominican Republic, and Mexico, trying to help improve their educational systems. His life's work was to try and teach educators how to educate, and to create systems that permitted this. His primary obstacles were politics, complexity, and unrealistic expectations.<br><br>My mother was deeply into the mess that was early Special Education, learning how to teach the unteachable and educate those who the education system had given up on. A pioneer of Special Ed in the same large southern city's educational system, she eventually was able to transform the program in only one small primary school, going one-on-one with challenged kids. She was likely more successful at increasing the level of critical thinking in her students than the old man was in his. Her quiet techniques, repetition and patience became a model for special ed elseware.<br><br>My roles in this adventure in education varied quite a bit. My mother was constantly trying out this or that new test on me before integrating them (or not) into her program: setting a baseline, she said. I wasn't quite sure how to take that...<br><br>The old man paid me a few dollars each to pre/proofread theses and dissertations for his candidates. It was revealing how many errors I could find (I wish I knew now what I knew then. Use it or lose it, it seems.) While the constant stream of thought regarding many aspects of education was facinating (and enlightening), I thank my stars that my real dad was a natural born, and eventually trained, engineer. In no way was I going into the family business of education as several of my older sisters did.<br><br>The conclusion that both of my educator parents eventually came to was that education in this country was/is in deep trouble, and that the catchphrase "dumbing down" was itself a gross oversimplification. Standardization, 'mainstreaming', goals orientation, faux diversification, one-size-fits-all testing, mandates such as "No Child Left Behind", funding and competition, all had become the enemies of the process of actually producing adults capable of critical thinking.<br><br>The same school system in which my folks both worked, during much of their careers, is now embroiled in a scandal of changing kids' test scores to make them smarter.

Or I would throw out ideas until somebody with more knowledge in the area said "Hey, that might work." My superiors hated it because I (with no degree) came up with solutions far faster than they (some of them with multiple master's degrees) did.

You write well and are, if nothing else, provocative. It’s a refreshing blog.<br><br>I was a member of the university/college system for nearly all but the last 6 years of my life, going to college, graduate school, and then teaching for 30+ years in it. I think it was in my fist year of teaching, at the tail-end of the Vietnam era, when I was talking about human capital and a student stood up and declared “I am not a resource!” It rather took me aback, but years later I applauded him vigorously. Over the years I have seen the system swing ever steadily in the direction of job training while the “liberal arts” were continually deprived of resources. At my midwestern, mid-level university, natural resources and business were the two favored programs. (By the way, I taught economics.) <br><br>I can’t tell you how many times, when advising students, they would respond to my suggestions about possible course choices by asking “Will this help me get a job?” Now these were largely first-generation students coming from lower-middle class to lower-class backgrounds whose parents saw college solely as a source of job training. And we certainly had many contentious discussions among the faculty about the value of the liberal arts vs. job training. As far as many of my colleagues were concerned, they were just trade school instructors, albeit at a higher intellectual level.<br><br>Unfortunately, academics are fully as prone to fads as any group of teen-agers (read: political correctness fad over the years and academic excellence fads). And of course administrators are ever and always seeking to expand, and always to prevent the contraction of, their units. I’ve seen for decades the value of both abstraction (I’m an economist, after all) and reflection, the specific knowledge of time and place, as in farming and gardening (I have a large garden that I lovingly, sometimes scathingly, attend). But a balanced appreciation doesn’t seem to be the rule in academe: they swing from one end to the other and never should the pendulum sit in the balanced middle. And that phrasing, I know, reflects my abstract mode of thinking about the world, of wishing that we could all come together and reason our way to a win-win solution. Sort of like in Washington, D.C. right now. Hah!<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c238290396386010591 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 8:38 AM</a><br><br>

By insisting on the establishment of a national debt ceiling, they are prying open the lid of Pandora's Box and hastening the demise of the very system they so fervently worship.<br><br>When that demise occurs, all those young University graduates will be left holding a very empty bag. The imagined future for which they have so arduously and expensively prepared will vanish before their eyes.<br><br>I hope they will have the time to recover from their shock and disappointment and acquire the real skills and attitudes that they will actually need.<br><br>My own experience in attempting to develop new practical skills in the face of rapid change is that the learning takes a long time and really can't be hurried. There is no iPhone 'app', Farmville icon or on-line video game magic that will substitute for putting in the years and learning from success and failure. <br><br>We need a new type of university to start the next generation on the path of learning practical skills balanced by the traditional humanities. A 'reflective' kind of institution, you might say. I suppose this cannot happen until we come to the collective admission that the old ways just don't work anymore. It also cannot happen if it costs the current equivalent of $53,000 per year to attend.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c6206919010397258014 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 10:14 AM</a><br><br>

Classes have been getting bigger, fees have been going up, and the staff to student ratio has been going down, leaving less time for teaching or evaluating critical thinking.<br><br>In South Africa and the UK, I don't think it's quite as bad yet, but in North America higher education is definitely regarded as a commodity, and universities are run as businesses. In my experience students here often come very close to having an attitude of "I'm paying good money for this degree, how dare you not give me an A for my paper?" and even good universities can feel like giant paper mills -- insert students and money in one end, get graduates and degrees out the other. What I found most disturbing was when the course coordinator for a second year level course I was TAing explained to me that, even in the most clear cut cases of plagiarism on the term paper, the most they would do would be to give the students an F. They were too scared of rich parents suing them to take the offenders through the university's official disciplinary process.<br><br>And I think some of the problem is that people do see degrees as being a gateway to better jobs, at many levels -- individual, policy maker, and, more importantly, employer. This isn't helped by a society in which entry level working class jobs pay less and less relative to the cost of living. And as undergraduate degrees become more watered down, the solution becomes more study. I'm not sure where it will end up, but this kind of positive feedback loop cannot end well.<br><br>It's also incredibly frustrating for those few of us getting degrees for the love of learning new things rather than for their value as a piece of paper.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c5560744630525936284 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 10:38 AM</a><br><br>

It seems that the American education system struggles under at least one misapprehension: the idea that a diploma is a talisman that guarantees that our next generation will be competent, educated citizens who will prosper economically. We therefore seek to maximize the number of diploma holders.<br><br>In this pursuit, we've relaxed academic standards (while simultaneously making them impersonal and inflexible) and taken on the Herculean (but worthwhile) task of educating everyone. Consequently, by flooding the job markets with diploma holders, we've made it simultaneously difficult to earn a good living without a diploma and difficult to difficult to earn a good living <em>with</em> one. In other words, if nearly everyone has a diploma, it becomes economically meaningless.<br><br>A diploma might still be meaningful if we hadn't watered down the education that it represents. It might still be the signal of better prepared citizen. Increasingly, it isn't.<br><br>To end on a more practical note, I've heard the rule of thumb that you shouldn't borrow more for your college degree than what you expect your starting salary to be right out of college. (Of course, given the current job market, it makes you wonder what that salary would be. Minimum wage?) For undergraduate degrees, which college you attend doesn't seem to make much practical difference in your future earning power, so a prospective student should shop around for a school that charges a fair price for the degree they want.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c2989800929349516141 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 12:35 PM</a><br><br>

The resulting doublebinds are driving the country stark staring nuts. I'd encourage Canada either to stay out of the empire business, or admit up front that you're in it for the usual reasons, and avoid the cant and hypocrisy that makes a straightforward discussion of how much America profits from its hegemony unthinkable down here. <br><br>Bashmu, since they depend on the survival of the internet, a hypercomplex and resource-intensive technology of the sort that's going away in the not too distant future, my take is that your proposals are actually heading in the wrong direction. Sorry. <br><br>Walker, one of the things that's harmed American education is the idea that everybody should get a diploma and go on to college. I've known a number of working class people whose education ended at eighth grade; they had a functional education, better than high school graduates have today, but nobody pretended that they were going to become intellectuals. It seemed to work. <br><br>Susan, that's an excellent point. Reflective knowledge doesn't "progress," as abstractive knowledge does -- or at least can. I think it's the attempt to make reflective knowledge fit into the abstractive model that produces a great deal of the pseudointellectual nonsense that fills so much space in universities today. <br><br>Zach, nice!

I've seen no evidence to suggest that the demonization of the other side I discussed is any less prevalent on the left than on the right. <br><br>Ozark, thank you.

So I can provide a fairly accurate "view from the trenches".<br><br>I can testify to some of what you have written. More than one dean has told me, after admitting that I rate highly with the students as a challenging professor, "Your idealism is admirable, but it's out of date. The modern university must be a business first to survive. When you focus so much on teaching your students, you aren't focusing on the fiscal priorities of the university." Giving an 'F' to a student who turned in only half the assignments is frowned upon because it might interfere with the retention of paying students for as long as possible. <br><br>However, while much of what you have written is quite valid, your comments about conspiracy theorists makes all too available an easy label to affix to anyone who disputes some of what you had written.<br><br>You wrote that there are two competing visions of education, and I can tell you from 25 years experience in academe that you are mistaken. There are three competing visions of education today: Abstraction, Reflection, and Indoctrination.<br><br>Before you label me as another one of those conspiracy nuts, take a look at the history of the notion of "loco parentis" and the writings of Dewey.<br><br>You've defined Abstraction and Reflection fairly well, so allow me to define Indoctrination as it would relate to the other two visions. Indoctrination is the view that holds that what matters is obedience -- to government, to tradition, to current norms -- and that both abstract investigation and reflective consideration are absurd, impertinent wastes of time.<br><br>Much of the difficulties in modern public schooling and higher education come from rival groups trying to utilize education for their own personal Indoctrination purposes.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c5857699855864153950 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 1:12 PM</a><br><br>

Not a good sign, methinks. <br><br>If I understand you rightly, it seems that reflective knowledge would tend to make a bigger place for the arts than the knowledge of axiomatic abstractions. For the latter has made all else subservient, and implicitly inferior, to itself, at least in its modern scientistic manifestation. <br><br>I wonder how reflective knowledge squares with the foundational philosophy of Leonardo's approach to investigating phenomena, which he consistently refers to in his notebooks as "la sperienza" - experience. Many might take this to mean something like "experiment," in the scientific sense, but I'm not sure he was operating in quite that way.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c7845049113485155810 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 1:32 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, of course, the government depends on continued borrowing, just as virtually every farmer does, and most businesses do, and as most families do with car payments, mortgages, etc.<br><br>HOWEVER, at some point we (the farmers, businesses, and families) pay back those loans, or at least pay them down enough to be able to qualify for future loans at interest rates that we can afford. I suppose if I could print my own money I'd have a different attitude...<br><br>The reason the credit rating agencies are threatening to downgrade our credit rating is not because we cannot agree on raising our debt ceiling; everyone assumes (at least so far) that we will eventually come to an agreement and raise the ceiling. They are threatening a downgrade because even if we do raise the debt ceiling we'll simply be another couple trillion dollars in debt with no end in sight. What the market really wants is for us to demonstrate that we can live within our means, even if it takes years to get there. <br><br>After much debate, my husband and I finally came to an agreement to raise our family debt ceiling.

Many subjects can't be just picked up, but require experts to guide the students, a place to do the learning in, and time to learn what needs to be learned. (Of course this does not really describe large portions of the university system.)<br><br>Just today I found out that I will likely receive a small stipend next academic year to conduct workshops for other faculty members. <br><br>The workshops are to be about greening the curriculum--taking full account of peak oil, climate change, etc., and challenging participants to change their curricula to reflect these realities, so as to help our students be able to adapt to our descending future. Of course the sponsoring college consortium calls it "our sustainable future" and says we're preparing our students for green jobs--but the people involved are very clear-eyed about what we face.

This is particularly the case in its most complex area, the corporate sector, especially finance. The demand for more highly educated "administrators" has had a large part in driving higher education expansion, as well as emphasising job training over the humanities, e.g. MBAs instead of the Classics. We are now probably witnessing the diminishing returns on the hyper complexity constructed to keep the corporate sector upright, and can expect to see higher education contract to the point where what it provides is useful to society again. P.S. most British Colonial administrators had a good grounding in the Classics with there reflective values, much more useful than abstractive ones when dealing with strange new societies!<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c454386090924146402 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 5:12 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks for articulating what I've come to believe from my own studies- that abstraction has replaced any real understanding of how nature works and how we can work in concert with it. <br><br>Dr. Temple Grandin discusses this as well in her books "Animals in Translation-Using the Mysteries of Autism to decode Animal Behavior" and "Animals Make Us Human" (which BTW contain a lot of great information on training techniques for animals for those who are interested.) Grandin refers to this process as 'abstractification', where us regular folks get so caught up in words that we lose the ability to observe. She discusses her astonishment when she gives her students an assignment to complete where they have to figure out how to catch a 10 foot daddy longlegs and bring it back to a lab using ONLY equipment that exists in the real world. Through an exercise like this she ends up having to teach them what kinds of information they would need to know before even arriving at a possible answer. She has to basically spoonfeed them the right QUESTIONS.<br><br> She seems to have an ability to think in pictures unlike those of us with a 'voice in our head', and is actually able to detect real world flaws in just about any piece of equipment (or system) before it's EVEN BUILT. Her impressive accomplishments as a result of these processes bear this out.<br><br>As someone who works with infants and toddlers with a myriad of disabilities that include autism, I've come to wonder if Nature, by producing more autistic people than ever who seem to have difficulty living in the world as WE'VE made it, has created an evolutionary response to our own over-abstracitification?

As for schools being ready for peak oil, it's good that they're teaching gardening, but so many other aspects of the system are unsustainable that that's kind of a drop in the bucket. <br><br>Les, thank you, but it doesn't take that much time to moderate, and I prefer to keep things in my own hands. <br><br>Kate, exactly. You get a gold star. <br><br>Joe, excellent! Yes, I'm very familiar with the trivium; the kind of occult education I got involved quite a bit of study of the quadrivium, and that led me to look into the whole structure of medieval learning -- which has much to recommend it. <br><br>The trivium is actually as relevant to reflective as to abstractive learning, though; remember that the standard way to learn grammar was through close study of classic literary texts such as the Aeneid, and rhetoric is a core element of reflective education, as it focuses on specific situations and contexts, and on addressing the whole person rather than sticking to the realm of formal logic.

Most of the quarries that made the place exist closed up decades ago.<br><br>Education is the servant of many masters, the soup with too many cooks. It is no wonder that it is a mess today. On one hand, universal education gets children and young adults out of the workforce, so that they won't seriously compete with adult populations. On another hand, education is supposed to prepare our young people for citizenship in our republic. Then there are fools like me who actually try to teach something now and again. I'm not even going to try to sort out the political push-me-pull-you and its effects in the classroom.<br><br>Human beings are inherently lazy. We do not want to work any harder than we think we must (to get what we WANT.) Perhaps it is wisdom: conservation of energy? So how do we teach those that have no desire to learn? (Teenagers already know everything important, no?)<br><br>My father has often talked about tricking students into learning. (He was also a public high school teacher, now retired.) Make students think that they're being entertained, and they'll be surprised how much they learn. This may have been my father's trick, or perhaps his ideal, but it never quite clicked for me.<br><br>I believe that the most valuable thing that a human being can learn is how to teach one's self. Few of us, however, are natural autodidacts. I try to construct my classroom in such a way that I create opportunities for my students to teach themselves. Activities that are not too easy and invite a mental checking-out, but yet are not so difficult that cheating becomes rampant. (Once again, human beings will only work as hard as they think they must. If actually completing the assignment is marginally easier than cheating, most won't cheat. If cheating becomes much easier than actually working on the assignment... oh well, we all fail again.)<br><br>There is one thing, however, that can make a human being work when one needn't, and that is passion. I have a passion for myth and story and fantastical tale telling. Passion is like fire, a fire in the belly. This fire can kindle other fires; some fires start spontaneously. There are also fires of art in the hands, heart, and head to fuel acts of creativity. This is my wild card as an educator. <br><br>With my carefully crafted classroom activities, I try to reach every student. I try to provide them the opportunity to learn, to hear what I have to say, to read what men and women have written, and to teach themselves. With my storytelling and love for literature, I hope to reach some students, to kindle a fire in them for whatever their driving passion will be. <br><br>The public high school can be a soul-crushing place. It can also be a forge of character and aspiration. I am only a little cog in the machine, but I am a cog with direct contact with the product. I hope that the product that I have had contact with is a bit more self-reliant than before, maybe even due to my influence. I am not self-delusional. I won't make a huge difference in the life of every student, but I might make a small and good difference in some lives and hopefully make one or two lives markedly better in the course of my career... just be being myself and trying to spark or feed some fires.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c2765879522299327153 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 7:01 PM</a><br><br>

I'll have to move him up a few notches. <br><br>Jhughston, that's a tall order. Much of what I've discussed here comes out of a flurry of scholary works from some years back on the writings of Giambattista Vico -- you might check out Ernesto Grassi's <i>Rhetoric as Philosophy: The Humanist Tradition</i> for starters -- and from the metaphysical chapter at the beginning of volume 2 of Spengler's <i>The Decline of the West</i>.

"Laws of nature" is a metaphor -- did somebody pass those laws? Who are the police that enforce them? All the things we call "laws of nature" are simply mental models we come up with to more or less predict what nature will do most of the time -- nothing more than that. <br><br>Raven, I'm quite sure we're ten to fifty years from another civil war here.

That doesn't justify the paranoiac fixation of so many people these days on claims that their political opponents are busy with some monstrously evil plot to enslave humanity, or what have you. Real conspiracies, like real secret societies, are strategies born of weakness rather than strength; you conspire when you can't simply act, or think you can't. <br><br>Planner, the terms are my own, though the concepts are based on quite a range of earlier analyses -- the scholarship on Vico I mentioned earlier is a good place to start. <br><br>Houyhnhnm, er, if I said that I was going to discuss the petroleum industry would you expect me to post something about vegetable oil? No, the education industry is the industry that claims to produce and sell education -- that is to say, the colleges and universities. Television isn't something I'm qualified to talk about, as I haven't watched it in my adult life, and don't propose to start now. <br><br>Don, that's sad. I hope you won't be contributing to the alumni fund drive, and will send a letter explaining why. <br><br>Hawlkeye, where did you go to college? It sounds remarkably like where I did my first three years, Fairhaven College, in Bellingham, WA. <br><br>Bruce, granted, the current mess has been a long time coming.

I know that what's happened to higher education is as much a function of demand from students as anything; in a contracting economy -- and we've had one of those since the Seventies, if you leave out the top 20% -- the pressure to find a way to earn a good living is a massive force.

I tend to be good at many fields and skills and can make connections between seemingly unrelated things, but I have trouble focusing solely on a narrow specialized field without my mind wandering off. Sometimes that wandering off (also called daydreaming) can be a great creative source and not something that is good to always tame the way the educational system often does. I actually think daydreaming is something that our education should value and channel. So much of creative work originates from having idle time and permission to daydream. <br><br>When I went to college, I considered majoring in about twenty different subjects before I decided to study anthropology. Anthropology seemed to be more interdisciplinary, being both a science and in the humanities, and it made me look at my own life from many other angles I hadn’t before. Plus, I had lots of space in my schedule to take many classes in other departments, so every semester, I pretty much looked through the course catalog and picked the most interesting classes—perfect for my generalist self. Still, by the time I graduated, I saw how even a field like anthropology was becoming so highly specialized just like any other field, and while I really appreciated the generalized knowledge I gained through my undergraduate work, I could not see myself going on to graduate school in it, despite my professors’ telling me that I should continue on.<br><br>I remember sitting during my college graduation ceremony skimming through the titles of all the theses of those getting their Masters or Phd’s. The research topic for every thesis was so obscure and specialized, regardless of the field. I could not imagine myself going on in graduate school and spending several years focusing in such a narrow area. I’m not saying that any specialist knowledge isn’t worth pursuing by some people, but I think the healthy balance between specialist vs. generalist studies is way off.<br><br>The scientists, artists, thinkers and others I really admire the most are generalists (I consider you to fall in this category). They have knowledge in lots of fields and are able to synthesize things in creative ways. And oftentimes and not surprisingly, significant periods of their work and study happened outside the academic world. I don’t know how to seriously reverse the trend in academia of increasing specialization except let it collapse on its on weight. (I recently finished Joseph Tainter’s Collapse of Complex Societies and specifically have been reflecting on how his ideas related to the educational industry.)<br><br>I am at heart a generalist—I like to be knowledgeable about many fields, I like having both artistic and scientific skills, to be engaged in both intellectual work and manual work. Sometimes I tell myself I should finally focus on some one career path to the exclusion of all else, but I know that isn’t me. And I’ve come to think that having multiple skills and not being stuck in just one career track makes me more resilient in a post-peak world.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c8250773337185695667 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 8:44 PM</a><br><br>

As others have already noted in the comment thread, the practice of many fields requires the use of both. An engineer works with the abstraction of Newtonian mechanics, but the design of a bridge requires deep thought, imagination and intuition. Likewise, a scientist has to pause for reflection to work out how the results of an experiment fit into the existing abstractions, and how they could best test the hypotheses their reflection produces. Even in the humanities, most reflective of all disciplines, frameworks to abstract everything from literature to history to the human mind abound.<br><br>I have other reservations, but I think I'll keep them for next week when you've developed the idea more clearly.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c6276393190389302356 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 10:15 PM</a><br><br>

Other people obsess about conspiracies, and build their universes around them. The two things don't have much to do with one another. <br><br>Tully, that's a fascinating retrospective. <br><br>RPC, actually, that works for me. Certainly some people have become just as obsessive about evil Muslim terrorists as others have become about evil Republican neocons!<br><br>Bill, that's a good point. It's by no means certain that a reflective education would lead people to question their habit of investing their sense of self-worth in how much cheap consumer garbage they own, but it's worth a try. <br><br>Jonathan, it's a good rule of thumb, but it's impossible to get even an undergraduate education for the amount of money any entry level job will pay for the first year, so it's a bit difficult to put into practice. <br><br>Wizard, my only disagreement with your claim is that I don't consider indoctrination to be a form of education. In most senses, it's the opposite of education, just as it results in the opposite of thought. <br><br>Kevin, good! Leonardo was in fact a very good example of the results of a reflective education, the standard form in Italy in his time; more generally, the meaning of the phrase "Renaissance man" has more than a little to do with the kind of education on offer during that particular period. <br><br>Susan, that's an abstract generalization that's worth its weight in gold -- yes, even at current prices. <br><br>Provo, the fact that drowning is bad doesn't make dying of thirst good. In the same sense, there's something between naivete and paranoia that's better than either one. <br><br>Raven, those students sitting around a lecturer make a good model for effective education. Might be worth keeping in mind. <br><br>Sekenre, I read <i>Godel, Escher, Bach</i> when it first came out -- a very lively and thoughtful book, especially helpful in that I disagreed with quite a few of the author's arguments. Thank you for the article link and the reminiscences!<br><br>Draft, of course you can specify one particular pair of beliefs out of a galaxy of possibilities, choose a specific sample population out of the many options, and come up with figures to support a claim that it's all the other side's fault. So? I heard just as many Dems insist that Dubya was about to launch a fascist coup as I hear Republicans these days insist that Obama is about to do the same thing -- and I got roughly equal numbers of comments from both sides here.

Libraries are my idea of Valhalla, anyway; the public library was the one refuge I had from a generally wretched childhood, and I routinely spend an hour each way on public transit to get to the nearest university library to spend some hours of research time and haul home a stack of books as heavy as I can carry. If there's anything you can do to help your own library weather the approaching mess, that would be great. <br><br>Adrian, congrats on the stipend! That's excellent news. You're right, of course, that some subjects need to be studied with people who already know them inside and out; the question is how to arrange for this in a way that doesn't have such a high overhead. <br><br>Beren, it's interesting to note that those societies that historically had the best administered governmental systems -- ancient Rome, imperial China, imperial Britain, and more -- all trained their staff by reflective rather than abstractive systems of education. A point worth, er, reflecting on...<br><br>Mokey, well, as someone with Aspergers syndrome, I have an odd perspective on this; unlike many people on the autism spectrum, I think entirely in spoken language, and so Grandin's gifts are as unfamiliar to me as they are to neurotypical people, if not more so. All the autism spectrum disorders seem to involve a narrowing and therefore an intensifying of the range of things the mind can do, with reading of social cues one of the things that usually doesn't make the cut! As for why autism spectrum disorders are so common now, good question; it's certainly suggestive that we're getting an increased diversity in neurology just when radically new thinking is going to be most desperately needed. <br><br>Sofistek, fair enough. I just get tired of radical moral dualism, I suppose. <br><br>Robert, thanks for the correction!<br><br>Beneath, my degree is in comparative history of ideas, which is about as generalist a program as I could find.

You will remember that one or two of the wise among our forefathers- wise in fact, although not in the world's esteem- had ventured to doubt the propriety of the term "improvement," as applied to the progress of our civilization. There were periods in each of the five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution, when arose some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious- principles which should have taught our race to submit to the guidance of the natural laws, rather than attempt their control. At long intervals some master-minds appeared, looking upon each advance in practical science as a retro-gradation in the true utility. Occasionally the poetic intellect- that intellect which we now feel to have been the most exalted of all- since those truths which to us were of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that analogy which speaks in proof-tones to the imagination alone, and to the unaided reason bears no weight- occasionally did this poetic intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition of his soul. And these men, the poets, living and perishing amid the scorn of the "utilitarians"- or rough pedants, who arrogated to themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the scorned- these men, the poets, ponder piningly, yet not unwisely, upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our enjoyments were keen- days when mirth was a word unknown, so solemnly deep-toned was happiness- holy, august and blissful days, when blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest solitudes, primeval, odorous, and unexplored.<br> Yet these noble exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by opposition. Alas! we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil days. The great "movement"- that was the cant term- went on: a diseased commotion, moral and physical. Art- the Arts- arose supreme, and, once enthroned, cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated them to power. Man, because he could not but acknowledge the majesty of Nature, fell into childish exultation at his acquired and still increasing dominion over her elements. Even while he stalked a God in his own fancy, an infantine imbecility came over him. As might be supposed from the origin of his disorder, he grew infected with system, and with abstraction. He enwrapped himself in generalities. Among other odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground; and in the face of analogy and of God- in despite of the loud warning voice of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in Earth and Heaven- wild attempts at an omni-prevalent Democracy were made. Yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil- Knowledge. Man could not both know and succumb. Meantime huge smoking cities arose, innumerable. Green leaves shrank before the hot breath of furnaces. The fair face of Nature was deformed as with the ravages of some loathsome disease. And methinks, sweet Una, even our slumbering sense of the forced and of the farfetched might have arrested us here. But now it appears that we had worked out our own destruction in the perversion of our taste, or rather in the blind neglect of its culture in the schools. For, in truth, it was at this crisis that taste alone- that faculty which, holding a middle position between the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely have been disregarded- it was now that taste alone could have led us gently back to Beauty, to Nature, and to Life.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c413535662662632357 title="comment permalink">7/28/11, 11:23 PM</a><br><br>

What is taught will evolve (devolve) according to the needs of the societies doing the teaching, much like mythology and religion did prior to their codification into written dogma.<br><br>One hopes that much of what we've learned will be preserved in some way, perhaps being taught only to a special guild, as in the Star's Reach "Melumi", or even 'held in trust', longterm, ala Asimov's Foundation concept (I actually have reliable knowledge that at least one such facility exists).<br><br>I think it's very possible that, at some point, the masses will be ruled, not by force, devine right, or control of property and resources, but by control of knowledge; a learned elite who dole out "the old wisdoms" as they see fit.

The biggest difference he sees in his students now versus when he started teaching lies in their experiences that have lead them to want to study science. In my dad’s case, it was the lots of time he spent outside exploring the natural world where he lived that inspired him to become a scientist. Now, most students spend little time outside, and their knowledge of science comes from the laboratory and textbooks. Most students studying biology tend to be interested in medicine and biotechnology, not in natural history. If they were plopped down somewhere in the woods away from electronic media for several days, many would soon get bored.<br><br>I think this change parallels the change in the areas of science that have received the most funding, attention, and allure. There are some thinkers who claim that scientific knowledge has increased exponentially, but I’m highly critical of such claims. For one thing, areas such as biotechnology, genetic engineering, &amp; computer technology, have increased while areas such as taxonomy, natural history, herpetology etc. have gotten considerably less focus.<br><br>It’s a curiosity to me how few people in the sciences really grasp the predicament that were in right now, let alone are responding to it meaningfully. A person close to me studied environmental science in college and it always struck her how she felt that most of the others who completed the degree were not very ecological at all in their daily life, and how most of her environmentalist friends tended to major in the humanities. I think this may connect to the contemporary emphasis on abstraction over reflection, including in the sciences. Someone can be capable of learning ecology well as an abstraction, but the ability to internalize ecology and apply it broadly to every aspect of how one lives one life, involves a great deal of reflection.<br><br>To me, reflection involves thinking in the first person tense. In the anthropology department I got to be known as the student who often asked questions in class such as “Why is this important for us to know?” or “How does this knowledge change the way we live our lives?” For example, I took an entire course on the High Civilizations of the Americas, and we spent a great deal of time studying the history of the Mayan civilization. While I found it all very interesting, I kept finding my mind silently wandering into types of discussion questions that weren’t being discussed. Such as, “How does our understanding of Mayan history relate to our current society?” “How does it change the way I live my life?” “If an anthropologist from the future would observe this class, what might they say about why we are coming to sit here in a class studying and discussing Mayan history in the format we are currently?” I did eventually raise my hand and ask some of those questions. But still, I realized how deep reflection was undervalued compared to abstraction in academic studies.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c9046736672868387870 title="comment permalink">7/29/11, 11:18 AM</a><br><br>

Relocalization could usefully start there, too. <br><br>Surfer, good heavens. That's stunning -- and not something I've seen before. Obviously I need to chase down some of the less common bits of Poe!<br><br>Jonathan, $90,000 is still absurdly too much, but it's better than many. It'll be interesting to see what happens as government funding dries up and the universities have to cope with the prospect of actual contraction. <br><br>Draft, you could as well argue that that shows that the elected officials of the GOP better represent the attitudes of their constituents. My point remains that tendentious arguments, claiming that a bipartisan problem are all the fault of one side, are a good part of what landed us in our present deadlock. <br><br>Thijs, I'll have to read your book on the subject -- you may have read mine, for all I know. As for the potential survival of the sciences, though, I'm a good deal less certain than you are. I think it's possible to get the scientific method, at least, through the crises ahead, and that alone will make up for much. But I'll check out the Pratchett book!<br><br>Cherokee, it's going to be interesting to watch. The US system of government has vulnerabilities that parliamentary systems don't -- the checks and balances make it too easy for a sufficiently deep and even schism in the body politic to produce total deadlock, which is what we more or less have now. Will they be able to pull some rabbit or other out of the hat? Or will the US government freeze up for a few weeks or months, with interesting economic results? A bag of popcorn would be worth having handy...<br><br>As for homeschooling, it has its traps. So does public schooling -- the deficiencies of the bureaucracy, rather than those of the parents, get impressed on the children.

The national/world leaders quickly become allies and/or enemies, in the same way that cliques form in high school. It is human nature for people to rationalize their unfair behavior, and sometimes intelligent people are even better at it, thus more impervious to reason.

It's the heritage of the last few millennia of culture I worry about, and the management types you describe, for whom the measurable is the manageable and nothing else is real, are among the reasons for that worry. <br><br>Jason, thanks for the links! Yes, I've written an encyclopedia of secret societies, which treats them as a real historical phenomenon with documented effects on history. That's one of the reasons I'm fairly confident drawing a line between real conspiracies and vast imaginary scapegoats. <br><br>Yupped, if you get your daughter assessed, don't let the educational or medical bureaucracies find out about it; they'll have her on drugs so fast you won't be able to see straight, and her ability to deal with the benefits as well as the drawbacks of her condition will suffer accordingly. I'd encourage you simply to read up on Aspergers on your onw, and adapt your assessment as you see how she develops. <br><br>The capacity for intellectual focus that comes with AS can have huge benefits in terms of learning and scholarship, which your local schools almost certainly won't be able to cope with; if you send her to school, you'll need to provide her with a rich intellectual life at home to counter the stultifying dullness of modern public education, and work with her to develop ways of coping with the social deficits that AS brings. You're not fooling yourself; AS has an upside as well as a downside, and if you help her learn how to cope with the social issues, she can capitalize on the upsides to have a happy and productive life. <br><br>Grrl, we're something like one percent of the population these days, and growing. My spouse is somewhere on the spectrum, too, so I'm at least a little familiar with the way that gender differences affect the way autism-spectrum conditions play out. <br><br>Unknown, I've seen claims along those lines before and have never been sure how to take them -- it's a longstanding habit in social psychology to project the prejudices of the researcher onto his subjects, and (for example) define conservative people as "authoritarian" because they get irritable when a liberal college professor airily dismisses their deeply held beliefs. (It's rather reminiscent of the claims, in the antebellum South, that African American slaves suffered from a bizarre mental illness called "drapetomania," an irrational compulsion to run away from home.)

A diversity of projects to preserve useful knowledge and culture would be one helpful way to try to prevent that. <br><br>Beneath, one of the things that I find very frustrating is the number of people who are involved in the sciences to one degree or another, but seem to be unable to apply their critical thinking skills in exactly the way you've outlined -- asking questions about their own presuppositions and the cultural and social context that defines scientific belief in the present age. I recall a while back reading an MD insisting that if approved pharmaceuticals caused harmful side effects, that was okay because they were doing more good overall, while if herbs caused any negative side effects at all, that proved they were quackery that must be banned. I don't think he was being deliberately meretricious, but his lack of ability to assess his own stance against the basic rules of logic, or to correct for his personal financial interest in having patients come to him rather than going to an herbalist, was the opposite of impressive. <br><br>Thijs, I'm sorry to say I don't read Dutch.

The fact that JMG and Temple Grandin are put on the same "disorder spectrum" yet have such vastly different cognitive processes in critical areas points this out. Considering that both have accomplished more than the large majority of we who comment here on this blog, one might wonder about the whole "disorder" thing, anyway. The "tests" say I am "neurotypical" but I expect if you put me and JMG down next to each other at your dinner party you would be hard pressed to tell which of us was "normal" and which was "disordered" (or possibly even which of us was which, period). <br><br>On another note, I am constantly amused by the horror expressed at the "radical socialist" accusations against Obama by the exact same people who were calling Dubya a "fascist" just a few years ago -- a much harsher accusation, actually, and just as false (or there would be no President Obama and we would not be having this discussion). Sure Dubya waged an illegal and immoral war based on deliberate misrepresention of critical military facts. So did Kennedy and Johnston. "Draft-dodging" Clinton deployed U.S. forces more times than did "war-mongering" Reagan. I'm no fan of the neocons and teapartiers; but I'm not an especially big fan of greenie utopian fundamentalists or cheerleaders for "globalization" of any stripe either. Based on actual manifested domestic and foreign policies, second term Dubya and first-term Obama can often be hard to tell apart. Ddid you know that Dubya abolished the ban on HIV-positive people entering the U.S. during his second term? Didn't fit the "profile" so got no media attention.

I think it would be exceedingly rare to find an employer who held that work experience had no pragmatic value.<br><br>2.

I agree completely that there are proponents of science and medicine who are far too uncritical of their own field, or the knowledge they are presented with. I'd add that I think this is quite contrary to the spirit of science, for example as outlined by Karl Popper, which requires constant questioning and criticism of existing theories. Yes, you're welcome to bring up Thomas Kuhn's view of science, too. I don't think they're entirely incompatible, though Popper outlines the ideal, while Kuhn outlines some of the mess in practice.<br><br>My view on medicine is that there is room for both alternative (especially herbal) medicine and mainstream medicine, but that the two have different roles. For example, even in the mainstream medical community, I think there is quite widespread recognition that home remedies for basic ailments like the common cold are largely better for patients (and the rest of the human race) than, say, antibiotics. On the other hand, there are no herbs or alternative medicines that will do very much to help patients with severe bacterial pneumonia, or, say, syphilis, while in both those cases antibiotics can be life-saving.<br><br>As for herbal remedies, interestingly enough, modern medicine is full of examples where herbal extracts are used -- aspirin from willow trees, digitalis for controlling heart rate, deadly nightshade eye drops for eye tests, aconite extract as pre-operative sedative. Often, however, dosage is critical, as there is a narrow range between having no effect and killing a patient. In these cases, the extract has to be prepared in a lab which can accurately quantify and control the dosage. It's also best for them to be administered in a clinical setting where emergency help is available if the dosage turns out to be wrong. It would be a brave herbalist indeed who would give a patient foxglove or aconite in anything other than sub-effective doses. <br><br>Of course, there are plenty of examples of over-prescription of drugs, especially psychoactives, accompanied by very shady practices on the parts of the pharmaceutical companies manufacturing them. Likewise, there are plenty of practitioners of alternative medicine making ludicrous claims, e.g. that <a href=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/_2010/2010_74-eng.php rel=nofollow>industrial bleach can cure cancer, HIV and malaria</a>, or that every disease can be cured just by straightening your spine.<br><br>In fact, I think the whole debate has, like the political spectrum, tended to have become quite polarised. Again, pressure from to polar opposite groups with an economic ulterior motive seems to be the driver.<br><br>I'll conclude by saying that a fairly clear thinker on this topic is <a href=http://www.badscience.net/ rel=nofollow>Ben Goldacre</a>, a British medical doctor who writes a column about bad science reporting. He's drawn a lot of ire for his criticism of genuine quackery in alternative medicine, and even been accused of being in the pocket of Big (Bad) Pharma. More recently he has laid that last accusation soundly to rest by criticising the shady practices of Big Pharma.<br><br>Gah - maybe I should start a blog about this...<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c4045915677128714021 title="comment permalink">7/29/11, 2:53 PM</a><br><br>

The public school system is essentially a glorified babysitting session. I wish I'd known long ago that my Bachelor's degree would be completely useless. I managed to graduate Magna Cum Laude while having learned very little. Not that I didn't want to learn. My statistics class was great, and there was some decent stuff in there. Most of it though -- busywork. Or stuff that should have belonged in middle school. At that point in my life, I thought that I needed a Bachelor's degree to have a sense of self-worth, but now I'm so sorry that I completed it. For one, when you get a BA you're no longer eligible for any financial aid. Now that I'm older and more learned, I'd like to learn a usefull skill but formal trade school is no longer an option as I'm not willing to go into debt by any amount.<br><br>Also, thanks for the positive plug about homeschoolers. I've been looking at doing a Waldorf-based program because of the inclusion of traditional crafts. There are other great programs too of course. My daughter really wants to go to school because her impression of it is as an endless play session, but I don't want her brains to be wasted.<br><br>Not that anyone is following our decisions, but we've nixed boatbuilding due to various reasons and are looking at a trade like carpentry. I can imagine that a business retrofitting existing homes to add wood stoves, remove the dishwasher, better insulation, etc. would be an interesting one. Now we just have to figure out how to survive until school's over.

At one point, you said, <i>"It’s not a knowledge that can be extracted in the form of abstract generalizations, either; it’s a personal, tacit knowledge, a knowledge woven of examples, intuitions, and things felt rather than things defined.

The "good examples" you talked about surely come from trial and error, and understanding what went wrong, in the bad examples. This is science at an elementary level, isn't it? And abstraction is only improved on by applying, or trying to apply, previous abstractions - and we gain from the abstractions only by applying them.<br><br>It's interesting that history shows abstract learning being maintained even through periods of reflective dominance.

For the first forty years of my life, I was bedeviled by questions -- my own and others' -- about why I couldn't do things that were perfectly easy for most people, since I was obviously so intelligent, and so on and so forth. It was a huge issue for me, since the things I couldn't do well included reading nonverbal cues (90% of human communication) and nearly anything involving motor skills -- my coordination matured about half normal speed, meaning I had all the dexterity of an eight-year-old at age sixteen. <br><br>Finding out that I had specific, well documented neurological deficits that I could understand, and figure out how to work around -- that was an immense gift. I literally started crying right there in the middle of the university library where I'd encountered the article, because I could finally be sure that it wasn't just a matter of not trying hard enough -- that there was actually something wrong. <br><br>Kieran, er, I thought I explained in some detail that we're also talking about two ways of thinking about education, which do have their partisans. That seems to be the detail that messed you up. It's abstraction as a theory of education that has its hooks deeply into American culture -- again, I thought I explained this -- which is why most people think of education as a matter of learning the right abstract generalizations. <br><br>As for your question, to codify something is inevitably to reduce it to abstract generalizations -- a codification that included all the context of each individual case would be as useless as the map in the Borges story that was the same size as the empire it mapped! It's entirely possible to test for reflective knowledge, but there's a catch; you have to have it in order to perceive it. You can't reduce it to a set of cut and dried formulae -- which latter are, of course, more abstract generalizations, but you can determine its presence to a high degree of exactness. Have you ever had the experience of hearing someone talk about something and get all the words and jargon right, but leave the inescapable impression that he didn't actually know what he was talking about? <br><br>Lewis, I'm partial to the books written by Tony Attwood. <br><br>Kieran, I'll be talking about this in a few more posts. I don't use mainstream medicine myself; I can't afford it -- I've never had the money for health insurance -- and I've had far too many family members sickened, maimed, and killed by drug side effects, hospital-borne infections, and the other consequences of the venial and arrogant mess that too much of modern American medicine has become. Mind you, of course you're right that there's quackery in the alternative scene, and it takes a fair amount of care to navigate the swamp; but alternative medicine is a lot less expensive, and the annual death toll from all alternative health care put together is a tiny fraction of the annual mortality from drug side effects, drug interactions, surgical misadventures, nosocomial infections, etc., etc.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c2201784044933096146 title="comment permalink">7/29/11, 6:53 PM</a><br><br>

A bit of concentration on the whole range of home energy conservation retrofits might pay off; in a few years, I'm guessing, that's going to be a substantial market, and there aren't too many carpenters who know how to do it any more. <br><br>Houyhnhnm, I think the internet is part of it, but the same thing happened just as intensely in the runup to 1860, so I don't think it's the dominant factor. My own guess is that the economic decline of the United States has pushed its internal stresses to the breaking point, just as the massive economic shifts of the early 19th century did with an earlier set of internal stresses. Whether the current mess can be resolved short of civil war is a good question. <br><br>Sofistek, as often as not the good examples stored up by reflective learners are fictional, not factual; that's one of the roles of traditional epic poetry in oral cultures, for example. Science can also be pursued in a more abstractive or a more reflective mode. Finally, as I pointed out, abstract learning is preserved in reflective ages because it has a reflective value apart from any practical use it may have -- Greek astronomy was of no practical value in the Dark Ages, for example, but it was preserved because reflecting on it was held to be valuable for grasping the character and context of human existence. <br><br>Ceworthe, thanks for the links!<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c9076120021775776425 title="comment permalink">7/29/11, 6:55 PM</a><br><br>

The stories of JMG and Grandin herself, plus even 2/3 of the children I work with, point to far more than just an aspect of personality- it's accompanied almost always by a nervous system and neurological connections that have gone haywire somewhere, where just the interactions between individuals and their environment cause profound under or overreactions.<br><br> Interacting with the world in ways that most people take for granted causes incredible pain and suffering for many of these people.<br><br>Children especially.

Responding appropriately to social cues has always been difficult for me. Through the years I've learned the basics of socializing with others, but I often feel like I'm merely in an acting role, outside myself. In social situations, I do things because I am consciously telling myself to do something (oh, "I should be giving eye contact now," or "do not stare too much longer" or "Now I need to say this."). It's an inspiration to hear about how Aspergers can be gift if understood and the many uniquely talented people who have it, including you.<br><br>I understand the great feeling about suddenly knowing a name to describe a condition. My example that follows is a little different because it's generally not considered a disorder now:<br><br>I have always experienced sensory mixing. Sound comes through also in color. And every word, letter, number, day of the week, etc. is a very specific color that has been true for me as long as I can remember (example, if you're curious: "peak oil" is a certain shade of brownish orange and white to me, though "Aspergers" is a light blue.) When I started mentioning this to other people, people looked at me strangely. I even started to doubt my own experience as something that wasn't "real" even though I felt it was. Finally, my senior year of high school, I stumbled across a scientific article and learned that what I experienced was "legitimate" and it was called synesthesia. Knowing it had a name (and it was a growing research topic among neuroscientists) really empowered me. (This is a little different than something like Aspergers because it never really hindered me perse, it just made me seem weird to others).<br><br>Interestingly enough I've learned that synesthesia is much more common among those in the autism spectrum. Some theorize that infants experience synesthesia, but those cross-linked sensory connections are usually lost in early childhood, except in a minority of cases.<br><br>I feel I've gotten off the topic of education here, though I do feel it relates in some indirect way. Synesthesia is an interesting topic in science because it deals with subjective experience. In fact, many scientists showed outright hostility to acknowledging it to be "real" and study it precisely because of its subjective nature, that if it was "subjective" it somehow could not be "real." I attended the American Synesthesia Association Conference a few years ago, and a number of presenters reflected on the larger implications of the study of synesthesia on our abstraction-dominated educational system.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c6146083408369797682 title="comment permalink">7/29/11, 9:40 PM</a><br><br>

I have just started reading <i>American Tempest: How the Boston Tea Party Sparked a Revolution</i> by Harlow Giles Unger, and it's obvious that Americans have been crazed from the git-go. Speaking of the Molasses Act of 1733, Unger says "Merchants argued disingenuously that the duties would have doubled retail prices of rum and left colonists unable to afford a drop of their favorite drink. In truth...[the merchants]were able to distill a 16-pence gallon of molasses into a gallon of rum to sell at 192 pence--a gross profit of 1,200 percent! The six-pence-per-gallon duty would have cut profits to 1,161.5 percent!"<br><br>Temple Grandin: When I read her book <i>Thinking in Pictures</i>, I instantly flashed on John Anthony West's book <i>Serpent in the Sky: The High Wisdom of Ancient Egypt</i>. West's description of the Giza plateau in meticulous relationship to the stars overhead made me go "Whoa! This whole society sounds 'autistic'!"<br><br>Education: When I was 21, I fell in with the Ecumenical Institute in Chicago, which, I suppose, was a think tank for social justice issues. I went to their six week Academy and pretty much had my brains turned inside out. In those six weeks, I was exposed to the ideas of Bonhoeffer, Neibuhr, Tillich, Kazantzakis, Joseph Campbell, Carlos Castaneda, Jonathon Livingston Seagull, and a host of other minds--frequently without any labels, so my whole adult life as been like an unscripted treasure hunt. To this day I still trip over concepts I picked up at Academy. "Oh! That's where (whatever) came from."<br><br>On the other hand, in our teacher training, we were given so many wonderful organizational tools.

Reflection is a tool not often employed even though there is requirement for it at the top of the ladder (it's useful for strategic thinking). Sir Isaac Newton wouldn't have been able to make intuitive leaps without all that time kicking around his mothers orchard.<br><br>You can see a lack of reflection in our societies politics - catchy sound bites, tough talk, but very little vision.

What I think they actually mean is that they are over whelmed. Take some time out to smell the roses people.<br><br>Also, whilst people are talking about higher education, what is the obsession with living on campus in the US? Of course education is going to be expensive if you expect someone to feed and house you for years on end. From my perspective also is that it places impressionable people into an environment that's unlikely to be repeated anywhere else in society. It lends itself to feelings of superiority.

I found the last line most chilling...<br><br>"Jody calls it her 'vitamin'; Cole, his 'M&amp;M'; James, his 'focus pill'. It's the medication they each take every day so that they'll pay attention in my sixth grade classroom. Thanks to these drugs, these students are able to sit in their seats while I train them to pass the high-stakes state-wide tests...<br><br>"I teach formulaic responses to essay prompts they'll encounter on the state exams... My classroom is more factory than learning environment, but I have little choice. Legislators are proposing that the students' scores on these tests be linked to my job security. If you were to ask me if I wanted my entire class on medication, I'd say yes.<br><br>"If a student starts acting out or is unable to sit and focus, I'll suggest to the parents that they obtain from their pediatrician an ADHD checklist, which I'll use as I observe the child's classroom behavior. Occasionally, a parent will argue about the wisdom of medicating a developing child.

Psychological diagnoses are not clearly defined things with understood, identified causes, mechanisms, and progressions. "Measles" is a disease, with a clear cause. Two people with "measles," though certainly not identical, share fundamental attributes of mechanistic physiological causation that are vitally informative about their conditions. Such is not the same for people with the same psychiatric diagnosis. Mental conditions are for the most part "syndromes" -- collections of loosely similar symptoms that may actually arise from disparate and/or multiple complexly interacting processes. Even to the extent that these diagnoses do come from similar underlying processes, these processes are not yet identified or understood in the VAST majority of cases (no, it is not just a "chemical imbalance in your brain," with no specification as to what chemicals and how imbalanced). They are also fluid, being redefined and reclassified, in some cases created and abolished, every few years. This does not say that the issues are not real or are not rooted in profound physiological roots. But what it does mean is that a diagnosis of "Aspergers" or "Borderline Personality Disorder" is in many ways fundamentally less informative than a diagnosis of "Diabetes" or "Syphilis," in terms of understanding the condition or how to respond to and work with it. You are still dealing with a whole lot of idiosyncratic individualism that will have to be worked out one-on-one before you even understand well what is happening. HOWEVER, in this society with its mechanistic medical concepts of just about everything, psychiatric diagnoses tend to get treated the same as medical diagnoses. "You've got this condition, take these pills." Never mind the fact that two people with the same diagnosis might have drastically different neurological foundations for their circumstances. It is not just the medical community that does this, it is society as a whole. We love tidy (arbitrary) boxes in which we can throw complexity and pretend we don't need to deal with it anymore. Boxes and syndromes are very useful. But you have to remember their huge limitations, too <br><br>"I'm not crazy.

I wish that my abstract life allowed time for a full reflection upon it's implications. I will share a few thoughts before my weekly allotment of home gardening practical learning.<br><br><br><br>It seems to me a fool's errand to attempt to save or reform the current educational system. Its size and dependence upon large inputs of energy ensure its future demise. I think that education will survive only in forums similar to this one sans the Internet. When life inevitably returns to a predominately local affair only two types of education will survive: the practical and the reflective. The practical 'cause there ain't no way to escape the need to eat, keep warm and find a mate. It is the reflective experience that is the most curious to me.<br><br><br><br>You have framed the question of man's nature most succinctly. After we are finished meeting our daily needs via practical knowledge we are left with lots of time on our hands. While lions are content to lounge in the sun and groom themselves humans seem to be intent on contemplation and reflection. We have even labeled ourselves as such: homo sapiens, going so far as to add additional ~sapiens indicative of our superior knowledge. I think that from reflection springs abstraction in an attempt to know (reflect) with certainty.<br><br><br><br>As we enter the Long Descent I look to you and other sources for reflections upon our spiritual future. Are we as a species destined to perpetually exploit the practical benefits of reflection or is there another course where reflection results in reverence and respect for the precarious and wondrous nature of our existence? There is the very real possibility that our exploitative capabilities have already destroyed the opportunity for our contemplative selves to enjoy life basking in the sun, licking our neighbors. I like to think that somehow we come out of this predicament with a profound understanding of our limitations and a deeper appreciation for mystery and the opportunity to love.<br><br>Regards,<br> <br>Steve<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c3711900861446454277 title="comment permalink">7/30/11, 9:29 AM</a><br><br>

To be honest, it feels more like summa cum laude in multiple choice and student loans. Terrifying way to enter the healthcare factory, especially since the majority of the vast quantities of data we fried our brains memorizing and spitting out on exams is irrelevant to the actual work, which will require ongoing on-the-job training by more senior techs. Plus memorizing vast quantities of actually relevant data. Did I mention fried brains?<br><br>In the meantime, merging linear and nonlinear thinking is a full time pursuit. It's mind-boggling to be able to "do the math" one moment, and "magically think" a needed or desired item into existence the next. But it is do-able, as I've just confirmed for myself this morning. Eg, I determined after last week's 'druid report that I am in need of a scythe. I worried about it all week -- where would I find one, how would I sharpen it, and so on. Only to find exactly one available via Craig 's list -- offered by a local tool sharpening company, professionally cleaned, sharpened and ready-to-go. At the exact price I imagined. And they will deliver free to a town I will be passing through in the next couple weeks. In other words, the green wizard's path continues to clear before me as I trod along...<br><br>Anyway, back to the topic at hand, I expect that in the future education will devolve to guilds and apprenticeships for specialties, with humanities via clubs, reading and writing groups, library circles, religious organizations, etc.<br><br>Apprenticeships makes a nice segue into an earlier post on horse breeding that I wanted, but was unable, to respond to. Which response is, now is not the time to be breeding as a business, but is the time to be learning and researching. For non-horse people, to apprentice themselves to a local, quality ranch or farm. For horse people laying the groundwork for their future, to be researching the breed, bloodlines and current breeders who are preserving the right type of horse. And to be keeping an eye on those breeders. Eg, I have found a couple of breeders of the specific arabian type I want are now in trouble due to illnesses, drought, the economy, etc. Already there is one young mare offered free and several others available who were originally "keepers" intended to maintain and upgrade the mare bands. In other words, breeding at this point should be on a very limited basis with the focus on preservation of type and skills.<br><br>Jumping back to learning and education, yes, motek, work with animals requires thinking in images and close observation of subtle behavioral cues. For example, my filly is learning to relax in part by my breathing her into relaxation. When horses relax, they often breathe a a long, drawn out, breathy snort as they inhale deep into their chests. Like human yawns, those breaths are contagious; one starts and the rest will surely follow. It is easy to mimic, and when I do the filly is sure to follow. Much of horse training relies on such unexpected, unplanned communication techniques.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c3536863248465538211 title="comment permalink">7/30/11, 12:42 PM</a><br><br>

It's not just a grab bag of deficits. <br><br>Beneath, I have to deal with social situations in much the same way: "Okay, now meet his gaze and nod, that way he's going to realize that he's been listened to."

That's a notch further down than I expected. <br><br>Hawlkeye, okay, you just managed to equal Mr. Mustard's story. The appalling thing being that this isn't just one teacher; from all that I've seen, it's business as usual in a very large number of school districts across the US. <br><br>Bill, Aspergers isn't a psychological condition; it's a neurological disorder. The exact causation is still a matter of debate, because the fine details of brain neurology aren't known that well, but it's no more psychological than Parkinson's syndrome. Nor is it simply a vague assortment of symptoms; the presentation varies somewhat, due again to the complexities of the human brain, but the basic deficits can be precisely defined -- and here again, knowing what they are is a huge assistance in working around them. If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the value of a diagnostic entity is in whether knowing it helps those so defined manage things -- and this one unquestionably does. <br><br>Sophie, thanks for the link!<br><br>Steve, no argument there. Even if it were possible in theory to save the existing educational system, most of the current administration and staff could be counted on to fight such a project every inch of the way, and the resources needed to keep things running on their current scale simply won't be around that much longer. That being the case, all we can do is try to get something in place to preserve at least some learning as the existing system falls to bits.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c7820781634103759055 title="comment permalink">7/30/11, 7:16 PM</a><br><br>

I suspect that although we may be in a similar rainfall situation, our temperature patterns are quite different. I've never been to Australia, most of what i know about its ecology and climate is through reading David Holmgren's work. However, being in the interior of North America with nothing to moderate cold or hot temperatures, we get a good range. I'm in south central MIssouri near the Arkansas border, close to the middle of the Ozark plateau. <br><br>Last winter our coldest temperature was -3F which would be close to -20C, but we also get occasional days in the middle of the winter that get to 70F (21C). A typical summer has average daytime temperatures of around 90F (32C), with a few days of above 100F (38C), and humid, but this summer has been dry and unusually hot, with all but a few days since the beginning of June above normal, this following a cool, very wet pattern in the spring. One thing I notice is the huge difference in how plants respond to a small temperature difference when it gets hot. When we get many 100 degree days, even such things as tomatoes, cucumbers and beans show stress when they fully thrive at 90F. <br><br>I take note of what does best in the heat because it will likely be all the more valuable in the future. Sweet potatoes are something that yields very well here with less inputs than most annuals and less labor too.<br><br>As far as tree crops go, apples are the ones most popular, but although I love them and have some trees, they also have some of the most problems of any tree in hot, humid climates. Many other fruits are a better choice. Even pears are much better as long as you get fireblight resistant varieties. The next thing I want to try is Asian persimmons, as well as selected American persimmons ans crosses between the two. We already have tons of wild persimmons here, ans I eat quite a few, but they're small and seedy compares the the domesticated ones. Asian persimmons are not as cold-hardy as the wild ones, but someone I know who grows them successfully has a trick, he grafts them onto American persimmon rootstock at three feet or so above the ground, because winter damage in most likely to occur closer to the ground line.<br><br>A recent book I've enjoyed is "Sepp Holzer's Permaculture", although he lives in a very different climate (the mountains of Austria) so most of the specifics of the book don't apply to my situation, it's an example of a true permacultural genius, actually he has been practicing his form of ecological agriculture since before the word permaculture was coined, only learning decades later his similarities with the permaculture movement. He has used fossil fuel input into excavators to terrace much of his steep mountain land, but unlike the machine inputs to conventional agriculture, they are one time inputs to get teh system set up, not continually needed.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c7654216245417296861 title="comment permalink">7/30/11, 9:17 PM</a><br><br>

I just looked it up too, and it was empowering to have a word like that to describe what I've been doing since I graduated from college. <br><br>When I graduated from college my anthropology professors really encouraged me to go to graduate school, saying I'd be a great candidate. To me whether or not I would be a good candidate was not the issue, it's whether it would be good for me. I knew not and I was afraid of how it might confine me if I continued on even if it gave me the supposed safety of knowing what I was doing with my life. Since then, I've done a lot of self-study and had a variety of experiences that could not have happened if I was in a formal course of study. The first few years out of school were difficult though because I do really thrive on intellectual stimulation and school is the expected place, according to others, for that to happen. It's taken some time to carve a more solid path of self-learning. It involves a great deal of self-initiative and self-reflection. But I don't regret it. It's so nice to be able to read any book one wants or study what one wants without having someone else decide those things. No more wasted time on having to read books that are not on my priority reading list...or having to write papers on certain topics when I want to be writing about something else.<br><br>Next time someone remarks about how I haven't continued on in school and gotten advanced degrees or how I don't have a full-time paid career path, I'll simply tell them confidently, "Well, I'm an autodidact..."<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c4299167187824176880 title="comment permalink">7/30/11, 9:51 PM</a><br><br>

I haven't pursued it any further because of my general mistrust of the mainstream medical system and their diagnostics. However I'm thinking about looking into it further as JMG has found it useful despite having a similar bad experience with the medical system. Even if I do fit perfectly into those criteria, I think I'll never use the label publicly as I see how society treats people differently who end up labeled with a condition and would rather be judged as myself rather than under a label. I don't label myself with a set political ideology for the same reason, I just state my feelings about the issues at hand.<br><br>As far as thinking in words versus pictures, I think sometimes in both but many other times in neither. Words are one of my limitations, translating ideas that are in the realm of the mind into words can take me a while, ironically most of all when it's a subject that's most important to me, and in a conversation I've often missed my chance by the time I've made that internal translation.<br><br>One of the interesting things I have come upon is the connection between diet and neurological isseus. Some say many of them originate in the gut, and for me at least that seems right. For myself, when I started eating a natural diet and avoiding food additives, sparked by a combination of physical issues and my emerging ecological conscience, I noticed immediately that I was more healthy in the mind too, and could handle the stressed of the world better. Most recently I have been avoiding wheat. I am not a celiac and don't have the extreme reactions they do, so I can get away with eating it occasionally, but notice feeling worse afterward. Many health issues can be aggravated by mild allergies, and this includes neurological ones in my case at least, everyone's is different. Thinking in the holistic sense my real goal is to heal my gut and make it so I'm not so oversensitive, resilience is what I'm after.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c3564904869480435696 title="comment permalink">7/30/11, 10:15 PM</a><br><br>

" There is increasing evidence that all sorts of psychological diagnoses have substantial physiological components -- the emotional disregulation of BPD appears to have a genetic component, for example. And of course "purely" physiological conditions (even a broken leg) often have major psychological impacts as well. As you know at least as well as I, mind/body is a synergism, not a duality. And the "mind" component remains vastly more mysterious. Plus, of course, as you and many other Aspies I have known are testaments to, the most effective ways of dealing with it are through conscious and determined effort of the mind. This is not nearly as effective for Parkinson's. <br><br>The medicalization of the mind cuts both ways. I have a family member who is Bipolar with strong OCD tendencies as well. She refuses to go to counseling (which could almost undeniably help her) because, based on past experience, she expects they will offer her nothing but mood-erasing medication. So instead she spends 2 hours every morning in shower, 7 days a week...<br><br>I never said that such diagnoses not valuable; indeed I believe I called them "very useful."

I do not mean this as a criticism, but as an affirmation.<br><br>This is muddled. What I'm trying to say is that in some sense the whole idea of "normal" is what enables mass education as presently constituted, and is exactly where mass education is to be most faulted: the insistence on industrial-style standardization. Of human persons.<br><br>On the one hand, many people I know have a mild or strong versions of some "disorder" or other, including many members of my family. On the other, many people I know are concurrently creative and atypical in their thinking/functioning and manage to live productive and even fulfilling lives--it's better than being burned as witches, or cast beyond the pale. <br><br>This is not at all to disparage or discount the very real hardships involved for some people, or the severity of some disabilities. And truly, what a relief when you discover that no, you are not alone, and yes there are ways to get help and to help yourself.<br><br>The Rule of Benedict, after all, which prescribes nearly everything for monastic life, (and seems very, even overly, strict in many regards) also explicitly advises adjusting tasks, duties and teaching so as to take into account individual members' strengths and weaknesses: what they are able to do and how best able to contribute to the community without requiring them to do what they are unable to do. This is exactly opposite to mass education.<br><br>I hope you do keep moderating this forum--it's one of the most interesting and thought/life (abstraction/reflection)-provoking places on the 'net.

You're not alone. My sound/color association has served me well in my training as an operatic singer. I have been accused of having Asperger's myself. I think the only reason I escaped a diagnosis early in life was because they identified an infantile epileptic disorder first, but the symptoms were the same at the time. The intervention I received thirty years ago before age three inspired me to get into the field as a way of repaying a debt. <br><br>@ Bill Pulliam - Any diagnostic system will have its good and bad points. I think in this case it's not necessarily a bad thing that it's so fluid- as JMG pointed out in one of his posts, even that which we think of as the 'Laws of Nature' are nothing more than manmade mental constructs, with no enforcements. As a clinician it drives me nuts that a diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD NOS) is codespeak for 'it's sorta like autism, somewhere on the spectrum but we really don't know', but it does give a desperate family something that they can use to open the door to some invaluable resources. Plus, people are getting closer to identifying the neurological underpinnings of these children and are seeing some very distinct differences.<br><br>Someone mentioned using both math and magical ways of thinking as a basis for education. It's always struck me as odd that people separate the two. Math, to me, is just another one of many symbol systems, that when combined, produce very real effects on the physical world. People refer to 'theoretical physics' and 'imaginary numbers'. Couldn't it be a distinction without too much of a difference? Our civilization is built in part on it, at least for the last few hundred years. Change the symbol system that underlie a civilization and you may get a whole new society.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c1466633213263997010 title="comment permalink">7/31/11, 9:07 AM</a><br><br>

In my case it was, as much as anything, because the subjects I wanted to study and the books I planned on writing were not the sort of thing that will advance an academic career -- quite the contrary, in fact. <br><br>Ozark, the diet/neurology thing is interesting.

Although I hate the word because it sounds like an affliction or a type of person that the local police keep a database on. Right next to those pedophiles! :)<br><br>I dropped out after two years of college. I was studying fine arts and illustration (not enough money and even less guidance at my disposal) <br><br>For me, I view higher education the same way I view boats - - they both require an enormous amount of energy and money :-) Many boat owners lament that "a boat is hole in the water into which you pour money." So I've learned that It's always better to have a friend who owns a boat because they're always looking for someone to help out with the endless maintenance. :-) <br><br>And for me, my friends with fancy expensive college degrees have always recognized my native gifts and abilities, and have been generous to open doors for me in the workplace. <br><br>One of my very first jobs, in the mid-70's, was working as a file clerk in a blueprint room for a large precision tool manufacturer. I was surrounded by engineers and draftsman who (at that time) were struggling with the advent of CAD technology. Many older draftsman and engineers were being replaced by shiny new CAD systems. I guess the colleges they came from never prepared them for their own obsolescence. It was sad to watch. <br><br>In my spare time I looked over their shoulders and learned how to read blueprints. One older gentleman, recognized my natural aptitude and curiosity and took me under his wing and taught me how to create technical renderings using compasses, old ruling pens, etc. What an education! And all for free!! <br><br>When 'desktop publishing' came into play, I was absorbed by their marketing services department and was one of the first few traditional illustrators who was able to make the leap from the drawing board to the whole new world of Macintosh computers, Adobe Illustrator and the amazing bezier curve. They weren't teaching this stuff in art schools at the time. I know personally that many schools rejected desktop publishing technology - - thought it was a fad - - (much like newspapers until recently, rejected the reality of the internet - - thought it was just intrusive technology with no future. LOL.<br><br>Fast forward thirty years - - I've had some great jobs as a senior designer, art director and creative director for some fairly successful business-to-business advertising and marketing agencies and corporate marketing departments (Unlike 'consumer' advertising, a creative person doesn't have to sell his soul in the business-to-business world. And, you can actually learn a lot of very useful things.)<br><br>I've hired many people through the years, and most of them had much more formal education than myself. I was never threatened by their credentials -- indeed, I was challenged by them. But I never hired anyone on the basis of their education. I am no more impressed by a person's intelligence evidenced by their college degrees than I am by a politician's trustworthiness and patriotism by way of those ubiquitous flag lapel buttons. (gag!)<br><br>I would always hire people who had curious minds. People who were well read. I feel that we draw from these interests - - it informs the work. Nothing in- nothing out, I say. <br><br>But perhaps the real interesting thing about my 'autodidactic' path is that I was often invited to speak and conduct workshops at some of the local colleges, and have been teaching a couple of continued education courses (part time) at a prestigious college for the past ten years. They keep calling me back probably because my evaluations are off the charts. And to think that I applied to this very same college after high school and was rejected.

I've done a lot of reading on it since I learned the name and that it was growing research topic in neuroscience. Yes, it's quite common that synesthetes are artists, composers, or other types of creative people. I'd never met another person with synesthesia until I went to the a conference of the American Synesthesia Association four years ago. It was really interesting to be part of a conference that was very collaborative between both scientists and artists. All the synesthetes there seemed to be artists or composers too. Sean Day, one of the researchers and synesthetes studying it (who's also on the board of ASA), is also a composer (http://www.daysyn.com/sean-day.html). If it's ever easy for you to attend one of the conferences, I encourage you to do so: http://www.synesthesia.info<br><br>I find synesthesia interesting not just because I have it, but because of the larger implications from the study of it...about the nature of subjective experience, about the possibilities of the mind in all of us, etc. The first book I read on it I recommend: The Man Who Tasted Shapes by Richard Cytowic. I've read others since then. Diverse people can have synesthesia, though I do find synesthetes to be eccentric, at least that was my conclusion going to that conference.<br><br>As for Aspergers, I find that I have some of the key characteristics associated with Aspergers, though other characteristics not so much, so I'm ambivalent about the use in getting a diagnosis. Also, I think I had a very supportive and nurturing upbringing so the deficiencies I have (esp. skills in social interactions, reading relationships), I didn't fully realize until later on.

Some people can’t learn horse body language. Some lack physical dexterity. On and on. Working with horses is dangerous enough for those of us who through training and instinct react appropriately. <br> <br>Incidentally, one of my students is a professional breath worker. One guess what she has trouble with when she rides. She’s proof that exhaling to aid the halt doesn’t come naturally to most people. <br><br>To your comments, I’d add that I hope even non-horsey people will learn enough to understand the role of horses in history. Too many today, if they think of horses at all, think of them as pets, as show ring toys, or as part of the racing “industry.” I fear such ignorance could contribute to a decimation of breeding stock on a far greater scale than that of the Russian Revolution where the great Mesaoud, among others, was lost.<br><br>Have you read <i>The Horse in Human History</i> by Pita Kelekna or <i>Horses at Work: Harnessing Power in Industrial America</i> by Ann Norton Greene? I’m going to be pitching theses books to my non-horsey friends. I’m hoping learning some history will help them understand why I’m so concerned about the future of the horse. <br> <br>And, lastly, Mary, sorry I haven’t responded to your last comment on my Swift Horse blog. I will find time, but for now irrigating pastures. <br><br>@My Donkey—<br><br>I’m a huge fan of George Carlin, especially his rants on writing style. Much of what he says about “obedient workers” was true in an earlier incarnation of the American education mess. <br><br>Over the last few decades though, other factors instituted by educational theorists in the name of fairness and democracy have been far more devastating. <br><br>Once again, I recommend Richard Hofstadter’s <i>Anti-Intellectualism in American Life</i>. I’ve handed this book to several people who took it saying they intended to read only Part 5, “Education in a Democracy.” So far, all have gone back to read the entire book. <br> <br>@JMG—<br><br>You response to Donkey surprised me. <br> <br>I am fascinated by the tangled threads that have led to today’s educational mess. Donkey identified one. I lived through another since I was lucky enough to have been in elementary school when Sputnik went up. In retaliatory panic, our educational system suddenly—and briefly—pandered to its brightest students. <br> <br>@Everyone who reads this.

The instructor taught us a uterine massage technique drawn from traditional Chinese medicine. It consists of six strokes over the abdomen in a radial pattern: three from the base of the rib cage to the navel, plus three from the tops of the hipbones and pubic crest to the navel. The pattern looks very much like a Tribann. I recognized this only because your <i>Druidry Handbook</i> arrived at my house just in time for me to tuck it into my travel bag, and I happened to read that very page during the lunch break, immediately before the teacher introduced the technique. It was an odd and delightful synchronicity.<br><br>So, anyhow, now I'm curious: are there any special types of massage/bodywork/energy work which are particularly related to druidry?

We are in this situation because we never fully realized our place in the universe and instead of seeing ourselves as yet another species on yet another small planet in the vastness of cosmic space, fully dependent on the health of the ecosystems of that planet and limited in its growth by the energy flows through those ecosystems, we saw ourselves as the center and the meaning of the universe. It was precisely the sciences that have made it possible for (a small portion) of us to understand the foolishness of this attitude. And it has historically been the humanities who have distracted our thinking in the opposite direction. <br><br>I am not dismissing the humanities as entirely worthless, far from it, but the fact is that the majority of them focus on issues of what is essentially insignificant details of intraspecies competition between humans, while the role of the environment has gotten very little attention. The whole approach to history, philosophy, ethics, etc., has been a non-ecological one, and the vast majority of the great works of literature deal either with love on one side or politics, history (of the non-ecological kind) or ethics on the other. The end result is a culture that focuses on the details of its internal affairs and has completely forgotten that it is a tiny subsystem of the physical world around it. <br><br>So I can not agree with the idea that we need to go back to paying more attention to the humanities in their familiar form. Now, it is entirely correct that the ideals of the Enlightenment crash headlong into the realities of human nature. But there is a very good reason for it and it is that human nature was not understood at all at the time. After all, Darwin came only in the middle of the 19th century and it wasn't until the second half of the 20th century that the genetic and biological foundations of human behavior began to be understood (and I am not saying we understand it completely now, just that we know much better than people in the 18th century). So while not really possible in practice at this point, in principle, a society that is designed to keep human nature in check and prevent it from causing its self-destruction could be designed. Again, unlikely to be even practically possible so it is largely a purely academic discussion, but worth thinking about nevertheless.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c1130616162972082540 title="comment permalink">8/1/11, 2:57 AM</a><br><br>

During the industrial boom, public schools instilled the values of factory and corporate office workers -- punctuality, obedience, tolerance for rote repetition. During the 60s and 70s they evolved into more diverse and varied forms. Since the 1980s they have steadily evolved into vo-tech schools to fill constantly shifting business needs. Of course they tend to run a half a decade or a decade behind the times. In 1979 I enrolled in a prestigious west coast university. Our curriculum was pretty much "Hey, man, study whatever you want, it's all groovy. Peace!" The faculty were vaguely afraid of the student body. This was all strange to us, because as far as we were concerned the hippies were old news and the campus rebellions were ancient history. But in the minds of the faculty, it had hardly been yesterday that all the windows on the Quad were covered with plywood and their offices were closed by sit-ins. So they still bent over backwards to avoid pressuring us too much or agitating us. Meanwhile we were saying "You're kidding, right? I don't have to take a single foreign language, math, history, or english class if I don't want to? PARTY TIME!!!" The most popular class on campus was Human Sexuality (that's not a joke, it really was a for-credit course in the Psych department). A year later the faculty began to suspect maybe times might have changed a teeny bit, and instituted a modest mandatory core curriculum. But those of my class and earlier were grandfathered in, so we got to continue living in a strange chimera of the 1960s and 1980s for a few more years. <br><br>In recent years, America is confused and grasping at straws and scapegoats trying to identify What Is Wrong, Who Is To Blame, and How To Fix It. This is happening in the schools the same as everywhere else. It is the same force that is causing the electorate to "throw the bums out" every 4 years; each time throwing out the new bums they just voted in last time to replace the previous bums. The result is a lot of chaos and arbitrary junk that hurts more than it helps. <br><br>I would guess the next wave will be the long slow scramble for survival and adaptation skills, and if there is anything left of public education at that time I expect to see that come to dominate the curriculum. I am more than a little worried about what happens to the rest of human knowledge during this period; I gather JMG is as well, so I look forward to more discussion on this!<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c4346487371701307115 title="comment permalink">8/1/11, 10:13 AM</a><br><br>

Benjamin Randall Jordan (1805-1853) spent all his life in rural western Maine (generally in Newfield and Parsonsfield). He was the middle of 9 children. His father had died of consumption when he was 12. Not long after he turned 13, he was in the yard, picking up wood chips for fuel, when he heard a cry, ran into the house and found his mother dead on the kitchen floor. The nine children kept the family together and the farm going for two years more, but then split up. At 15, Benjamin was indentured to a farmer in Parsonsfield for 6 years, that is, until he turned 21. All in all, not a very promising start for an intelligent boy.<br><br>However, he had been put to a “dame school” when he turned 6: a certain Mrs. Mitchell taught him to read, that is, to take a written text and sound out the words correctly one after another. Women taught these lessons, in the year 1811, with the aid of a spelling book, either Webster’s speller or one of the other spellers for sale in Newfield country store. There were other books for sale in the country store, and there was a very small shelf of books in his home. <br><br>Later, as one of the terms of his indenture, he was promised 14 months of schooling in the Parsonsfield village school. As he notes in the chronicle he wrote of his life, he “got 12 months of it,” spread out over several winters. When he was 16, he studied “Arithmetick, Reading &amp; spelling.” The next year he studied Geography, and the year after that he studied “Grammar &amp;c.” And that was all the formal schooling he ever got.<br><br>But he bought books all his life – his library has come down to us intact – and he read them: Cowper’s “The Task,” Butler’s “Hudibras,” Pope’s “Poetical Works” and his translation of “The Iliad,” Ovid’s “Metamorphoses,” various textbooks of physics, of astronomy, and of history, a manual of what now would be called comparative religions, Samuel Drake’s “The Book of the Indians of North America,” Bunyan’s “The Pilgrim’s Progress” and “The Holy War,” and many others. <br><br>When he turned 21, he was free to earn his own living. He farmed his own land, but every winter he also worked as a schoolmaster in Parsonsfield or one of the nearby towns. In 1832 he edited a volume of poetry by a local poet, Thomas Randall, and saw it through the press. At some point in his adult life he discovered Swedenborg, and became the librarian of the local Swedenborg Society.<br><br>And he wrote. He filled page after page with his own verse, with philosophical and religious speculations, with a history of his own life, and so forth. These writings he formed into books, which he bound himself, and he left these books to his descendants. We still treasure them, more than a century and a half later.<br><br>Not too shabby, eh, for an intelligent boy who had only had 12 months of education beyond Dame School!?<br><br>(continued in the next post)<br><br>Robert (mageprof)<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c1778678403628902310 title="comment permalink">8/1/11, 12:41 PM</a><br><br>

As I'm maturing (I'm now in my late twenties), I'm realizing more and more that my education, while excellent in some respects, has been rather patchy. Perhaps the most important gap is that it's been thoroughly modern in the sense that I have very little notion of the Western culture and history (and indeed humanity's culture and history, but I'm trying to be modest here by sticking to the West) from the pre-modern times. Sometimes, I find myself equating ancient history with the nineteenth century, because this is about as far back as my readings have taken me. One consequence of this is that I lack historical context and tend to ascribe recent origin to ideas that are, at least in some cases, quite old. (For an amusing example: I was recently startled to discover that a certain literary technique, which I'm quite fond of and which I had for years assumed had been invented by certain early 20th century French writers, was in fact extensively employed by Pushkin, nearly a full century earlier. I now suspect that the technique in question was not invented by Pushkin either, but having read almost nothing written prior to the nineteenth century, I don't have the faintest idea where or when it originated. Of course, this is a minor matter, and not that important in and of itself, but it does, I think, provide an telling illustration of the point I'm trying to make.) <br><br>Which brings me to the practical question: short of going back to school, how does one make up for these sorts of deficiencies? On the one hand, I do realize that there is a problem. On the other hand, I find it hard to approach anything pre-modern, partly because I don't really know where to start, and partly out of fear of misunderstanding and misinterpreting what the authors are saying. And as much as I would support the project of revamping formal education, what someone like me needs is more of a guide for self-study, an instruction for avoiding the common pitfalls of autodidactic learning. (I am reminded of a novel of Sartre's in which one of the characters embarks on the project of educating himself, and his method of study is to read every single book in his small town public library, in alphabetical order by the author's last name. This is, of course, a caricature, but it does bring home the real dangers of the unguided autodidact's project.) <br><br>I was thinking that it might be helpful, both to me and to your other readers, if you (JMG) were to share your intellectual history in more detail. You clearly have a broad education, and I'd be interested in learning how you went about acquiring it, since it doesn't seem to have happened (or at least not primarily) in school.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c4290492723607814761 title="comment permalink">8/1/11, 12:42 PM</a><br><br>

When the claptrap came up via Lou Dobbs, I took copies of the long form and the short form. I made my "other" pals read the instructions at the top of the long form out loud. They got very redfaced and quiet and angry when they did, because the long form birth certificate is absolutely NOT legal for proof of identity. I had tried to use it twice--once for my child's social security card and again for admission to middle school. Government officials told me the long form is not legal for proof of identity--20 years ago!<br><br>Same with transcripts. They are absolutely not public documents.

She developed her methods from her time spent studying medicine. She selected her first students from Italian slums. Her only stipulation was that they had to show up in clean clothes.

I certainly don't mean to dismiss other draft animals. <br><br>The oxen you mention are promising since any type of cattle can be yoked for draft and they are more docile than horses. However, oxen plod even slower than draft horses and don't tolerate heat as well--which is saying something. Also, the digestive system of cattle, while efficient, limits their working time. So, horses win over cattle for work such as treadmills and threshing. <br><br>Donkeys have much to recommend them, both as draft and even riding stock. Their highest value though will come if people have enough sense to use them to breed one of the best ride/drive/pull animals ever--the mule. <br><br>Mules take heat and poor forage well. They live longer than horses and have fewer health problems. The supposed downside-- stubbornness--is actually just a stolid sense of self-preservation. <br><br>While mules require some different training tactics, the horse people I know who've tried mules end up complaining about how much of their lives they've wasted with horses. <br><br>The real problem with mules is they are smart--too much so for most people. A doctor I know in Montana calls mules "the thinking man's horse" and I agree. <br><br>As sterile hybrids though, mules are more difficult and more expensive to produce. However, since donkeys and horses can be crossed to produce mules tiny or tall, light or heavy, it's worth it. The biggest job is educating people about how to breed and handle them. <br><br>Also, we should not discount camels, another animal that does well in heat and whose feet do not tear up the earth.

You acquire knowledge by reviewing the works of others, interpreting them for your own understanding, and deciding which matters of information are of value to you.<br><br>Document your search to help define when you find what you look for, and to provide backup points to resume your search, when you abandon a dead end. Others have found such searches for knowledge to be worth writing and publishing, and reading.<br><br>Mostly what you need in order to learn, is a question, and enough discipline (will to complete a task), to look for answers to that question. If you find it uncomfortable to stretch from the path of predefined destinations, you are correct. People are hard-wired to seek security -- to avoid change. Change is measured in discomfort, whether changing jobs, starting to date or ending dating. Any real change must put away the life that went before, that loss is real, the grief is real, and all change hurts. <br><br>The discomfort of change can be endured, hopefully leading to a bettered life.<br><br>Blessed be!<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c225866656320922679 title="comment permalink">8/1/11, 6:55 PM</a><br><br>

Industry dictates more to be taught in less time, leading to first time applicants to companies that are exactly educated to their standard, but fully fail to perform for a lack of real life experience. <br>- In physics, where my home lies, we leave all the theories, and do away with the practical parts, because they take too long. <br>- But the real issue, which you have not picked up upon I think, that we have here in the humanities, is that they are mainly seen as a prerequisite subject for politicians, journalists and historians. Indeed you have to have a PhD in any one of the humanities to get ahead. However, again, no one is given the time to really do a proper PhD. Research? Duh, too hands on. At the moment we look at an unprecedented stream of high profile politicians that have their PhDs revoked for plagiarism. Universities like them because they give credit by celebrity status and so they can get away with almost anything. Our former Defense Minister C.T.z. Guttenberg has adamantly held up he tried to properly cite all his copied passages, but may have failed in some cases (I believe almost 80% of the pages included plagiarized paragraphs). The chancellor then said she did not hire him as a Social Scientist. And this exactly leads back to the main issue, a PhD is looked upon as a title inferring broad education, scientific working attitude and general wisdom, but the fact that solid work is needed, and that high school and college education does no longer really prepare students for this, is ignored. Can we please all have wise geniuses after 3 years of college? No. <br> <br>Thus currently there is an interesting climate in Germanies Universities where Students bash Uni Senates for being too lenient with high profile candidates and a public that looses all faith in higher education, which has been one of Germany's greatest economical assets so far. <br><br>Whether that will lead to a substantial reversal in the dumbing down of our education I doubt, but at least the debate might bring some awareness of the very weird way that politics and industry use higher education.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c8379520610181652427 title="comment permalink">8/2/11, 4:29 AM</a><br><br>

I was trained as a Montessori teacher and worked for years in a small school.<br><br>The Practical Life area is especially interesting; children are taught individually how to do such things as scrubbing the table or hand washing (with a ceramic pitcher and bowl, no less!) They are then allowed to do these “works” whenever they desire if the “work” is available. They can continue to use that work as long as they desire…no forced sharing, etc. It is incredibly rewarding to step back and observe a three year old carry out the very long sequence of steps, taught in silence, involved in either of the tasks mentioned. These activities and the whole methodology foster deep concentration and genuine mastery…the children are literally constructing themselves before our eyes. It is profoundly awe-inspiring. Montessori believed that the ideal ratio of one teacher and assistant to 30-35 s children of mixed age (2-6yrs) actually works, but the child education/care laws require higher ratios and not so much mixing of the ages. Much gets lost in translation.<br><br>The other issue is that Montessori is seen as an “elite” method for high achieving parents, and has evolved toward an expensive product oriented curriculum. Parents want product and schools believe they must accommodate. The joy in learning comes from the act of being immersed in the process.<br><br>There is also a bit of a cult-like aspect to maintaining the purity of Dr Montessori’s teachings. I have to admit I fell into this a little bit myself, but the theory and application are still valuable.

I'm a bit uncertain both about your choice of the term "reflective" based on how you describe it, and your thesis that it is at a particularly low ebb now in society as a whole. The way you describe "abstraction" and "reflection" make them sound more like "absolutism" and "relativism." This is certainly not an art/science split either; there have been times when the arts were extremely codified and formalized, and periods in science when relativism and epistemology ruled the day. The phrase you use to introduce the idea of "reflective" knowledge, "the view that recognizes that human ideas of the order of the cosmos are, in the final analysis, just another set of human ideas," sounds very close to a fundamental tenant of Postmodernism. In spite of what looks like excessive rigidity in news and politics, in culture as a whole postmodernism and relativism are extremely strong trends in society now. I think the veneer of absolutism might be in fact more of a highly visible backlash against the pervasive "you do your thing, I I do my thing, it's all good" attitude of true mainstream society, rather than the actual core trend of contemporary thought. While politicians rant about homosexuality, most actual people grow less and less concerned about it with each passing day. <br><br>Maybe I am just having problems with the terminology you chose. I do have a general sense, however, that the true American zeitgeist is not really what is represented in the pseudo-documentaries of that name but is something much more, well, reflective.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c8860321052514314159 title="comment permalink">8/2/11, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

Only one of them directly deals with education, but I hope my brief annotations show the relationship of history, capitalism, and the American educational system in the last sixty-some years.<br><br>Fussell, Paul. <i>The Great War and Modern Memory</i>. New York: Oxford UP, 1975. Print.<br><br>Poetry professor Fussell won both the National Book Award for Arts and Letters and National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism with this study of World War I. It’s a tour de force example of the value of literature in historical analysis. I add it mostly because it leads up to his work on WW II below. Skip this one if you aren’t a history or lit buff. <br> <br>---. <i>Wartime: Understanding the Behavior in the Second World War</i>. New York: Oxford UP, 1989. Print.<br><br>Of this work by Fussell, Lionel Trilling wrote, “An original and brilliant piece of cultural history and one of the most deeply moving books I have read in a long time.” Since great literary critic Trilling was not given to excessive praise, I will only add that Fussell’s analysis of the negative impact of winning the war on the future of the United States makes this work a good lead-in to the works by Lapham. <br><br>Heilman, Robert Bechtold. <i>The Professor and the Profession</i>. Columbia: U of Missouri P, 1999. Print.<br><br>New Critic Heilman (1906-2004), chair of the UDub English department from 1948 until 1971, begins this collection of essays with personal memoirs that many might want to skip. However, the fifth section, a collection of essays titled “Education Examined,” provides a clear view of the shifts in teaching by outlining the three dominant schools types of “litcrit” that ruled and then fell during the 20th C. This section also contains “The Great-Teacher Myth,” his fairly well known rant by about the Robin Williams’ movie <i>Dead Poets Society</i>. <br><br>I’m biased here. Post Modernism was only a cloud on the horizon when I studied under him in the late 60s, but I now know he loathed PoMo even more than I. <br><br>Kohn, Alfie. <i>Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A’s, Praise, and Other Bribes</i>. Houghton: Boston, 1993. Print.<br><br>Kohn’s powerful analysis of the infectious powers of enthusiastic teachers and the lethal effects of rewards on the desire to learn make this, an actual book on education theory, well worth reading. When a cousin of mine told me about the problems her children were having in elementary school, I told her of this book. Armed only with a copy, she got the school to change their policies. <br><br>Lapham, Lewis. <i>Fortune’s Child</i>. Garden City: Doubleday, 1980. Print.<br><br>The longtime editor of <i>Harpers</i> and current editor of <i>Lapham’s Quarterly</i> argues that attitudes and riches that came to those born in America after World War II was actually our doom. My only criticism of the book is that Lapham chose not to include the subtitle on the dustcover: “A Portrait of the United States as Spendthrift Heir.” <br><br>---. <i>Money and Class in America: Notes and Observations on the Civil Religion</i>. New York, Ballentine, 1988. Print.<br><br>This work is less relevant than <i>Fortune’s Child</i>, but it illustrates the money obsession in America and how it affects the elements of American life, our educational system included. Besides, Lapham’s such a fine prose stylist I can’t help recommending just about anything else he’s ever written.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c1644133962613143022 title="comment permalink">8/2/11, 8:35 AM</a><br><br>

He knew the absurdity of recent "reforms" in education better than most. In a rust belt school with students pregnant, into drugs and gangs, from broke and broken homes, the least appropriate expectation is that a college prep curriculum would serve them best.

They're really not all that out of character, you know!<br><br>Tracy, what we've got in modern Druidry is what's been slowly reinvented since the revival began in the early 18th century. I know of one system of energy work that's part of one of the Druid lineages in which I've been initiated, but it's relatively fragmentary at this point -- the usual problems with transmission of knowledge in a minority faith. Beyond that, most of the Druids I know who are into alternative healing modalities draw from the same broad range of options as everyone else. <br><br>Houyhnhnm, I don't see it as a waste of time, just a difference of opinion. Of course there are broad social forces helping to drive the collapse in modern American education, but the specific forms taken by that collapse also deserve discussion in their own right, and that was the point of this post. <br><br>Georgi, you really need to learn something about the history of science and the ideologies that have grown up around science. What you're saying is simply not accurate; for example, it's well documented that scientific ideas have far more often been used to justify claims that humanity ought to dominate nature than to back up any sort of ecological sanity. Were you aware, for example, that the great majority of the opposition faced by Rachel Carson when she campaigned against DDT came from within the scientific community? <br><br>Rainbow, yep. <br><br>Adrian (A.F., thanks for the link!<br><br>Adrian (S.), I'm glad your children are getting a decent education. All the evidence I've seen suggests that here in the US, at least, that's an increasingly rare luxury. <br><br>Bill, the desperate scramble to "fix" things is all the more ironic in that, as I suggested a while back, I think most people know what they have to do to actually fix things, and it scares the stuffing out of them. So it's all a matter of displacement activity -- vote the scoundrels out because they won't (and can't) give us the future we ourselves have already thrown away. <br><br>Mageprof, I learned to read at the age of two, with the help of sound-it-out books not that different from old-fashioned spellers, and some help from my parents. I think you're quite right that the public schools may not be long for this world in large parts of the US; the question then becomes what will replace it. The survival of literacy seems crucial to me, and if it takes the reinvention of the old-fashioned speller, that's what it takes. <br><br>Isis, that's a complicated question that would require a very long answer! You're quite right that very little of my education took place in schools -- about the only useful things I got out of formal schooling were the ecology I studied at my first college and the Latin I learned at my second. As for the rest, well, Sartre's satire is funny, but the education someone can get by reading every nonfiction work in a small town library, patchy as it is, will still be a great deal better than the sort you'll get from modern school textbooks, since it hasn't been predigested and forced into the Procrustean bed of a contemporary sensibility. <br><br>I'll have to consider doing some posts down the road on post-leak education. Mind you, if there's a topic that will get me more hate mail than my suggestion that both sides of the US political spectrum bear roughly equal blame for the mess we're in, that's probably it!<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c3452564749618204745 title="comment permalink">8/2/11, 2:00 PM</a><br><br>

A culture is basically a group of people who all know most of the same set of stories. "The Courtship of Miles Standish" -- yes, I've read Longfellow's poem, and it's worth saving -- used to be one of those stories. Nowadays the stories most people know seem to be trashy sitcoms. Yes, I know, I'm showing my age -- and Longfellow was a man of his time rather than ours, and had attitudes a lot of people find uncomfortable these days. Still... <br><br>Kayxyz, no argument there. I'm not familiar with Montessori's methods, but they can hardly help but be an improvement on the current public school fodder. <br><br>Deepthought, that's interesting! I'd heard a little about the plagiarism scandal. Over here, politicians "write" books for the mass market. JFK started the fad with <i>Profiles in Courage</i>, which he didn't write -- a couple of Kennedy staffers wrote it for him -- and these days it's hard to think of a would-be presidential candidate from any of the last half dozen elections who didn't produce a book in the runup to the primary campaign. Word has it that all of them are by ghostwriters, and that there's a thriving little market for writers who can churn out 80,000 words of politically themed fluff under somebody else's name -- but it's not something of which I have any direct experience. <br><br>Bill, I'm less than satisfied with the terms myself, but they were the best I could come up with while writing the post. Neither relativism nor postmodernism are what I have in mind for reflection, and it's certainly not an art/science split, as you correctly noted. Perhaps the best way to talk about it is to note the difference between "book learning" and craft knowledge, while noting that book learning also has its craft dimensions; or to start from the distinction between those very useful French verbs <i>connaitre</i> and <i>savoir</i>. The distinction is one I'm still developing, and this sort of exploratory work is inevitably a bit muddy. <br><br>Houyhnhnm, thanks for the references. <br><br>Steve, unless something changes fairly quickly, I expect to see a lot of public universities shut down or consolidated in the next decade, precisely as a result of the trends you've outlined.

Quick and dirty research on etymologies of latin verbs for "knowing":<br><br>Fr. connaitre / Sp. conocer, from Latin cognoscere, from cum+gnoscere, more or less "to join in knowing" or "to know deeply"<br><br>Fr. savoir / Sp. saber, from Latin sapere, to taste! I had not really noticed the Spanish homonyms saber - to know vs. saber - to taste; if I thought about it I probably passed it off as being from a morphological convergence not from a true etymological brotherhood.<br> <br>So why is the same verb used for "to taste" and "to be wise?" According to my America Heritage Dictionary's appendix of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) roots... the element here is "sep-" which has a more general sense of "perceive." So you "sep" flavors and you "sep" the nature of the world. I suppose the Wise Person is one who has tasted many things?<br><br>Back to the cognoscere form of knowing... this root is borrowed from Greek, traced back to a widespread and pretty highly conserved PIE root, "gno-" translated as "to know." The co- prefix intensifies it, "to REALLY know." <br><br>So the one seems to refer to perceiving (being savvy), while the other seems to refer to comprehension (being cognizant).<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c9199836696457622224 title="comment permalink">8/2/11, 8:32 PM</a><br><br>

Insofar as this has affected the realm of education, we have a created a bloated and mediocre education system which is devoted to inculcating everyone with some semblance of a “comprehensive” education as they are dragged through the pipeline, after which they trickle out with a 4-year college degree. <br>But as we continue towards post- peak oil contraction, it will be interesting to watch the collision of liberal ideology with the hard realities of resource scarcity (with an elite most likely less willing to, and less able to accommodate this gross excess of modernity). In short, universal education, which is economically viable only in the most energy-abundant era, is rapidly on its way to extinction. <br>In my country of residence, Russia, universal education was (the efforts of a handful of liberal 19th statesman like Tolstoy notwithstanding), a Soviet project. Its aims, as you might imagine, were not to procure for the masses an appreciation of the subtleties of Aristotle and Beethoven but to create the next class of Party cogs. I am not sure that the American system is operating under an entirely different framework, minus, of course some of the more egregious forms of propaganda and indoctrination. <br> Russian education is currently in a state of crisis at least as severe as the one facing America. Bureaucratic inefficiency, unlivable teacher salaries, brain drain, corruption have all taken their toll. What has emerged, rather organically I might add, is a system whereby access to educational resources once again is falling back into the hands of the wealthier classes. Western liberals, of course, reflexively watch in horror at this abandonment of what is supposed to be a birthright. But the only recourse they can offer is more State intervention, more resources, in short, a continuation of the fantasy world. <br>Perhaps it’s time for a massive paradigm shift. Given the necessity for a political and business elite to emerge who can help America navigate the treacherous road ahead, and do so without mass starvation, Gulags, etc, perhaps it’s wiser to rethink the basic assumptions. And given the pathetic state of the American political elite, I have a hard time believing the problem is a lack of college degrees among the population, but rather the degradation of the elite itself whose manner of speech and behavior is shockingly similar to 1970s Soviet party apparatchiks.<br>The problem needs to be attacked on the level of values and priorities, and not the usual utterly superficial and worthless budget debates, i.e. where should we throw our money.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c8075414953222069224 title="comment permalink">8/3/11, 2:45 AM</a><br><br>

First, is that the seniors "completed" the course of education, and had been observed doing so. They were assigned to, and attended, those events and classes prescribed by those handing out the completion certificates. "Completed".<br><br>There is a perception of content of "education" that includes mastery of certain facts and skills, and a presumption that such mastery is represented by said certificate. That seems to be lacking, in too many cases. Thus, "completed" is suspect.<br><br>It is defining the prescribed set of skills and knowledge that seems to be what JMG calls "abstraction". Maybe.<br><br>But I think the alternative is not to correct the corruption of fiscal and intellectual foundations. Instead, the alternative is the trivium and quadrium -- training those with the grasp and aptitude to draw enlightening conclusions from the study of language and math, of history and science, of societies and cultures, and of people and their actions and interactions. Think of the equivalent of math's Calculus, expressed in philosophy, in studies of culture, government, and ethics.<br><br>That is, not training to prescribed skills sets as much as mastering fundamental skills <em>to enable</em> deeper understanding and to emphasize the difference between knowledge (abstraction) and wisdom. I doubt that this is what JMG refers to as "reflection", his description doesn't seem to fit what I think of as wisdom, and I have probably simplified, in my mind, past the point of usefulness.<br><br>Modern American schools seem much enamored of the knowledge needed by standardized tests; enabling wisdom in students is left as an exercise for the reader. Which is to say, in today's schools, not assigned thus deemed a "waste of time and effort" in goal-based schooling.<br><br>It seems facile, yet perhaps the trite movie "Accepted" presents a better education model -- sort of a "radical unschooling" mode of homeschooling, writ large. The outcome in knowledge and skills is less certain, but the possibility of wider-thinking adults, enabled to enrich their world (rather than merely enable "more of the same"), is modestly improved.<br><br>And perhaps the dichotomy of thought schools is the difference between knowledge (training), and wisdom (what education meant, once upon a day).<br><br>I confess, the only exposure I had to <em>savoir</em> was <em>savoir-faire</em> --<br> literally "know how to do"; to respond appropriately to any situation<br> -- From Wikipedia: <em>List of French phrases used by English speakers</em><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_French_words_and_phrases_used_by_English_speakers#S<br><br>Being that savoir comes from French, knowing when something is right or complete or true by seeking or adjusting until it "tastes" right doesn't come as a surprise to me.<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>Brad K.<br><br><a href=salvaging-learning.html#c2670583760876674185 title="comment permalink">8/3/11, 6:28 AM</a><br><br>
