It’s been a busy week for those of us who keep watch over the industrial world’s deepening tailspin, as politicians in the United States and Europe play a game of chicken using sovereign debt in the role traditionally filled by fast cars. The issue in the United States is simple enough: the most that either side is able to offer, given its political commitments, is less than the least either side can afford to accept, and the occasional turns toward demagoguery on both sides haven’t exactly helped. It’s still possible that some last minute compromise may be hammered out, but the odds against that are starting to lengthen, and if that doesn’t happen, the financial end of the federal government will start seizing up in about three weeks. It should be an interesting spectacle.<br><br>Europe is a more complex situation. Greece, the current poster child for sovereign debt dysfunction, did what poor countries so often do, borrowed in foreign markets far beyond its ability to repay, and now can’t meet its bills. Unfortunately the normal way to resolve such problems – defaulting on the debt – would bankrupt quite a few large banks in other EU nations, and these latter have put pressure on their national governments to stave off a Greek default. The problem here is that Greece is going to have to default sooner or later; the question is purely a matter of when The Greek government is in hock far beyond its ability to repay, and the austerity measures pushed on it by the cluelessly doctrinaire economists at the IMF have worsened the matter considerably by putting the Greek economy into a tailspin. So it’s simply a matter of waiting for the inevitable to happen, and the credit markets to go into spasm accordingly.<br><br>Mind you, the horrified utterances currently being splashed around the global media, claiming that default is unthinkable and unprecedented, are nonsense of the most blatant sort. Nations default on their debts all the time. Russia did it in 1998, Argentina did it in 2002, and both nations survived; most European nations, for that matter, have defaulted on their debts more than once over the course of their history, and bankrupted plenty of banks in the process – that’s where we get the word <i>bank</i>rupt, you know. Defaults have always been one of the inescapable risks of lending to governments. EU governments could get realistic about this, let Greece do what countries with too much debt normally do, and spend their time more usefully writing letters of condolence to the bank executives who will be out of a job shortly thereafter.<br><br>Come to think of it, it’s just possible that this is what EU governments are actually doing. The current flurry of handwaving and emergency meetings may be no more than a source of plausible deniability – we’re sorry, we did all we could, it was the fault of (fill in the blank to conform to local prejudices) that Greece crashed and took half Europe’s banks with it, blah blah blah. For that matter, it’s not completely beyond the bounds of possibility that politicians on this side of the Atlantic are playing a similar game. The US is up to its eyeballs in unpayable debts, loaded down with entitlements and international commitments that it can’t afford but that no elected official dares to touch, and lurching toward a default as inevitable as Greece’s but on an almost unimaginably vaster scale. Nearly the only way to get out of the resulting trap with some chance of national survival would be to trigger a run on Treasury bills, now, that will force a default on the national debt in the near future, when both sides can conveniently blame it on the intransigence of the other party and the perfidiousness of foreign lenders. It does seem unlikely that this level of public-spiritedness is at work in Congress and the White House, but I’d like to believe that it’s possible.<br><br>These latest consternations, in turn, provide all the more relevance to the theme I’ve been discussing in the last couple of posts here, the possibility of shifting over here and now to the salvage economy that’s already beginning to emerge outside the narrowing circle of scarcity industrialism. This week I’d like to bring up another dimension of that shift, and talk about one of the unspoken and unspeakable realities of life in a declining industrial society: the pervasive phenomenon of stealth inflation.<br><br>By this I don’t mean inflation in the sense in which economists use the word, the decrease in the value of money driven by the expansion of the money supply relative to the supply of goods and services. That kind of inflation deserves much better press than it gets; though it’s denounced by all right-thinking people these days, it’s one of the safety valves by which a capitalist economy’s tendency to produce excess paper wealth gets brought back into step with the actual wealth in circulation, the nonfiscal goods and nonfinancial services that meet actual human needs. It thus serves exactly the same role, in a much more subtle and flexible way, as the negative-interest currencies being proposed by would-be financial reformers these days.<br><br>Stealth inflation is a good deal less laudable. It’s the process by which the price of goods and services remains the same, while the value of what’s provided for that price diminishes. It’s sometimes done by decreasing quantities – most Americans over forty, for example, will remember the days when cans of soup and candy bars were a good deal larger than they are now – but far more often done by cutting quality. Sometimes this is a minor, even a subtle, factor; in other cases, it’s neither, and can quite easily become lethal in its effects.<br><br>A good example of the first kind came my way a while back when a friend, knowing I like to cook with cast iron pans, found an elderly example in a secondhand store for some absurdly small price and gave it to me. Because my wife has celiac disease – a severe enough case that relatively small traces of gluten can have unwelcome effects – I had to strip off the natural coating that cast iron cookwear gets when it’s well treated, and reseason the pan again, just as though it had been bought new. Even with this rough treatment, though, the old pan proved to be a much better piece of cookwear than any of the more recently manufactured cast iron pans I’d been using for a decade or so previously. Its inner surface has a much smoother finish, its metal conducts heat more evenly; this evening’s fried zucchini (fresh from the garden) was cooked in it, because no other pan I have does as good a job.<br><br>This isn’t simply a matter of chance or a personal quirk. Ask any cast iron aficionado and dollars will get you doughnuts – perhaps these days I should say “credit swaps will get you crullers” or something like that – you’ll hear a similar story; the cast iron cookware you can buy in your local hardware store simply isn’t as good as the same products made a quarter century ago, and the difference is no small thing. I’ve heard the same thing in the very different context of craftspeople who work with old tools; the quality of the metal, they say, as well as the workmanship tends to be dramatically better in tools that are at least a quarter century old.<br><br>In some cases the differences are enough to kill. One of the nasty little secrets behind the rising toll from food poisoning in the United States and elsewhere is that a great deal of it could easily have been prevented by common sense sanitary procedures that used to be standard, but have been cut for the sake of lower per unit costs and higher quarterly profits. What makes this all the more embarrassing is that this is America’s second encounter with what happens to the safety and quality of processed food in a capitalist system under economic stress; Upton Sinclair’s <i>The Jungle</i> probably ought to be required reading for the pundits, and there are many of them just now, who fatuously insist that government regulation is always and everywhere a bad idea<br><br>The same purblind mania for gutting sensible regulation that freed the banking industry from the Glass-Steagall Act and its equivalents in other industrial nations, and at a stroke brought back the devastating bubble-and-bust economics that dominated the industrial world before the Glass-Steagall Act was originally passed, has had equivalent effects in many other sectors of economic life. An acceleration in stealth inflation through declining quality is among the results. Still, there’s a deeper force pressing in the same direction, and it comes from the relentless mathematics of fossil fuel depletion and its impact on an economy founded on the expectation of constant growth.<br><br>There has been a great deal of talk recently on the leftward side of the economic spectrum about the need to “decouple” economic growth from increases in the supply of energy. Still, as Zen masters are wont to say, talk does not cook the rice; insisting that economic growth can continue while energy supplies are stuck in a bumpy plateau does not make it so. The production of real, nonfiscal goods and services requires inputs of energy, as well as raw materials (which must be extracted by using energy) and labor (which in America, at least, usually uses a fair amount of energy, too). The only goods and services that can grow unchecked as energy supplies flatline are financial goods and services – that is, “goods” that consist of the essentially arbitrary tokens our society uses to allocate real wealth, on the one hand, and “services” that consist of shuffling and exchanging these tokens in more or less intricate ways, on the other.<br><br>As the cheap abundant energy that provided the basis for three centuries of industrial civilization stops being cheap and abundant, then, one of the consequences is a widening disconnection between the production of nonfiscal goods and services and the production of money in all its various forms. Left to itself, the natural result would be a rising spiral of inflation in which the value of money declined steadily, to stay more or less in step with the amount of real goods and services available to buy. This natural result, though, is utterly unacceptable to the political classes – the people who take an active role in the political process – anywhere in the industrial world. <br><br>This has imposed any number of distortions on the global economy, but one of them is a constant push to keep the nominal rate of inflation as low as possible, thus sparing politicians the hard task of explaining to their constituents a reality that neither the politicians nor the constituents have yet begun to understand. That push drives the widespread juggling of economic statistics across the industrial world, but I’ve come to believe that it also provides an important motive force behind stealth inflation. Large corporations have plenty of interfaces with governments, and governments have plenty of levers by which to influence corporate behavior for political ends; if the politicians in Washington DC, let’s say, decided that it would be really helpful if businesses increased their profit margins relative to their costs by some means other than raising prices, it doesn’t seem at all unlikely that this preference would be heard in corporate boardrooms, and play at least some role in shaping their decisions.<br><br>What this means for the individual green wizard, in turn, is that there’s every reason to think that a good many of the goods and services sold to consumers are going to continue to decrease in quality in the years ahead. That in turn implies at least two things. The first is that the strategy of salvaging energy discussed in last week’s post has an additional advantage, because what’s being salvaged in a good many cases is not simply an equivalent of what’s on the market today, but a better product, one that tolerably often will work better and last longer than a new product of the same type. As we approach an age in which many goods may stop being available at all for extended periods, this is not an opportunity to ignore.<br><br>The second implication is that those who learn the skills needed to take older products that are no longer working, or no longer working well, and recondition them so that they can return to usefulness, may find themselves with a job skill of no small importance in the emerging salvage economy. It’s not too hard, for example, to find old handsaws for sale very cheaply at flea markets and estate sales. Fairly often, after being handed down through a couple of generations, these have rusted blades, teeth that are dull and bent out of their proper set, cracked and damaged handles, and the like. The steel of the blade, however, is very often of much higher quality than the equivalent new product in a hardware store today, and it doesn’t actually take that much in the way of skills and tools to remove the rust, polish the blade, reset and file the teeth, make a new handle out of hardwood and attach it to the old blade, and so on. The result is a saw that can be handed down for several more generations, and do a great deal of useful work in the meantime; it’s also a product that can be sold or bartered to craftspeople at a premium price.<br><br>In at least a few cases, it’s also possible to go one step further and figure out how to manufacture products on a small scale to old specifications. I don’t have anything like the metallurgical knowledge to figure our what makes the difference between my old cast iron pan and my newer pans, but the information’s surely out there, and could be tracked down by someone with the necessary background. Whether or not there would be enough of a market to make this a paying proposition anytime soon is another matter; there are odd little niche markets that might at least pay the bills. <br><br>Myself, having more facility with words than with metals, I’m contemplating tracking down a basic letterpress and exploring the honorable profession of Benjamin Franklin. The printing press with movable type was invented in the Middle Ages, after all, and very likely can remain a viable technology no matter how far down the slope of decline we end up sliding. Under current conditions, it can help pay its own bills via handprinted wedding invitations and the like; as conditions change and the complex supply chains that keep computer printers and copiers functioning become more problematic, a printing press powered by human muscle and capable of running on supplies no more complex than paper and homebrewed ink may turn into a serious asset.<br><br>Your mileage will unquestionably vary, and a second income refurbishing old items or using some outdated but sustainable technology will be the right choice for some people and the wrong choice for others. I mention it here partly because a good many readers of these posts have asked about potential businesses and income sources in a deindustrializing world, and partly because a fair number of people out there in the peak oil blogosphere don’t yet seem to have thought through the fact that they’ll need to earn a living in one way or another during the long slow unraveling of the industrial economy,<br><br>That unraveling may have its sudden jolts, to be sure. If the politicians in Washington DC and an assortment of European capitals fumble the current situation spectacularly enough, this autumn could see an economic crisis on the grand scale, with markets seizing up, banks shutting down, and governments facing abrupt replacement by legal means or otherwise. Still, we’ll come out the other side of it, no doubt poorer but still faced with the ordinary challenges of the human condition; if learning how to recondition old tools allows someone to barter for necessities during the years ahead, that’s a positive step, and such positive steps on the individual scale are the raw materials from which the deindustrial future will gradually emerge.<br><br>*********<br>On a related note, those of my readers who have been following <i>The Archdruid Report</i> for a while now will have seen me more than once pointing out that, challenging as the decline and fall of industrial civilization will doubtless be, it’s not the end of the world. With the help of an enthusiastic publisher, I’ve had the chance to make that point a little more clearly. This September, San Francisco’s Cleis Press will be bringing out my next book, <a href="http://www.cleispress.com/book_page.php?book_id=433">Apocalypse Not</a>, a wry survey of the apocalypse meme – the notion that sometime very soon, history as we know it will suddenly be replaced by a new osmos that just happens to bear a close resemblance to our favorite daydreams – and its role in inspiring the last three thousand years or so of End Times that weren’t. The Rapture, the Singularity, the prophecies of Nostradamus, and of course the upcoming 2012 brouhaha, among other things, all come in for discussion Though the subject’s a serious one, the book is a good deal shorter than my three peak oil books, and a lighter read as well. On the off chance that you’re interested, dear reader, it’s now available for preorder.

When giving workshops to people on buying a (low-end) used bike, we've been recommending they go for road bikes from the 60s-80s era over anything entry level you can buy new today, or indeed anything comparably priced that you can get used but made more recently. The decline in component quality is marked, with some of the parts on brand new department store bikes now lasting only a few months under serious use.<br><br>On the other hand, at the very high end of bicycle componentry, there have been <a href=http://www.fredericgrappe.com/media/revues/manipvelo.pdf rel=nofollow>measurable advances</a>. I don't know if the newer, fancier tech would cost more in relative money than the cutting edge of the 80s, but in any event it isn't really representative of what the average consumer has access to. It's an interesting comparison nonetheless.<br><br>On a completely different note, for kitchen knives, the Japanese have retained much of their tradition of quality in workmanship and materials. I own several, and I expect them to last me a lifetime. They also beat pretty much anything made in the West. <a href=http://www.japanesechefsknife.com/ rel=nofollow>This somewhat clunky website is a pretty good source</a>, representing a number of smaller family operations, some of whom can boast having been in the business for 15 generations or more...<br><br>(That would be an example I can think of where buying new would still be worthwhile.)<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c9102037900394704746 title="comment permalink">7/13/11, 10:46 PM</a><br><br>

Still it is now impossible to stop or unravel the mess that the industrial world is in on this front.

I totally agree and confirm that tools of all sorts have eroded in quality over recent decades. I think this is also partly influenced by a marketing strategy called "planned obsolescence" in which the "consumer" has to keep purchasing the same tool every few years (or maybe it's every few weeks?). <br><br>I would add that in addition to flea markets, estate sales and auctions - particularly at old family farms - is a great place to pick up all sorts of well made tools. In the case of estate sales, get there EARLY; There are now a few other people in this area who are catching on. <br><br>Many of the tools at these estate sales are from the pre electric motor day. As an example, I've found extremely high quality planes for woodwork for five dollars. Apparently no one knows what to do with these things and so they're viewed as worthless. I've seen comparable quality, high-end German made planes selling for $150 or more. (Yes, there still is a high-end, high-quality tool market, but it's not at Lowes - and be ready to pay a lot). So, huge bargains are out there if you're ready to scrounge. <br><br>Also, let me add that high quality older tools are not such a bad place to put some of that increasingly questionable paper money - if you happen to have some extra.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c1904058096894336795 title="comment permalink">7/14/11, 3:07 AM</a><br><br>

And indeed, there are fewer occasions for the kind of spiritedness that is called forth when we take things in hand for ourselves, whether to fix them or to make them. What ordinary people once made, they buy; and what they once fixed for themselves, they replace entirely or hire an expert to repair, whose expert fix often involves installing a pre-made replacement part.<br><br><br>So perhaps the time is ripe for reconsideration of an ideal that has fallen out of favor: manual competence, and the stance it entails toward the built, material world. Neither as workers nor as consumers are we much called upon to exercise such competence, most of us anyway, and merely to recommend its cultivation is to risk the scorn of those who take themselves to be the most hard-headed: the hard-headed economist will point out the opportunity costs of making what can be bought, and the hard-headed educator will say that it is irresponsible to educate the young for the trades, which are somehow identified as the jobs of the past. But we might pause to consider just how hard-headed these presumptions are, and whether they don’t, on the contrary, issue from a peculiar sort of idealism, one that insistently steers young people toward the most ghostly kinds of work.<br></i><br><a href=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft rel=nofollow>http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft</a><br><br>Here is a good page on cast iron Cookware:<br><a href=http://www.richsoil.com/cast-iron.jsp rel=nofollow>http://www.richsoil.com/cast-iron.jsp</a><br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c6527127645233724542 title="comment permalink">7/14/11, 6:30 AM</a><br><br>

Virtually nothing made today is either built to last or repairable - digital cameras, cell phones, computers, hifi gear - nothing. You buy it, it breaks after a couple of years, then its off to the landfill (very little gets recycled).<br><br>My source for most of the electronics I need is the local dump. In rural areas around here people bring their own trash to the local dump (urban and suburban people look at me in horror at the thought of doing this). At these dumps is an area variously termed the 'swap room' 'recycle room', or 'dumpmart'. People bring things here that they don't want but are still useable, and other people take them away and use them. Sometimes the things need fixing and sometimes they don't.<br><br>Of the many finds I have made here was a stereo tube amp I picked up a few years ago. It was made in 1959 and after being cleaned up a bit, worked perfectly. It sounds better than most amps you can buy today and, when I took a look inside, I could see that it had never been serviced or repaired - it still had the original tubes even! I was amazed.<br><br>My son has also taken up the salvage cause, recovering a 50 year old organ from the local church that was slated for the landfill. He's already repurposed one of the speakers and amps from the organ into a guitar amplifier, the better to deafen me and his mum.

Moreover, the newer machines were also configured to make losing a finger far more likely. We discussed how repairing, adjusting, or replacing a machine like this must have been a major chore when it was built (and still would be), so it was probably built to extremely sturdy and exacting standards: standards which are completely unfamiliar to nearly all of us in today's "gotta get a thinner TV" culture. It seems that, if one looks hard enough (which is not that hard), one would find old tools and appliances in many aspects of our lives that will be necessary during the descent, and that one could learn to make or repair without too much effort.

Thank you!<br><br>Planner, the flight from paper wealth to actual goods, if I'm right, will be the main driver of hyperstagflation in the decade or so to come. Since it's already catching on, anyone who wants to ride that wave needs to move fast. <br><br>John, most of the old tube-based electronics are sturdy and very effective -- transistors are cheaper to make and use, but in analog uses they're no better and often not as good as a properly chosen tube. As for organs, we inherited one when we moved to Cumberland -- it was under a blanket in the basement -- but I didn't part it out; I play it instead.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c1843813735193096405 title="comment permalink">7/14/11, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

We will all certainly need to develop such skills in the future when there won't be nearly so many buttons we can push that seem to make things happen.<br><br>Meanwhile, now that numbers in the 'billions' are everyday stuff, we are now being presented with the idea that 'trillions' of dollars are comprehensible and manageable things too. I suppose this can be so, but only if those trillions are imaginary numbers.

As a thought experiment, let's imagine a family wind turbine costs about the same as a family car. It doesn't actually have to be a wind turbine: it might be a fraction of a wind turbine instead, or a solar panel, or a combination of different things. The point is that a family-car-size outlay might purchase energy self-sufficiency. Is this possible? It is hard to say, but a family car is a big hunk of highly processed resources and technology.<br><br>Now, let's imagine that a war-effort economy develops in reaction to a crazy high oil price. In the Second World War around 30% of the British economy was shifted from consumption to war production, with associated rationing and austerity, over some five years. That would be in modern terms a diversion of some $130,000 per household. That is 5 family-car-equivalent units per household.<br><br>Could an oil price crisis trigger such a scenario? I think in a slow decline scenario the answer is "yes". The return on investment in 'new' energy would get so large and the incentive would be tremendous. The obstructive mythology of progress which you draw out so well: this is going to be debunked, by this stage. Great swathes of other activity could give way: fine dining; going on holiday; university education; taking showers; care for the elderly; etc etc. It is not nice but it may be feasible.<br><br>If it's so "easy", why didn't our great-great-great-etc-grandparents take a similar approach? We can start with: no knowledge of electricity; or the technique of mass production; blueprints for advanced energy technologies; or for that matter a huge installed base of manufacturing capital equipment! The technology really matters.<br><br>So that's it, that's bugging me - why can't such a war effort set us straight?<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c7094907832306014295 title="comment permalink">7/14/11, 10:45 AM</a><br><br>

They're usually fairly low-end, but only in the sense that they're the least you can get by with and still have a bike that will a decade or so if treated well. They get priced between around $200 and $400.<br><br>But a problem which the mechanics running the shop constantly face is with people coming to buy a bicycle (because they can't afford another mode of transportation), who've been conditioned by department stores to think that they can get a bike for $100 or less. You can buy a new bike for that, but such a bike is really not good for much else than throwing in the recycling (never mind the human and energy costs of its manufacture in China). <br><br>It's incredibly frustrating trying to convince somebody that a decent bicycle is worth at least a few hundred dollars, or that spending a hundred dollars or so a year on maintenance is normal. Even though that's a tiny fraction of the cost of a car's maintenance, insurance and fuel costs, or even for that matter the cost of a bus pass, it still seems to be too much.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c3590257258010875830 title="comment permalink">7/14/11, 11:11 AM</a><br><br>

This has taken months of planning, but he should be open for business this fall. Legally he can't sell his own excellent brew, but that may not be true forever.<br><br>Would stealth inflation also include having to pay more for the same better quality, longer lasting goods? I've noticed that some kitchenware manufacturers now have two or more "lines:" the original high-quality one that used to be affordable and is now out of reach, and the cheapened versions--same brand, just not as good, for what the originals used to cost.<br><br>Also, I think salvage could include handing down and inter/intra family barter.

A cooking fork - the kind I call a "threek" that is to my modern one what the skilliet I also scored is to a Walmart throwaway. It looks to last forever, too, unlike the one I have.<br><br>2) Vintage Griswold cast iron skillet, size 5 (next step up from the little one-egg one I got on Freecycle) - $30. The iron is as smooth as a baby's bottom. No, the roughness of modern cast iron is NOT a certificate of authenticity, any more than the crudeness of some hand-made pottery is. The website from which I copied and downloaded pretty nearly a chapbook on the subject said Griswold and Wagner are the best, and that back in the day they machined them smooth. But don't try it at home with the modern ones, you'll wear them too thin. AND I test-hefted the Size 5. Either I'm getting stronger, or it's lighter than the ones at Tru-Value Hardware. Anyway, yum, YUM, *YUM*!<br><br>3) Black lid, $1. Enameled, looks and feels sturdy and strong. Fits the new skillet. $1 lousy $1.<br><br>4) Hand can opener, the kind you jab the point into the can and jerk it around the inside edge. Lots of points - which is to say, all purpose cutting &amp; hole punching. $3.<br><br>5) Small tin measuring cup, $2. Now, why, you ask, would I want that. Now, let me see. The glass one from Walmart has the numbers - the very things that make it a measuring cup - just painted on the sides? And they're coming off? And being glass, you can't take it camping if you should so desire? But largely because the numbers on the tin one are stamped in and permanent. And you can see them at all times.<br><br>6) Lastly "Wagner Ware Kettle, $30." Which is to say, a 2-quart cast iron Dutch oven - which I also have no trouble picking up. Having read the bottom of the kettle, which merely says "Made in USA" so maybe "Wagner in a pig's eye." And the bottom feels rough, though how much of that is how it was made and how much just needs to be cleaned or burned off is anyone's guess. However ---<br><br>It's a cast iron Dutch oven of just the right size. It's pre-seasoned. (as is the new skillet) And unlike any other I've had or tried, I can lift it easily.<br><br>So --- did I make out like a bandit in the quality kitchenware department? Or did I not?<br><br>And without this blog post, I never would have thought to do this, let alone what to look for. <br><br>Merci mille fois!<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c1663888119150494342 title="comment permalink">7/14/11, 11:42 AM</a><br><br>

Depending on where one is, and the particular debt, resources, trade inbalances, employment, etc. of that place, it might certainly be possible to "grow their way out of debt".<br><br>The trick is that such "growth" cannot -and never really could be- the "unlimited growth" of too many capitalist's fever-dreams-as-theory.<br><br>Rather, the "growth" must be -from the beginning otherwise the tools will not be right for the job- merely Phase 1 of a multi-Phase plan culminating in something like a "steady-state economy" when the non-renewable resources are burned and gone.<br><br>If a country initiated such a plan, they would be able to temporarily ramp up usage of resources beyond where the markets or maximum sustainability (per resource) would dictate. This "excess" resource use would provide the "growth" that would pay-off the debt and set-up the low-energy, low-capital, low-maintenance systems that would allow a decent life during the inevitable energy and resource decline-to-stablization.<br><br>Two additional essential caveats here are:<br><br>1. The "plan" cannot and will never be cast in stone or planned down to the finest detail. It would be much more like "restoration" of a climax forest biome. The scientists can know much about the process, but not all. Nature must be allowed flexibility to work right.<br><br>2. The "steady-state" final Phase is the equivalent of that climax forest in that it will be undergoing constant local and regional break-down and renewal. Also, dramatic enough events -like major climate changes- can wipe the whole system out. Adaptation would still be necessary for survival.<br><br>Now, I don't expect even the relatively decent governments of the moment to do this, and it will take an increasingly unlikely effort on the part of people in such countries to elect governments that would.<br><br>But it IS possible, just very unlikely. ;)<br><br>-Matt.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c4127718288205929193 title="comment permalink">7/14/11, 11:50 AM</a><br><br>

I have a tendency to ignore my strong intuitions (I refrain from calling them visions), which I'm sure are born of simply paying attention and having a good sense of things. They serve me better when relegated to motivations rather than obsessions. That said, I have strong feelings about the first part of 2012. Think Spring of 1930, when the pain of depression really began to sink in. This assumes we make it that far. <br><br>I was going through some notes I found from early in our journey towards self-sufficiency, @1998, and found a rough list of goals I had set for completing some major projects. The two prominant dates were Summer 2001 and Summer 2008. I, of course, couldn't predict 9-11-2001 or the crisis beginning in 2008, I just had a sense of urgency regarding goals and these dates. While I take predictions with a grain of salt, and put little stock into prophecies or second comings, my little voice has been screaming pretty loudly as of late. My intuition tells me that we'll all be damn lucky to make it through 12 more months without the next big slide down, one that will be impossible to ignore for most. A black swan perhaps, or a convergence of things we are already seeing; some dark synchronicty. The tinder is getting dryer by the day....One can hope, pray for rain, though I've noticed the same quiet sense of urgency and purpose in many of those I've learned to pay attention to, including the Archdruid.<br><br>About that sense of purpose: I have just completed a long planned upgrade of our solar potable water system. A new SunPump (actually purchased <i>new</i> in '07!), a controller, repaired like new (swapped for some heavy 2/0 copper battery cable lugs), added a second PV panel (salvaged and repaired, diode) to my old Zomeworks passive tracker (from a scrap pile). All rewired properly, lubed, balanced and adjusted. Buzzing like a bumble bee, pumping about 2 GPM to the tank on (in) the ridge.

Yes, in their case, it was an advantage, because Castro and his inner circle of advisors were able to hammer out a coherent response, and those who disagreed their free to discuss the matter at length with their fellow political prisoners. Half the problem faced by the Western world just now is that nobody, anywhere, has enough clout to make the squabbling factions of the political class sit down, shut up, and buckle down to do what must be done. Mind you, I'd rather live in a democracy any day, but part of the price tag is poor response to certain kinds of crisis. <br><br>Robo, it's actually very simple. There are two rules I know that free up vast amounts of time for productive work. The first is not to own a TV; the second is to treat boredom as a luxury you can't afford. As for printing, what I have in mind -- given the other calls on my time! -- is something a good deal smaller and simpler than your sister's press; I'm considering a tabletop press of the sort that used to be made for hobbyists, perhaps a C&amp;P Pilot or equivalent, perhaps a Kelsey or clone thereof. That would give me decent printing capacity to bridge the gap until I can make arrangements with somebody with a serious professional-style press. <br><br>Tom, an energy shortage is still an energy shortage. Your wartime effort could probably make the transition easier, but it's not going to make the Long Descent go away, because we're still stuck trying to run a society indefinitely on a small fraction of its current resource base. Family wind turbines won't support a modern standard of living; neither will anything else, once the Earth's store of fossil sunlight has been depleted to the point of economic uselessness; and nearly all our current infrastructure will have to be scrapped, because it's designed around specific fuels and highly concentrated energy sources, which is exactly what we won't have in the future. Mind you, I think a crash program for national transition would be a very good thing, if it could be done; I have very serious doubts about the chances of making it happen; but it's a palliative, not a solution. <br><br>Nathaniel, have you tried hunting up another of the same model on the used market? <br><br>Kieran, I suspect the problem is that people think of bicycles as toys, not as all-weather transport. They'll figure it out. <br><br>Adrian, your brother will probably be a rich man, by the standards of the time, by the time the current round of crisis finishes unwinding.

I'm really looking forward to your next book. I have a strange feeling about 2012, not so much from a Mayan prophesy perspective, about which I know very little. But more just a sense that the stresses and strains in the system are getting too obvious to extend and pretend for much longer. Perhaps the election cycle will provide an opportunity for a "we aren't wearing any clothes" moment. Here's hoping, at least. Staring reality in the face and not flinching would be good for all of us.<br><br>On the topic of salvage, a racoon got a few of my chickens earlier in the week. I really miss them, especially the Speckled Sussex which had just started to lay. We've found a few replacements locally so all will be well. I gave them a respectful burial, but then a neighbor wondered why I didn’t eat them or use them to fertilize the garden instead, which would have been a remarkable act of salvage in a way. I guess I have a long way to go till until I’m really hardened for self-sustainability! John Seymour would have put them in the pot, I’m pretty sure.<br><br>Finally, I must admit that I'm still working on the "must stop needing to buy stuff" end of the spectrum. I grew up strongly in the "make do and mend" tradition, a fall-out from rationing and WWII in the UK; but somewhere along the last few decades my brain got rewired to go out and shop. Last year I switched to carting my own garbage off to the dump, which does tend to focus the mind on how much crap my family and I consume. I've almost kicked the shopping habit, but man it got hold of me for a while without me realizing it.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c4928219982624884188 title="comment permalink">7/14/11, 5:13 PM</a><br><br>

That's what we're telling ourselves everyday now. We've been clinging to the comfortable existence for far too long now, but it's time to make a move. Looking at homestead properties several hours removed from our current home, we're honing in on cleared acreage, soil types, annual rainfall, annual sunlight hours, water rights, solid-built older homes, root cellars, distance to cohesive small towns, etc., and, most importantly, affordability in terms of an all-cash purchase.<br><br>These places actually do exist, most surprisingly enough. It's just a terrific hunt to sleuth out the best candidate, and we're up to the task. Over the next 3 or 4 months we hope to nail the most feasible place down.

Yes, it's a crucial issue -- and you know, I bet if you went looking, you'd find some branch of the arts where you could be more than a spectator.

While skills directly related to actual physical survival are definitely important, I consider skills in the arts to be a practical skill too. Humans need art.

I am someone who has always loved doing various types of art, but I am uninspired by the direction of a lot of artistic trends, which is maybe why I didn’t have inspiration to get a degree in art, and have always just kept it as a hobby.

If you can get your local financial planner to have a few drinks he might just tell you what a big game it all is.<br><br>Starting about two years ago (just after the financial meltdown of 2008), several hedge fund managers that my company deals with started telling us that we should advise our clients to start thinking seriously about getting out of municipal bonds and into buying arable land, preferrably a safe distance away from the nearest big city. <br><br>At first I thought they were just being paranoid, but when they walked us through the numbers it became obvious that they understood early on that our whole economic system is going to collapse (not might collapse, or could collapse, but WILL collapse).<br><br>How that collapse will happen is the subject of great debate. Depression and deflation is what lots of people, including Mr. Bernanke, seem to fear the most, but it could go the other way just as easily. <br><br>The least politically painful way out of our current mess is to simply print money. Sure, it destroys savings, leads to hyperinflation, and ultimately results in massive social upheavals, but it doesn't require anyone to pay more taxes or accept cuts in their entitlements before the next election, or the next one after that. Thus the politicians get to keep their jobs for a few more years, or at least until the mob comes and stands them up against that proverbial wall...<br><br>Then the new government, which still owns most of our mortgages (through Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac), as well as millions of acres of federal land, can issue new money backed up by land (instead of gold or other commodities).

The cast iron pan I mentioned in my post was a run of the mill consumer item from a midrange brand, for example; the house I live in -- far sturdier than most modern construction -- was a Sears &amp; Roebuck kit house, like about a third of the houses in this end of town, thus far from the top of the line; and I could go on. For that matter, I've observed a sharp decline in quality in many, many products over the course of my own adult life, so I think there's something much more pervasive than survivorship bias at work. <br><br>Gordon, I grew up in Seattle with the art of the Northwest Coast First Nations everywhere, so woodcarving ranks well up there as an art in my mind, certainly. It's also an art that has a very high chance of being preserved, and can help other arts pull through -- have you tried your hand at musical instruments, for example? <br><br>Surface, I'll be discussing this in rather a bit of detail down the road a bit. I play mountain dulcimer, among other things, precisely because it's one of the most sturdy, easy-to-build, and low tech instruments you can find, and still makes lovely music. On the other hand, I'm a Wagner fan, and it hurts to know that there is zero chance that people in the future are going to experience anything like a good modern production of <i>Der Ring des Nibelungen</i>; once the living traditions of operatic performance, singing, and production die, as they will, all that can happen thereafter -- even if a complete score survives -- is a very rough approximation, filtered through the esthetic sensibilities of a different culture and time. More on this later. <br><br>Susan, that's fascinating to hear. I'd more or less assumed that hyperinflation followed by a new currency -- possibly modeled on the rentenmark -- would be a likely way out. The question in my mind is whether the economic crisis creates enough of a political backlash to overturn the entire system: a possibility that can't, I think, be easily dismissed. Glad you liked the books!<br><br>Don, you've just outlined in fine detail why my wife and I now live in a comfortable old house in a century-old neighborhood in a town that used to be a key transport center on the oldest major route linking the Ohio valley with the eastern seaboard. it's not that hard to do the math, once you start thinking in those terms!<br><br>Cathy, I've got both of the Darr books also!

You're right that the people in the upper end of government and business will do everything they can to keep things from falling apart; some of them, at least, have the brains to know that their wealth and authority comes from the system, and when it goes, any fifteen-year-old with a stolen gun has more power than they do. The core problem, I think, is that they don't grasp the real roots of the crisis and thus have no clear idea how to respond to it. They are where they are because they've utterly internalized the values of the existing order of things, and so the thought that our civilization is dying of too much progress has never entered their darkest dream.

The reason I suggest that it was possible then and not possible now is because as a society we have largely neglected our heavy manufacturing industries in favour of off shore production where labour is cheap.<br><br>Think about it, if resources are already scarce, how would a government even be able to undertake such a massive building program?<br><br>Also think about the skills and labour required to operate those industries. They're gone. Australia was virtually self sufficient in manufacturing up until the early 1970's. Not so anymore and the will power to retool is just not there.<br><br>Even if you acknowledge a scarcity of resources, how about trying to get your head around how 2% of the population produce food for the other 98%. This is not a sustainable situation in any way, shape or form without oil - historically 90% of the population was involved in food production. To do a massive war footing response would require resources to be taken away from agricultural purposes. Hungry people are very unhappy campers and very poor workers.<br><br>Hi Angus - By the way Cuban's lost on average 9kg and not 20kg during the special period.

It might actually buy some readjustment time which is probably no bad thing. It may also end up rebuilding communities and getting people back into agriculture. There is no nobility in poverty, but the outcomes do not necessarily mean a revolution and/or great change. People fear poverty, but what are we doing with our resources now, all I see is a lot of oversized vehicles and homes. Growing a garden, having some chooks is not necessarily such a bad outcome if it can be achieved across the board.

One thing we must get over is the idea that (as JMG has pointed out) the arts are to be practiced by a small, professional, tertiary-economy-backed, class only. <br><br>In 16th century England nearly everyone could and did sing, for pleasure and while working, and a large majority could sing parts in a madrigal. If you couldn't you were considered some kind of dolt. All kinds of people wrote (or if illiterate, composed) poetry. As part of everyday work, women embellished useful cloth items with fabulous embroidery. The list goes on. Much of this (though certainly not all) was simply part of the culture and not done for pay.<br><br>My personal test for which arts might survive would be: can you do it without electricity or modern manufacturing methods? Thus, synthesizer music, over-amped versions of rock songs and such things as movies and conceptual art involving beams of colored electric light would go. <br><br>However, to respectfully disagree with JMG, forms such as opera and chamber music might very well stick around and even be renewed in some way: The tradition rests in the pre-fossil fuel era (Medieval church music among other things) and there is a large class of cultural conservers already at work keeping it going (like my son the tenor).<br><br>What you can do with the human voice, unaided by electronics, is something few people today truly appreciate. And the training doesn't need any kind of technology at all. <br><br>You won't have Wagner on steroids, with massive fossil-fuel powered sets (as recently done in New York)--but remember, Beyreuth festival is in a small theater. Mozart operas were meant to be performed in small settings with few instruments: the productions we see today are bloated beyond what Mozart would probably have imagined (or maybe not). Having attended Mozart operas performed by young non-professionals in small theaters with basic orchestras and minimal sets, I can say that the experience is delightful.<br><br>Also, I believe, with Peacegarden, that there can be art involved in everything you do. It's not a question of "fine" art, only. That is a class-ridden concept that derives from the Romantic idea of the “artist as hero” and therefore special at the expense of the rest of us “average” folks. You can garden efficiently, but also artfully, and make your garden delightful as well as productive. Shaker furniture comes to mind, as well as those really good hand tools and smooth-machined cast-iron skillets we all appreciate (I have one too), as well.<br><br>The arts help make hard material circumstances bearable and even full of grace.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c1763021437291666930 title="comment permalink">7/15/11, 8:25 AM</a><br><br>

It separates the monetary and energetic components without getting too deep into theory or jargon of economics or the oil patch.<br><br> Energy return on energy invested, and the consequences for our industrialized world, can be conceptualized by looking at how many people a farmer can feed.<br><br> If a farmer can feed only himself then everyone is a farmer. If he can feed himself and another than half of society can be specialists* of one stripe or another. If he can produce enough food to feed ten people than 90% of the population are specialist. The number of specialists per capita is proportional to the surplus that farmers can produce.<br><br>*specialist: I don't mean to imply that farming is not a specialty, or skilled profession, or anything of the sort. What I mean is that farming produces a necessity and specialists produce niceties. (For the sake of this discussion the economy refers to goods and services from non-farmers. Food produced by farmers is a prerequisite, like air or gravity, that must exist before any economy is possible)<br><br> So, as a farmers yields increase the number of specialists producing goods and services per farmer increases. If on the other hand yields fall the goods and services provided per person decrease. The same logic holds for fossil fuels. If oil can be liberated from the ground at a low cost then only a small percent of the economic output needs to be employed in digging it up and the rest of the people and machines are available for other pursuits.<br><br> As the good resources are used up the economy starts to pursue the poorer quality resources that are smaller, more remote, and in worse environments. More time and energy are needed to produce from these resources. That cost comes out of the time and energy that was previously devoted to the economy, the goods and services we enjoy. <br><br> This is the energy inflation that we are facing. It means that the wealth society can produce per capita is going down. Adding prices, wages, and the money supply is unnecessary to understand energy inflation. What congress or the fed does about the debt and the number of zeros on our paper notes does have effects in the world of prices, but those effects happen on top of the energy inflation and they are powerless counter it.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c3342378858564313117 title="comment permalink">7/15/11, 9:27 AM</a><br><br>

We could have reduced working hours and produced a smaller quantity of high quality products.<br><br> I think that the frugal and industrious Americans that came of age in the depression and fought WWII had better sense than that. The depression era saying 'use it up, wear it out, make it do or do without' was supplanted by endless waves of advertising, advanced consumption oriented propaganda, for instant coffee and tv dinners. The best advertising circumvents ones reason and appeals to baser desires.<br><br> We created an industry that exists to override our higher principles by manipulating lower brain functions. It appears to have pervaded our entire society to such an extent that news media is meaningless sensationalized tripe, politicians are incapable of meaningful discussion, and our industry sells us cheap plastic garbage.<br><br> Important aspects of civilization, like social capital, that don't fit the mold of quick and easy have fallen by the wayside. I think that older gear is higher quality because Americans have forgot the important of quality. Quality is incongruous with the principles of advertising that have taken over.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c7313369096409537479 title="comment permalink">7/15/11, 9:50 AM</a><br><br>

Many small towns (especially in the PacNW) that have good water/river access have become tourist havens and retirement zones and are thus priced well above their true worth once the tertiary market comes back to earth...all else ignored, that would have to happen in another 10-20 years...the generation behind those currently in their late-60s to mid-70s don't have anywhere near the paper wealth to come in and buy up all the retirement houses, waterfront places, etc. as the former group gets put out to pasture (ie nursing homes). The financial crash will probably hasten that, but if not, I'd still expect prices to fall considerably in the tourist/retirement areas. <br><br>Unfortunately, the economies and everything else in the smaller towns are set up to survive on the retired/tourist funds, so there's much work to do to make the towns livable again for families and working (not just tourist service) class individuals. The infrastructure that's there is largely now replicas of big-box culture elsewhere, with some beautiful exceptions of course. Schools, parks, and rec centers are of course failing too and less people are able to raise kids in the areas due to no jobs/affordable housing. Will be interesting to see how it all plays out in the various small towns...<br><br>Of course, some areas never made much of the boom and may be positioned well for the descent.<br><br>I'm thinking Astoria, OR, Port Angeles, WA, maybe Mt. Vernon, WA, or some other coastal OR towns like Newport and futher south. I could see those returning to their blue-collar roots if corporate fishing/logging interests die under debt issues and things become smaller and more local.<br><br>In any event, it seems those who are willing/able to move in when times change will have plenty of work to do at all levels: city government, teaching, etc. All these towns that are set up for providing essentially entertainment to the old and visiting will need something else if they don't want to be ghost-towns 20 years from now.<br><br>I put a lot of my "gee, this could be a good outcome of the whole mess" type hope for the future in the re-purposing of those types of places. Not sure what my role will be in any of it, but its fun to dream that someday maybe I'll get to live in one of those small towns I love to visit and that I'll get to raise my kids in an area like where my wife and I grew up.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c1648697869622282894 title="comment permalink">7/15/11, 12:43 PM</a><br><br>

I just started reading <i>Founding Gardeners: The Revolutionary Generation, Nature, and the Shaping of the American Nation</i> by Andrea Wulf, and there is a gem of a quote on almost every page. For instance, in "Positions to be examined concerning National Wealth" (1769) Benjamin Franklin listed 3 ways a nation might acquire wealth: "The first is by <i>War</i>...This is <i>Robbery</i>. The second by <i>Commerce</i> which is generally <i>Cheating</i>. The third by <i>Agriculture</i> the only <i>honest Way</i>."<br><br>I find it comforting to know that our Founding Fathers and Mothers were dealing with many of the same issues that we are facing now: cash crops and raw materials flowing to England, manufactured goods coming back... Soil depleted, forests stripped during the Revolution to forge iron... When Franklin was in England protesting the Stamp Act, he saw what was coming and make "food security" a priority, shipping all kinds of seeds and saplings back to the colonies.<br><br>As I mentioned once before, I have been musing on our 250th anniversary coming up in just fifteen years. It's gratifying to discover that Washington, Jefferson, Adams, et al. were Green Wizards.<br><br>On a completely different subject, dog food: it occurs to me that down the road there will continue to be a supply of knackered horses. And you will be able to be able to make potted meat and store it for Rover. --And, honestly, dogs have no concept of "disgusting." When our neighbor gelded horses, the dogs ate fresh "oysters"--with antiseptic seasoning.<br><br>@Gordon. Don't worry if you don't have "talent." Artists need patrons.

Digging soil tends to destroy soil structure and expose all of the soil flora and fauna to the sun. You can also lose quite a bit of nitrogen to the atmosphere through the process of the bodies of the microbes breaking down - which is also the reason why it is a good short term strategy - plants use these dead resources. Long term though you reduce organic matter - it gets a little bit worse every year.<br><br>I recommend that you have a think about top dressing soils with mulch and compost instead and really reduce digging. I've noticed that people think that if they're not digging at some point it can't be proper agriculture. You don't see nature digging soils and for long term results you have to follow what nature does as best you can.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c7303583942443569705 title="comment permalink">7/15/11, 4:00 PM</a><br><br>

The problem with Wagner, though, is that his major works aren't something that can be performed by amateurs at all -- unlike Mozart, who was relatively forgiving of his singers and musicians, Wagner worked at the upper end of what 19th century vocal and instrumental music was capable of achieving. The first orchestra that attempted the score of <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> ended up giving up in despair, calling the thing unplayable, and the major parts in <i>Der Ring</i> will shred the voice of anyone who tries them without a lifetime of hard training and almost superhuman stamina. Once we lose the economic basis that makes it possible to support fulltime opera singers and the huge support system that trains, coaches, and works with them, as I see it, Bayreuth will go the way of Eleusis. <br><br>Susancoyote, I don't know if you were reading this blog when I last talked about dissensus.

This saddens me.<br><br>In the same way that many people in our society haven’t truly come to terms with their own mortality and the mortality of much of the society they’re used to, it feels as though people in our society assume works of art (and similarly also, achievements in scientific fields) to be immortal. Computer technology and the Internet help make it feel as though works of art will be preserved for all time. It is easy to mistakenly believe that one will be able to always find and watch films, scan through zillions of musical pieces online, and that zillions of recordings and digital images will always exist.<br><br>I would be interested to know if there are any artists whose works of art specifically address and explore the mortality of a lot of contemporary art as our society faces collapse. So many people currently rely on various forms of high-tech entertainment and art (that often reinforce popular and comfortable narratives) and I suspect there will be psychological dislocation in some of the populace if these sources of meaning are amputated from daily life.<br><br>In the past few years I have gotten into participating in Sacred Harp shape-note singing.

At one point there was a scene where they were all sitting in a bus which was passing row upon row of corn crops. Yeah, yeah, it's a bit geeky to notice such things but there you go. The point is, I hadn't seen that sort of agriculture before - we don't really have the soils for growing such large quantities of corn here.<br><br>There is a point to this - please hang in there.<br><br>I grow corn here and it's a heavy feeding crop. Really hungry - like no other crop that I grow.<br><br>It started me thinking, because I constantly see references in peoples comments saying this place has fertile soil, that place doesn't etc. <br><br>Well it kind of occurred to me that if they were producing the volume of corn that I saw in that brief glimpse year after year using industrial methods then that soil would be biologically as good as dead.<br><br>People may confuse the issue because they see current agricultural output and think that it's from really fertile soils, when in fact what was once fertile, is now, well kind of trashed and would take many years to begin to restore some of the original fertility.<br><br>The same types of issues arise if you try to grow large quantities of vegetables in a forested area - it's not easy. Fruit trees yes, vegetables no - unless you set aside specific areas for them and treat the soil very differently.<br><br>As a suggestion, it might be worthwhile having a post on the dependancies on industrial agriculture and its risks. Also in a similar vein, the Cuba solution keeps popping it's head up regularly and commenters keep mentioning how they transitioned across to organic agriculture without understanding the serious difficulties they had to face (I keep hearing, they did it, so it must be 100% too easy!).<br><br>Just some food for thought - no pun intended!<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c6830513465280752103 title="comment permalink">7/16/11, 2:51 AM</a><br><br>

I have several pieces of Revere Ware stainless/copper as old as I am, and a couple of heavy, commercial pans that I expect to last generations. They seem indestructable. I also value my heavy stainless mixing bowls, especially for canning and preserving, as stainless pots and bowls won't react to acidic foods and brines (think vinegar/tomatoes) like aluminium and, indeed, cast iron. My favorite bowl is over 20" in diameter, 12" deep, and gets used often for bread making, canning, large salads, etc.. I've had stainless pans get 'burned to a crisp', and with some effort, along with a good stainless scouring pad/powder, come back better than new.

My wife is (was) an accomplished potter who taught at a county art center for several years. While she hasn't thrown a pot for perhaps a decade, I'm trying to get her to renew her interest, as she needs the creative outlet, if nothing else. I actually built her an outbuilding for a studio about eight years ago. Alas, It has become a storage unit for her kids' 'stuff'. This will change soon. If I can get her a basic setup in place, I'm sure her nose will be back to the wheel in no time. <br><br>She is used to working with modern electric kilns and wheels, though she has some practice on old, manual kickwheels. We certainly aren't going to fire pots electrically, being offgrid, but neither did the potters of old. I'm looking at wood-fired kiln designs in hopes of building one soon, and an electric potter's wheel is doable with PV, though I'm also looking for a nice kickwheel, or a good design I can construct.<br><br>While digging our irrigation pond near the garden, I encountered a layer of beautiful blue clay around two feet thick, about four feet under the surface.

Well, we need to keep in mind that feeding the people wielding the scythes is the WHOLE POINT of agriculture in the first place. The mowing crews being fed off the fruits of their labor is not a drain on the system, it is the success if the system. We are rather entrenched in a pervasive market-based, commerce-based view of agriculture and its yields. We have to remember that the primary purpose of agriculture is to feed people, not generate wealth.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c3349867522678749418 title="comment permalink">7/16/11, 9:18 AM</a><br><br>

I'd encourage you to learn Spanish, if you're not already fluent in it, though, and to cultivate good relations with the local Hispanic communities; you're in the probable path of serious migration from points south. <br><br>Cherokee, the standard First Nations trick for corn was to throw a dead fish into the ground, then hill up the soil over it and plant corn, beans and squash in the hill. That way you replenish the soil. Yes, industrial cornfields are practically rock dust after a few decades; it's going to take hard work and time to restore those soils. <br><br>Mustard, this is why I don't recommend using any manure but your own -- and generally why I don't recommend supplementing soil with anything but homebrewed compost made from your own garden waste, kitchen scraps, fallen leaves, and bodily wastes. There's just too many toxic chemicals in circulation these days. <br><br>Laney, if the clarinet's of any quality, she'll be able to pass it on to a descendant in her will, and it'll still play. The one thing she's going to have to figure out is how to make reeds, which musicians used to do themselves in preindustrial times -- back into the Middle Ages, in fact. Once she gets that worked out, she can plan on playing that clarinet into the far future; it's a lovely instrument and worth saving. <br><br>Ghung, good sturdy stainless is another thing worth finding and saving, no question. As for pottery, preserving that is crucial -- I keep on thinking of post-Roman Britain, where pottery had been imported from Gaul for so long that nobody was able to figure out how to make it any more. <br><br>Bill, thanks for the link -- and another good point.

I have purchased a new shovel (forged, from AM Leonard) in the near past that is of excellent quality, but I paid dearly for it. I guess it ran about four times the cost of a stamped POS one could get at a box store.<br><br>My thought about old tools though was that perhaps not all were of surpassing greatness, rather that time has winnowed out the crap. I think it's entirely possible that a significant percentage of tools produced back in the day were of low quality, and they have disappeared, never to be missed. Tools of higher quality metal and craftsmanship would generally have a greater propensity to last... No matter how it comes to be, I agree with the general thrust of the post.<br><br>My second thought is about "stealth inflation" relates to food quality. It was amply demonstrated many decades ago (like in the 20s and 30s) that pushing the potassium levels up (to 5% or more of the cation exchange capacity) in food growing soils makes for a higher carbohydrate, lower protein crop. Crops grown on such soils can put on huge tonnages/acre because most of the photosynthetic activity goes to storage. Protein synthesis forces plants to use up a lot of the sugars the make and thus reduces the "yield per acre", even though the nutritional quality of a "lower yielding" plot is far, far better. Since farmers are generally paid for the size of the crop as opposed to the life-supporting quality, guess which way most farm soils are pushed?<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c1266578586326959915 title="comment permalink">7/17/11, 5:04 AM</a><br><br>

No microbes, no worms, no humus, just dead and waiting for a dose. To call it rock dust is to insult the true glacial mineral powders so desperately needed by these very grounds upon which our society parasitizes itself.<br><br>And with over 90% of the population NOT growing food, not many people are engaged in re-building soil fertility, not many people keep animals for agriculture anymore, stuffed as they are on feed-lot carcasses.<br><br>So where are the sources of manure? Usually elsewhere, and must be salvaged like all good tools orphaned and alone. Usually it's some rich lady's pet horse or two, stranded in a beat paddock. The problem now is that those pastures are so played out, the horses are not getting the minerals they need, thus more susceptible to heart-worm, so here come the heart-worm meds, the vermifuges. Which linger and kill the earthworms which you want in the manure. <br><br>Finding a pile of horse manure with bio-integrity is quite a score. Folks aften glance in my truck and ask, where did you get the manure? And I'm always vague and never say exactly which stable. <br><br>I think we're going to have to import organic matter and manures in order to build up fertility as fast as possible, which doesn't happen all that fast after all. And all the while growing the legumes and composting all available organic matter at hand.<br><br>But I just don't think it'll be enough to use ONLY what is immediately at hand... Building alliances with animal owners now is no bad thing, because I'll betcha they pay zero attention to what comes out, only what goes in. <br><br>To me, that is the essence of green wizardry; taking a pile of liability and alchemizing it into an asset.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c8250628786429433934 title="comment permalink">7/17/11, 6:23 AM</a><br><br>

Non sailors tend to underestimate the size of the Pacific Ocean. Things really are bigger in the west (crude regional jab). About 6000 miles wide. Now, given the direction of the North Pacific drift or Kuroshio current, _eventually_ things get here from Asia. Under _Sail_ it takes about 5 to 6 weeks. Drifting takes a lot longer. Broken down asian fishing boats have arrived here. The crews have always starved to death. For a substantial number of Asians to get here alive they will need at least a month's worth of food and water, sailboats, or enough fuel for current ships or fishing boats. I think by the time the food crisis in Asia is that advanced that none of these resources will be available. Hence, we will be salvaging the wrecks, burying the dead, taking in the few survivors as farm hands or marrying them. I don't think it will make much of a demographic change, and have no political effect.<br><br>I don't think will be importing any weapons from the U.S. We have arms manufacturers here in the West. We may have to start a few factories for ammunition. I do live near a large military ammo depot, which is somewhat worrying. If there is a complete federal political collapse some self styled "humongeous of the wastelands" may decide to take it over. The local city and county may have to provide a militia to protect the ammo, using some of said ammo to do so. In which case there'll be draft of men, and at least food taxation to feed them.<br><br>"Cascadia" will be separated from "Alta California" by the buffer state of "Jefferson". These mountaineers of Southern Oregon and Northern California, will like the Kurds of Asia, engage in smuggling, spying and guerilla warfare.<br><br>Bill Pulliam, I am in complete agreement regarding neighbors and community. Fortunately, we have good ones in both cases. We live in "schooner central", a small neighborhood of South Marrowstone Boat Hippies. In addition, the entire Island is very close knit and cooperative.<br><br>I'm descended from the people who kept moving west; from the plains of central Asia, to Europe, to North America and last, to the Pacific Coast. But here, I stop, and stand with my neighbors.<br><br>Glenn Woodbury<br>Master of the<br>Sloop - Boat<br>FEATHER<br>and the<br>Terror<br>of<br>Scow Bay<br><br>Marrowstone Island<br>Jefferson County<br>Washington State<br>Former USA<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c6826065593283757923 title="comment permalink">7/17/11, 11:24 AM</a><br><br>

Let me introduce myself and pose my biggest question;<br>I have had serious reservations about the status quo since the 70's and have been supported by it as well as dropped out of it many times since.<br>By training, I'm an engineer and technician and until last year worked as a handyman. At present I'm a technician at a company that makes motor testing equipment. By habit I fix, build and yes, salvage things. My New England heritage gives me a legitimate excuse to avoid throwing things away, or pick up repairable things from the sidewalk. I could easily jump right into a career in the salvage economy.<br>We live in co-housing in Colorado and are gardening and sharing in the chicken duties, so you can check off some community and subsistence points.<br><br>The question: Because of its dryness, I see Colorado as a poor location to settle for the long descent. Any suggestions for a better location are very welcome.<br><br>My initial thoughts are someplace east for the moisture. Someplace with a vibrant small-agriculture community might be good. Someplace where people are in the habit of civility.

I live in a small rural town, in a small rural county half way between Portland and Seattle. And, if all goes well, will move a bit further out to the east part of our county. Away from I-5 and up from the more frequently flooding valleys. <br><br>Since I'm pretty old (62) I don't think I'm going to have to worry much about invasion from Asia or, a Hispanic invasion from the south. Also, I'm almost an orphan. So, no worries about progeny. <br><br>Judging from some of the high feelings over the topic, I think regionalism is alive in well in these United States. Well into the descent, we may fracture into the "Nine Nations of North America." <br><br>As far as defense goes, we may ask for help in defense, and get the same reply the Brits did, when the Roman Empire began to unravel. "Look to your own defenses." And, we will. I think we're all ready well down that road. There's always been a lively subculture of self defense (ie: gun nuts :-) ) <br><br>Actually, as far as real estate prices go, it depends on where you are. Olympia, our state capitol is 30 minutes up the freeway. Here you can get 3 times the house and land at a third of the property taxes then in and around the capitol. I think I saw an article recently where the median house price here had fallen to $120,000. <br><br>There's a retirement town, south of us where you can get houses with good sized lots for $45,000. It's an old mill town, so the houses are tight little bungalows that were built in the teens and 1920s. And, the prices continue to fall. <br><br>We can't predict the future. We can make guesses (which, will probably turn out to be wrong.) It just all depends on how far and how fast the descent goes. <br><br>But, this is the choice I've made. And, I can't get along without my rain. All though, this year the weather is making even me a little twitchy. It's overcast today with temperatures in the 60s. We had rain last night. It was cold enough last night that I threw another blanket on the bed.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c4623173289479800003 title="comment permalink">7/17/11, 1:41 PM</a><br><br>

On a farm scale, it's more challenging, though there again all depends on size.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c8333507692569637464 title="comment permalink">7/17/11, 3:29 PM</a><br><br>

First, a huge amount depends on the personal equation, and second, none of us knows exactly what the future can hold. Myself, I wouldn't move to Colorado for love nor money -- water issues are only one of several factors that may get very difficult there -- and chose to move to a small town in the Appalachian end of the Rust Belt, where land is cheap, the cost of living is low, rail transport has some chance of survival, and the likelihood of being able to grow food into the indefinite future is pretty high; still, that's my choice, not a universal one. <br><br>I'd encourage you to sit down with anyone else who's going to be involved in a move, make a list of what you want in a place to live. Then make another list of things you expect to happen in the future, and mark the latter on a cheap disposable US map -- here's where the next Dust Bowl is forming, here's where the civil war between Anglo and Hispanic populations in the Southwest is likely to start and here's as far as the violence will likely spread, sea level rise will reach to here, there will be too many starving people here and here -- and back it up with research as appropriate. Factor in all the rational factors, and don't neglect the irrational ones, either -- intuition is the way the mind synthesizes impressions too subtle to come to consciousness. At the end of the process, you'll likely have several locations in mind; visit them, make your choice, and act. You'll want to do it quickly, though -- we really are a lot closer to crisis than most people have begun to guess. <br><br>Glenn, oh, granted, the Cuban government was smart as well as autocratic, and paid attention to what was working. It's one of the advantages of autocracy that it can do that, if the autocrat's canny enough. <br><br>Lewis, ultimately that's what it comes down to -- where do you, personally, choose to make your stand? There's no one right answer for everyone; for a variety of reasons, though I was born and raised and spent most of my life on Puget Sound, and my great-great-grandfather and my only child are both buried on the same small island there, that wasn't the place for me, and the north central Appalachians is. You pays your money and you takes your choice, and the wheel starts to spin.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c3659542462433225324 title="comment permalink">7/17/11, 3:36 PM</a><br><br>

Pre-fossil fuel (pre-metallurgy!) even the low deserts and the high arctic were successfully inhabited by stone-age agrarians and hunter/gatherers to some extent. Only the absolutely coldest or driest areas are entirely uninhabitable (though you may need to migrate seasonally in some places).

Alot of things seem to be in place for us to see through these changing times at least fairly comfortable. BUT... we still have the dream of selling this house and making good money off of it (economy? hymmm...most of our friends think we can get double what we paid for it, but maybe not at the present moment) and buying some land and building a modest size home smaller than what we have now out of cob or useable discarded lumber. We want our mortgage GONE, and replaced with a home we own ourselves, even if it's twice as small. We have also considered living in a huge barn somewhere, fixing it up, and doing our thing 30 miles outside of our present 110,000 populated little city we reside in at the moment. I'm currently researching solor panels and water collection techniques and filtering. I have alot to learn. There is plenty of fertile land not far, affordable , and we really want to make a move for country living.<br><br>I'm 40 years old and REALLY want to be off the grid in a couple years for good. I feel we are half way there having eliminated all our bills but the mortgage, and am starting to see a better life for us in the near future. The problem I'm having though is feeling like right now might not be the best time to jump ship and start this life altering process!? Will we get stuck in the middle? Maybe we can't get the best $$ for our home due to the times. Will things get worse before we can finish building a new home and it becomes very difficult to get supplies?? Is it best to sit tight and be happy we can get by with a small garden, easy foot travel to close friends, and be closer to the city? We live in Southwest Louisiana, and to be honest , as lovely as our downtown historical little neighborhood is, just 2 blocks down the road is another section of town with alot of suspicious foot traffic and plenty of drugs and crime. I can't see it getting better anytime soon, and when times get rougher, I feel we we'll have more to deal with than just car burglaries and down and outs needing beer money. People's homes are getting broken into NOW. We have two dogs and an alarm, but people will do what they have to do to survive! <br><br>So, we talk of country living and a simple off grid existence not far from here, it's always been our dream. Just don't know if now is the time to go for it, or just hold the fort down and see how things unfold first. I am optimistic overall, but I'm also a realist, and this potential "move" is really the last one I want to make for a long term lifestyle.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c1748479251728687005 title="comment permalink">7/17/11, 6:32 PM</a><br><br>

The pioneers basically hated the rich, Eastern Establishment bankers who ran everything. <br><br>I was born and raised here in Northern Illinois, and I hate the rich, Eastern Establishment bankers who run everything, too. Everybody around here hates them.<br> <br>And the rich, Eastern Establishment bankers hate us. We’re in “flyover country”. We’re irrelevant rubes. We only exist so that they can steal our hard-earned money. <br><br>Glenn said:<br>“There you have it, my cultural prejudices.”<br><br>It appears that we may both share a cultural prejudice against rich, Eastern Establishment bankers. (Is it really a prejudice? Or do they fully deserve our disdain?)<br><br>About Mexican immigration:<br><br>Immigration from Mexico is slowing. But that’s only the peaking of the first wave.<br><br>When my wife and I lived in the country, we had some spare rooms with bathrooms, so we rented them out. Over the years, we rented to a number of people, including three Mexican immigrants who were fairly typical: healthy, young-to-middle-aged men who moved here to work hard and send money back to their families in Mexico.<br><br>Since jobs are drying up, that type of immigrant is getting scarcer.<br> <br>But I’m afraid that the next wave of immigration may be very different. Mexico has only been surviving because of the Cantarell oil field, which is way past peak. Mexico is eating oil, just as Asia is eating oil, just as America is eating oil. As the oil ratchets down, the competition for food will ratchet up.<br><br>As Mexico slides down into chaos, it won’t be primarily healthy, young-to-middle-aged men coming here to look for work - it will be entire families coming here to forage for food. That’s a much more desperate scenario, because they will have nothing to go back to but starvation.<br><br>Glenn said: <br>“I envision a region from Eugene, Oregon to Juneau, Alaska, and up the Snake river to Idaho; linked by waterborne trade, with British Columbia as the center.”<br><br>I think that the Pacific Northwest region has a good chance of working. The climate is favorable; the soils are good; you’ve got hydropower; you’ve got water transportation routes along the coast and up the Snake.<br> <br>My main concern is political/military. <br><br>In the 1860’s, why was the Union so obsessed with building a transcontinental railroad when it was fighting a hugely expensive war to keep the South in the Union? <br><br>The Union understood that without a land communications link with the West Coast, the West would inevitably become a separate nation. Frankly, the Union had seen the results of political/military disunity in Europe, and didn’t want a political/military competitor on the North American continent. (Note to GHung and Bill: Sorry, guys, but I think you’re stuck with us obnoxious Yankees for a while longer. Our self-preservation takes priority over your self-determination, you know.) <br><br>They wanted to build a nation that would be secure against military attack – and that requires a certain critical mass.<br><br>You already anticipate that war-like “Kurds” are going to be on your southern border. What happens when you get a chain reaction like the successive outpourings of barbarians from the Asian steppes two millennia ago that eventually wiped out Rome? Conditions change, and one band of nomads pushes another band out, which pushes another band out. <br><br>If immigration from Mexico pushes against the “Kurds’” southern flank, the “Kurds” won’t go west to starve in Asia.

First, eliminate any areas that will be too wet, too dry, too violent, too crazy, etc.<br> <br>Get information from a wide variety of sources, as a reality check.<br><br>For example, James Wesley, Rawles at SurvivalBlog.com (a very heavily-visited site) favors an area which is the exact opposite of what some other people (like JMG and I) would recommend; namely, the Northern High Plains and the Northern Rockies.<br> <br>James Wesley,Rawles states, “I suggest calling it The American Redoubt. I further recommend Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, eastern Oregon, and eastern Washington for the réduit. Some might call it a conglomeration, but I like to call it an amalgamation, since that evokes silver. And it will be a Biblically-sound and Constitutionally-sound silver local currency that will give it unity. I am a separatist, but on religious lines, not racial ones. I have made it abundantly clear throughout the course of my writings that I am an anti-racist. Christians of all races are welcome to be my neighbors. I also welcome Orthodox Jews and Messianic Jews, because we share the same moral framework. In calamitous times, with a few exceptions, it will only be the God fearing that will continue to be law abiding. Choose your locale wisely. I can also forthrightly state that I have more in common with Orthodox Jews and Messianic Jews than I do with atheist Libertarians. I'm a white guy, but I have much more in common with black Baptists or Chinese Lutherans than I do with white Buddhists or white New Age crystal channelers.”<br><br>My personal opinion is that if “The American Redoubt” ever gained political traction, it could be one big religious war-in-the-making – or at least a tiny religious war between the few emaciated survivors who didn’t starve to death.<br> <br>But your mileage may vary.<br><br><br><br> Joeln said...<br>John,<br><br>I have been reading you for a some time now.

Any suggestions for a better location are very welcome.<br><br>My initial thoughts are someplace east for the moisture. Someplace with a vibrant small-agriculture community might be good.

One of the reasons the natives of what is now California had several very rich, yet peaceful cultures was geographic isolation from their more warlike neighbors that wasn't ended until Spanish horses and ships arrived. The Siskiyou mountains and the Southern Cascades still provide a substantial barrier between the fertile Central Valley of California and the fertile Willamette Valley of Oregon.<br><br>Should Alta California move militarily against Jefferson in a move to acquire the Willamette Valley (most of the area in between is not very good farmland in general), I assume Cascadia would be supplying Jefferson with arms and munitions, and perhaps troops. Maybe even a flanking naval attack on the Ports of Alta California.<br><br>Leaving potential future smaller nation states out of the deal, a volkwanduring might undergo a similar process.<br><br> One might remember that the Spanish and their Mexican heirs settled more of the Southwest than California, and their culture was, with a considerably lower population level, more sustainable in the area from Texas to Nevada. Their motive to move north for prime agricultural land may be less than you think.<br><br>I certainly agree that such cities as Las Vegas, Pheonix, Tuscon and the like will see an outmigration or severe die-off. There isn't enough water in the Colorado basin to keep supporting them. The intermountain West is certainly going to have a considerable population reduction. Some will go East, others West. A few will stay, ranchers, hunters and trappers. Far fewer than today.<br><br>I agree with Don about history, but not the future. The U.S. will have no choice about whether or not to "retain" the Northwest once transcontinental transportation is expensive and rare. We will "go it alone", but not alone. We will certainly join with what is now British Columbia. Whether or not California will be part of Cascadia (unlikely I think) or becomes Alta California (more likely) remains to be seen.<br><br>The end of cheap oil in Mexico might not trigger emmigration if we don't have any cheap oil here either. I don't know enough about the state of Mexican agriculture to say whether or not arable land will be an incentive to move. If so, we might welcome them. We have 300 million people in the U.S. If 100 million Mexicans came here, my family could take in 1. If every family did the same, it could work.<br><br>That last would require human nature to be _much_ more rational than history shows it to be, but I've seen less rational proposals on this site...<br><br>In reality, I think a good deal of the reversion to a Hispanic Culture in Alta California and the Southwest U.S. has been underway for many years, and will continue. At the point where the U.S. can no longer hold on to the West Coast we may find that Cascadia and Alta California are already in existance and that California is as independant of Mexico City as Cascadia is from Washington DC.<br><br>Glenn Woodbury<br>Master of the<br>Sloop - Boat<br>FEATHER<br>and the<br>Terror<br>of<br>Scow Bay<br><br>Marrowstone Island<br>Jefferson County<br>Washington State<br>Former USA<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c6300380849680705765 title="comment permalink">7/17/11, 10:34 PM</a><br><br>

(For example, many of our neighbors here in Rockford are shooting at each other; but fortunately, for the most part, they are terrible shots.) But great neighbors cannot offset the damage to the neighborhood if the region turns into a Dust Bowl or disappears under the waves of a rising sea level.<br> <br>Do we want to encourage people to invest in an area that appears likely to be facing severe problems with long-term habitability?<br><br>As a society, we make a qualitative judgment about land that is unsuitable for human habitation. <br><br>For example, on a micro level, we have flood plain maps that ban constructing a residential building in certain flood plains. As a society, we’ve had too many disatrous problems with residential buildings in flood plains.<br><br>We also do that on a macro level, such as when an expanding United States of America made the Louisiana Purchase.<br><br>We bought a huge tract of land from the French, and then sent Lewis and Clark off to find out what exactly we had just bought, and which areas would be most suitable for settlement, and which areas would not. Then we guided investment capital (railroads, Army posts to exterminate the current inhabitants, etc.) towards the areas that we believed were best suited for settlement, and withheld investment capital from areas that we believed were least suitable for settlement. And the areas we invested in grew rapidly, and the areas we withheld capital from did not.<br><br>Now we’re doing the reverse: an overextended United States of America is trying to figure out which regions are low-quality and unsalvageable, and therefore capital investment will have to be withheld, and these areas will consequently be de-settled; which would permit the limited remaining capital to be directed towards the high-quality regions that we believe are still salvageable. <br><br>We're performing regional triage.<br> <br>So for me, the regional triage list is (from most salvageable to least):<br><br>1) Rust Belt<br>2) Southeast<br>3) Great Plains<br>4) Northwest<br>5) Rockies<br>6) Southwest<br><br>Your mileage may vary. (But hey, Bill, you’re in #2, and real, real close to #1. You're not in the next Dust Bowl, you won't be submerged... On a micro level, you've even got good neighbors who aren't shooting at you.

I lived in the PNW for a time and my son is still there, but, for various reasons, I wasn't quite compatible with things. Firstly, I had a tough time with the much shorter days of winter and overall reduced sunshine. Further, there were social and cultural differences (that I couldn't quite put my finger on) which would have required a lot of time and energy to adapt to. When in Rome, do as the Romans do, or leave. A sense of belonging is important to functioning well in an environment...a sense of 'place' takes time. Seattle and NYC are great places to visit for this southern-raised boy.<br><br>For many reasons I like to think that the Southern/Mid Appalachians can't be beat, for it is truley (even after centuries of exploitation) a cornucopia of life: Great rainfall, soil, climate, flora/fauna,, and these mountains are naturally subdivided into biologically and culturally diverse regions, which I believe adds resilence to the whole. This area has been described as one of the most biologically diverse ecosystems on the planet.<br><br>That said, many folks aren't compatible enough to dwell here. The same cultural differences and prejudices some have described above apply, and the shear biological density overwhelms some folks. A good friend, who loved the area, had to move back to the desert Southwest due to allergies and insects. Her body was rejecting the environment (or perhaps the environment rejected her). It was ironic, since she came here to study the amazing pharmacy that is our forests.<br><br>There can be a large overhead involved with suddenly changing ones location, well beyond the financial. Re-establishing social bonds and enculturation, adapting physically, learning all of the nuances of life that locals take for granted, all take time and energy. Some folks can slide right into a new situation. Some try to adapt the new situation to their needs and prejudices with little regard for what has worked in the past. We see that alot here. <br>Just some thoughts.....Methinks time is short, so if you are planning a move, do it soon and prepare well.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c6863101810736631882 title="comment permalink">7/18/11, 6:48 AM</a><br><br>

Your post about intensive vs extensive growing a while back clearly outlined the necessary differences in approach between gardening and farming. (I use it often to explain these things).<br><br>I don't mean to disparage either your skills or experience, but I suspect you've been rather fortunate in your sample size. For over twenty years in and around the PNW town you used to live, I've been helping fledgling wizards transition their yards from ornamentals to edibles (I even filmed an instructional DVD called Backyard Sustainable Gardening). <br><br>In most cases, and certainly all the newer construction, the developers first stripped off all the topsoil, so after peeling back the chemlawn, there's nothing but subsoil and/or gravel. And when there's any decent topsoil at all, it takes quite a bit of organic matter to make it growable, more than a year or two and of course they want a garden now. <br><br>So sure, it's possible without importing manure, but isn't the gist of the advice here "get your skills now, get your supplies now, get yourselves ready now", because we're past the point of luxury of a slow decay...?<br><br>I consider the lonely horse stall to be a replenishing gold-mine the way many here exult over their scores at auction or yardsale. Whether or not your backyard soil can be improved without it, the mindset of identifying sources of soil fertility and cherishing them all the way through to the dinner table, and yes, hauling them in with fossil fuels while we can, is an indispensible attitude and activity for these times.<br><br>As for regional bias, I look forward to the day when geography re-asserts its relevance to travel.

I grew up birding with my mom, went on several bird walks with Roger Tory Peterson, and have a signed first edition (hardback) of his Eastern Field Guide. <br><br>The last three years we have hosted several <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-breasted_Chat rel=nofollow>Yellow-breasted Chats</a>, which is a new sighting for me. I've been trying to get a good video with audio to post for the birding community. All spring now, we suffer the male's song 24-7; he truly puts the common mockingbird to shame. Most interesting is his mimicry of some tropical bird calls, a bit out of place, here in WNC.<br><br>I attribute the Chats' presence/return to habitat restoration, as we haven't had cattle on the place for several years, and I'm allowing some previously managed pastures to return to bramble and sapplings. I've noticed that some other species have made a comeback as well: more rabbits, more hawks, toads seem to be bouncing back as well, deer, turkey, foxes, etc.. I'm also seeing fewer coyotes; not sure why. If they go back where they came from, maybe I can bring back our former resident, Bobwhites.<br><br>It'll be interesting to watch life rebound as more land returns to a more natural state; an upside to collapse perhaps.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c1888572977398265593 title="comment permalink">7/18/11, 7:42 AM</a><br><br>

Whether the State of Jefferson will rise or fall, whether it will even matter to the people to its north and south, where the dust bowls will emerge, etc. etc. are unknowable. Sure, 95% of climate scientists agree that anthropogenic climate change is underway and will continue; but there is no similar consensus on how and when it will manifest. Will the Gulf of Mexico be lapping on the Memphis riverfront in 2050 or 2450? Nobody knows, though many believe they do.<br><br>The more detailed your future scenario is spun, the less likely it is to come to pass. There are some obvious bad bets, like Phoenix and Las Vegas. But who is to say that climates in the eastern states will NOT shift in rather unfavorable directions? We have had Julys with zero inches of rain in recent years; we have had Mays with 24 inches of rain. There is no telling if either of these is a trend or a fluke, and what the trend might be. And that is just climate. Politics? War? Directions of mass migrations? Not a hope of anticipating all that accurately.<br><br>Be adaptable, be wise, be alert, be prepared. <br><br>By the way, the dust bowl was more a result of poor agricultural practices than just drought. Those agricultural practices were the result of the industrialization of agriculture. We have had droughts of similar severity since, without a return to dust bowl conditions thanks to better soil conservation practices.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c6254814800069258763 title="comment permalink">7/18/11, 10:12 AM</a><br><br>

Time is getting short; choose the place that works for you, and get to work. <br><br>Hawlkeye, actually, I've been creating gardens in conditions at least as bad as the ones you've described, and in some cases worse. My current garden was a weedy back yard with next to no topsoil over the top of random fill, some of it apparently out of an old coal mine; the one before that was heavy clay, and so on back to my first, which started out as bare dirt so poor in nutrients not even weeds would grow there. I've never imported manure; composted kitchen scraps, garden waaste, and raked-up leaves every fall have always done the trick. Now of course I'm willing to wait a year or two, and I also dig the grass under (if there is any) as an initial boost for humus building, but it's never been a problem for me.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c8868047096277690695 title="comment permalink">7/18/11, 10:15 AM</a><br><br>

The nighttime singing should be slowing down as we get in into the dog days (and the moon continues waning). A friend of mine describes their song as sounding like the soundtrack to an old Hannah-Barbera cartoon. <br><br>Bird populations are shifting in all sorts of directions, and it is difficult to peg causes -- up, down, east, west, north, south, expanding, contracting. I plan on talking about some of the trends of the last 50 years in Tennessee on my blog in coming weeks, when I get time to write it up. Take the chats as an example. At present they love clearcuts and abandoned pastures that are about 5-15 years old. Look at the maps of clearcuts from 10 years ago, and you are looking at the present-day distribution of chats in many areas! But they lived here before clearcuts. And what happens to them after clearcuts? Hard to know. <br><br>Also remember that we are lacking several keystone species from these eastern forests now -- American Chestnut, Carolina Parakeet, Passenger Pigeon, Red and Gray wolves, Elk, American Bison to name a few. All of these had major roles in shaping the landscape. How the ecosystems will develop in the post-industrial era without these, and with the many invaders, is another of these things about the future that is impossible to predict. We may lose the oaks to sudden oak death; the impacts of that would be terrifying so we just have to hope it does not happen!<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c4460786893085838731 title="comment permalink">7/18/11, 10:30 AM</a><br><br>

Sometimes life and relocation and settling down don't happen quite as easily as we'd like. If you don't have resources built up, for whatever reason, there's just not much chance to settle as well as you might like.<br><br>Joel, I just left Colorado. It's beautiful, but drive east past the front range and the land is clearly not meant to produce and support lots of food/people. It's not even well-connected to anywhere by train. It's *connected*, but not in a decent way. I don't know if there are perhaps some locations in the mountains that are more fertile--I know the area near Grand Junction does grow apples and such--but it may end up being much more isolated than you might want, even if it's somewhat survivable for a smallish amount of people. It sucks, because I just love that state.<br><br>So anyway if I can ask a personal question--no one else really understands, in my family. My husband wants to do boatbuilding and I strongly feel that we should settle in a cheaper area in the gorgeous mid- to northern Appalachians. His school is unfortunately in the PNW but luckily lasts only one year. I want to indulge his wants and career choices but each Archdruid Report that goes by makes me feel very queasy about making the move out there and spending a year that much farther from where we'd like to be. If the financial situation gets that bad, as you JMG mentioned in a response to someone, I mean, you've got to consider how easy will it be to move again cross-country. I don't want to be stuck in an area of expensive land 3,000 miles from where we want to be. Is this a wise choice, or a poor choice? After all, without a decent skillful education first we can't make a living anywhere right?<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c2838853316144825395 title="comment permalink">7/18/11, 3:02 PM</a><br><br>

Even the "conservative" eastern half of Washington is extremely liberal and accepting of relocalization initiatives compared to anywhere in Georgia, excepting perhaps Atlanta.

Every part of the continent has it's rewards and challenges, and I have no quibble with other people's choices. I'd like mine to be respected too. Up until this post, I haven't really been critical of other areas. But I will offer some criticisms now.<br><br>Some areas, like deserts and the intermountain west are going to be very _sparsely_ settled in the future.<br><br>My main objection to the rust belt is personal, I just don't fit in there. That being said, 20 years of wandering for Uncle Sam taught me that I can only really be happy where I can smell the Pacific Ocean. So we paid a premium for 8 acres on the NE corner of the Olympic Peninsula; we could have got 40 acres on the Snake River in Idaho for the same money. I have no regrets.<br><br>I do have some practical objections to anywhere East of the Rockies. Only Bill Pullian has really brought up the weather implications of climate change. I wouldn't live in Tornado Alley during the next thousand years for love or money. Likewise anywhere in range of an Atlantic Hurricane. And I think agriculture will take a big hit with irregular rainfall and drought patterns East of the Mountains. I also regard current population density in the rust belt too high, the die off may be really ugly and a bit too violent and random. Don keeps mentioning the shots he hears.<br><br>About Don and I, and our differing views. It's taken me a bit to catch on, and I hope he will correct me if I'm wrong. Both his "triage" and view of history seem based in the desirability of maintaining the U.S. as large territorially as possible and as a viable entity. Since the area of arable land East of the Rockies is much larger, and more well connected by water and rail than the area to the West, he logically infers that's the way to go; and he therefore maintains an Eastern centric view. Which is fine.<br><br>I, on the other hand, don't really care if the U.S. remains a large viable territory, and am quite happy in the Northwest with it's risks and rewards. We (My family and friends) get along well with Hispanics and aren't afraid of Asians.<br><br>Railroads have not been mentioned much. Assuming the Southwest becomes part of Mexico, or an independant Northern cousin, the U.S. (Meriga, the Rust Belt) could be connected to Cascadia by rail on the Burlington Northern tracks. The U.S. still pumps about a quarter to a third of the oil it uses. IF (and it's a big if) some rationality intrudes after we lose access to oil imports we could prioritize fuel to farms and rail to keep people fed. And we might employ some of the unemployed to electrify the trains. In the later steam days the Cascades had electrics to help with the haul over the mountains, powered by water running down the mountains. Of course, congress would have to grow a brain and bury the partisan hatchets; or some now unknown Colonel or General may take a hand...

Always consider the source. If I am looking at a 15th century painting of the death of Christ I am unlikely to learn anything about Roman Judea in 1 AD; the artist may or may not have known anything about ancient Roman armour. However, it's a good bet that he had seen Lorenzo de Medici's parade armour more than once, and the picture might be a very useful source for mid 14th century plate armour.<br><br>So with those of you following the discussion primarily between Don Mason and I. You may or may not learn anything useful about where to live during the next 50 years. You have learned a bit about Don and I and how we think, reason and rationalize our arguments.<br><br>I might observe, that living in an area that is already approximating low intensity conflict, he sees it as inevitable in the Southwest and perhaps elsewhere.<br><br>He might observe, that living in an area inhabited by mostly peaceful liberals and hippies, that I discount the possibility of war and violence.<br><br>We might both be wrong. Your milage may vary. Others on this thread have given excellent advice, which I cannot improve upon. Pay attention to what Bill Pullian says, he's one of the most senior contributors and always seems to keep a level head. We can't predict the future. We can look at the big things, climate change, oil depletion, the economic trends of the last 50 years. And then do the best we can with what we have.

Which linger and kill the earthworms which you want in the manure.”<br><br>Perhaps I’m misreading or have missed some recent vet publication, but I’ve heard of no link between mineral depletion and heartworms (dirofilaria immitis). It’s my understanding overgrazed, non-rotated pastures raise the parasite loads in horses, not because of mineral depletion, but because the horses can’t avoid contact with leavings from horses already carrying a heavy parasite load. <br><br>Furthermore, heartworm infestation in horses is itself rare, so I’m not sure I understand your use of “heart-worm meds”? Do you mean bloodworm meds? Ivermectin? While ivermectin kills heartworms in dogs, the box in my hand says in horses it kills strongyles (large and small bloodworms), pinworms, ascarids, large mouth stomach worms, bots, lung worms, hairworms, intestinal threadworms, summer sores, and dermatitis—pretty much everything except heartworms, tapeworms, and bad breath. Is calling strongyles “heartworms” rather than “bloodworms” a regional usage? <br><br>I’m eager for any news on this subject since I’ve found little reassuring research on natural anthelmintics and the three classes of drugs currently in use are losing effectiveness with no new products in the pipeline. In fact, reports of parasite resistance to the once nearly invincible ivermectin are increasing, mainly because overuse selects for Ivermectin-Ready parasites, an alarming problem since many, many equine vets say internal parasites may trigger fifty percent of horse deaths. <br><br>Knowing this and motivated by the special section on deworming in the February 2011 issue of <i>Equus</i> and by several articles on thehorse.com, I now follow the new vet recommendation of routine fecal examinations rather than the periodic paste worming that’s been standard for over a quarter century. <br><br>The reason behind the new regimen is simple. Most horses do not need regular worming; typically only a few individuals carry a parasite load worth treating. For example, only one of my five warranted treatment. <br> <br>Fecal exams, selective use of commercial drugs, and temporary separation of treated animals can keep dubious manure out of the compost. I’m sorting manure now, but I’m also happy to report that my earthworm population thrives in the million and a quarter pounds of unsorted horse manure we composted over the previous thirty-one years. <br><br>hawlkeye also said, “Building alliances with animal owners now is no bad thing, because I'll betcha they pay zero attention to what comes out, only what goes in.” <br><br>I’m sure you’re right about some animal owners, but, uh, did you have an amount in mind? Like me, most of the livestock owners I know consider their manure piles treasure rather “a pile of liability.” <br><br>Houyhnhnm<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c7657288685857278399 title="comment permalink">7/18/11, 9:43 PM</a><br><br>

It’s the area from the East Coast to Minnesota, and from the Potomac and Ohio watersheds north through southern Canada. It’s unique in the Western Hemisphere because of its internal water communications (particularly the Great Lakes), and when you combine that with the fertile soil and reasonably predictable rainfall, it’s no wonder that it was the first area to develop when the Europeans overran the continent like locusts. So my guess is that that’s the center that things will gradually contract back to.<br><br>The Southeast is second; it’s the area just to the south of the Rust Belt. It has many of the same positives (good soil, good rainfall) but it lacks the outstanding internal water communications system of the Rust Belt. It’s right next to the Rust Belt, which helps to create a certain critical mass. (However, it is known to be inhabited by people of a hot, rebellious persuasion, and since the Northern States are inhabited by people of a glacial, anti-rebellious persuasion, this critical mass can sometimes go nuclear.)<br><br>I placed the Great Plains third. That’s the area from the base of the Rockies eastward to Minnesota and eastern Texas (Texas is partially in the Southeast, partially in the Southwest, partially in the Great Plains, and partially in a world of its own.) Soils are generally good, but water availability is a problem, particularly as you head further west. It’s right next to the top two regions, so it gets points for being contiguous with the two most salvageable areas.(critical mass again). <br><br>I placed the Northwest fourth: good soil, good rainfall, but like the Southeast, lacking an extraordinary internal water-born transportation system like the Great Lakes. The Northwest has better rainfall than the Great Plains, but it is very remote from the top two regions, and security issues are a concern.<br><br>The Rockies are fifth. Agricultural potential is limited. Transportation is impossible. Rainfall often comes instead as snow, and in some places, it stays all year. <br><br>Southwest is dead last. It’s the area that was a part of Mexico until we stole it from the Mexicans, and now the Mexicans are stealing it back. Extremely hot. No water-born transportation. No water, period. Narco-terrorist insanity.

It amuses me that even though "Pulliam" is by far the most common of all the variants (Pullian, Pulliman, Pullman, Pullium, etc.) it seems to be about the least likely one that I see other people writing down or typing after I have told them my name. And also thanks for your kind words. <br><br>Don -- I would not discount the inland waterways of the southeast so universally as you do. I live in the Tennessee Valley, where "river" is almost synonymous with "long narrow chain of lakes connected by locks and dams." And of course this all feeds directly to the Mississippi, Gulf of Mexico, and the World. There are many cities and towns around here whose reason for being was originally shipping on the inland waterways. Barge traffic is my no means extinct on them at the present day. Along the southeast coast, many rivers formerly had boat traffic far inland (to the "fall line"), without the need for locks and dams if they were dredged and snagged. As long as dredges, locks, and dams can still be operated, you will still be able to get a barge within about 60 miles of pretty much anywhere in Tennessee. And once those things go by the wayside, the inland waterways of the Northeast become just as useless as ours here (remember that big waterfall separating the Great Lakes from the Atlantic?). Note that I don't personally like locks, dams, dredging, or snagging, seeing how they destroy the riverine ecosystems. But realistically I don't see them going away until they are no longer feasible. <br><br>Re: the dysphonia of the term "Rust Belt," you could just call it the Inland Northeast. That is no more unwieldy that Pacific Northwest. <br><br>As for regional instabilities, I'd put my personal money (though not very much of it) on the first armed insurrections breaking out in the west, not in the former Confederacy or Appalachia. I've spent time among the backwoods of Northern California, the Rockies, and much of Dixie. I think the westerners are more likely to actually resort to "second amendment solutions" on a large and quasi-organized scale. My wife used to work for the USGS in Colorado, traveling all through the mountain and intermountain west. There were many places where they would not take a vehicle with government insignia or license plates, because of previous shooting incidents.

I dread the day when the Internet goes down and I lose access to Doppler radar. Back in the day, NOAA weather radio was the main information source, supported by a network of dedicated volunteer storm spotters, who often stayed in communication via amateur radio. They unquestionably saved lives in the event linked above. Those systems are still available and active today. But modern day Doppler does greatly help in coordination with on-the-ground observations, allowing more timely and accurate warnings, and providing me a much better picture of what's coming in. I don't especially want to be without it in the era of Global Weirding. I think about that a lot.<br><br>When I consider whether life in my little section of the Great Plains is sustainable, I look back to the Pawnee culture which flourished here for an extended period of several hundred years before European settlement. Most people who aren't familiar with our immediate area tend to assume it was inhabited by nomadic bison hunters. Actually, the Pawnee built earth lodges along the river valleys and grew crops, the chief of which was maize. They became sophisticated astronomers, orienting their buildings toward particular stars. There were also only 10,000 of them, spread out over a large area, as of the early 19th century. That's less than half the current population of my town, which is only a couple of miles across.<br><br>I would gently discourage people from moving to Southcentral Nebraska for that reason, despite the fact that I was born and raised here and cheerfully expected to die here. My family's been established in this state since my great-great-grandfather began farming in 1869, yet I'm likely moving away in a few years. My motivations arise more from the heart than the intellect. My husband's parents and elder brother—who's only semi-independent due to an autism spectrum disorder—will likely need our care in Michigan. I love them dearly, and I will not see any of them sent to an institutionalized setting, not while I have anything to say about it. The two decades that Mr. G and I have enjoyed a frugal lifestyle together are about to pay off, I guess, as they've given us a bit of a cushion to make that transition.

The difference between a tornado and a spring shower is modest changes in the mesoscale atmospheric processes. Even hurricanes are quite delicate beasts. So any kind of climate change will likely change their patterns as well, and because of this temperamental nature and the butterfly effect it is really hard to anticipate how. Tornado Alley could easily move. And, of course, the number one killer of severe weather events is flooding. All regions are subject to that risk, and it is one risk you can almost entirely eliminate by proper planning. I would also not in any way expect pacific coast climate patterns to be less subject to changing that those of any other place around the world. <br><br>After the big tornado outbreak in MS, AL, GA, and TN this spring, a friend in Oregon wrote me to say that "extreme weather that you get there makes me glad that I'm only in a volcano/earthquake/floodplain zone." But, here's the thing: Even when you live in Tornado Alley, the odds of any one spot (like your house) being hit by any tornado at all are about 1:100 to 1:500 per year. Only the strongest 5% of tornados cause major damage to well-built structures and result in frequent fatalities (5% of storms/95% of deaths). So your odds of being hit by a strong tornado that can seriously bang up your (properly engineered house) are thus something like 1:2000 to 1:10,000 per year. I think these odds compare quite favorably with the volcanic/seismic+tsunami/mudslide/wildfire risks on most of the Pacific coast. <br><br>In other words, you are not going to get away from natural disaster risks by moving to one part of the country or another. Something can get you just about anywhere. And remember that probably your biggest risk is burning your own house down, especially in a post-cheap-electricity world were flames regain more prominence for lighting, cooking, and heating. Our 125 year old house shows signs of having survived at least two fires, one very small, one (in the kitchen) pretty significant. Meanwhile it has never been damaged by tornado, flood, or earthquake.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c6775252135568033817 title="comment permalink">7/19/11, 7:45 AM</a><br><br>

Allow the Mexicans, the Asians, the Baja Californians, the Alta Californians, the Jeffersonians, the Cascadians, the American Redoubters, the Crips, the Bloods, the MS-13’s, the Neo-Nazi Aryan skinheads and the others to mutually slaughter each other in the West. You would not have to expend much blood or treasure trying to maintain your own security, since you could easily prevent any survivors from pushing east through the few, narrow mountain passes in the northern Rockies. If they try to push through in the south, then just prevent them from getting water, and the desert sun will do the rest.”<br><br>Machiavelli might also stress the positive implications regarding investment capital: “You would no longer have to maintain an expensive, transcontinental, land communication network. It does not serve the American public interest to invest additional capital west of the High Plains; and the only capital invested in the High Plains would be the minimal amounts necessary to convert from row-crop agriculture back to permanent pasture for ranching as water becomes too scarce. As a result, virtually all future capital investment in the United States of America would be efficiently concentrated east of the High Plains in the compact, contiguous area of better rainfall, better soil, and better water-born transportation: from the states of the Eastern Seaboard west to the states of Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, and eastern Texas.”<br><br>- Continued Below -<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c4342517905731952241 title="comment permalink">7/19/11, 8:38 AM</a><br><br>

The West is filled with ghost towns of the past and ghost towns of the future.”<br><br>If JMG’s theory of catabolic collapse is correct, then this reversal of Manifest Destiny could potentially convert the relatively unproductive, high-maintenance capital of the failing American West into waste, thereby reducing capital maintenance costs and socio-political complexity, and buying the eastern two-thirds of the states more time to adapt.<br><br>Like the eastern Roman Empire centered around Constantinople, the Rust Belt, the Southeast, and the Great Plains would get a more manageable nation in the eastern two-thirds of the continent; and like the western Roman Empire centered around Rome, the Alta Californians, the Jeffersonians, the Cascadians, the American Redoubters, the Crips, the Bloods, the MS-13’s, the Neo-Nazi Aryan skinheads and the others would get… well, they would get each other.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c6527167727004050687 title="comment permalink">7/19/11, 8:39 AM</a><br><br>

It was all about what will be in demand and applicable to our short/midterm conditions, and having the right reasons for making this choice. Seems like a big step. <br>I actually had a shot at Pilchuck in the mid '90s, have had a personal tour of Chihuly's Boathouse, and was very drawn to the glass arts as a lifelong trade, something I took to quickly. My wife was president of a regional glass artist guild for several years; an accomplished stained glass artist and potter. It is with some regret and reluctance that we decided to change course toward, as I said, more pragmatic pursuits. My focus on various appropriate technologies, salvage, gardening and homesteading are paying off in very important, hopefully sustainable ways. I chose to defer to my engineering talents, sacrificing much of my artistic side; not an easy choice. She chose to be the fully employed support person. This arrangement is something JMG has mentioned several times. We've been about this for 15 years.<br><br>My son, still in Seattle, asked what I would recommend he apply his learning energies toward. He is a talented artist, hoping to eventually get into one of the better art schools. I told him to develop some skills that would put food on the table anywhere, anytime, such as bartending, baking or microbrewing (he would be great at any/all), and focus on his art as time permits. An old highschool buddy of mine put himself through 6 years of chemical engineering school (Ga Tech) by tending bar, and throughout his boom/bust chemical engineering career, he's always done well at his 'second job'. He's a great listener.<br><br>Other jobs/skills applicable to our near/midterm future:<br><br>Medical- especially emergency medicine, midwifery, dental tech/assistant, herbal and holistic treatments, apothicarial skills/pharma, etc.<br><br>Baking (I was the assistant baker at my college for two years; paid much of my tuition). A good baker is usually in demand somewhere. May not pay much...<br><br>Butcher, including smoking, sausage making, meat preserving.<br><br>Veterinary tech, especially large animal care and husbandry (I recently learned to glue wounds vs sutures. Really works well. Add surgical glue to your kit.)<br><br>Mercenary/martial arts<br><br>Metal working incl. smithying, casting, welding, machining.<br><br>Carpenter (I suppose boat building gets Matt there).<br><br>Any additions to the list would be of value.

Between the Mexican Border and the North Slope of Alaska, the coastal states and British Columbia have 50 million people, are agriculturally self-sufficent and have quite a number of successful basic industries. Aluminum production for one. California alone used to be the 5th largest economy in the world. The feds get more in taxes from the 3 West Coast states than it returns in benefits.<br><br>I'm confident that we can survive without the East. Will losing the West accelerate or retard the collapse of the U.S. as a nation?<br><br>Your assertation that the Southwest has "no water, period" precludes California being part of the Southwest. The city of Los Angeles does get some water from the Colorado River, which it could, and has, done without. As a whole, the state breaks even on water, piping it from the Northern mountains for agriculture in the Central Valley and the sprawling cities of the South. Were they to move the Mexican border North to the Tehachapi Mountains, the state would have a net water surplus.<br><br>Bill Pulliam,<br><br>According to Prof. Cliff Mass at the University of Washington, climate change will be greatly mitigated and delayed here in the NW. Being immediately downwind of the Pacific Ocean gives us that benefit. We are currently enjoying a cold damp summer, after our second cold damp spring in a row.

The three most important haggling assets one can have (in order of importance) are extreme courtesy in negotiation, product knowledge, and knowledge of markets. I'll give a recent example.<br><br>At a car boot sale I spied a large oil globe lamp for sale. I enquired about the price which was £25. I politely stated that this seemed a tad expensive. The vendor retorted that the glass globe by itself costs £10. This is generally true (product knowledge). I stated that he was certainly correct and I wasn't implying the item was too expensive as such, but it was too expensive for my limited budget. I thanked him and walked along to view other stalls.<br><br>I returned to the vendor's stall. Now we both knew negotiations were about the begin. (I had also noticed a smaller oil globe lamp previously, but didn't mention it to him or ask for a price.) I said I'd buy the original lamp for £15. He said no. I then asked about the price of the smaller lamp which was £7. I took some time to view the object to make sure it was working. I offered £20 for both lamps. He said no. I said what about £25 for both lamps. He said no. I said what about €27 for both. He said yes. (I received about a 15% discount due to currency conversion from pounds to euros - so I bought two lamps for about £24).<br><br>The two lamps, one with a reflecting mirror, originally cost (I'm pretty sure) 2/6' and 1/ (which is about 30 pence and 10 pence). Talk about inflation, but unfortunaley in Ireland anything made before the 1990s is declared an antique (market knowledge). I have practical use for them and plus I scored a free load of wicks when I bought something else at another mart.<br><br>[Barter, on the other hand, opens up extensive vistas of trade, but product knowledge is key.]<br><br>- Never be too keen.<br>- Knowledge is power - always shop around and get to know products or replacements values.<br>- Know your budget.<br>- Be courteous and be prepared to banter. Both have value.<br>- If you visit certain marts on a regular basis, get to know the vendors who you want to deal with in the future. The price they give today might be reduced for you in the future.<br>- Be prepared to walk away from any purchase by thanking the vendor and maybe complimenting her on the goods available (depends on the vendor's disposition), but always thank them for their time.<br>- Price is relative - value to you is only known to you. You're merely discovering what value the vendor places on the item.<br>- Don't approach trade as merely a purchaser or price taker. You are a value trader. You are trading goods or money for some utility value item that corresponds to an equal exhange. <br>- Items at the end of the day are more negotiatable as vendors want to leave with as little stock as possible.<br>- Think creatively.<br><br>from: make do and mend<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c3480536029717289625 title="comment permalink">7/20/11, 1:12 AM</a><br><br>

I also used (before it was run over) to feed my wombat whole apples and I'm finding apple seedlings growing in the strangest spots now. The seeds get nicely packaged in fertiliser and also randomly spread.<br><br>I'm learning the same thing as you about gardening.

It is worth noting that even with the Pacific buffer you folks out there do have quite a bit of year-to-year climate variability already! Those short- and mid-term climate oscillations predominate over long-term trends just about everywhere, by the way. Here in TN the North Atlantic Oscillation, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, and Pacific-North American Pattern are all big influences (El Niño is trivial by comparison for us). It is a convergence of negative NAO/AO and positive PNA that have given us this pattern of hot summers and cold winters we seem stuck in for the last couple of years; it seems to have nothing to do with any long-term trend (at least so far...). But of course, altering the patterns and timing of all these oscillations is one of the things we'll likely see from anthropogenic climate change, too! Climate is a REALLY complex system (have I mentioned that before?). <br><br>But it's pretty clear you have picked your home and are planning to stick with it (and personally I think it's a perfectly fine one; you have soil, water, seashore, and temperate climate, not sure how much regional or transcontinental trade you even need in the long run). The climate, politics, demographics, seismic faults, and volcanoes will do what they will and you just find ways to go with the flow instead of against it. One of JMG's earlier fictional series (Adam's Story, monthly installments starting in May 2007) was set in the PNW, and his fictional late 21st Century people were finding ways to get by in spite of militia, refugees, and climate changes. In the end we each have to find our own place to plant our asparagus. <br><br>Khriss Baelloe --<br><br>I think those TVA dams will last a good bit more than just "decades," for the most part -- at least the steel-and-concrete ones with locks on the Tennessee and other major rivers. Not so sure about the earthen ones -- one of those has been raising alarm bells for years because of seepage and the threat that a failure could make the Great Flood of 2010 in Nashville look like a teeny hiccup. But if there is a need for transport I expect the lock-and-dam systems can be maintained for quite a while -- and they have those monster hydroelectric turbines right there, on site, to power the machinery w/o the need for a huge extensive power grid. Even failing that I expect it is child's play to rig a lock system to run purely on mechanical force provided by the river itself without the electric intermediate. <br><br>What kept us out of East Tennessee was high cost of land and rampant suburban sprawl. It is far worse than the two other Great Divisions (Middle and West TN) on those fronts. There are pockets; but research your communities carefully. There have been arson incidents in some rural areas of east TN involving newcomers who were perceived as being just too far in the extreme (like gay nudists); whereas in middle TN we have long-standing hippie communes (gay and otherwise), and some braver souls even fly their rainbow flags on country backroads without incident. <br><br>That gets back to my earlier point -- it's at least as much about your neighbors as about your region.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c4333285408082496549 title="comment permalink">7/20/11, 6:39 AM</a><br><br>

Pre-fossil fuel the Mississippi and it's tributaries were trafficked quite heavily. I have a letter written to my great-grandfather in the late 1800s, the address is simply "Tallahatchie River." Apparently it was successfully delivered. Also seems that the bigger plantations must have had their own landings, which makes sense for transporting and loading something as bulky as cotton.<br><br>I don't see the Southeast separating from the North again. With the slavery issue settled, it just makes too much sense for them to stay together. The South does a lot better in the national political process as part of the union anyway. I'm not happy about that, as I'm definitely in the minority around here. <br><br>But the advantages of staying unified were obvious to Lincoln, and they would be for anyone trying to build or maintain an empire. And those glacial Yankee boys are amazingly able to endure hardship and carnage to uphold a weird little abstract concept like "union." As I write this, I'm looking out my back yard at an area those brave souls probably marched through during the Vicksburg campaign in 1863. They got whooped that time and had to fall back, but we all know they found a way.<br><br>Though I sit on a prime piece of rich Mississippi Delta land with easy river access, ideal in so many ways for post-peak purposes, it's most likely I'll end up in N. California. That's where my children and their mother are, and I don't see them pulling up everything to come here. I would like to make the change sooner rather than later, to try to get something going that will eventually help them. But California farmland is too overvalued for me to make any kind of worthwhile exchange. Eventually, I expect that to level out somewhat, as values around here rise, and the consequences of depending on unsustainable levels of irrigation begin to be realized by the agricultural sector out west.<br><br>For those considering Don Mason's hierarchy of regions I would also point out that the Lower Colorado River valley had one of the highest population densities in pre-conquest N. America. The West Coast in general was second only to the Mississippi/Ohio River valley. In prehistoric times, the Southwest was quite densely populated. Check out Mesa Verde or Chaco Canyon sometime. Those areas were just population hubs made possible by irrigation opportunities, but the surrounding countryside supported quite large numbers of people on wild game and corn/beans/squash agriculture. Climate change long ago made the difference, so that will be one of the wild cards going forward.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c8454512229557217809 title="comment permalink">7/20/11, 8:15 AM</a><br><br>

If every family did the same, it could work.”<br><br>My concern is: how are we going to feed the 300+ million people who are already in America without importing oil?<br> <br>America is eating petroleum. Mexico is eating petroleum. Asia is eating petroleum. <br><br>When the Export Land Theory starts to kick in with a vengeance, our oil imports are going to drop like a stone. We’ll be down to domestic production (about a third of current consumption) and even that will be dropping. How can we feed the huge population we already have, let alone any additional people?<br> <br>The resource and demographic numbers imply that tens of millions of Mexicans and hundreds of millions of Asians are going to be at risk of premature death; and the geography implies that they may be headed to the Southwest and the Pacific Coast, because they would have no other realistic choice. Where else could they go for food?<br><br>For me, this has been a very enlightening discussion. I started out the discussion looking at it one way: how do we maintain our land communications network to keep the West in the Union?<br><br>Now I’m thinking: the Western third of the United States is lost. The West was a bad investment of Eastern capital. <br><br>The mineral wealth has largely been extracted; its agricultural productivity disproportionately relies on technology-dependent irrigation rather than no-tech rain; it’s overpopulated and about to get overrun with starving refugees; and it hates everything in the East and aspires to splinter into smaller and smaller heavily-armed but mutually-incompatible political units.<br> <br>Why try to keep this area in the Union? It’s going to be nothing but expenses, with no long-term payback.<br> <br>The former American West is a McMansion in a Las Vegas subdivision that was originally valued at $300,000; is currently valued at $125,000; and will eventually be worth the value of the raw land minus the cost of demolishing the house - and since the raw land will be worthless, this means that the house has a negative value of ($10,000).<br><br>Why continue to pay the mortgage?

Capital investment in the West was a bad idea because the region is not sustainable in its present form? No region of the developed world is sustainable in its present form. You really think the American economy has not benefited as a whole over the last century from all the infrastructure that made present-day California possible (and makes present day California also doomed, just like all major agricultural-industrial-urban complexes around the world)? As for allocating future capital investment, I'm kind of wondering, WHAT capital investment? We are already in the depreciation phase, the catabolic part. We are going to be dismantling and salvaging capital, not deploying more. <br><br>Las Vegas is also a bit of a Straw Man for the American West. Only a small portion of the Western population actually lives in hyperdeserts like Las Vegas and Phoenix. Even the LA basin, overpopulated though it may be, actually has significant autochthonous environmental resources.<br><br>Glenn -- with only two major Northern Hemisphere oceans in the world, it's kind of hard to generalize too much about patterns. Europe, by the way, is downwind of the Atlantic; they are not expecting to be spared climate change the last time I checked. Sure, the Atlantic is smaller; but the PNW has no equivalent of the North Atlantic Drift. As for distance from the Equator, you might want to check the latitudes. San Francisco is only a bit south of D.C., Portland is parallel with central Maine, Seattle is north of Duluth, and Vancouver lines up with Newfoundland. I just think that any hypothesized climate change scenario is a poor basis for decision making, other than to be prepared for unpredictable shifts.<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c5109989185399001418 title="comment permalink">7/20/11, 8:17 PM</a><br><br>

McKay</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>JMG I see many parallels in your idea of cultural senility and Derrick Jensen's idea of toxic mimics. It is explained here: "Toxic mimics...take a very real, necessary, creative, life-affirming, and most of all relational urge and turn it -- pervert it -- until it furthers not fully mutual relationships at all but instead superficial relationships based on domination and control. Toxic mimics...can cause people to forget those original relational urges, to forget mutuality is possible, to forget depth is possible, to believe control is natural and desirable."<br> <br>So as you pointed out we have such cultural absurdities such as Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, that simply rehash and commodify old ideas so that someone can make a few bucks. I have a strong idea of which one people will remember in another 50 years time and it isn't the one with the zombies. <br><br>Rape is a toxic mimic of sex. War is a toxic mimic of play. The bond between slave owner and slave is a toxic mimic of marriage. Care bears is a toxic mimic of The White Stag.<br><br>The better we become at identifying these toxic mimics and removing them from our lives the better we will be equipped when systems really start becoming disrupted in our part of the world. It's about removing the veneer from the modern world and looking at what lies underneath it and learning to do those things for ourselves. <br><br>Buying food from a supermarket is a good example of a toxic mimic of the old ways of growing your own food and buying or trading what you can't grow yourself with your nieghbours. Interactions like this bring a whole range of other benefits with them such as a sense of community, a knowledge of how everything is produced that we put into our bodies as well as environmental benefits. <br><br>I could carry on listing all the toxic mimics I can think of but I think I've made my point. Thanks very much for you're writing, it's the number one thing I read each week.<br><br>Regards<br><br><a href=salvaging-quality.html#c1587204852766974387 title="comment permalink">8/20/11, 1:56 AM</a><br><br>
