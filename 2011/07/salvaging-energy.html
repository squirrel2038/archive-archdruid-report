The peak oil blogosphere this year seems to have decided that the Fourth of July needed a Grinch of its own to compete with Christmas, and a fair number of blogs duly went up denouncing the day and its entertainments. I can’t say that these added much to the peak oil dialogue or, really, to much of anything. It’s hardly a secret, for instance, that intellectuals on the two coasts like to belittle working class people who live in between, nor that it’s still quite fashionable on both ends of the political spectrum to characterize our system of government in terms that would get those who do so dragged away by a death squad if their rhetoric had any relationship to reality.<br><br>Me, I enjoyed the Fourth; I usually do. My wife and I spent a quiet day gardening, dined on chicken fried tofu – hey, don’t knock it if you haven’t tried it – and walked down to the city park that runs along the old Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, where we met friends, munched watermelon, and watched the annual fireworks display. The Fourth of July is one of the high points of any small town American summer, and I’m also sufficiently old-fashioned to celebrate the ideals that sent this country along its historical trajectory all those years ago. Since the United States is a country inhabited and governed by people rather than abstract ideological mannequins, those ideals got put into practice no more consistently than any other country’s, but they’ve lost none of their relevance, and I’d be a good deal less worried about the future of my country if I saw more people paying attention to them and fewer people waving them aside as obstacles to the pursuit of some allegedly glorious future.<br><br>The theme of this week’s post isn’t primarily about the future, glorious or otherwise. Strictly speaking, it’s a response to circumstances that will almost certainly go away within the lifetimes of people now living, and only exist today in those few nations that can afford the overblown consumer economy that budded, bloomed, and went to seed in the second half of the twentieth century. That response, curiously enough, has more than a little to do with the theme of independence central to the holiday just past, but the easiest way to make sense of it is to start with the nearly complete state of dependence expressed by another fashionable topic under discussion in the peak oil scene.<br><br>That topic is the return of electric cars to American roads. A dozen large and small automakers are in the process of bringing out battery-powered cars of various kinds, ranging from generic compacts like the Ford Focus and Nissan Leaf to more exotic items like the Aptera and the GEM. Most of them are pricey, and all of them have their share of drawbacks, mostly in terms of range and reliability, but a significant fraction of people on the green end of things are hailing their appearance as a great step forward. As things stand, that’s a bit of an oversimplification, since almost all the electricity these vehicles use will be generated by burning coal and natural gas, and the easy insistence that the grid can easily be switched over to solar and wind power has already been critiqued at some length in this blog. Still, there are a couple of other points that would be well worth making here.<br><br>First of all, of course, the best way to reduce your ecological footprint isn’t to replace a petroleum-powered car with an electric car, it’s to replace it with a bicycle, a public transit ticket, or a good pair of walking shoes. This isn’t the first time I’ve mentioned that option, and I know I can expect to be belabored by commenters who are bursting with reasons why they can’t possibly do without a car, or even leave the car parked in the driveway most of the time. Granted, the built geography of much of rural and suburban North America makes it a little challenging to do without a car, but something close to a hundred million people in the United States live in places where a car is a luxury most or all of the time, and a significant fraction of the others choose to live in places where that’s not the case. Still, let’s set aside for the moment the fact that the one energy-related bumper sticker that might actually make a difference these days would belong on the back of a bicycle, and would say MY OTHER CAR IS A PAIR OF SHOES. For those Americans who actually do find themselves in need of a car, how about the new electric vehicles? Will they really decrease your carbon footprint and your fossil fuel use, as so much current verbiage claims?<br><br>The answer is unfortunately no. First of all, as already mentioned, the vast majority of electricity in America and elsewhere comes from coal and natural gas, and so choosing an electric car simply means that the carbon dioxide you generate comes out of a smokestack at a power plant rather than the tailpipe of your car. The internal combustion engine is an inefficient way of turning fuel into motion – around 3/4 of the energy in a gallon of gas becomes low-grade heat dumped into the atmosphere via the radiator, leaving only a quarter to keep you rolling down the road – but the processes of turning fossil fuel into heat and heat into electricity, storing the electricity in a battery and extracting it again, and then turning the electricity into motion is less efficient still, so you’re getting less of the original fossil fuel energy turned into distance traveled than you would in an ordinary car. This means that you’d be burning more fossil fuel to power your car even if the power plant was burning petroleum, and since it isn’t – and coal and natural gas contain much less energy per unit of volume than petroleum distillates do – you’re burning quite a bit more fossil fuel, and dumping quite a bit more carbon in the atmosphere, than a petroleum-powered car would do.<br><br>This isn’t something you’ll see discussed very often in e-car websites and sales flyers. It’s even less likely that you’ll find any mention there of the second factor that needs to be discussed, which is the energy cost of manufacture. An automobile, petroleum-powered or electric, is a very complicated piece of hardware, and every part of it comes into being through a process of manufacture that starts at an assortment of mines, oil wells, and the like, and proceeds through refineries, factories, warehouses, and assembly plants, linked together by long supply chains via train, truck or ship. All this costs energy. Working out the exact energy cost per car would be a huge project, since it would involve tracking the energy used to produce and distribute every last screw, drop of solvent, etc., but it’s probably safe to say that a large fraction of the total energy used in a car’s lifespan is used up before the car reaches the dealer. Electric cars are as subject to this rule as petroleum-powered ones.<br><br>The energy cost of manufacture has generally been downplayed in discussions of energy issues, where it hasn’t been banished altogether to whichever corner of the outer darkness it is that provides a home for unwanted facts. (I’ve long suspected that this is not too far from “Away,” the place where pollution goes in the parallel universe that cornucopians apparently inhabit.) Promoters of the more grandiose end of alternative-energy projects – the solar power satellites and Nevada-sized algae farms that crop up so regularly when people are trying to ignore the reality of ecological limits – are particularly prone to brush aside the energy cost of manufacture with high-grade handwaving, but the same sort of evasion pervades nearly all thinking about energy these days. I’ve mentioned before that three centuries of cheap abundant fossil fuel energy have imposed lasting distortions on the modern mind; this is an example.<br><br>Still, factor in the energy cost of manufacture, and there actually is an answer to the question we’ve just been considering. If you really feel you have to have a car, what kind involves the smallest carbon footprint and the least overall energy use? A used one.<br><br>I suppose it’s just possible that one or two of the readers of this blog will remember a strange and politically edgy comic strip from the Sixties named <i>Odd Bodkins</i>. The rest of you will just have to forgive a bit of relevant reminiscence here. Somewhere between an encounter with the dreaded Were-Chicken of Petaluma and a journey to Mars with Five Dollar Bill, I think it was, the Norton-riding main character, Hugh, and his sidekick Fred the Bird had a run-in with General Injuns – the resemblance to the name of a certain large American automotive corporation was not accidental. I forget what it was that inspired Fred the Bird to shout “Buy a used car!” but the General’s response – <b>“BLASPHEMY!!!”</b> – was memorably rendered, and will probably be duplicated in a good many of the responses to this week’s blog. Most people in the industrial world nowadays are so used to thinking of the best option as new and shiny by definition, that the homely option of picking up a cheap used car as a way of saving energy is likely to offend them at a cellular level.<br><br>Still, the energy cost of manufacture needs to be taken into account. If you buy a used car – let’s say, for the sake of argument, a ten-year-old compact with decent gas mileage – instead of a new electric car, you’ve just salvaged the energy cost of manufacture that went into the used car, most of which would otherwise have been wasted, and saved all the energy that would have been spent to produce, ship, and assemble every part of the new car. Since it’s a ten-year-old compact rather than a brand new e-car, furthermore, you’re not going to be tempted to drive it all over the place to show everyone how ecologically conscious you are; in fact, you may just be embarrassed enough to leave it in your driveway when you don’t actually need it, thus saving another good-sized chunk of energy. Finally, of course, the price difference between a brand new Nissan Leaf and a ten-year-old compact will buy you a solar water heating system, installation included, with enough left over to completely weatherize an average American home. It’s a win-win situation for everything but your ego.<br><br>The same principle can be applied much more broadly. Very few people, for example, actually need a new computer. I’ve never owned one; I need a computer to make my living – publishers these days require book manuscripts to be submitted electronically – but I get my computers used, free or at a tiny fraction of their original price, and run them until they drop. One consequence is that I’ve salvaged the energy used in manufacturing the old computer, rather than burdening the planet with the energy cost of manufacturing a new one; another is that I’m keeping a small but measurable amount of toxic e-waste out of the waste stream; still another, of course, is that I save quite a bit of money that can then be directed to other purposes, such as insulation and garden tools.<br><br>Most Americans buy most of the things they used new, and dump a great many perfectly useful items into the trash; the more conscientious package them up and donate them to thrift stores, which is at least a step in the right direction. As a society, we have been able to afford this fixation and its attendant costs – new houses, new cars, new computers, new everything – because we’ve been surfing a tidal wave of cheap abundant fossil fuel energy. As we get further into the territory on the far side of peak oil, and as peak coal and peak natural gas come within sight, that state of affairs is rapidly coming to an end. One option, as I suggested in last week’s post, is to plunge into the emerging reality of scarcity industrialism, which centers on an increasingly savage competition for access to a shrinking pool of new and shiny things produced by what’s left of the world’s fossil fuel stocks.<br><br>A saner alternative, though, is to move directly into the stage that will follow scarcity industrialism – the stage of salvage economics. That’s what I’ve been discussing here, under a less threatening label. Right now, while the tidal wave of cheap energy has not yet receded very far, the beachscape of industrial society is still littered with the kind of high-quality salvage our descendants will dream of finding, and the only thing that has to be overcome in order to access most of it is the bit of currently fashionable arrogance that relegates used goods to the poor.<br><br>Now of course that’s not a small thing. One of the reasons that Thoreau’s concept of voluntary poverty got rebranded “voluntary simplicity,” and repackaged as a set of fashionable lifestyle choices that imitate authentic simplicity at a premium price, is the stark panic felt by so many middle class Americans at the thought of being mistaken for someone who’s actually poor. Those of my readers who decide that the advantages of voluntary poverty are worth pursuing are going to have to confront that panic, if they haven’t done so already. Like all supposedly classless societies, America makes up for its lack of formal caste barriers by raising caste prejudice to a fine art; the cheap shots at small town America mentioned toward the beginning of this blog are an expression of that, of course, and so is the peer pressure that keeps most Americans from doing the sensible thing, and buying cheap and sturdy used products in place of increasingly overpriced and slipshod new ones.<br><br>We are all going to be poor in the decades and centuries to come. Yes, I’m including today’s rich in that; the stark folly that leads today’s privileged classes to think they can prosper while gutting the society that alone guarantees them their wealth and status is nothing new, and will bring about the usual consequences in due time. Voluntarily embracing poverty in advance may seem like a strange tactic to take, at a time when a great many people will be clinging to every scrap of claim to the fading wealth of the industrial age, but it has certain important advantages. First, it offers a chance to get competent at getting by on less before sheer necessity forces the issue; second, it sidesteps the rising spiral of struggle that’s waiting for all those who commit themselves to holding on to an industrial-age standard of living; third, as I’ve already pointed out, buying cheap used items frees up money that can then be applied to something more useful.<br><br>It’s probably going to be necessary here to insert a response to what used to be the standard objection to the piece of advice I’ve just offered. No, buying used goods instead of new ones isn’t going to put any significant number of Americans out of work. Very little is actually manufactured in America these days, and most of what is, is produced and sold by conglomerates that pump money out of American communities and into the black hole of the financial economy. Nearly all used-goods stores, by contrast, are locally owned and circulate their earnings back into the community, where they generate jobs by way of the multiplier effect. The calculations would be fiendishly difficult, and you won’t find a mainstream economist willing to touch the project with a ten-foot pole, but I suspect that when the differences just listed are taken into account, buying used goods actually yields a larger number of jobs than buying new ones – and while thrift store clerks don’t make as much as corporate office fauna, to be sure, I have to admit to a suspicion that the former contribute a good deal more to the world as a whole than the latter.<br><br>For the time being, at least, the office fauna and their corporate sponsors are likely to continue to thrive after a fashion, lumbering through the jungles of deindustrializing America like so many dinosaurs, and the thrift store clerks and their customers will play the part of smart little mammals scurrying around in the underbrush. Still, like the mammals, those who opt out of scarcity industrialism to embrace the first stirrings of the salvage economies of the future will have certain advantages not available to their brontosaurian neighbors. One of them, as already suggested, will be a certain amount of spare room in the household budget, which can then be turned to other projects, or used to free up a family member to work in the household economy, or both.<br><br>Another will be the chance to learn skills that could well become income sources in the not too distant future; as I’ve suggested more than once here, salvage trades – that is, anything that involves taking the leftovers of industrial civilization and turning them into something that people need or want – will likely be among the major growth industries of the next century or two, and the ground floor is open for business right now. Still, the advantage that comes to mind just at the moment is the one suggested by the holiday fireworks I mentioned toward the beginning of this post. Not uncommonly in history, people face a choice between being comfortable and dependent, on the one hand, and poor and free on the other. It’s been a particularly important theme in American history, driving phenomena as different as the settling of the Appalachians and the counterculture of the Sixties, and I’ve come to think that it’s going to become a live issue again in the decades ahead of us.<br><br>In time to come, those who cling to the narrowing circle of scarcity industrialism will likely discover that most of the freedoms that remain to them are going to have to be handed over as part of the cost of admission; those who choose otherwise – and there will be a range of other options, though you won’t learn that from the mainstream media – will have to give up a great many expectations and privileges that are standard issue in the industrial world just now in order to preserve some degree of autonomy and individual choice. That’s the way the future looks to me, at least; if I’m right, the simple act of salvaging energy by buying used goods instead of new ones – a step that Ben Franklin would have appreciated, interestingly enough – might just turn out to be a useful step in the direction of the ideals that some of us, at least, were celebrating a few nights ago. We’ll talk more about this in the weeks ahead.

I hesitate a lot at electronic gear and cars, precisely because there is no ability to return them if they start to fall apart immediately. (Though I have a friend who swears that the deal she got from a rental car firm –including a warrantee – was an incredible deal. Wish they rented trucks; I’d get a used one.) It’s already really frustrating to deal with the complexities of machines I can’t fix (I used to do my own hardware upgrades/fixes on the 80’s computers); I get nightmares thinking about a huge purchase like a car that goes bad in a year. But your theory is very sensible – I just need to find a really reliable consulting mechanic before my ’98 truck dies. I shop for 95% of my clothes and household needs at thrift stores and garage sales, if I can’t find it free – and yes, it does save a lot of money!!

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c7235865956235224665></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/12182219187951871203 rel=nofollow>Unknown</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I just got back from visiting friends in Michigan, some of whom already make a habit of living in the salvage economy (via garage sales and surplus stores) and have done so for years. This time, we visited a "shopping mall" for the Amish a few counties away, and while my frugal friend was hunting for roving in the sewing store, I found a very interesting book on the book rack.<br><br>It seems that back in the '30's, an enterprising soul realized that there were a huge number of sacks-- for flour, sugar, etc-- that were being used once and then thrown away. He came up with the idea of making these sacks out of fabric that would be suitable for sewing into clothes, and printing the labels on them in washable ink. He then patented the process.<br><br>The idea took off like gangbusters-- to the point where commodity manufacturers competed with each other to come out with new and appealing flour sack color patterns to draw their customers. Flour sack sartoriality prospered right up until the '50's, when the consumerist culture took over.<br><br>I was really struck by this story, at how frugal and resourceful our American ancestors used to be. The last 60 years truly has been a cultural aberration.<br><br>Your essay about the used car really struck home for me. My parents were of the "buy it new then drive it till it drops" school and so am I. If I buy it new, I can break it in correctly; then if I take proper care of it, I can drive it for a very long time. My parents' cars generally lasted 20 years in snowy salty Michigan. Of course, my Dad grew up in the (first) Depression, so I guess that is where that philosophy came from!<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c7235865956235224665 title="comment permalink">7/6/11, 9:05 PM</a><br><br>

One of the upper limits on technology in the salvage age will be just how complex a device you or the people you know can repair. So many modern machines can't be repaired at all; it's probably best for those to be parted out for scrap.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c6777544384770859252 title="comment permalink">7/6/11, 9:06 PM</a><br><br>

It's like gold to me and I keep bringing it in here and the top soil is starting to look pretty good. I still can't understand that people don't recognise it for what it is. Our nutrient cycle is truly broken.<br><br>Anyone promoting electric vehicles should be forced to live with battery technology of some sort. It will change their minds. <br><br>Some fun facts for people here:<br><br>People think batteries recharge in a similar way to refilling a fuel tank. Not so. A battery will accept upto 85% of it's total capacity in a reasonably quick fashion, however the last 15% will be slow. I don't add more than 10% of the total battery capacity in any hour. However, the final 15% capacity can take days of surplus solar production to recharge. Overcharging a battery can damage it permanently.<br><br>Most electric vehicles are designed to be too heavy because they ape a petrol powered vehicle and as such have a limited range of around 160km to 200km. Still I reckon that's a long way, but you need to remember the earlier point about recharging - that last 15% can be a problem and there is no recharging during power outages either. An electric vehicle should look like a motor assisted push bike or a go kart at the very most to keep the weight down. <br><br>Most electricity has a fossil fuel subsidy - even hydro and wind. If there's no oil, or restricted oil then those renewable electricity sources will stop too.<br><br>The amount of electricity used by an electric vehicle during one complete cycle of it's battery cannot be supplied by a small scale solar power system. It needs to be a pretty big system to cope with recharging an electric vehicle. My system at home would overload after about 1/2 hour if I connected up one of the vehicle chargers.<br><br>People over the past few weeks have commented on nickel iron batteries and it might be worth pointing out that whilst they have an extremely long life and they are very robust, they only return 40% of the energy that you put into them. As a comparison lead acid batteries return about 80%. Still nickel iron batteries would be easier to make at home and these are the compromises that we all have to learn to live with.<br><br>For anyone interested in some entertaining and informative reading on electric vehicles and their dirty little secret have a look at:<br><br>http://permaculture.org.au/2011/03/28/a-solar-powered-life-part-iv-the-dirty-little-secret/<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c5191801425488191984 title="comment permalink">7/6/11, 10:21 PM</a><br><br>

According to Jane Holtz Kay, author of <i>Asphalt Nation: How the Automobile Took over America and How we can Take It Back</i>, in the mid-1990's German researchers examined the environmental impact of a middle-class German car thru 3 stages--manufacturing, road use, and disposal.

Despite Greenpeace's efforts to scare everyone into thinking that nuclear is a terrible beast, the new breeder reactors are actually the safest option for clean energy available.

It's a heavy half ton, four wheel drive set up for hauling and towing. While the stable continues to work I'll need to haul horses, hay, etc. <br><br>I recall seeing a motorcycle junk yard around here and I'm thinking of hitting it to buy several junked motor bikes. I could use the front wheels, forks and hand brakes for a cart for one of the horses. What's left over will go into the bone yard where the old truck and maybe the horse trailers will go to be raided for usable parts and metal later. There's a lot of good sheet metal in horse trailers. <br><br>I just bought a brand new computer, I'll need it for the stable.

I'm just starting out at making a living in the salvage economy. I find, repair, refurbish &amp; sell old &amp; secondhand items of craft equipment - sewing machines, spinning wheels, looms etc - and also teach people how to use them. The subtext is getting people to think about the things we've been throwing "away" in a different light, something like using those beautiful old flour-sacks for patchwork quilts, rather than driving to an expensive store to buy brand-new fabric to cut into tiny pieces. And it's taking off, slowly but surely; two ar three years ago it was just a pin-money-earning hobby but now I'm as busy as I want to be, and could make a lot more money if I didn't have a home, garden &amp; family to care for too.<br><br>It's probably easier over here (UK) than it would be in the States, in that we've never completely lost the habit of re-using stuff; I've never owned a brand-new car in my life but all my vehicles have been as reliable as any car could be. So there's not the same resistence to buying "used" goods and it's not seen as a sign of failure, just a slight eccentricity. What particularly encourages me is that I sell a lot &amp; give tutorials to young people, often students, not just to older people who remember how much better-made, reliable &amp; controllable older tools were. And there are many teenagers who really want to learn to knit or crochet or spin or sew, not just the design, marketing &amp; packaging of items as they are taught in "Textiles" at school.<br><br>So. over here at least, the Salvage Economy is beginning to get under way, and the signs are encouraging.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c9111231689392466697 title="comment permalink">7/7/11, 1:32 AM</a><br><br>

I got some plastic cladding, ideal for the garage door frame, timber for the garden for stepped planters, boards for a flat bed trolley I want, (already got some cast-off casters and an extending handle from a damaged trolley bag), two 2 foot square plant pots, a large slatted pine shelf stack unit which will be getting the green wood treatment for a potted plant rack, a small plastic garden table, a ply box for supporting two growbags on end (apparently the roots go deeper that way), half a dozen empty, never used hanging baskets, a large ceramic cooking pot and lid, some chicken wire, and best of all, two good quality office chairs for my hobby room, and spare casters from a third. Still looking for some hi fi speaker stands, a bird table, and a vanity unit washbasin in white, though. I daresay £300+ if I'd gone to the sadly bankrupt Focus DIY store and apparently solvent Staples office supply big box store for all the stuff I did find. <br><br>£300 for an hour's gentle labour? I almost felt like a Merchant Banker.<br><br>Regarding the new car vs clunker argument... I’ll admit to buying a new car last year – a performance diesel based on a VW Golf. Part of the argument for buying it was what I know is the currently low cost of the embodied energy in manufacture, and the 20% improvement in fuel efficiency it offered, (80 mpg if driven gently!) and not least, the current negative return on savings. And that it would last longer, probably to the point where fuel becomes no longer available / affordable. Therefore, the case for buying it essentially rests on whether that point is reached is in 5 or 15 years time. The downside is the complexity of the engine electronics, which makes me dependent on the Main Stealer to maintain it, and yes, I did remember your writings on complexity/ fragility from a while back. But so far, the decision looks good, as the forecourt price has increased 25% in six months, due to increased sales taxes, and manufacturer discounts being ended. A neat trick to have a new car actually appreciate in value... <br><br>I’m now looking for a furry toy Womble* mascot (unavoidably made in China) to put on the dashboard. <br><br>*For the benefit of your mostly US readership - Wombles are true pioneers of the Salvage Society. Best described in the Americanese as ‘cute furry critters’, they live in burrows, where they help the environment by collecting and recycling discarded items in useful and ingenious ways.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wombles<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c8759660503099655604 title="comment permalink">7/7/11, 2:43 AM</a><br><br>

I've been giving a good bit of thought to the topic of voluntary poverty. Currently, my green wizardry efforts are being pursued within a reasonably affluent town in the North East. We've done a lot - heat, big garden, food preservation, chickens, some solar - but we haven’t yet really offended our neighbors’ sensibilities. At least I don’t think we have. They just think we’re a little nutty but still holding hands with the prosperity/growth/recovery consensus. <br><br>I sense a new phase ahead of us, though, where we cross some sort of dividing line and declare independence, and a clearly declared preference for poverty and economic de-growth will tend to do that. I’m actually wondering whether it would just be easier to sell up and go do this in a community that is already further down the prosperity ladder, by reason of not having climbed very high in the first place. But that will bring its’ own challenges.<br><br>There was an old British sitcom from the 1970's called "The Good Life" where a couple opt out of suburban mores while still living in an upscale London suburb. You can see episodes on You Tube and it still makes me smile. Voluntary poverty was certainly embraced, but since this was a sitcom the endings were all happy. I’m concerned about the tensions in our community as one set of folks start to head to the economic exits, while the rest are running faster and faster to stay in place. I’m probably worrying too much, and it won’t stop me from continuing to downshift, but it will be interesting to see how that tension plays out.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c545626823978432653 title="comment permalink">7/7/11, 2:58 AM</a><br><br>

Thankfully in far away Mauritius we still do have the habit of passing round used items to friends and family.

I can't unfortunately remember where I've read this otherwise I'd give you that reference. You could probably reasonably extend this concept to the second hand marketplace. The local economy is worth investing in because you'll at least get to know who you're living around. I always try and support farm gate sales here as the produce is awesome. <br><br>There is one place near me that sells tomatoes grown in poly tunnels between December and early June (remember I'm in the Southern hemisphere). There's another place (and it's my guilty pleasure) that sells locally grown strawberries between November and May. The taste is better than any other strawberries that I get anywhere. Unfortunately it means that I can't buy strawberries anywhere else now - there are about 50+ odd plants growing here now in a special strawberry bed. Mmmm strawberries (blackberries work better here though).<br><br>Thanks very much for the effort you put into "The Wealth of Nature" I really enjoyed it. As I said before it confirmed my world view, however I really enjoyed the final chapter as it appealed to my professional sense as well. Australian's are having difficulties coming to grips with proposed carbon taxes to charge for damage to the primary economy. There's a lot of outrage here, although I feel that it is a logical thing to do. <br><br>Unfortunately your earlier mention of the workings of the economists left me with the mental image of Deep Thought and its' advice to Magic Thighs and Broom fundle about how to become top rating pundits. Very sage!<br><br>When I was a lot younger, I used to talk with my mates over AM CB (27Mhz) radio's at night. The communication method for this forum kind of reminds me of those days. Incidentally the SSB (single side band) versions used to be able to bounce their signals off the ionosphere and you could end up speaking to people from massive distances away - you don't see the AM CB radio's used much anymore these days as most people use UHF. This is off topic but kind of interesting anyway. I must look up ham radio's one day - I was a massive geek when younger and used to build my own amplifiers and radio's from kits chasing the hi fi dream (remember AM Stereo!) - not good for my own hearing though.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c8758872395349029793 title="comment permalink">7/7/11, 3:14 AM</a><br><br>

I hate to dismiss anyone's low tech idea, but feel compelled to comment on the suggested chemical dehumidifier. Using road salt? <br><br>There are any number of chemicals on the lab shelf that will take up humidity if expossed to air. They turn into a wet sloppy mess. Many of them are salts of one kind or another. <br><br>The problem with using this method to dehumidify a house, is that you are going to really need a lot of whatever salt you are using and you'll need to dispose of the brine -- you see, it gets back to thermodynamics. You can't decrease the entropy of your humid house without increasing the entropy of something else, in this case the salt. <br><br>Around the lab, if we have something small and precious that can be kept in a small confined space, and must be kept dry, we might use Calcium Sulfate (gypsum or plaster of paris). <br><br>It has some advantages -- gypsum is not readily soluble in water, and the hydrate does not become a liquid mess. You can bake the moisture out of the hydrate and re-use your CaSO4 many times. <br><br>But as I was saying, you'll need to invest some energy if you want to dehumidify a whole house.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c4422265801140647881 title="comment permalink">7/7/11, 4:58 AM</a><br><br>

So far, at age 31, I’ve been true to my intentions. At least in my case, it’s been actually way easier not having a car than if I had one. <br><br>The occasional time I’m elsewhere where a TV is on and I see car commercials, I’ve noticed cars are advertised as being synonymous with freedom. I find the opposite to be true—not having a car has made me feel free in so many ways. There’s financial freedoom: don’t have to worry about paying for the car, insurance, repairs, gas, parking tickets, speeding tickets, parking and garage fare. Then of course there’s all the many environmental reasons. And I don’t have to worry about gettting in an accident or accidentally hitting a pedestrian or biker.<br><br>And not having a car reduces anxiety in my case. During my late teenage years and the few times I’ve driven as a adult, I found that driving made me anxious. While driving on two-lane backroads were manageable, I found that driving on complicated multi-line highway entanglements made me nervous, maybe more so than other people. I’m not naturally accustomed to the fast-paced way of making quick decisions and multi-tasking that you need to do when driving. I used to feel it was a sign of my own weakness that I never felt comfortable driving the way other people did, but now I’ve learned to feel less ashamed about my anxiety around driving. It’s a legitimate and natural psychological reaction to what is an unnatural situation.<br><br>Of course it helps that I live in a very walkable neighborhood in a city with good public transportation. It’s a four minute walk to a small members-only basement food co-op where I get the majority of my food, a seven minute walk to the Farmers Market, a ten minute walk to the public library, a five minute walk to forests where I can hike and almost forget I live in the city, and many bus lines and a couple metro stations are just a few minutes walk from my house. The current paid work I do takes me to different households; oftentimes I can walk to work, or sometimes public transportation is a more feasible means of getting there.<br><br>I attended the ASPO conference last year, and while a few there were exclaiming that they took the train instead of flying, I can actually say I walked to the conference some of the days (about a four-mile walk from my house)! Walking is condusive to good thinking, and walking to and/or home from the ASPO conference helped me reflect on everything discussed. (I see that the conference will be in my city again this year, so I should be able to easily attend again!)<br><br>I’m actually not a city person at heart, and there’s a part of me that wants to move to a smaller town in a more rural area in the future. But I have to admit, the walkability and the ease of car-free living where I currently live is one of the main things keeping me here for the time being. If I do move, walkability will be high on my priority list when choosing where to live.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c5947811498354091945 title="comment permalink">7/7/11, 6:57 AM</a><br><br>

The expertise and ecological footprint required to repair, re-purpose, or salvage some use from existing engines is orders of magnitude less than that required to produce new ones. I suspect that even if the entire fleet of US passenger vehicles could be replaced with 100mpg equivalent models, the up front material and energy cost of doing so would be greater than realized savings. There simply seems to be no need to manufacture any more cars at all, ever. Imagine the useful and productive purpose all that excess industrial capacity could be put. Thermal solar for everyone, and railway revitalization, for just a couple of examples.<br><br>Because older vehicles are much simpler, they are much easier to keep running than newer models. The salvage model also works quite well in this respect, the old parts being generally less expensive. The old vehicle up on blocks (out of the rusting wet), or better yet in a shed, as a source of parts for the still running twin is a tried and true economy. So, don't trade your failing hooptie for scrap $, acquire a more functional same make and model jalopy.<br><br>At the end of the fossil fuel run, the trickle of available vegetable oil and wood gas can be used in simple durable engines such as the <a href=http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001011.php rel=nofollow> Lister.</a><br><br>Great point Bill regarding housing.

So you might as well go with the flow.<br><br>The way I see it, making due with LESS comes down to sacrificing the two C's: comfort and convenience. Over time you can learn to be comfortable with LESS. However, for the vast majority of Americans forsaking comforts and conveniences will run counter to the dominant cultural norms. For example, biking to work in the rain is less comfortable and convenient than driving to work in the rain. Oppessive humidity is less comfortable than air conditioning. Making dinner from scratch is less convenient than ordering take-out. <br><br>We know that a third C - cost - will force many to involuntary relinquish comfort and convenience.

I think it was the least expensive car available at that time. At that point in my life I had 2 young children and was overloaded restoring an old farmhouse, and my crap old vehicle was demanding too much of my time. It still runs very well, but then it was carefully chosen for fuel economy, basic simplicity and ease of repair (which it has thankfully not needed much of).<br><br>Repairing things is maybe the one true skill I have, sometimes it seems my whole world is filled with things that need to be fixed. We could never afford to pay someone to do the repairs we need, our budget simply could not support it. Likewise we could not afford to replace everything that fails either. While it is often frustrating when something fails (I'm often found ranting “can't I ever just use something, must I always fix it first?), I know that repairing equipment is a valuable skill, and one that used to be commonplace. It takes time to learn how things are made and how they come apart, so once you've figured that out the object becomes relatively more valuable to you.<br><br>Based on that experience, I'm fairly careful in the kinds of equipment I will accept, whether it be by purchase or salvage, because eventually that thing will place demands on my time. Therefore I look for things that are assembled in such a way that I can take it apart, made with materials that are durable, and do not contain unneeded complexity, etc. Often times that means older products are preferred. Many of the “advances” in newer products have nothing to do with improving functionality, and are instead about reducing the cost of parts and manufacture. The product itself is often inferior.<br><br>I've got quite a collection of old computers I've acquired, mostly because I couldn't see them go to the dump or shipped to Asia so children could take them apart. They all work fine, although mostly I do not need them. My laptop was built from about 6 machines that were being disposed of by my employer, plus some extra bits bought on eBay, running Linux. I've got so many spare parts that I should be able to keep it running for a long time.<br><br>Lastly, remember that entropy cannot be defeated – whenever you fix something, entropy requires that something else somewhere in the world must fail. The law of unintended consequences usually requires that it be something else you own.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c1113342607842285259 title="comment permalink">7/7/11, 7:36 AM</a><br><br>

At dusk I biked over to the local park where people often practice tai chi at the center of a group of widely spaced maples and oaks. This evening it was empty, but years of people practicing tai chi have given the place a special feeling--like there's extra chi there. The fireflies were flickering.<br><br>While doing a qigong exercise I happened to look at the street; there was a man on a recumbent bike riding along, and behind the bike was a long trailer (at least as long as a car) on which was an unidentifiable tarp-covered load. The whole thing looked inevitable, from his energy-saving posture to the tail-lights on the back, as he glimmered along, half visible in the deepening twilight.<br><br>Re embedded energy: <br>I once read that you must drive a new prius at least 40,000 miles before you get to where you're actually saving energy with the hybrid gas system. So I'd imagine something similar for electric cars.<br><br>Re buying used: <br>Twenty-five years ago we bought an inexpensive 100-year-old "used" house in a "used" "streetcar suburb" near the el to Chicago. No regrets.<br><br>Some of my gardening tools were previously owned either by my husband's mother or grandma.<br><br>I do buy new things--like the mason jars I got the other week: they'll last a really, really long time and it beats weeks of fruitless searching at garage sales. And I wear my own vintage clothes I bought new years ago and haven't worn out yet.

Most of the stuff you find in goodwill (which now seems to be run like a for-profit corporation) these days is worn-out, cheap junk that isn't worth the $9.99 price tag. Of course there are diamonds in the rough, but my thrift-store experiences have become less and less fruitful over the years.<br><br>As with anything, it pays to be savvy. I have no problem finding most if not all of my new retail goods at 50-75% off. I still work in the "you must look like Dilbert" office world, so dressing relatively well is a priority for me to keep my job. I've been able to shop sales though and stay fashionable on the cheap, often for only a few more dollars than buying worn-out clothes at the thrift-store. Latest score was a brand new pair of khakis for $13.13 w/ tax that should last for 3+ years of wear. I don't feel good about contributing to the corporations, but I figure if I'm paying $13 for a $70 pair of pants, I'm not giving them that much support. I don't expect this to be available "forever", but as abundance-industrialism meets deflation, there will be some great deals to be had in the near-term.<br><br>Anyway, just a little hat-tip towards looking for the cheapest way to do what works for you...often that is paying a few more bucks to get something of higher quality to begin with, when it's on a deep discount, and then using it up, wearing it out, etc.<br><br>The other maxim of course is to just make do with less and only buy things that have a very long service life...cast-iron pots and pans, more simple devices, repairable electronics, etc. <br><br>And take good care of what you buy.

You've rounded down the efficiency of internal combustion engines -- most sources I've seen put the average around 25% -- and rounded up the efficiency of electrical batteries, motors, etc. Even if you were right, you've got maybe a 4% gain in efficency to balance against the fact that the coal and natural gas burnt in power plants have far less energy density per unit volume than petroleum -- to get the same amount of electricity, for example, you have to burn three times as much coal as bunker oil -- and so you're producing more CO2 to drive your e-car that you'd produce with a conventional car. <br><br>Cracked, repeating the claim that breeder reactors are a good idea doesn't make it true, you know.

As a matter of fact I probably won't be living here too much longer but if any budding Green Wizards fancied a sure thing business idea here I'd be happy to point them in the right direction as I have one or two contact in the city's environment department. <br><br>Regarding salvaging old cars it strikes me that now is the perfect time to go for it seeing as you can take advantage of the internet to learn how to bring back to life a dead car. Even complete novices (like myself) can use some of the tutorials on YouTube to, say, replace alternators, fan belts and the like. Like other posters have noted, older cars tend to be better because they are more easily fixable. I used to own a VW Kombi, and was able to do some fairly serious work on it - thanks to some clear tutorials.<br><br>If you really need a car go for something pretty ubiquitous because spares will be easy to come by. <br><br>I'm currently considering the idea of investing in used car alternators. Given that they are relatively cheap at the moment, and that they are quite compact and easy to store, I'd be willing to bet that they are one of the few things that will keep value over time.

Here in Europe it's a little different in that old houses tend to be more valuable than new ones, but you can still find run down semi-ruins going for a song. I personally couldn't imagine living in a new house ... to me houses are like good wines and get better with time - the older the better (once you brush away the cobwebs). Saying that, many of the modern houses I see being built won't get better with time - so it might just be a case of making the best of what you've got.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c1682027901785274774 title="comment permalink">7/7/11, 1:05 PM</a><br><br>

Ah... another 70s flashback, along with my own childhood memories of The Wombles. Evidence that at least here in the pre-Corporate UK of 40 years ago, there were some Green shoots... Even now, ‘The Good Life’ is often referred to in general discussions of self-sufficiency. An idealistic husband, practical (and attractive) wife, friendly and put-upon corporate wage-slave neighbour, and his hideously social climbing, rather horrified, and condescending wife... Such a potent mix for a sitcom - we Brits used to do them so well back then!<br> <br>On which, I’d thoroughly recommend Porridge, (prison life) Open All Hours, (corner shop, now largely extinct) The Rise and Fall of Reginald Perrin, (corporate life toady turns bad) Yes Minister, / Prime Minister, (political and bureaucratic chicanery) and Dad’s Army (a class comedy set in the Home Guard reserve forces of WW2), and Are You Being Served, (Department Store life). Though the best sitcom ever, never to be surpassed, was the woefully mismanaged Fawlty Towers hotel. I fully expect the classic scripts of that will be performed by storytellers to the Ruinmen around the camp fires of Stars Reach. <br> <br>And to think we even gave the world a classic salvage society sitcom - Steptoe and Son. They were what we called Rag and Bone men, both in poverty, the clinging, reliant old man with disgusting habits, opposing an aspirational son, to nicely set up the comedy tension. Though I’d imagine that by the late 60s / early 70s when that was written, rag and bone were no longer the valuable items they once were...<br> <br>Hey... you guys owe us some back! The only worthwhile US sitcoms I can recall were set in a field hospital, bar and radio station...

Which is good, because it is trying to be much richer that puts all our lives in jeopardy, and being even greatly poorer might actually mean an increase in life expectancy (if it removes junk food and adds some exercise). <br>I think that finding tricks and techniques to work with our mend-and-make-do evolutionary patchwork brains might be just as valuable as the tricks and techniques of energy harvesting and salvage.

I just took my first full, long, hot, bona fide 100% solar heated shower, a 30 minute test of our now nearly completed system. Our previous system was solar assisted, feeding pre-heated water to a tankless propane water heater, and had been off-line for over a year: one of my semi-false starts; useful but not efficient. The salvaged 70's era collectors had deteriorated beyond repair.<br><br>As I posted a couple of weeks ago, I used parts of the old collectors to construct new ones, ala BuilditSolar, modified. I've been testing the one fully completed collector for for about a week with great results. Two days ago I flushed and refilled the storage system (450 gal. poly tank) with cold, fresh water and replaced the heat exchanger loop with 120' of 3/4" soft copper tubing (puchased new about 6 years ago for this purpose) and tied it into our potable water plumbing this morning. I've turned the tankless water heater off and bypassed it.<br><br>In two fairly overcast days the storage tank temperature had risen to 112 degrees (f). I measured the hot water at our shower at 111 degrees, so the heat exchanger works well. After over 20 minutes of shower time (about 2gpm), the tank temp was still at 112 (about a foot below the high water level, where the heat exchanger is). <br><br>Since I'm still constructing two more panels and haven't finished insulating everything, output and efficiency will improve quite a bit. <br><br>This is a very simple and robust drainback system, non-glycol, single pump, made with mostly salvaged and used stuff. Anyone with a few basic skills can do this. It's a big step for us as it will cut our propane use by perhaps 90% or more. We're getting very close to total energy self-sufficiency, mostly solar. <br><br>Keeping my nose to the gridstone ;-)<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c3070173108667026800 title="comment permalink">7/7/11, 1:48 PM</a><br><br>

All in all, it sounds like you and your husband are doing the work -- thank you for that encouragement. <br><br>Bill, thank you. I appreciate hearing from someone who can still think outside the extremes. <br><br>Beneath, I was one of the people who came to ASPO last year by train; I may try walking it one of these years, since the C&amp;O Canal Trail runs from here to there -- granted, it's a good 180-plus miles, but it would be quite a little adventure. As for small and medium sized towns, if you get one that's been around for a while it can be entirely walkable. <br><br>Craig, bingo. In fact, once you get past the psychological barriers, buying things used becomes a good deal more entertaining, since it's less predictable. <br><br>Larry, thank you. As it happens, I'll be talking about health and fitness a few weeks from now; as you've probably already guessed, my suggestions are not going to be anything like the standard ones. Stay tuned!<br><br>Lloyd, I think you're quite correct on that. <br><br>Planner, the interesting thing is that you actually don't have to give up much in the way of comfort or convenience. What you have to give up is the specific forms of comfort and convenience that Americans today are used to. That is to say, it's mostly a matter of fashion, and will change as fashions do. That's why I think it's so important that people get to work now, and provide good examples of how it's possible to live comfortably and well with a lot less energy, stuff and stimulation; as the industrial world winds down, they'll be the models that others will follow. <br><br>Twilight, have you considered a second career as a bodger? Along the lines of Thriftwizard's comment earlier, there are a lot of very good used items that could be cleaned up, reconditioned, put in fine working order, and sold or bartered to those who need them. <br><br>Jack, true enough!<br><br>Dick, you're most welcome! Glad to hear you're one of the wizards!<br><br>Adrian, there <i>is</i> extra ch'i there; it's a common side effect of that kind of practice.

Mind you, your other points are excellent, and will be coming up soon. <br><br>Raven, it's called the professionalization of dissent, and pervades the current activist scene. Gah. <br><br>Petro, glad to hear it. Another thing to point out to your favorite Mises fan is that salvage economics is the free market at its best -- small businesses and individual customers interacting, with none of the corporate welfare that pervades the rest of the economy. <br><br>Watcher, that's an interesting idea, but you'll have to take it up with those who understand dogs, which I don't. An animal that naturally feeds fairly high on the food chain might be a bit of a challenge unless you have plenty of animal protein to spare, though. <br><br>Bill, our 1925 bungalow is a bit more complex, but not much; nearly all the pipes can be accessed directly from the basement, for example. When we were househunting, my wife and I had a rule: nothing built after the Second World War. It served us well. <br><br>DPW, let's hear it for synchronicity. <br><br>Cvncvbn, heck of a good question -- I don't have the knowledge to offer an answer, and a great deal would depend on where you live and what local electrical resources are like. <br><br>Kieran, that sounds like a real possibility.

I’ve been working on setting up a local community garden (allotment), and it has been fun to see various gardeners go from a “that’s my shovel” mindset to a more communal approach in about 3-4 weeks. It’s just a lot easier to put all the shovels together in a corner and take one when you need it, than it is to cart your tools back and forth to your home. They’d better keep their hands off my good compost, though. ☺<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c4695299022597716131 title="comment permalink">7/7/11, 5:08 PM</a><br><br>

That’s true whether it’s conservatism, liberalism, moderatism, radicalism, Christianity, Druidry, free market-ism, American democracy, American freedom, whatever.<br><br>One of the reasons why the peak oil (and peak other things too…) issue interests me to a much greater degree than any other issue I’ve cared about is because it hasn’t (at least not entirely) been characterized as a movement of one end of the political spectrum. I see that as potentially more powerful. If I talk about my concern about climate change (which I am concerned about) I’m often automaticallly assumed to be a leftist. This strikes me as odd, because I think being truly conservative should mean one should be concerned about climate change!<br><br>I find it inspiring that some people from different parts of the political spectrum are speaking up and taking action about peak oil. I admire Roscoe Bartlett, a very conservative Republican from your district, who I think is being true to his conservative ideals, unlike most politicians who claim to be conservative. I just watched a 60-minute youtube speech he made at a Congressional hearing:<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9maqiPVxdsI&amp;feature=related<br><br>I’m thankful for his commitment and courage (even if I don’t agree with some details of his views, such as his support for more nuclear power).<br><br>Some political issues that have become very polarized weigh me down, and even when I do identify with one side more than the other. There is a lack of creativity in all ends of the political sphere in dealing with contentious issues. And I’m not implying that the supposed “middle ground” of certain polarized issues is always the best answer either. Being creative politically means not repeating the same arguments and tactics over and over again thinking that it will effect change, no matter how “right” a stance may be… Sometimes I think it’s important to acknowledge that certain people disagree and are not going to easily change, accept that, and creatively work with that disagreement instead of trying to force political agreement. Maybe this relates to your discussion of dissensus as a powerful tool sometimes too, and that there are limits to what working for consensus can achieve.<br><br>I myself have often avoided aligning myself too closely with any single political label or party, even though I acknowledge that political parties and labels can have a useful purpose to a certain extent. The only political label I wear is being a registered independent and I’m suspicious of ideologues of any kind. In some ways I could say my views are liberal, in some ways moderate, in some ways conservative, in some ways radical, and sometimes all simultaneously. It depends more on what people actually mean by those political labels…<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c7090666715042670262 title="comment permalink">7/7/11, 5:17 PM</a><br><br>

I think that's the situation a lot of thinking people find themselves in, particularly as they are surrounded by more and more zombies spouting the reactionary political rhetoric they heard on TV or talk radio last night. It's very easy to get cynical facing down that every day. It doesn't help either when national-level politicians brand anyone who isn't a rural, gun-owning, white Evangelical Christian as "not a real American."<br><br>As you well know, the salvage economy is already what they do in much of the so-called "developing" world. A few months ago there was the story of the old Georgian babushka who was digging for buried cable to sell for scrap and ended up knocking out the internet for the entire country of Armenia. A sobeing thought for those who think the Internet will always be with us even in the age of energy descent. In fact, I recently heard that the single largest portion of the Georgian economy is selling off scrap from Soviet-era detritus.<br><br>Fortunately, growing up poor, I never expected anything more for myself than the basics, no matter what my income. It's helped me out in this economy, and kept me from a lot of mistakes, although initially it had little to do with being environmentally conscious and more to do with just not having money. I've never owned a new car - it makes no financial sense to do so. The minute you drive it off the lot, it's literally lost several thousands of dollars in value. I was always told to buy a car between 3-5 years old - old enough that the most steep depreciation has taken place, but still new enough to avoid major mechanical problems. Let the big shots have their new cars, and the 60-hour weeks to pay for them, I say.<br><br>I can tell you that there is already one segment of America living this way and it's growing rapidly - Mexican immigrants. I live in an area of town alongside the vast swaths that have become outposts of Mexico, and one of the reasons they can work for such low wages while having massive amounts of children is because of extreme fugality and cooperation. Need a place to live? Somone knows someone who is renting out a place cheap. Need work? Someone you know will get it under the table, paid in cash, no questions asked. Food is bought at the local market - whole food, cooked at home - beans, rice, menudo, etc. They borrow money from friends and relatives until payday. If they need car repairs, someone's friend or neighbor will do it for cheap. Yards are full of used baby clothes, toys, bikes, etc. for sale. Kids wear hand-me-downs. There is a vast informal economy - people cook and take care of children out of their homes. If you put something out on the corner, you can bet it will be gone by the next day to its new home. There is no shame in any of this; it's part of the culture. Most of these immigrants were on the bottom tier of society in their native country, so they feel no need to put on airs like most status-conscious Americans. Due to the discrepancy in birth rates between White and Hispanic Americans, in thirty years' time, most children will have grown up this way, outside of the privileged consumer economy of the suburbs. They will have been primed for the new paradigm, so to speak. As that day approaches, I think we'll see interesting cultural changes.

We’re in an older urban neighborhood (Rockford, IL), and we’re considering getting one or more draft dogs to help increase the amount of food that we can produce, both in our two adjacent yards and other vacant lots in the neighborhood. We’re hoping that the dog(s) can produce enough additional food calories to justify their continued existence, as well as provide transportation and protection. It may involve a long-term breeding program to develop a line that does well on a largely low-on-the-food-chain diet (high protein veggies like beans, etc.).<br><br>We researched every breed in the AKC, and came up with a short list that included two breeds we had never heard of (Bernese Mountain Dog and Bouvier des Flandres) and one that we both had when we were kids (German Shepherd Dog). We’ll probably get a Berner; they are a little better fit for our situation: a less active breed than the other two; a little more stoic; protective, but not aggressive. But Bouvier’s and GSD’s are both great breeds, as well; and the Bouvier, like the Berner, is very good at draft work.<br><br>Nothing against Siberian Huskies or GSD’s, but you may want to check out the homeowners insurance restrictions concerning dog breeds before you get a breed like the Siberian Husky or German Shepherd Dog.<br> <br>From: Breed Restrictions in Homeowners' Insurance | eHow.com http://www.ehow.com/info_8129504_breed-restrictions-homeowners-insurance.html#ixzz1RTD5NBcK<br>Restricted Breeds<br><br>"The list of dog breeds that may prevent an individual from securing homeowner's insurance includes the following breeds: Akita, Alaskan Malamute, chow chow, Doberman pinscher, German shepherd, American pit bull terrier, Presa Canario, Rottweiler, Siberian husky, Staffordshire bull terrier and wolfdogs, also known as wolf hybrids.

But perhaps, three topics.<br><br>EV vs ICE. Embedded energy probably a wash. Fuel? EV's don't have to waste energy idling. A good rule of thumb is 3 to 4 times less energy needed than ICE. BUT, and it's a big one. Where does the electricity come from? If it's a fossil fuel plant; a stationary plant, unlike a vehicle doesn't pay a weight penalty for very effective scrubbers on the exhaust stack. BUT, except for Natural Gas burning plants, the Coal Fired generators produce way more CO2 per KW than burning any petroleum product. Here in the Pac NW we get the bulk of our power from Hdro. Pretty benign, right? Wrong; hydro pretty much killed all the Columbia Salmon runs. Salmon is no longer poor people's food. When they built the dams they put in fish ladders, pretty fore-sighted eh? Turns out the problem is the smolts need the current to get to the sea in their first year. That being said; we traded cheap salmon for cheap power. Until they silt up I have no problem using the cheap power.<br>The more fundamental problem with any private vehicle is that it makes no sense for every adult in any country (but I'll take the U.S.A. where I live as a good bad example.) to own a 1 - 2 ton hunk of iron and drive it 10 - 50 miles every day. It's a wast of iron, at the least. But, several decades ago Wendell Berry said it was difficult to live in the country, and impossible to be a good neighbor without owning a motor vehicle in the 20th century U.S. The Amish manage it, but until the rest of us have that level of community and cooperation in a local area, most of us country dwellers will need at least one private motor vehicle per family.<br><br>New V.S. used. We do a lot of thrift store shopping, cruising through a variety of prices, quality and organization. Works pretty well. I buy my work clothes new, at a discount on line retailer (Sierra Trading Post). It's worth the cost for the wear I put on the clothes, I'm a carpenter and hard on clothes. I also buy tools new and used. I go for the best quality I can afford, I want them to last.<br><br>Voluntary poverty. I wish I could use the "money saved" for that wonderful {Fill in green tech item here, bought _or_ home made}. For many of us, it is a matter of simple survival, staying out of debt and being able to keep the land. "Take the money you saved and get a solar hot water system". Uh, never had the money, just making ends meet.<br><br>I think though, we are approaching a family threshold. We don't have quite enough self-sufficiency, and living in two worlds is killing our tiny budget. But a couple more years of garden improvement, a couple more years of infrastructure improvement (we started with raw land 7 years ago), and I think we'll be over the hump. Right now though, it looks a little grim.<br><br>Glenn,<br>Master of the<br>Sloop - Boat<br>FEATHER<br>and the<br>Terror<br>of<br>Scow Bay<br>Marrowstone Island<br>Jefferson County<br>Washington State<br>F.U.S.A.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c8992087942421764519 title="comment permalink">7/7/11, 7:31 PM</a><br><br>

Learn to make basic polenta, or leek soup, and then have the spices and extras to make it Spanish, or Thai, or Indian!

We have Johnson Grass, that in well-grown clumps can put seed heads as much as 8 feet high, and the leaves go up to six and seven feet high. Cows love the stuff; my pony likes the ends of the leaves, until they get three feet or so tall.<br><br>I have been cutting some with a two-hand scythe a friend gave me. About 10-20 minutes is all I can fit in between work and chores, and I am not used to actually working that hard. Scything might not need to be that much work, if I knew how to use one. Unfortunately, I haven't figured that part out yet. So I let the grass cure a day or two, turn it once or twice until "hay" dry, then pile an armful on the wheelbarrow using a field fork I picked up at a farm sale. (No one else there recognized a use for the thing.)<br><br>Then I wrap a piece of twine around the middle of the bundle. Sisal twine, a ball I picked up for $3 at Big Lots. I pull the string tight with a modified square knot, and call it a bale. The wheelbarrow just makes stacking the bundle simpler, getting the twine around, and then tying the bale without having to work on the ground. <br><br>I carry the 'bales' with the fork, and stack them in the barn.<br><br>The long grasses and haphazard arrangement make the bundle long and not too wieldy, but they hold together, stack fairly well, and I have a few hundred pounds of hay set by, after a bunch of staggered hay days.<br><br>In addition, the grass re-grows in the pasture where I cut it. And the pony has been enjoying the regrowth, too.<br><br>And, yes, the pony does appreciate the resulting hay. I checked that out, first thing.<br><br>I would like to stack more hay, but don't know how to build a stack, and I can't find anyone around here that will/can show me how.<br><br>@ Rita,<br><br>There is a National Ornamental and Miscellaneous Metals Association (NOMMA) at Nomma.Org that deals with various artisan kinds of metal working, including blacksmithing and commercial and artist metalworking.<br><br>The Artist Blacksmiths of North America at ABANA.org is a lively and vital organization, with several local and state chapters, and many events and people interested in sharing a love of forging metals.<br><br>Anvilfire.com is the online face of one of the blacksmith magazines.<br><br>(Note: The local Wal-Mart store has a sale on double-bags of charcoal for $7.50, in case he wants to forge with store-bought charcoal).<br><br>Luck!<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c9057865368033157783 title="comment permalink">7/8/11, 1:01 AM</a><br><br>

Dogs do NOT need a lot of meat, or any for that matter. They're omnivores, and you can actually do damage by feeding too much meat. I personally know of a dingbat who killed a dog that way.<br><br>I make about 3/4 of my dog's (~75# lab mix) food from scratch. You will find a lot of recipes, I'm sure, but the most serious dog lover I know does thirds of ground meat, brown rice, and greens. I personally think that's way too much meat.<br><br>I think the key is about equal portions of protein food and grain. For the protein food, I generally use whatever scraps are handy, supplemented by deer meat (esp the heart and liver, which I save for that purpose), but dairy, beans, nuts (Bruno likes pecans, which grow wild around here), the soft end bones from chicken, marrow, all work good.<br><br>Brown rice is probably ideal for the carb, but I use whatever's handy: leftover noodles, moth-blown grains, weevely flour, bread scraps mixed in after cooking, etc. If you used a lot of legumes for the protein, that also takes care of some of the carb.<br><br>Most of the year, there is something going to waste in the garden. I personally don't think you can overdo the veggies. The dog is not going to get fat on them, and they beat a multivitamin any day. So I start with the biggest pot I have, filled to the brim with whatever green material is available that time of year: that includes leftovers, trim from the kitchen, culls from the garden, banana peels, melon rinds, wild weeds like dock, chickweed, clover, etc, carrot tops, and occasionally something bought for the purpose. Onions are a no-no, but garlic is OK if cooked, and is a good herb and mosquito repellant. I also throw in aromatic herbs, in his case, a few that have been recommended for his heartworms, which we are beating, BTW.<br><br>If I have any used cooking oil around, I add a few tablespoons for his coat.<br><br>When the pot is cooked down a bit, I add the meat and grains.

I was a reader of Paul Goodman {decent poverty) and Ivan Illich (tell me how fast you go and I'll tell you who you are.)<br><br>The worst mistake I ever made was to trade in my 3-speed Raleigh for a mountain bike. When my wrists and back got sore as I got older I just couldn't ride much. So I looked online - starting around Y2K - to see whether recumbent bikes were made for street use. I bought a used BikeE mountain bike dual shocks. It was just amazing on the flat, but I live in a hill town in Massachusetts. I am 5 miles from the centers of three little towns by the side of a stream and pond. Trouble is, all three towns are seriously uphill.<br><br>So, I looked online and found a guy who builds special purpose vehicles. There were no good electric systems back then so we bought a whole Currie electric folding bike - he got the folding bike and I got the electric system mounted on my BikeE. I think there is an old picture of me on that "Share the Road" website. From then on, it was a search for good batteries. Right now, I have a battery system that comes from China and is Lithium Iron Phosphate. <br><br>Since then, I have worked with the bike builder to create a really fine nomad trike, also with a batter back-up, relying upon sealed lead acid batteries. We tried to design an electric human-hybrid car and are pretty much stalled at this point. <br><br>Here's my summary of the situation for those who would like to have some of the functionality of a car but use human power and energy resources most efficiently:<br>1) The design must be based upon bicycle/airplane principles because weight is a huge issue. You will never be able to run big heavy vehicles on batteries in anything like a sustainable way. Most people have enough trouble peddling a heavy bike on the flat but going up hills, even with great gearing, is a huge challenge for most of us. Electricity should be used only as an assist and any vehicle should be able to be pedaled, at least on the flat. <br>2) Safety is a huge issue on anything but a two-wheeled bike. Trikes can flip quite easily and, if they are light enough to be pedaled they are light enough to go airborn over a big bump. I have had some spectacular crashes on my trike and my "human hybrid electric car." I have had an un-fused controller get stuck in the 'on' position so that I had to brake hard enough to burn out the motor while going downhill at 40 mph. <br>3) Weather protection is a big issue. You have to chose whether to cover yourself or the vehicle. If you are pedaling you are making extra heat and you need to ventilate. <br><br>I don't know whether anyone here is interested in pursuing a human-hybrid electric vehicle discussion, but I have been at it for a frustrating 12 years so I do have some interesting experiences to share plus at least two really cool vehicles. Of course, I am still so busy in the FIRE economy that there is never enough time to take the bike rather than the car.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c1875810584782368112 title="comment permalink">7/8/11, 7:19 AM</a><br><br>

As the energy age ends, I expect much of this will return to historical norms, see the recent bipartisan assault on New Deal entitlements, for instance, or the increasingly business friendly court rulings and hollowing out of regulatory agencies. <br><br>In other words, I think one could argue that it is not any particular set of ideals on a piece of paper that has made the United States less cruel or oppressive to its citizens over the past 70 years or so, but the same dynamics that afforded us a false sense of wealth.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c4375133350714864175 title="comment permalink">7/8/11, 1:18 PM</a><br><br>

If you need a car just now to build your own self-reliance in other ways, that's the way it is. <br><br>Miles, I wish. The books and other sources on magic that are available these days are either by people who don't practice it and thus don't have a clue what they're talking about, on the one hand, or primers for beginners that duck the hard philosophical issues in order to get people practicing. The lore we've got is fragmentary and often unclear, being basically the scraps that got missed when the bullyboys of the Scientific Revolution stomped Renaissance occultism into the gutter and kept on stomping. The last 150 years or so have been mostly about salvage operations and attempted reconstructions of basic practice and theory; there are a few people now getting beyond that, and trying to make sense of the philosophical implications of what magic does, but when I write my book on the subject -- which I will do eventually -- it's probably going to sell about twenty copies, total. Maybe in a couple of centuries, if a copy or two survives, it'll find its audience. <br><br>Hal, no, because it's not ideal forms or ideals that they're obsessed with -- it's arbitrary symbolic representations of inner states, mass-produced in cheap plastic. <br><br>Rbtp, because when you take the blue pill, you get a couple of years of pretty dreams, and then you find yourself starving to death in a burnt-out basement without the least idea what to do. <br><br>Justin, now go compare that history to the history of any other nation on the face of the earth. I'd remind you that long before the age of cheap energy, people came here from all over the world of their own free will, eagerly, because however bad it was here, it was much worse back home. Human beings are human beings; they very often don't treat one another well; what a set of ideals or a system of government can do, some of the time, is make things less awful than they would otherwise be -- and to my mind, that's worth celebrating. <br><br>Bill, that's very promising indeed! I'm not a great fan of piercings, but whatever does the job. <br><br>JD, the phrase "society of the spectacle" keeps coming to my mind, though that's probably just because I read a certain amount of Situationist literature back in the day.

I was suggesting that with the advent of American empire and the cheap energy age, the middle class in America received material largesse, and the nation generally could afford to grant more progressive rights and social programs for its citizens, that much of that appears to be rolling back, see Obama's recent attempts to cut Social security and so on.

Much of those migrations had to do with better economic prospects here. And I am suggesting that our political freedoms largely followed from our economic wealth.

That rings true for many of the other prior waves of immigrants, at least the ones that were not brought over in chains.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c8964739399588541472 title="comment permalink">7/8/11, 9:12 PM</a><br><br>

This tapers off in a few weeks to maybe one megawatt, which continues for a year or more. It's called 'decay heat'. A megawatt of concentrated heat energy. <br><br>Chalk it up to profligacy of scale, but when they are shut down, these power stations require a supply of electricity from somewhere else in order to dispose of the decay heat. If the cooling circuits fail, the heat will eventually burn through all containment in a spectacular system failure. <br><br>(for what it's worth I have heard that newer designs include a small turbine just to salvage this energy)<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c119459259916792434 title="comment permalink">7/9/11, 5:46 AM</a><br><br>

How much more efficiency do you need?"</i><br><br>Not so much efficiency as more capacity. Since the same hot water tank supplies the radiant floor system in winter, heated mainly by the woodstove, I want as much winter production as I can get, perhaps save a cord or more of wood each season. We have many marginal days, especially late fall and early spring, when the passive solar needs a boost and firing up the woodstove is overkill. During these periods, any solar overproduction gets dumped into our slab floor, starting with the bathrooms, keeping them nice and toasty. <br><br>Really cold periods here are usually clear and sunny as well. Combining a few hours of solar production with a few hours of firing the woodstove should save wood, at least that's the plan. I'm just making this up as we go along. So far, so good. <br><br>The great thing about hydronic heat, solar DHW and thermal mass is that it is adaptable to many inputs. This is why I think all homes should have one or more systems of thermal storage. It's pretty ancient technology, stone age really, as in heating rocks by the fire or in the sun.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c4211730098587648395 title="comment permalink">7/9/11, 5:58 AM</a><br><br>

It was the site for many movies starting with some of the old John Wayne serials ending with TV series'. Along with being tutored in horse training she was also taught to drive a four up in front of the stage coach. It isn't as easy as it looks and requires strength and good physical condition. <br><br>She's showing some signs of regaining more mobility which will allow her to use a set of long lines on a horse in harness. I was trying to get her to let me buy her a miniature stallion complete with cart and harness for a ridiculously low price so we could go out on some trails together but she kept telling me no. I felt bad that she doubted her ability to control a miniature horse. It's not that the sweet little boy would have been useless. I could think of several uses I could have put him to besides driving him in harness before things go to heck in a hand basket, standing him at stud or using him for photos with children as they did a hundred years ago. It would have worked out quite well since we have an antique pony saddle that was used in those photos and would add a bit more to my current income.<br><br>However with her current indications of returning feeling in her hand and leg I'm sure she'll get the chance to teach me eventually.<br><br>@Cherokee Organics,<br>I'm curious as to how you chose your name for your property.

An understanding or friendship with a non-human being widens perspective at the very least, and can with care and skill develop into a mutually beneficial working partnership. <br><br>More generally - while we enjoy excess, diversion of some small fraction to the maintenance of a companion animal is of little concern. But when we no longer do, sustaining the familiar will become more problematic. I have always created dog food from the remains of our meals; for example all that remains of a chicken processed through my kitchen is literally a small handful of clean bones and a few tablespoons of fat. But because even our relatively small dog can't get by on our refuse, some supplementary purchase (mostly kibble) is needed. Posters here have also shared their preparations, including bulk chicken parts and brown rice. In poverty these might be, like dry kibble, more than a little difficult to acquire and store in sufficient quantity. <br><br>Animals appreciate certainty, which generally means routine. If you don't have one, the relationship will be strained. Providing care for an animal is a lifetime contract: 'til death do you part, theirs, usually.

From an ethical standpoint, can we justify feeding a dog (or dogs) when we are reasonably sure that in the future, a significant number of human beings are going to starve because they can’t get food?

"Every household seemed to have one." And, not just rural households, but urban households, too. <br><br>When I was in "The Biz," not a week went by that someone didn't call with a sewing machine. Usually with inflated ideas as too the worth. As I often pointed out (at that time) about all they were good for was a stand for potted ferns. Or, some people would dispose of the innards and use the cabinet and elaborate iron part as the base for a vanity sink that would slip into one of those little pocket half baths under the stairs. There was a period of recent housing where that was pretty common. <br><br>Other things you run across a lot. Shoe last (sp?) kits. A cast iron post that would attach to a bench and several sizes of interchangeable shoe forms indifferent sizes. All in cast iron. I think I've seen hundreds, over the years. Not much retail value, but at one point people used to like to scatter them in a decorative manner around the fireplace. <br><br>And finally, nickel or tin plated meat grinders and sausage stuffers. Still in the boxes with all the attachments. I've seen hundreds. <br><br>I guess what I'm trying to say is (and, I think someone touched on it earlier) is that estates are great places to find all kinds of low-tech gizmos once you look past the "antiques" the dealers are scrambling to get at.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c1687343744651933462 title="comment permalink">7/10/11, 12:07 AM</a><br><br>

I had a dear friend, my "Uncle Larry" who lived in a huge house in the Alamedia District in Portland, Ore. Cathy McGuire will be familiar with the neighborhood. Huge old houses from the 20's and 30's. <br><br>He was the last of his line, but over the years, in that house, had lived his grandmother, mother and a maiden aunt. So, the household arts were well represented. It had a enormous basement and attic and every bedroom had enormous closets and built in storage units. I was free to poke about to my hearts content. I don't think I really thought much about it then, but it was a snapshot of life in the first half of the 20th century. <br><br>When I was in "The Biz" I hauled out boxes of stuff to sell for him.

I've always admired your name as it tells the world you are a straight talking kinda gal.<br><br>The area where I live is actually called Cherokee which is kind of wierd given it's in Australia. How it came about was timber getters from Oregon arrived in Australia in the 1850's for the gold rush, failed to get rich and then had to turn back to their normal trade of timber getting. <br><br>Well, they did make their fortunes in the end by cutting down the old growth forests up this way during the 1860's. I'm on the train line half way between Melbourne and the gold diggings up north so the timber was pretty high quality hard wood and it was easy to get down to the station via the tram ways which they would have built and operated. Anyway, before they cut the trees down they called it Cherokee because they thought it looked like the forests in the Cherokee territory in Oregon.<br><br>Most of the trees have regrown now and despite regular intense wild fires they're around 50m (about 150ft) tall (eventually they'll exceed 90m).

Referring to the table at:<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_ignoring_external_components<br>Bituminous coal is 20 MegaJoules/Liter, crude oil is 37 MJ/L. So by volume, 1.9 more units of (low quality) bituminous coal must be burned to get the same energy as crude oil (approximating bunker oil).<br><br>Secondly, this does not tell us the relative amounts of CO2 emitted.<br>The amount of CO2 produced by burning something depends on the MASS (not volume) AND the CHEMICAL COMPOSITION (i.e. how much carbon is in the fuel). Mass indicates the number of atoms, given a chemical formula. Given the atomic weight of each element, one can then calculate (roughly of course) the number of atoms. see:<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)<br><br>So I could calculate based on the carbon content of the average coal, etc., but...<br><br>Third, the big fly in this ointment is when we also want to say "per unit of electricity produced", we also have to factor in the EFFICIENCY of the generating t<br>echnology (and the actual heating value of the fuel given actual impurities, etc.). Rather than calculate theoretically, let's use data based on measurements in the real world.<br><br>Like that from Table 4 in this EIA document: CO2 Emissions Report<br>http://www.eia.gov/cneaf/electricity/page/co2_report/co2report.html<br><br>They give the 1999 US average as 2.095 pounds of CO2 per kiloWatt-hour of electricity generated from coal, and 1.969 lbs CO2/kWh from oil, and 1.321 lbs CO2/kWh from gas.<br>Note that CO2 emissions from coal and oil (in the real world) for the same amount of electricity are very close! (6% difference).<br><br>Why is this so, and not the 90% more for coal?<br>Several reasons (besides the chemistry mentioned above):<br>Coal plants tend to be larger and more efficient than oil burning plants, especially newer coal plants. Newer materials and larger boilers produce hotter steam with less waste heat, leading to higher Carnot efficiencies.<br>Oil fired boiler plants are older and smaller since oil is getting pricier, and bunker oil has a lot of sulfer in it, so nobody has built any oil fired boilers lately. (expensive to run, and gas is much cleaner). Those that still exist are thus likely to be neglected as they're known to be on the way out. <br>Some of the "petroleum" plants are diesel engines, spending much of their time running at inefficient load points, since they (and the oil fired boilers) are likely to be in small corners of the grid (or isolated grids) and must provide (inefficient) spinning reserves for local grid stability.<br><br>I hope this is clear without a full discourse on chemistry.<br><br>I thoroughly applaude your efforts to get people to re-examine the materialist/reductionist/physicalist dominate beliefs,<br>so it's disconcerting seeing assertions like quoted above - they fail first year chemistry and tend to bring dismissal of all things you might say by those with a chemistry/physics background.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c7304525591455610493 title="comment permalink">7/10/11, 2:33 AM</a><br><br>

It is possible to consume the specially prepared stems and immature leaves from the branch tips of older plants. After reading all the cautions, however, I'd personally be reluctant to attempt that without an experienced person to show me exactly how it's done. Among other things, pokeweed contains a mitogen which can cause serious changes in the blood if absorbed through skin abrasions. Young also suggests that anyone growing pokeweed as a garden plant should fence it off, to prevent humans, dogs, or cats from inadvertently getting into it. Birds, on the other hand, can indeed eat the ripe berries with no trouble at all.<br><br>Young's text agrees with what Adrian Ayres Fisher wrote: pokeweed shoots should be boiled (after washing) for about ten minutes, then drained and the water changed before boiling an additional ten minutes, then drained and rinsed once more. The shoots are then added to a pan of already fried bacon or well done salt pork. The salat is ready after about five additional minutes of stirring and cooking.<br><br>-----<br><br>After reading a bunch of different definitions of "materialistic" online, I feel I must clarify my comment a ways back. I was thinking in the sense of a small "m," not a big "M." Having never particularly studied philosophy, other than one college class in logic, I had no idea how much is entailed in that term. Geesh. I need to get myself a <i>Philosophy for Dummies</i> book or something! I just meant, of course, that I really appreciate the material things in my life, mostly for the practical value they add to it, but also for certain aesthetic and spiritual associations that come to my mind as I'm working with them. So apparently I'm not Materialistic, after all, even though I'm fond of my stuff and hence quite hesitant to renounce it. Hmmph. I'll meditate on that next and see if I ultimately have anything intelligent to say on the subject.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c8082341830948736462 title="comment permalink">7/10/11, 12:43 PM</a><br><br>

Go to any well-organized animal shelter in your area, and sit down with them and explain what you want and what your resources are: material, temporal and emotional. One shelter I visit regularly (also has a thrift store, in keeping with the main topic) has profiles on each dog, listing its personality, emotional needs, abilities, etc. You will see a lot of dogs that have predominate characteristics (size, color, appearance, disposition) of a known breed, so you can have a pretty good idea if your dog will hunt, etc., and how trainable it is. (Actually, all dogs are trainable, some more easily than others. Also, you probably don't want to tell the people in the shelter if you happen to want the dog to be good for hunting. They tend to be vegans.)<br><br>Get a 2-3 y.o. dog and bypass all of the puppy mess and headaches.<br><br>Get the critter fixed, for Christ's sake.

Not while there are thousands of perfectly good dogs being put to death every day in shelters.”<br><br>Over the years, my wife and I have lived with a number of pure-bred dogs: two German Shepherd Dogs, two Airedale Terriers, an Australian Shepherd, a Rough Collie, a Standard Poodle, a Dachshund, and a Mastiff.<br> <br>When I was a kid, we took in a mixed-breed stray dog that was wandering around the neighborhood. Six months later, it attacked my father and ran away. Although we had had the dog vaccinated, my father had to have the 14-day series of rabies vaccinations as a precaution, and he almost died from the injections.<br><br>My wife and I also lived with our daughter’s pointer-like mixed breed. It whined incessantly, and when left alone for only a minute, would tear the house apart.<br><br>Sounds like you’ve had better luck with mixed breeds than we have.<br><br>As far as “some theoretical use” … well, the civilization we’re living in is starting to go off the rails, and developing a theory about why it’s happening and what we need to do to survive the train wreck is important. Dogs have lived with humans for thousands of years, so we need to develop a theory about their future role: in our case, their possible role in a tough urban neighborhood with vacant lots that have small-scale agricultural potential, combined with two farmers’ markets within dog-carting distance.<br><br>This is a difficult niche to fill, but the after a long search, we’ve found a breed (Bernese Mountain Dog, aka BMD or Berner) that might work. So we joined the local BMD club, and have seen several hundred examples of the breed at regional BMD shows and also the 2010 BMD National. We’ve seen many Berners perform in Obedience Trials and Draft Tests. So we know what we’re trying to accomplish – which is why we’re taking a lot of time with it.<br><br>After living with dogs on and off for over half a century, my advice on getting a dog would be the opposite of yours:<br><br>1) Search for the basic breed temperament and physical characteristics that best match your situation: what the breed has to offer you, and what you have to offer the breed. Be objective about it; fall in love with the breed and the particular dog later.<br><br>2) Go to a reputable breeder and buy a puppy. Any dog has to be molded to fit into your household, and it’s always easier to mold a puppy in the direction of its basic breed temperament than to mold it away from its basic breed temperament. By the time a mixed-breed dog is three years old, the training will be much, much harder – and it may never really be a good fit.<br><br>3) To survive the coming descent, we are going to have to make tough triage decisions about which person (or what animals) get the scarce resources needed to survive and which person (or what animals) do not. Dog breeds represent the work of countless generations of breeders who have tried to mold their breed into an animal that has a natural ability and propensity to do certain things well. If push comes to shove – and eventually, it will – the scarce food and medical resources should go to preserving the genetics of the highest quality canine breeding stock rather than to preserving the individual lives of spayed or neutered mixed-breed dogs. We need to preserve the rich genetic diversity of dog breeds (and the rich genetic diversity of other domesticated species: horses, cows, sheep, goats, etc.) just as some people are trying to preserve the rich genetic diversity of heirloom vegetables.<br> <br>To me, putting food into the mouth of a sterile mixed-breed dog is like devoting all of your garden space to sterile Monsanto hybrids: you may get a decent crop this year, but it has no future.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c6646062633796866241 title="comment permalink">7/10/11, 7:19 PM</a><br><br>

Yesterday, in just half an hour, I bagged a printer (unopened box), a new set of crockery (unopened box), a sewing machine (barely used, still with manual), a typewriter (retro), a large toolbox full of tools, a cat box and a large toy tiger (for my daughter, still wrapped). The reason I struck lucky was that half the city have had their basements flooded last weekend in the most powerful downpour to hit Copenhagen in recorded history – and folks are just chucking out everything. You won't find any news on the downpour BTW, I suggested a story on it for the newspaper I sometimes write for and they said they only now report extreme weather events if there are substantial deaths.<br><br>@Kathleen – regarding walking. One example who springs to mind is the English writer Gerald Brenan, influential member of the Bloomsbury Club – who chose the path of tough poverty in rural Spain to eke out his war pension. He used to routinely walk 100 miles a day, usually between Granada and Almeria, passing over the summit of Mulhacen, Spain's tallest mountain, en route. In his old age he claimed that people were becoming physically soft and devoted his body for scientists to study upon his death. He might have a had a point – the same journey in a car takes about 2.5 hours on fast roads today.<br><br>@Don – thanks!<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c6943416062615808744 title="comment permalink">7/10/11, 11:27 PM</a><br><br>

Right now we have two purebred (one AKC Champion) Rhodesian Ridgebacks and one fuzzy yellow old boy who was dumped at out doorstep in the middle of the night complete with hookworms, heartworms, ehrlichia (a tick-borne rickettsial disease similar to RMSF), and Pachydermitis (a non-contagious fungal mange casued by general poor health and suppressed immunity). Of course we have no desire for hunting lions on the Veld; but what you get from purebreds is more predictability of size and temperament (good and bad). I knew my Ridgeback pup was going to grow to be over 100 pounds, and could decide in advance if I really wanted a dog that big. Knowing his father, mother, three of four grandparents, and a half-brother personally I also had a pretty good idea what his personality was likely to be like -- big, sweet, and goofy. <br><br>As for inbreeding, that is how ALL domesticated breeds of ALL animals ad plants are created. That is how you bring positive and negative traits out where they can be seen and select for and against them without taking the 1,000,000 years that natural selction takes to create a new animal. Without massive intense inbreeding there would be no dogs at all, no cattle, no chickens, no domesticated goats, sheep, or horses. Inbreeding is a taboo in humans because it causes all sorts of trouble when it occurs in populations that have not experienced it much -- all those lurking weird things are brought out. Domesticated animals that have been tightly bred for many generations can withstand (indeed require) a high level of close line breeding and inbreeding. Do you slander your heritage varieties and breeds of vegetables and poultry as "inbred?" Inbreeding combined with intense selection is one of the greatest inventions of the human species, and is what created agriculture (and hence "civilization"). <br><br>Also, I wish those who slander purebred dogs and promote rescue of mixed breeds as the only legitimate and honorable way to deal with dogs would actually THINK about the end game of this strategy. In that world, the only dogs out there would be the results of backyard random breeding by outlaws and irresponsible folks who do not control their dogs and their reproduction (in other words, the sort of people who dumped that neglected dog on our doorstep). And when you just let dogs chose their own mates for many generations, you get Dingos -- things that resemble yellowish wolves in appearance and behavior. Similar pariah dogs have emerged in many parts of the world. They are very poorly sited to domestic life as pets or workers. Is this the world of dogs you really want to see? All those evil inbreeders are the only reason you see the wonderful variety of dogs we have in the world -- mixed and purebreds.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c55855636859891507 title="comment permalink">7/11/11, 6:02 AM</a><br><br>

Buying, trading and bartering, or receiving gifts of quality seed, then growing it in your own garden, in the climate you live in, and then keeping back the best of the seed each year is intended to build a stock of plant that is suited to you, your environment, and especially to the purpose that you desire.<br><br>How can livestock, any livestock, be a different matter?<br><br>The dog that you depend upon to do the guarding, or ratting, or herding, or companionship that you get the dog for, needs to be dependable. <br><br>Picking up strays without regard to bloodlines or early training is a refusal to take responsibility for taking care of yourself.<br><br>What worked in Iowa farming country when I grew up, was to watch the neighbors and their dogs. When a litter came 'available', you considered how the owner used the dogs, how they behaved, and whether the place and need they came from suits your needs. Some were purebred, others deliberate mixes (which is one reason that quality pure bred dogs -- not inbred puppy mill big-box type mutts of whatever breed -- are needed, to provide reasonable out-crossing prospects).<br><br>A part of me is appalled at the blanket "adopt and neuter stays" policy, as it is a deliberate and non-discriminate thinning of several gene pools.<br><br>A horseman commented to me that a breed is not improved by planned matings, but by the culls removed from breeding. The chances of removing dogs with sound genetics from the breeding pool by the "neuter them all" robs this and the next generations of opportunities.<br><br>Be that as it may, horsemen also tell me, "know the horse, or know the seller." <br><br>I might mention that in the future, the once-ubiquitous rat terrier may be a necessary companion to help maintain control over rodents around stored feed and foodstuffs. Rabbits in the gardens, possums in the chicken house, and raccoons in the feed room, not to mention mice in the yard and buildings, are the rightful prey of the vigilant dog.<br><br>Some cats are very effective hunters. If you aren't selecting, and keeping back progeny, for useful skills, how do you propose to maintain that embarrassingly rare skill among cats in America?<br><br>In the past it was reputed that you could tell a man's character by his dog and his horse. Being able and adept at training the dog and horse, the respect and discipline in your relationship with your companions and other livestock, is a matter of taking responsibility over circumstances that directly affect your life, especially outside the reach of an abundant society.<br><br>Please, do keep taking in strays and providing homes as your ability to feed and care for them permits. For me, I feel one overlooked responsibility of taking on livestock, even pets, is that of knowing and acting when the time comes that you no longer have a use for the animal, or that it can no longer serve. That, I think, is more important that whether the animal enters your life as an adoptee, as a considered procurement, or as one that you planned for and raised.<br><br>I would neuter an animal <em>not suitable</em> for reproduction.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c4229140384426350959 title="comment permalink">7/11/11, 7:46 AM</a><br><br>

Draft dogs? Show me anywhere in the world where they were ever used, other than places where horses or oxen weren't practical. There's probably a reason.<br><br>My personal experience with dogs is a lot less extensive than yours, but we always had one in the family (my brother collected strays.) I have observed a lot of dogs over time, including service dogs and dogs used for specific purposes, especially hunting. I have seen a lot of bad hips, front leg joints, heart defects, and other problems in purebred dogs. I've seen people practically go broke with vet bills.<br><br>I don't think a couple of anecdotes about mixed breeds tells a very good story. Mixed breeds, after all, represent most of the universe of dogs, so you're going to have all types. I have definitely seen the type of separation anxiety you described in purebred dogs, especially a bouvier and a wheaton terrier I was close to recently.<br><br>In my post, I recommended looking for dogs that have percentages of major breeds. My dog is a lab mix, and I wish I had gotten him at a younger age, because he would have made a great hunting dog.<br><br>Funny, when you compare mix breeds with Monsanto hybrids, I see it just the opposite. Those hybrids are the result of intense effort in breeding very specific traits. They result in a variety that is useful for very specific conditions, and require an amazing amount of resource inputs.<br><br>To me, the extremes reached by commercial seed and animal breeding are every bit as much an example of an obsession with idealized perfection as the search for meaning through wealth represented by plastic junk.<br><br>I don't want to overstate the case, now. I appreciate good vegetable breeds, and grow both heirlooms and hybrids on my farm. (Check out Sharon Astyk a couple of months on that. Very few of us are black or white on the issue.) Chickens are another example.<br><br>I'm talking about the extremes you usually see with the major dog breeds.<br><br>I have to say, though it's a little disturbing to see you make the jump to an argument that sounds a lot to me like social "Darwinism" (no relation to actual Darwinism, of course). When you use the term "person" it makes me wonder who gets to make the "tough triage decisions?"<br><br>Yeah, I'll have to admit that ethics has something to do with my position on adopting pound animals. I'd probably be even more of a softie with the dim-witted cousin. As for neutering and humans, I don't think we need to go there.<br><br>As far as the future of dog breeds is concerned, if you go to any 3rd world country you'll see that, left on their own, dogs devolve into the basic, usually yellow, canine. Hair not too long, not too short; nose, tail, ears, etc., ditto. Scrappy and resistant to most of what life will throw at them. These dogs might not be ideal for a lot of uses, and there will always be a need to breed good dogs for specific uses. Bred dogs will always develop problems, and need some wild genes. I don't see either as being endangered in the foreseeable future.<br><br>[This may be a repeat.

I've never had a working dog, but my grandfather's farm never saw a purebred. If you get a mutt, you get the bonus of hybrid vigor, and the temperament comes out reasonably predictable, as long as you don't breed at cross-purposes. A collie-Shepard mix, you might expect, still has sheepdog instincts.<br>All those centuries of breeding were more like that than the highly-inbred strains of today, I suspect. A good dog sires puppies upon a good dog, rinse and repeat. Registered breeds only became a thing when the idle rich and middle classes decided to breed showdogs, which is what most lines in a lot of breeds are these days. So be careful about that, is all I'm saying. If you know what you're doing (as Don presumably does) you can probably a fine dog. If not, go to the pound. As the man says, we're nowhere near peak dog.<br><br>P.S.

Around here many people hunt with dogs. They use purebred Labradors for waterfowl, several breeds of Coonhounds for raccoons, and Beagles for rabbits. There are also specialized local breeds (squirrel dogs, black-mouth curs, etc.) for specific hunting functions. People with hooved flocks use purebred Great Pyrenees for livestock guarding. Sheep keepers use purebred Border Collies. Drug sniffing dogs are almost all purebred Labradors; search-and-rescue dogs are usually purebreds of several different breeds (including many German Shepherd Dogs). <br><br>About dogs for draft animals, it was common in earlier centuries. Goats were used as well. <br><br>To all who say that the excess of strays means that no one should be deliberately breeding dogs, the same logic can be applied to humans.

If the crisis of faith and religion that we both feel is coming happens, you may find that it might not take centuries for your book to find its audience, but could happen even within your life time. Please notice that I said could happen, not would happen.<br><br>I can see that there will be an increasing feeling that science failed us going forward. I don't think so, it has done what it suppose to - increasing our understanding of the material world. What has failed is how we made use of what we have learned. We have created expectations for what science can do that an unbiased review of what it tells us shows can't be met. It is somehow sadly predictable that the most concise and insightful description of this conflict that I have found is not in a scientific publication but in writing of a non-technical author on this blog.<br><br>My current understanding of magic comes from what you have written in this blog. So I will cheerfully admit that I almost certainly don’t a clue about what I’m talking about. However, since that doesn’t stop anyone in our current society from bloviating…<br><br>Since reading your blog post last year on magic, I have been saying that magic is still practiced widely, especially by large corporations and governments; it is just not explicitly recognized as such. Has it occurred to anyone that the term "the magic of advertising” may be more than just a metaphor? The image that comes to mind is one from the original Stars Wars movie, where the empire’s generals are smugly talking about how technically advanced they are and that the Force used by Darth Vader is a primitive, and out of date, thing. Vader, being a little hotheaded, can’t resist showing them that they might be mistaken. The empire is, of course, completed based on using “the dark side of the Force”.<br><br>Like you, I very much doubt that there is a tiny cabal of people fully versed in the ways of magic running the show (Darth Bernanke does has nice ring to it though). I just suspect that rediscovered debased forms of magic, stripped of the critical deeper levels of understanding, is dressed up in scientific drag and used to sell toothpaste, cars, foreign policy, political candidates and the American way of life.<br><br>James Kunstler has recognized will be a hunger for and development of something beyond the pseudo scientific rationalism of our times in the years ahead, an idea he dramatized in his World Made by Hand novels by including supernatural elements. However, since he probable knows little more, if that, beyond what most people know about magic; what he wrote includes, I suspect, a confounding the planes issue, which is why I find it jarring and out of place.<br><br>I can predict that if there was a wider rediscovery of magic it would not lead to some human utopia, as I am sure some would be claiming once that rediscovery starts to happen. My guess any society that made the fullest use of magic also had its share of wars, misery and foolish mistakes. Magic would be just another tool that we can again use in navigating an unpleasant future that we have foolishly underestimated. I just think we need every valuable tool possible for that future, and a fuller knowledge of magic is one that we are lacking.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c8883858929743434258 title="comment permalink">7/11/11, 2:24 PM</a><br><br>

You'll be interested to know that your take on magic as a central element of today's consumer economy was proposed by no less a figure than Ioan Couliano in <i>Eros and Magic in the Renaissance</i>, a book you might want to look up; Couliano was one of the very few academics who was also a first-rate occultist, and thus knew what he was talking about. <br><br>The kind of magic practiced by today's corner-office sorcerers, though, might better be described as necromancy -- the manipulation of dead images. What I was taught, many years ago now, to call the Magic of Light requires the mage to participate fully in the process of the cosmos; you can't stand back and manipulate from a distance, and you can't fool youself into thinking that what you do won't circle back and bite you in the rump. The necromancers of finance and advertising haven't grasped that.

Woof!<br> <br>Tyler August said: <br>“If I go to a breeder around here looking for a German Shepard dog, what I get back will be useless for sheparding, guarding, or any other sort of work, because the breeders have decided that highly deformed hind legs are a desirable breed characteristic.”<br><br>I agree that some of the current conformation champion German Shepherd Dogs are, in my humble opinion, hideously deformed freaks. Some breeders are breeding for whatever “look” is currently fashionable, and with GSD’s the “racy, swept-back look” is currently all the rage. <br><br>However, there are other more traditional GSD breeders who are breeding for exactly the qualities you mention: guarding, herding, etc. <br><br>How do you find a breeder like that? One clue is that conformation (appearance) is not the only title that can be awarded. There are other awards: obedience, herding, draft work (pulling a cart), hunting, retrieving, tracking, earth dog (terriers going underground), etc.<br><br>There is currently a counter-current in dog breeding circles that is pushing for a return to the earlier emphasis on function as opposed to appearance. In my opinion, it will eventually prevail. <br><br><br>Tyler August said <br>"…unless you can find a good breeder who cares more about the dog than the kennel club's specifications, those heirloom breeds have for the most part been destroyed by a century or more of cosmetic breeding… Registered breeds only became a thing when the idle rich and middle classes decided to breed showdogs, which is what most lines in a lot of breeds are these days.”<br><br>I agree that in the 20th Century, dog breeding – like so many other things – went off the deep end into (we need a word here, and the word Bill came up with certainly fits) glamour. The obsession with perfecting the dog’s glamorous appearance damaged a number of breeds (the Bedlington Terrier, for example, has developed an extremely high incidence of heart defects). <br><br>But many other breeders have “kept the faith” and attempted to keep the temperamental and working characteristics intact, while attempting to breed out health problems. <br><br>As the middle class disappears, I suspect that the excesses of show dog breeding will also disappear with it, and the practical aspects will make a comeback. <br><br>For example, I prefer the original 1957 AKC Breed Standard for the Bernese Mountain Dog that called for a dog that exhibited “sagacity, fidelity, and utility”. To me, that’s the perfect dog. As the old saying goes, “How can a good dog be a bad color?”<br><br>Tyler August said: <br>“So to anyone considering Mason's arguments, I caution you to be very, very careful in selecting a breeder.”<br><br>I agree. Be very, very careful in selecting a breeder. We’re at four years and counting. (We could have gotten a Berner a long time ago if we weren’t considering breeding; but once we started considering breeding, we realized we needed to learn a lot more about the breed and the direction our breeding program would go - if we decide to do it.)<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c2495156418469683586 title="comment permalink">7/11/11, 9:12 PM</a><br><br>

When you use the term 'person' it makes me wonder who gets to make the 'tough triage decisions?'”<br><br>I used that phrase “tough triage decisions” very deliberately. <br><br>You have to make tough triage decisions when an emergency overwhelms your scarce resources. Put bluntly, when seven billion people slam headfirst into Peak Oil, Peak Potash, Peak Everything – including Peak Dog - then some people – and some dogs - are going to die. There’s only enough resources to keep a finite number of people (or domestic animals) alive. An enormous amount of death is inevitable. <br><br>So what determines who gets the resources to live and who doesn’t? Location? Money? Pure dumb luck? Barak Obama? Sarah Palin? The Queen of England? Wall Street? The People’s Revolutionary Committee? Space lizards from the constellation Draco? A combination of one or more of the above? Who or what does the determining? Who makes the tough triage decisions during this Long Emergency/Long Descent? Who gets the resources to live, and who gets to die?<br><br>We’re going to have to have some extremely difficult conversations about triaging collapse, and we need to be explicit about it: we are triaging collapse. Our world is becoming one big salvage operation. <br><br>We are all making those tough triage decisions, every day, in whatever we do. Right now, our own everyday actions are determining who is going to get the resources to live, and who will not. <br><br>We can’t save every person, and we can’t save every dog – and the resources to save a couple of dogs could instead be used to save a person. So my thinking is: If we’re going to save a dog instead of a person, then that had better be a really, really good dog that we’re saving. And that, of course, is a subjective judgment. But the more useful the dog is – particularly at increasing resources like food or providing transportation or protection – the more reasonable it is.<br> <br>Hal said: <br>“As for neutering and humans, I don't think we need to go there.”<br><br>Triaging collapse is definitely something that nobody really wants to talk about. <br><br>Infinite growth is much more pleasant: infinite resources allowing infinite people the infinite freedom to produce infinite babies to play with infinite dogs. Much more pleasant.<br><br>Instead of: Either your dog is going to starve to death, or somebody in South Asia is going have a baby, and that baby is going to starve to death. Who wants to make a decision? Hands? Anyone? No one? Okay, by default, then. You, over in the corner: the skeleton in the black cape with the scythe…<br><br>Tyler August said <br>“P.S. Instead of a draft dog, have you considered a pedal-powered plow?”<br><br>We’ve thought about that. There are some really good pedal-powered machines out there. But my wife and I are in our sixties, and our physical stamina isn’t what it used to be. We need some additional muscle power around here. <br><br>With an aging population, this will probably become an even more important issue as time goes on. Our fossil fuel slaves are dying, so we’re going to need the muscle power of the working breeds. <br><br>Also, a pedal-powered machine doesn’t scare the junkies and crackheads away. <br><br>And a machine doesn’t do some of the endearing things that a dog does, like trying to con you out of a treat: “Woof! Woof! I've been a good dog, right? Can I have a carrot now? Woof! Woof!<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c783390976062593030 title="comment permalink">7/11/11, 9:16 PM</a><br><br>

I think we might be talking past each other in more ways than that, though.<br><br>On draft dogs, it's the idea of using them for tillage that has me stuck, but I certainly don't think there's anything wrong with trying them out for light hauling. For that, you'd probably need to go with something pretty well bred, because left to their own, dogs return to a size that is more environmentally "fit," as per true Darwinian evolution.<br><br>For dirt work, I wonder if a miniature horse or pony might be a better "poor man's horse." But hey, in the spirit of the green wizard project, give it a shot. Letting a thousand flowers bloom seems to be the purpose of the project, but keep in mind, a lot won't make it. I think one of the purposes of the forum is to raise legitimate technical concerns, rather than people discovering them the hard way.<br><br>I think that also applies to ethical concerns. JMG clearly didn't like my tractor and pickup truck, and the way it struck me, it was hard not to see that as coming from a place of values. So I need to seriously consider that. There had already been plenty of discussion by that time of transitional strategies, and that's how I look at my choices. But how we go forward with at least some of our civilized values intact is another issue worthy of our discussion.<br><br>There is definitely plenty of discussion available as to how post-transition life is bound to be (ahem) "dog-eat-dog." I'm not so sure it has to be, and think it's worth discussing ethics and institutions as part of the subject of cultural conservation.<br><br>Having ethical concerns might label me as soft, unrealistic, liberal, even "urban" in some circles, and not up to the serious discussion of hard choices and triage, but codes of behavior and ethics are at least as old as Hammurabi and the Old Testament. I think people mostly go along as long as they can in the existing framework, including societal rules.<br><br>I think plenty of people have already pointed our Russia as a model for post-collapse demographic change, so I won't beat that one. It will be very interesting to see how things go in Southern Europe in the next few years.<br><br>Anyway, this has wandered further than I wanted. Meanwhile there are lots of lovable doggies (and don't forget cats!) going wanting in pounds in the overwhelmingly urban nations of the world. And there are a lot of people who could really benefit from a good buddy.

What likely took her an hour would take the tractor maybe 10-15 minutes. She could do maybe 10-12 times as much cutting in a day; the tractor could do 50 times or more. That means, at a minimum, five more people, or five more days, to harvest the same amount.<br><br>Consider that that means feeding and nurturing five people for the year to get the field harvested in a similar amount of time, or five times as many days that the harvester isn't available for other work. If this were wheat, oats, or another food crop, you would be diverting part of the harvest to sustain the farmer(s) (tractors don't eat wheat, directly), resulting in less of the harvest available for feeding others.<br><br>Using a scythe for agricultural purposes has significant community aspects. Scything takes people, and time. The McCormick harvester was an important tool when it appeared. It was ground driven, had a sickle cutting bar with gather wheel to position the stems for clean cutting, and canvas belts to arrange and stack the cut stems for efficient drying in a windrow. The McCormick harvester might well be one of the more important advances in modern agriculture.<br><br>The advantage remains with the scythe, though, for cutting small and irregular shaped fields, road ditches, empty lots, etc. Or around my chicken coop and pony yard.<br><br>Cutting the harvest and gathering it to preserve or thresh are weather sensitive. Rains while the grain is down, or that delays harvest too long, can diminish or ruin a harvest.<br><br>So what I noticed about the video is how much using the scythe to harvest grain diminishes yield of a given field, and how many more hands, or days, are required to harvest the same field.<br><br>Extra 'hands' have to come from somewhere. They aren't in the pipeline at present, and they need to eat -- which fewer are prepared to promise today that was true when scythes were in general use. And you might consider how many of us that are "available" are in shape for five or ten hours of continuous physical labor, daily.<br><br>And when working tired, or with other people around, expect more injuries using scythes. Farming has always been one of the more hazardous occupations.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c3711443954915861716 title="comment permalink">7/12/11, 7:30 AM</a><br><br>

I groom dogs for a living.<br><br>Folks do get emotional about the subject of dogs, and extreme in their arguments. It's tantamount to religion for many. We like to think our approach, our program, is far more pragmatic and scientific. While our relationships with dogs certainly involve a lot of emotion, our decisions to breed or not to breed are never, ultimately, emotional ones, nor for profit. <br><br>While there are some extreme examples of breeds that have been bred for conformation (looks), the #1 rule for conformation is "form follows function". The GSD's hind quarters were originally the way they are to provide power and agility vs. speed, and not all GSDs have hip problems; far from it. Someone mentioned Golden retrievers as well. These are fairly new breeds that still have a lot of variation. Many older breeds, Sight Hounds and Mastiff breeds, (thousands of years), some herding dogs, and water dogs, incl. Poodles, Water Spaniels, etc., have many hundreds of years of trial and error behind them. While poor breeding can undo the tests of time, many great bloodlines still exist in most of these breeds.<br><br>Don M. has done a fine job of posting most of what I could say, though there has been a tendency here to require dogs to have some utilitarian purpose. While this is important in many respects, I'll submit that their most important function is companionship, as "man's (human's) best friend". <br><br>Anyway, for those of you considering a purebred, registered breed, in the US, only two registries matter: AKC and UKC ( http://www.akc.org and http://www.ukcdogs.com ). Our dogs are all registered with both, some have shown in both. We currently show our Standard Poodles in UKC, mainly for two reasons: UKC doesn't allow professional handlers and Standard Poodles are shown in the Gundog Group, where they belong, as opposed to AKC: Non-Sporting Group (silly). Also, UKC allows Poodles to be shown in a much more sensible "sporting clip".<br><br>When considering a breeder, if the breeder isn't publishing ALL of the pedigree and health testing results, they likely have something to hide. Health testing results are published at http://www.offa.org/ , and any breeder worth considering will produce hard copies of all test results without question. We had an opportunity to breed into one of the top Standard Poodle bloodlines in the USA. When they refused to produce their test results for SA (<a href=http://www.upei.ca/~cidd/Diseases/dermatology/sebaceous%20adenitis.htm rel=nofollow>sebaceous adenitis</a>), we backed out.<br><br>Our breeding program has produced only 16 puppies in 6 years. We know where each one is and they are under strict contracts. All but 3 have been spayed/neutered or are scheduled to be when old enough. If any of these dogs 'don't work out' with their owners, by contract, they are to be returned to us before being rehomed. <br><br>Virtually all breed clubs have purebred rescue and adoption programs,and many great dogs, some with papers/pedigree and health testing are available. <br><br>Oh, yeah, I also have a little terrier mix that we found in a ditch one rainy night. We named him Gutter, and he is my constant farm/garden companion, and a great mouser. His sense of humor is unsurpassed.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c8185317654436115468 title="comment permalink">7/12/11, 8:05 AM</a><br><br>

A dog is not as powerful as a horse, but dogs are an order of magnitude smaller, and therefore much more maneuverable. Dogs can get into places that a horse cannot. <br><br>Dogs can pull a tremendous amount of weight; a Bernese Mountain Dog in Europe was able to pull a 2,000 pound load. Pound for pound, dog muscle is much more powerful than human muscle. Dogs are lower to the ground than a horse, so their dog harness has a better mechanical advantage than a horse harness (more energy goes into pulling forward rather than upward). <br><br>However, Berners are not a generic "dog". They have been specifically bred for draft work, just as Clydesdale horses have been specifically bred for draft work.<br> <br>If you compare a well-bred Berner to your Lab mix, you will immediately see the difference: both are about the same height at the withers, but the Berner weighs 20 or 30 pounds more. The Berner's leg bones are much sturdier; the chest musculature is stronger. <br><br>Labs are bred to run, so they have light, thin bones. Berners are bred to plod along pulling a dog cart, so they have good bone and strong muscles.<br><br>The temperament differs, as well. As you noted, if you had gotten your Lab mix at a younger age, it probably could have been trained to be an excellent hunter because that’s what breeders have bred into the Labrador Retriever: the excitement of the hunt.<br><br>But most of the hunting instincts have been bred out of Berners because the instinct to chase after a rabbit is definitely not a desirable trait in a dog that is pulling a fully-loaded milk cart down a country road. <br><br>Berners are bred to be stable, stoic, hard-working doggie citizens. Not the world’s most exciting breed, but exhibiting "sagacity, fidelity, and utility."<br><br>Neither Labs nor Berners are generic, yellow street dingos. The various breeds have been bred for many generations to perform specific tasks that make them useful to us humans. We don’t want to lose the rich diversity of these different breeds by throwing all the genes into one enormous yellow genetic stewpot.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c8711320872331047521 title="comment permalink">7/12/11, 9:20 AM</a><br><br>

You must be hitting a nerve (or two).<br><br>I'm going to play devil's advocate here on the car front. Don't get me wrong; I don't buy new cars - I generally like to get "certified pre-owned", which means somebody leased (and depreciated) the car first. But, as much as I loved my 1977 Accord, it required a lot more work to keep running than my current 2008 Fit. Things like regularly changing spark plugs, Rotor, points and condensor, and rebuilding the carburator simply no longer exist. The quality of the steel and rustproofing is much better. And if the car does misbehave, an OBD tool will let it tell you what's wrong. Granted, it can't be repaired by a blacksmith, but in its lifetime I think there'll be donor cars available for parts should the supply infrastructure collapse.<br>Don Mason: regarding population, Dmitri Orlov has remarked on the degree to which this seems to take care of itself. When times get tough, folks have a lot fewer babies - see post Soviet Russia and Depression-era USA for examples. And a lot of the "marginal" die sooner than they would have otherwise.

You can grow your own scythe fuel much easier than you can grow your own tractor fuel.<br><br>If you compare the scythe to, say, a gasoline string trimmer or a heavy-duty walk-behind mower (for things like clearing between trees in an orchard or along edges, ditches, feincelines, slopes, roads, and paths), in my experience the comparison in terms of time and effort is much closer.

I have a resemblance to the character on the cover of a paperback from the 80's, titled 'Cherokee Mission,' enough so that the man used for the model could be my literal brother!<br><br>If you like the language here are several links, only about 15% of the people still speak it every day.<br><br>http://mypeoplepc.com/members/cherlyn/onefeather/id7.html<br><br>http://www.wehali.com/tsalagi/<br><br>http://www.native-languages.org/cherokee.htm<br><br>The tribe is quite large, not to mention one of the most prosperous. (Currently they're 'fighting it out' with the Navajo for which is the richest. Both fortunes were or are based on energy resources. Petroleum for the Cherokee and coal and uranium for the Navajo.)<br><br>The capital of their country within a country they tried to make of their homeland was called New Echota. But they were forcibly moved to Oklahoma in 1830 in what was called The Trail of Tears. They were the first but not the last tribe to make such a forced march.<br><br>@ Whoever posted the link for the AI Dog.<br><br>In a quick scan of the dog discussion I saw the link for the American Indian Dog and I checked it out last night. I'm intrigued and Song Dog Kennel isn't far from here. Unfortunately for you JMG, the dog looks almost exactly like all feral dogs. Almost like the Pharaoh Hound I liked the looks of, if smaller. (And from the AI web site more mentally stable!) <br><br>For stock dogs I'm still going for the Aussie's, full sized instead of the miniatures they're breeding now. From the ASKA registry instead of AKC, I want something that can still take down a Brahma Bull, like the half trained, 6 mo. old pup my room mate had bred. It was at the stock yard and a local rancher was so impressed he offered her a $1000.00 for the pup on the spot! Foolishly, imo, she accepted. <br><br>I'd prefer Aussies over Catahoolas although with the feral pig population I might be better off with the Catahoolas out of Louisiana. That's part of what Catahoolas are bred for in modern times, wild pig hunting. I think because of that they are rougher with regular livestock.<br><br>When it comes to used and horse furniture I LIKE old saddles! If they've been well cared for they'll last a life time and a half. My room mate had an antique saddle that was around a hundred years old when it was stolen and still totally usable. It was also rare and quite valuable which she found out "after" it was gone. And yes, I know who stole it and I know he didn't make as much profit as he could have if he had only known! <br><br>Wadulisi Tsalagi<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c6555742184193046182 title="comment permalink">7/13/11, 10:01 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c1566321160949254835></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/18378344866487206569 rel=nofollow>Brad K.</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>@ Bill,<br><br>I wasn't looking at a comparison of using the scythe vs. the tractor. What caught my attention was the difference in infrastructure, about how many people-days that field increases in cost when going to the scythe.<br><br>My comment wasn't about how good the tractor is, but how socially and economically difficult it will be to gather and employ the people needed to harvest that field, about the reduction in yield just because of the need for more people. My presumption was that the yield from that field, and others under cultivation, will be needed to continue feeding people.<br><br>Only the yield of such fields, after feeding the workers, will be lessened. Injuries will increase. And we are way behind the training curve, of getting people used to working the fields and of getting the tools needed to get the work accomplished in a timely fashion.<br><br>Absolutely a scythe/scythes can bring in a harvest in a post-industrial age. Craftsmanship and skill are always beautiful to watch, and well-made tools make their own species of glory. But creating craftsmen that farm, that harvest and plant and store and process the bounty of the land, like other crafts, takes time and apprentices and toolmakers. And this video brought that part of the picture home to me, again.<br><br><a href=salvaging-energy.html#c1566321160949254835 title="comment permalink">7/13/11, 10:40 PM</a><br><br>
