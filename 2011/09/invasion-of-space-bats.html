Science fiction, that oddest offspring of industrial civilization’s religion of progress, has not done a great deal so far to explore the end of the age of cheap energy that gave that religion its moment in history’s spotlight. Still, the trajectory traced out in last week’s post helped midwife some useful habits of thought concerning the future, and one of these is a sense of the believable a good deal more stringent than the one that’s been cultivated so far in the peak oil blogosphere.<br><br>That last statement might raise some eyebrows, I know. Whatever its pretensions in recent decades, science fiction spent most of its formative years, and produced a good many of its major classics, at a time when it was basically a collection of wish-fulfillment fantasies for teenage boys. (And that, Mr. de Camp, is what the woman in the brass brassiere is doing on the cover of your book.) Still, even the most lurid of fantasies depend for effect on what has been called “the willing suspension of disbelief,” and if the absurdities pile up too deeply, as J.R.R. Tolkien commented in a characteristically acerbic passage, disbelief has not so much to be suspended as hanged, drawn, and quartered.<br><br>Thus there was always pressure on SF authors to check their facts and make the details consistent. As SF fandom became a significant force on the evolution of the genre, the sort of geeky obsessiveness you find in teenage fans of just about anything became a badge of honor, and pushed the same process further. Before long, it was no longer enough to tell a rousing tale about square-jawed space heroes and nubile females on some distant planet; no matter how hackneyed the plot and two-dimensional the characters might be, the planet had to make some kind of sense in terms of the scientific knowledge of the time, and so did the fanged and tentacled horrors that threatened the heroine, the hero’s laser pistol, and the rest of it. Even when authors made things up out of whole cloth, as of course they did constantly, they had to figure out some way to graft the invention onto existing knowledge so that the seam didn’t show too clearly.<br><br>Even before science fiction hit the big time in the wake of Sputnik I, the demand for believability had become one of the essential elements of the genre. The dismissal of legendary science fiction editor Ray Palmer from the senior position at <i>Amazing Stories</i> in 1948 was arguably the turning point in the process. Palmer had made the Ziff-Davis pulp magazine chain a remarkable amount of money by filling the magazine with a free mix of trashy science fiction, popular occultism, and dubious alternative science, and he also played a central role in <a href=http://www.softcom.net/users/falconkam/manwho.html>inventing the UFO phenomenon</a>, but the higher-ups at Ziff-Davis sensed the way the market was moving. Palmer ended up launching a new magazine, <i>Fate</i>, that for all practical purposes created the modern New Age movement, while SF took a different path.<br><br>Unexpectedly, science fiction’s unscientific twin, fantasy fiction—which had a similar prehistory in the pulp magazines and broke through into respectability roughly a decade after SF did—followed a similar trajectory. To some extent this was driven by the overlapping readership of the two genres, but of course there was another factor as well, the force of nature already mentioned that went by the name of J.R.R. Tolkien. There had been plenty of fantasy fiction before <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, but none that succeeded so stunningly in evoking the presence of another world with its own history, languages, cultures and conflicts, because nobody before Tolkien had tackled the job with the obsessive consistency and eye for detail that he put into his creation of Middle-earth. In his wake, fantasy authors who hoped to get away with the casual disregard for plausibility that ran riot through Robert Howard’s <i>Conan the Barbarian</i> stories, among many others, started getting rejection slips in place of contracts. Expectations had changed, and the genre changed with it.<br><br>By and large—with important exceptions, to be sure—those expectations have remained glued in place in both genres, and when a book fails to live up to them, you can pretty much count on hearing a raucous response from the fans. Sometimes this sort of response has been taken to remarkable lengths. For decades, for example, <i>Analog Science Fiction</i>—under its original title, <i>Astounding</i>, the great rival of Palmer’s <i>Amazing</i>—had a substantial crowd of retired engineers, especially but not only in the aerospace field, among its loyal readership. Get a story published in <i>Analog</i>, and you could reliably expect to have hundreds if not thousands of pairs of beady and remarkably well-informed eyes scanning every scientific detail. If you got some bit of hard science wrong, in turn, you could expect to hear about it at length, in fine technical detail, complete with calculations hot off the slide rule, in the letters to the editor column two issues down the road.<br><br>It’s occurred to me more than once that the peak oil field badly needs certain things science fiction has stashed in its imaginary warehouses, and one of them is a shipping container or two full of those eagle-eyed retired engineers who used to read <i>Analog</i>. Now of course we have some—to quote only one example, regular readers of <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/ >The Oil Drum</a> are familar with the very capable technical analysis that routinely appears there—but there aren’t enough to deal with the need for what might be called technical criticism: the careful, impartial, and exacting analysis of claims about not-yet-invented technologies and not-yet-created social movements that played so large a role in making science fiction the intellectually and even philosophically challenging genre that for a while, at least, it became.<br><br>And this, dear reader, is where we start talking about alien space bats.<br><br>No, those aren’t the symptoms of an unusually florid psychosis, nor do they feature in any significant number of science fiction stories—well, not since Ray Palmer’s time, at least. The term comes from the field of alternative history, the fascinating study of what could have happened if some small detail of history had gone the other way. Back in the early days of the internet, according to the account I’ve seen, one participant in a lively discussion on a Usenet newsgroup dedicated to alternative history insisted that Hitler’s planned invasion of Great Britain could only have succeeded if the Wehrmacht had been helped out by alien space bats. Whether he was right or not—a question I don’t propose to discuss here—the term caught on as a convenient label for the kind of arbitrary assumptions and implausible gimmicks that too often get used to prop up dubious alternative history scenarios.<br><br>It’s a useful term, and one that could helpfully be brought into the peak oil scene, because arbitrary assumptions and implausible gimmicks play an embarrassingly large role in discussions of how our industrial civilization is going to deal with the twilight of the age of fossil fuels. The "drill, baby, drill" mantra beloved of so many American pseudoconservatives these days is based, for example, on the wholly arbitrary assumption that the United States, which has been more thoroughly explored for petroleum deposits than any other piece of real estate on Earth, and has seen trillions of dollars of government largesse poured into encouraging domestic oil production in recent decades, still has vast amounts of crude oil tucked away somewhere that would flood the market with cheap petroleum if only those awful environmentalists weren’t getting in the way. That’s nonsense—politically useful nonsense, to be sure, but nonsense that ranks up there with the best alien space bats of alternative history.<br><br>Mind you, the fluttering of alien space bat wings can be heard just as clearly from other points around the peak oil compass. A forthcoming paper in the peer-reviewed journal <a href=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511004836>Energy Policy</a> by a team headed by Carlos de Castro usefully points out, for example, that a great many recent claims about how much electricity can be produced by wind power fail to deal with that old nemesis of cornucopian schemes, the laws of thermodynamics. Since energy taken from moving air in one place can’t be taken out of it again in another, the paper attempted to come up with an approximate figure for the total energy that human beings can extract from the atmosphere. Their estimate relies on a certain number of ballpark guesses, and begs for more research; still, it will come as no surprise to those of my readers who have been paying attention that the figure they came up with is a small fraction of the total amount of energy currently used by industrial civilization, and only around one per cent of the high-end estimates circulated by the wind industry and its proponents.<br><br>There are plenty of other examples. I discussed some of them a while ago in a post here about <a href=../../2011/03/trouble-with-vaporware.html>the blind faith in vaporware</a> that pervades large sectors of the peak oil blogosphere, and some of the others in another post about <a href=../../2010/11/no-time-for-lullabies.html>the lullabies disguised as solutions</a> that fill an embarrassingly large fraction of peak oil literature these days. The same illogic, in turn, drives the self-defeating insistence, chronicled in a <a href="http://www.cleispress.com/book_page.php?book_id=433">a newly published book of mine</a>, that history as we know it is about to end for their convenience. Whether it’s the Rapture, the Singularity, the flurry of freshly invented prophecies about 2012, or what have you, it’s all the same thing, the great-grandmother of all alien space bats: the claim that something or other will bring history to a screeching halt in time to spare us the necessity of facing the consequences of our own actions.<br><br>There are a great many forces driving these unproductive ways of thinking, but I’ve come to think that one of the more important is a factor other people in the peak oil blogosphere have discussed already. This is a curious atrophy that afflicts the modern imagination, making it remarkably difficult for most people nowadays to imagine any future that isn’t simply a continuation of the present. Science fiction authors are not exempt from that; it’s impossible to read such classics of the genre as Isaac Asimov’s <i>Foundation</i> trilogy, for example, without noticing on nearly every page that the galactic empire that provides the series with its setting has the social customs of the 1950s, when the stories were written. For that matter, the much more recent SF bestseller <i>Anathem</i> by Neal Stephenson, which is not only set on another world but takes place at a point in its history more than 3400 years past the equivalent of our own time, characters wear T-shirts, eat energy bars, and use cell phones (they call them jeejahs, but they’re cell phones) to call each other or access the equivalent of the internet.<br><br>Still, one of the virtues of science fiction is that it doesn’t always fall into such ruts, and more often than other branches of literature, recognizes that the social and technological habits of any given era are not the permanent fixtures they sometimes seem, but points along a historical trajectory shaped, among other things, by ultural fashions and sheer dumb luck. Even if we get through the crises of our age the way the people of Stephenson’s world got through the period they call the Terrible Events, and create a technological society on the other side of it, our descendants won’t be wearing T-shirts or calling people on cell phones in the year 5400 AD, any more than we now wear togas or take notes on wax tablets the way the ancient Romans did; they’ll wear other clothing and communicate with other tools—and with any luck they’ll snack on something less repellent than energy bars. Fairly often, science fiction catches wind of such shifts; sometimes it succeeds in guessing them in advance; tolerably often, for that matter, what starts out as imagery from science fiction becomes the inspiration for design in the real world—I trust nobody thinks, for example, that it’s accidental that most early cell phones looked remarkably like the communicators from the original version of <i>Star Trek</i>.<br><br>That awareness is something the peak oil scene desperately needs just now. Leave out the alien space bats and the fetishistic obsession with mass death, and there have been few attempts so far to make sense of the world our descendants will inhabit in the wake of peak oil. Fiction, one of the principal tools our culture uses for such projects, has been particularly neglected here. James Kunstler is the major exception here, of course, with <a href=http://www.kunstler.com/books.php#WITCH>two very readable novels</a> set in a post-peak future; there’s also Caryl Johnston’s intriguing "essay-novel" <a href=http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/after-the-crash-an-essay-novel-of-the-post-hydrocarbon-age/2438736>After The Crash</a>; there are a few others, including my ongoing blog/novel <a href=http://starsreach.blogspot.com/ >Star’s Reach</a>. Still, the arrival of the limits to growth bids fair to have at least as massive an impact on the future of the decades ahead of us as space travel and its associated technological advances had on the decades that followed science fiction’s golden age, and it seems to me that it’s past time to get thinking and writing about the dangers and adventures, the hopes and fears, the dreams, problems and possibilities of a world on the far side of peak oil.<br><br>Longtime readers of this blog will have noticed that one of its central themes is the need to stop waiting for somebody else to do what needs to be done, and get working on it ourselves. With that in mind, I’d like to propose a contest—or a challenge—to this blog’s readers.<br><br>I propose that as many of you as are willing write a short story set in the future in the wake of peak oil, and put it on the internet. (If you don’t have a site, <a href=http://www.blogspot.com/ >Blogspot</a> and <a href=http://wordpress.com/ >Wordpress</a> both offer free blogging space that you can use for the purpose.) When it’s up, post a link to it on the comments page of this post. Meanwhile, I’m going to sound out some publishers, and see if I can find one willing to bring out the world’s first anthology of peak oil-related short stories; if that happens, I’ll pick the best dozen or so stories, add an introduction, and get the collection into print. If any money comes out of it—there probably won’t be much—it will be split between the contributors or, if they agree, donated to a peak oil nonprofit.<br><br>Here are the submission requirements for the contest:<br><br>Stories should be between 2500 and 7500 words in length;<br>They should be in English, with correct spelling, grammar and punctuation;<br>They should be stories—narratives with a plot and characters—and not simply a guided tour of some corner of the future as the author imagines it;<br>They should be set in our future, not in an alternate history or on some other planet;<br>They should be works of realistic fiction or science fiction, not fantasy—that is, the setting should follow the laws of nature as those are presently understood;<br>They should deal directly with the impact of peak oil, and the limits to growth in general, on the future; and...<br><i><b>There must be a complete and utter shortage of alien space bats.</b></i><br><br>What I mean by this latter specifically is that stories should show humanity dealing with peak oil and the limits to growth—dealing with them, not evading them. If your story insists that petroleum and other fossil fuels can be replaced by some other equally cheap and abundant energy resource, or that we can still have an industrial system churning out lots of consumer products in the absence of cheap abundant energy, it’s not going to be posted here or considered for the anthology. If your future leeps some elements of modern technology going, fair enough, but your story should provide enough detail that the reader can figure out where the resources and energy to keep the technology going come from, and how a society far more impoverished than ours can afford to divert enough of its limited wealth for the task.<br><br>For that matter, if your story has friendly aliens land in flying saucers to solve all humanity’s problems, it’s going to go into the recycle bin, and the same goes for transformations of consciousness, divine interventions, divine interventions in cybernetic drag such as the Singularity, or the like. To be considered for the contest, your story needs to start from the assumption that human beings like you and me are going to be living with much less energy, and far fewer of the products of energy, than you and I have available to us today; they’re going to have to cope with the legacies of the industrial age, and with the social, political, and ecological consequences thereof; and they’re going to live challenging, interesting, and maybe even appealing lives in that context.<br><br>This last, to my mind, is perhaps the most crucial point. There’s nothing easier, in fiction or out of it, than wallowing in the pornography of despair—insisting that life isn’t worth living in the absence of cheap energy and its comforts and conveniences, or in the presence of widespread poverty, illness and warfare. The fact remains that the vast majority of humanity’s existence on this planet has been spent in conditions that can be described in exactly these terms, and somehow our ancestors found life worth living in spite of it all. There’s nothing to be gained by sugarcoating the deindustrial future, to be sure; we’ve got a few very harsh centuries ahead of us; but it’s worth remembering that most of the great epics our species has written so far came out of exactly such periods, and neither they nor the historical events that inspired them were chronicles of unrelieved wretchedness.<br><br>Now of course it’s a bit early yet to begin writing the Mahabharatas, Nibelungenlieds and Heike Chronicles of the deindustrial dark ages; our Arjunas, Siegfrieds, and Yoshitsunes haven’t gotten around to being born yet, nor will for quite some time if the usual pace of events holds true. Still, plenty of people wrote about the first human footprints on the Moon long before those prints actually got there, and it’s not too soon to start talking about the first human footprints on the post-peak oil Earth in the same terms. Your stories may be set a year from now, or a thousand years from now; they may be tales of everyday life or stories of high adventure, or anything in between; but there’s a very real chance they can help kickstart the process of coming to terms with the future that’s ahead of us as the industrial age totters to its end.

The other knights stirred uneasily, such strange news must go to King, but they had no answers for the questions he might pose. Dragons and battles they well understood, but none could envision how a kingdom without wood might endure. I was Sir Tristam who spoke first. "Perhaps we might benefit by gathering as many ideas we might." "Humpf," replied Sir Gawain, "Do you propose we set the beaters and the hounds in the King's Wood, and have them drive all the ideas into a field where we may examine them?" "A simpler plan, I think, is to lure the ideas to us" replied Sir Tristam. "We shall sponsor a Bardic competition for the best tale about life in a land without wood!" "Bah," said Sir Gawain, "All we will hear are Faerie tales and sagas of Wizards calling fire from the heavens. Shall we tell the King Faerie tales when he asks our counsel?" "Tall tales indeed we shall hear, for that is the Bard's nature," replied Sir Tristam, "but even the tallest of tales may contain seeds of truth, for as we know, tales differ most in time and place, but not in the nature of man." The Knights considered what had been spoken, and in the end agreed that any plan to bring them the King's ear was better than no plan at all.

I began to speculate on a future in which a survivor of a The Road scenario stumbles upon a people who are doing a World Made by Hand scenario only to turn out to have an intact high-energy device in their possession (to their ultimate sorrow) as it leads to Road Warrior scenario. In other words, history will repeat itself wherever unsustainable energy supplies are concentrated, especially in weapons form.<br><br>In the novel, a salvage-industrial world is posited to have energy hot spots leading to resource war in the short term, leading perhaps to a post-salvage world through overreaching avarice. So descent might very well, in some places, deprive well-meaning Transition Townies of their windmills and solar panels, putting them on the road to bows and bow-drills. The story doesn't claim this as a universal outcome; there might be a perfectly fine civilization in Chile, for all the characters know. Their situation is set in motion by economic chaos leading to the abandonment of at least some of the Northern Hemisphere's spent fuel pools, which I thought horror enough for one novel.

I'll use it as an incentive to attempt to write one.<br><br>My own dream is to finally get around to writing and illustrating a whimsical children's book with a peak oil theme. I have some rough ideas, and your posts have been hammering in the importance of stopping my internal talk about someday doing things and simply getting to work on the project.<br><br>My current paid work is caring for young children, so I'm constantly analyzing and critiquing contemporary children's books from a peak oil perspective...what sort of myths and narratives they perpetuate, how might they be looked at 50, 100, or 1000 years from now, etc. I personally dislike a lot of contemporary young children's literature...too cutesy to me, too unoriginal, no depth, and morals too spelled out, even if they have "good" morals.<br><br>Certainly there are a number of children's books nowadays that have environmental and other themes of cultural critique. However, I find that many of them spell out their morals too much for children's (and my) likes. The trick in writing fiction, in my opinion, is not to state any moral too overtly, and allow readers to come to their own conclusions through it.<br><br>To me, many of Dr. Seuss's books fall under the category of successful children's books: they are loved both by many children and adults; they are creative; they can be read on many levels; they have embedded deeper commentary about the world (but don't state any morals outright); they are completely unserious and nonsensical yet are very serious and make a lot of sense. One of my favorites is "I Had Trouble Getting to Solla Sollew" and I can get new ideas out of it each time I read it. It's something a three-year old and a ninety-one-year old can enjoy. What I admire about Dr. Seuss's books is that while many of them playfully critique a lot of absurdities of mainstream culture, they have a remarkably popular appeal within mainstream culture, which is a tough feat to accomplish.<br><br>I would be excited to see a children's book that has a peak oil theme (not too overt though) with a quality comparable to books like Dr. Seuss's.<br><br>Well, I'm going to get to work.<br><br><a href=#c6349867133967157222 title="comment permalink">9/8/11, 10:21 AM</a><br><br>

If he'd done the same thing with the little details of Arbre's culture, it would have put the icing on the cake; as it was, I found that aspect of the novel disappointing.<br><br>As for Stirling having a character make a crack about alien space bats, though, that's brilliant -- it's exactly what someone familiar with internet slang would say in the face of an unexplained change of the sort Stirling imagines -- and of course it's all the more elegant in that Stirling's Change is a classic alien space bat, that is, an arbitrary gimmick that allowed him to get the setting he wanted to have for his story.<br><br>Brad, nope. I want readable short stories that imagine the future, with interesting characters and a plot, not rehashes of the present. Give it a try!<br><br>Sixbears, don't get me started on the problems with contemporary fantasy! Still, if fantasy flourishes in hard times, how come science fiction had the beginning of its golden age in the Great Depression? <br><br>Mister Roboto, I'm not at all sure how well an erotic story about peak oil would work, and I'd like to ask you and anyone else considering the project to go lightly on graphic sex of any flavor, but if you want to do a relationship story in the deindustrial future, that could be interesting. <br><br>Gregorach, okay, the first widely available cell phones -- and there are dozens of ergonomic ways to arrange a microphone and earpiece that don't involve a flip-open design. <br><br>Chris, did you read the article I linked to at that point in the post? John Keel, the author of the linked essay, has some useful things to say about the question you've asked; I've also <a href="http://www.llewellyn.com/product.php?ean=9780738713199" rel=nofollow>written a book</a> about the topic that goes into quite some detail about the manufacture of the UFO phenomenon. <br><br>Lynn, perhaps you could consider writing something far enough in the future that the age of crisis is past and something new and enticing is coming into being. There's more to look at than the dark. <br><br>Siddrudge, I'm not an optimist in any ordinary sense of the word; I'm simply aware that how we define our future shapes our actions and, over time, the future itself. <br><br>Phil, no, the nuclear bomber had the engines in the aft fuselage -- no pods at all. Your broader point is valid, but there's another side to it, as I mentioned to Siddrudge just now. <br><br>Yupped, please do give it a try! As for changes in consciousness, I don't mean at all to dismiss the kind that involves hard work and personal commitment; that's as necessary now as it's ever been. It's the kind mass marketed by the 2012 crowd these days -- the kind you don't have to work for, because the space brothers or Jesus or somebody does it for you -- that needs to be sent back to the belfry with the rest of the alien space bats. <br><br>Refarmer, that's typical H.G. Wells, and yes, it was rife with space bats; Wells usually was. <br><br>Lagedargent, that's the plan.<br><br><a href=#c4766096040426820110 title="comment permalink">9/8/11, 10:27 AM</a><br><br>

Butler's "Parable of the Sower" and related works are set in a world that has recently been bitten by resource scarcity, although I remember being struck the first time I read it at the implausibility of water being more expensive than gasoline (there are quite a few techniques for producing more than a gallon of distilled water using less than a gallon of gasoline, many of which can provide other energy services along the way). Despite those relative prices, a major part of the first story is a long journey on foot, along crumbling freeways.<br><br>In the mid future, "The Handmaid's Tale" can be read as a plausible prediction of the shape revival movements might take in response to limits on economic growth.<br><br>Lastly, in the far distant future, Ursula LeGuin's "Always Coming Home" has two cultures, one of which is tries to revive WWII-level military vehicle technology with only wood gas as fuel, and another which has a pre-agrarian food economy with high technology strictly limited to textile production.

Another example is the Parable of the Sower and the Parable of the Talents by Octavia Butler. As far as I can tell these books ARE about a peak oil world as she sees it and I think they are the best examples so far of "Peak Oil Literature" that I have read. Goes to show that some SF writers really are ahead of the times.

When they have not been bulldozing or demolishing them, they have acted as if such places do not exist. One example: for decades, the official land-use map of the Nairobi city council showed Kibera, which is perhaps 100 years old and home to as many as one fifth of the city’s residents, as a forest, not a neighborhood. With no city services and governments stuck in denial, these places have, of necessity, become hives of inventiveness, industry and self-made enterprise. Despite the hardship and deprivation, such illegal communities are the crucibles of our global future. Governments need to embrace them, not disown them.</i><br><br>Of course we can work in Peak Oil, etc. ( Mike Davis asserts that these slums are a byproduct of displacement caused by the Green Revolution )<br><br>But the theme should be that of a picaresque novel:<br><br><a rel=nofollow>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picaresque_novel</a><br><br><i>The picaresque novel (Spanish: "picaresca", from "pícaro", for "rogue" or "rascal") is a popular sub-genre of prose fiction which is usually satirical and depicts, in realistic and often humorous detail, the adventures of a roguish hero of low social class who lives by his wits in a corrupt society.

But while avoiding the nihilism of novels like Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road,” in which a father and son wander a hopeless post-apocalyptic moonscape, a number of recent books foresee futures that seem more than plausible as the nation’s ambient level of weirdness rises. <br><br>Albert Brooks, the actor and director, brought out “2030,” in which the nation’s economy is sent into a spin by seemingly good news: cancer is cured. The bad-news twist: the resulting drain on national resources by an aging population that no longer conforms to the actuarial tables and continues to consume resources at baby-boomer rates, and a rather literal twist on the notion of intergenerational warfare. “I chose not to go too far,” Mr. Brooks said. “I liked having more present in my future.” <br><br>In “Ready Player One,” the novelist Ernest Cline extrapolates from the ripples that rising energy prices and climate change send through the economy, and gives us a future where the suburbs die off and many people are packed into in high-rise urban trailer parks, spending their days on an increasingly addictive Internet instead of facing the quotidian squalor. Readers who spend so much time issuing updates via Twitter, Facebook and Google+ that they have forgotten what their spouses look like might see themselves reflected in Mr. Cline’s funhouse mirror. “I did try to envision it as a possible future,” Mr. Cline said. “I don’t see it as a future we’re necessarily headed for.” </i><br><br>http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/sunday-review/novelists-predict-future-with-eerie-accuracy.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;ref=johnschwartz&amp;adxnnlx=1315530215-eKiVdaAcJmZxoCDe7w2wJw<br><br><a href=#c4033969077483487758 title="comment permalink">9/8/11, 6:48 PM</a><br><br>

For example, if you want to see what America's future looks like, simply look at Mexico. Incidentally, Japan has been a post-growth society for twenty years now. Great tip about the Picaresque style.<br><br>I was actually contemplating a book of short stories about a post-petroleum world - it seemed to me that the experience of Peak Oil will not be one experience but several - it will affect every region and culture in a vastly different way, depending on its current level of development and how much prior modes of living have been preserved. In America, it may be the end of the world as we know it, Japan may retreat back to the Edo period (as Kunstler has hypothesized), Beduoin may ride camels past now silent and rusting wells in the desert, tending to their sheep, China may dust off Maoism. It's a fascinating playground for fiction, so I guess I'd better get to work.<br><br>Althought this might be a bit outside the discussion, one of the most influential descriptions of the future was Edward Bellamy's <i>Looking Backward</i> (reading it now). It is one of the few books ever published that created almost immediately on its appearance a political mass movement. In the US alone, over 162"Bellamy Clubs" sprang up to discuss and propagate the book's ideas.[via Wikipedia]. It also inspired almost an entire genre of supporters and rebuttals throughout the nineteenth century, most notably William Morris' <i>News From Nowhere</i>.

That's the problem--it's not just a fictional world that you made up out of whole cloth. It's a rational prediction of what <i>this</i> world is actually going to be like, free of fantasy and space bats. If most of us here share a common vision of what this world will look like, it may be impossible to draw a bright line between fan fiction and original settings. Original stories and differing historical events, sure. But if we all have a common understanding of what life will be like and what's going to bring about this change (resource depletion leading to the end of the Industrial Age), then all those settings are apt to look strongly similar, if not identical.<br><br>I can see that we could get around this by each writer talking about a different year or geographic region, but maybe you know an easier way around this. In your opinion, where does sharing a genre cross over into sharing a particular author's fictional world? How do we stay within your parameters while staying out of a place where the present day United States has fragmented, Japanese immigrants have swarmed the West Coast, the Spanish language has spread even more throughout North America, and people live in a relatively low-tech world where resources are supplied by savagers and ruinmen?<br><br><a href=#c3945335608294211952 title="comment permalink">9/8/11, 7:21 PM</a><br><br>

Was the sexual revolution a result of technology? Specifically, the birth control pill of the early 1960s, the automobile (get away from the parents, chaparones, and duennas, etc.), and the general abundance that resulted from widespread use of fossil fuels)? I would imagine that in a future world of limited resources, sort of like what most of humanity experienced for several thousand years before the age of fossil fuels, we'd go back to the traditional ways of courtship, arranged marriages, etc. <br><br>Without chemical birth control (and even with it in too many cases), sex equals children, which means be very careful, or be in love, or be seduced and abandoned... After the massive depopulation that we will certainly experience in the next century or so, people will more than likely want to limit the size of their families to be able to live within the constraints imposed by nature. <br><br>Of course, gay relationships would not have these problems, but hetero folks would have to be constantly balancing the trade-offs. It might depend on the level of medical technology: if most of your kids die before age five, you'll probably want to have as many rugrats as possible so you'll still have enough to work on the farm after you bury the other half.<br><br>My husband worked with several SF fans and writers on what a realistic "future history" might look like; everybody wanted to do the Heinlein thing. The final consensus was that such a thing wasn't possible. By the time you work out all the realistic (not physically impossible) possibilities, you've already been overtaken by new scientific discoveries, and totally improbably historical events. <br><br>To quote Yogi Berra: "It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future."<br><br><a href=#c4880793925959781341 title="comment permalink">9/8/11, 9:29 PM</a><br><br>

Earthpeeps are emigrating via big colony ships to new solar systems, fleeing the damage industrial society has wrought. (And how are they building and fuelling them, we ask ourselves). Automobiles are extinct, but affluent-enough people drive hovercraft (which iirc are far less energy efficient even than conventional autos, so why?). But the average person rides a bike or walks, which seems reasonable. Poor people wear paper clothing. Gummint record-keeping and surveillance are intrusive and universal, but a shadow subculture of undocumented persons persists. <br><br>They are not great lit, or even great sf, but they have a certain narrative zing and decent plotting, a few memorable characters, and reasonable extrapolations of current social trends. As I recall titles were Doppelgaenger Gambit, Spider Play, and Dragon's Teeth. Good light reading and possibly some background detail for lower-energy futures: Killough manages to convey a certain tired grittiness in her future.<br><br>There is also a novel I read some years ago, a first effort iirc and surprisingly good, about one last desperate bid to emigrate from Earth -- and somehow the emigres were Amish. And I'm darned if I can remember the title. SF and space bats were here an unimportant background to an extended meditation on ethics, conscience, error/sin, redemption, etc. If someone else can remind me of the title or author I'd be relieved.<br><br>Gardner Dozois wrote a devastating short story once about a ridiculously lucky character, a real so&amp;so who could do no wrong. Until suddenly he dies, to the amazement of an envious, bitter acquaintance who tells the story. But.. aha... in typical Dozois fashion he flips the plot inside out and the surviving narrator-character gets to live through peak oil, climate disasters, plagues, hunger, refugee camps, etc. -- which Lucky Boy died just in time to escape. A bleak little picture of a low-energy tomorrow and a summary of the attitude of (imho) far too many people over the age of 45: "Well, I'll be dead before it gets really bad."<br><br>Cecelia Holland the historical novelist, in an aberrant moment (or several), wrote a massive SF novel called Floating Worlds, most of which is space bats. But the interesting part is an Earth where all conventional government-as-we-know-it has failed and everyone is anarchist. How the protagonist deals with daily life, issues, interpersonal conflicts and so on, in an anarchist society, makes interesting reading and is (for me, at 20 years' distance) the only memorable part of the book. When thinking about governmental collapse, this might be interesting source material.<br><br>So might Rebecca Solnit's non-fiction work, A Paradise Built in Hell. A good antidote for the Mad Maximalists.<br><br>Having no time to write an entry, I'm kibitzing shamelessly from the sidelines!<br><br><a href=#c1971311170936039997 title="comment permalink">9/8/11, 10:46 PM</a><br><br>

Over all, extremely clever and inventive, but too many inconsistencies in its created world and too many convenient technologies that just happen along at exactly the right time. Not to mention I kept worrying about the real-life likely consequences of all his made-up technologies (and the energy and environmental costs: fuel trees?). And maybe I'd rather have Socrates be Socrates and Pythagoras be Pythagoras. <br><br>To me, the best part of the book were his descriptions of music and chanting (even his noticing that what we would call 12-tone compositions are tedious for students to learn and write) and the ideas of using music to communicate/cause change/express thoughts and emotions, not to mention initiate field changes (music of the spheres, anyone?).<br><br>IMHO the book (and its writer) could use a well-informed, well-educated, <i>rigorous</i> editor.

It struck me as a depressingly realistic end of civilization novel, right up there with <i>On the Beach</i> or <i>Level Seven</i>.<br><br>As far as story ideas are concerned, I could imagine a series of anthologies of short stories that approach the post Peak Oil world in a variety of ways. <br><br>For example, we could follow a single community or family coping with the downward steps, from the turbulent and painful near future to a more or less stable end state a dozen generations hence. I've read many multi-generational historical novels; why not do the same thing for the future?<br><br>Another way to approach it might be like escapefromcheeseland said: what happens in one part of the world with a particular culture and history will be completely different from another area. <br><br>Lotsa different variables will come into play, like for instance: will national governments still be around in anything like their present state? I'm afraid most of the so-called advanced nations will go broke long before we run out of oil. <br><br>Will new religious movements arise? Will giant corporations maintain, or even gain, power? Will India and Pakistan use nuclear weapons on each other? What happens when Baltimore and San Francisco and Shanghai are under 20 feet of water and whole populations are on the move? <br><br>No matter what happens, I'd like to see (and write) stories that show how people try to solve the many problems facing them (understanding, of course, that they may not always succeed).<br><br><a href=#c8082933823172889481 title="comment permalink">9/9/11, 10:01 PM</a><br><br>

Belanger's _The Place Called Attar_, which covers a span of time including the geologic past through modern times and into a near-future depression linked to climate change (colder rather than hotter).<br><br>John Crowley's _Engine Summer_ (perhaps most easily found in the anthology _Three Novels by John Crowley_). Set several hundred years into a future, Crowley weaves a rich tapestry of subcultures resembling traditional Native American ones and a semi-technological one still somewhat aware of the high-technology past. The end has some some crazy space bat (or something that rhymes with it) stuff, but boy can Crowley write beautiful prose!<br><br>Nobody mention David Brin's _The Postman_? I guess the movie was not very well regarded (which I have not seen), but I enjoyed the book.<br><br><a href=#c2253747372795229018 title="comment permalink">9/10/11, 6:13 PM</a><br><br>

It's about how the Edo period of Japanese culture managed to get by and live quite richly with tight resource constraints, using some fictionalized narrative to better portray the daily life. If I write a future Ecotechnic story myself, I'd draw a lot of inspiration from that book.<br><br><a href=#c5254980794506427869 title="comment permalink">9/10/11, 6:18 PM</a><br><br>

I'll look forward to your entry to the contest!<br><br>Cherokee, it's really simple. The key is the angle brackets, which I can't type here without confusing Blogger, but you'll see them right below the comment window around b, i, and a. So you type [a href="(URL you want to insert)"](words you want highlighted)[/a], but with angle brackets in place of the square brackets I've just used. Got your story, by the way -- I've been grabbing everyone's stories as posted and converting them into Word files, which are going into a folder for assessment down the road a bit. <br><br>Robert and Ozark, I'll look forward to your entries!<br><br>Adrian, that would take a couple of posts! A short version is that the forms or ideas of what fully developed Platonism calls the noetic realm, the realm of things knowable by pure intellection, arem't equatable to their material manifestations. The Platonic form of a chair isn't some sort of perfect chair hanging in another dimension -- it's the abstract relationship of support, in which every chair must participate in order to hold somebody's buttocks off the ground. <br><br>One of the biggest questions any form of Platonism faces is just how much of those relationships are a function of the human nervous system and innate mental structure, and how much is in the realm of forms. In a certain sense, that's going to be a key element of the plot in <i>Star's Reach</i>, so I'm not going to get too deeply into it here; let's just say that I tend to think inhabitants of other worlds will experience and understand those worlds in ways that don't necessarily have much in common with the primate operating system that runs so much of our brains. <br><br>Bill, I've added it to the stack. <br><br>Grrl, lousy handling of female characters is all too common in science fiction even now; I'm by no means sure that mine are particularly convincing, though at least I didn't end a lot of names with "a." <br><br>Richard, got it. Do you want to give it a title other than "The Future of Story Telling"? <br><br>Mike, I've been a fan of John Crowley since he first got into print. His sense of the future is as good as it is subtly handled; the deindustrial landscape of <i>Engine Summer</i> and the very well handled trajectory of decline in <i>Little, Big</i> seem utterly believable to me. Thanks for the other recommendations, also; I hadn't heard about the Azby Brown book. That's good to hear, as a good hard look at the Edo period -- when Japan got by on a minute fraction of the energy most people think of as essential, and yet had one of its cultural golden ages -- makes an excellent counterbalance to the common notion that the only alternative to vast amounts of energy waste is miserable squalor.<br><br><a href=#c5119494065243430002 title="comment permalink">9/10/11, 7:15 PM</a><br><br>

Over all, extremely clever and inventive, but too many inconsistencies in its created world and too many convenient technologies that just happen along at exactly the right time. Not to mention I kept worrying about the real-life likely consequences of all his made-up technologies (and the energy and environmental costs: fuel trees?). And maybe I'd rather have Socrates be Socrates and Pythagoras be Pythagoras.<br><br> To me, the best part of the book were his descriptions of music and chanting (even his noticing that what we would call 12-tone compositions are tedious for students to learn and write) and the ideas of using music to communicate/cause change/express thoughts and emotions, not to mention initiate field changes (music of the spheres, anyone?).<br><br> IMHO the book (and its writer) could use a well-informed, well-educated, rigorous editor.

Those of you who haven't gotten yours in yet, as previously mentioned, you've got a couple of months before I start weeding things out. <br><br>One hint at this point -- most of what's been submitted so far, though not all, more or less follows the standard model of post-peak decline pretty closely, and focuses on the track of decline to the exclusion of other possible narratives. There are many different stories to tell about the years of decline, and I'd welcome some of the less obvious ones. A useful reminder from Theodore Sturgeon: <br><br>"During the 'Ten Days that Shook the World,' the cafes and theaters of Moscow and Petrograd stayed open, people fell in love, sued each other, died, shed sweat and tears; and some of these were tears of laughter. So on Lihrt, while the decisions on the fate of the miserable Hvov were being formulated, gwik still fardled, funted, and fupped."<br><br><a href=#c5711594502754884300 title="comment permalink">9/11/11, 3:17 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you very much, I'm glad that some-one has taken the initiative to try and encourage SF writers to focus on this important subject as a basis for story creation. There is not enough public coverage, let alone debate about Peak Oil - and there really needs to be! Just the same as the oil crises of the 1970s inspired films like 'Mad Max', so Peak Oil should be a prompt for a whole raft of fiction dedicated to the issue of resource depletion.<br><br>This is something I have been working on myself for the past three years. I have written a novel (under the pen-name 'Owen Law') called 'Dragon Line'. Its set in Britain after a collapse caused not just by Peak Oil but by that other burgeoning threat which will not be affected one jot by the onset of resource depletion: Climate Change. (You only have to listen to James Lovelock to realise that the damage has already been done, unfortunately!) <br><br>Dragon Line is a bit of a saga, really - its got approximately 100 chapters! It does have a little of the metaphysical to it and incorporates something of the ancient myth and history of Britain (maybe of interest to yourself and other readers of this blog?)However, the novel was written to try and instil a sense of realism into the scenario, including a depiction of how people might be living in a total collapse scenario. Hopefuly, I have achieved something along these lines. I have posted the third draft on the Authonomy site and hope to get a publishing deal within due course.<br><br>I have a blogsite to promote the novel and discuss Peak Oil/Climate Change:<br><br>http://owenlaw.wordpress.com/<br><br>There are links to the novel on Authonomy.<br><br>I have also been working on short stories that have a general Peak Oil/Climate Change theme. I recently posted one on my blog called 'Matilda Leviathan', which is set in the near future with a backdrop of climate change, resource depletion and resultant regional nuclear conflict. I'm aiming to get this and two others as an anthology on Amazon Kindle very soon. The link for this is as follows:<br><br>http://owenlaw.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/an-owen-law-short-story-matilda-leviathan/<br><br>I like the idea of a short story specifically against the Peak Oil back-drop as a single issue.

I thought you might be interested.<br><br>Swarthmore College Approves the Construction of a High Hoop House on Crum Creek Ridge. Tues, September 10th, 2019<br><br><br>After much "sturm und drang", the Swarthmore College Sustainability Committee finally approved a proposal by Dharma Enterprises to allow construction of a high hoop house for off-season growing of medicinal herbs. Dharma Enterprises is an NGO that has been involved in the College's sustainability initiative since 2010 when it was instrumental in pushing through a plan to use goats for brush control on the campus. The college had been plagued by the invasion of English Ivy in many of the ground's oldest, most valuable, garden collections. <br><br>Dr. Suzette Larmond, a psychologist in private practice at the time, began experimenting with raising Nigerian Dwarf Dairy Goats in her .45 acre Swarthmore suburban backyard in 2009. In 2010, she was able to get approval for starting a herd of Kikos on College land. The College awarded a small grant for fencing and for purchasing starters for the herd. Larmond organized a group of students, town residents, and other volunteers to tend the goats. Many members of Dharma Enterprises were founding members of the Swarthmore Transition Town Initiative. Chenkin and her husband spent a year living with the goats in an authentic nomadic herding tent (obtained through mail order from Tibet) to get the herd established, their efforts augmented by stalwart members of Dharma Enterprises. Eventually the college allowed them to establish residence in a part of one of the 18 century historical residences that had been used for farming at the time the college was established. <br><br>Within 3 years Dharma Enterprises had a herd of 20 goats and a system utilizing portable fencing that allowed them to effectively rid most areas on campus of invasive plant species. The organization then requested a starter herd of sheep to keep Campus lawns trimmed and fertilized, and two Belgian draft horses along with haymaking equipment to provide a demonstration of how animals could be used to produce hay for the goats and sheep, all without petroleum products. Using these demonstration projects as a springboard, Dharma Enterprises began team teaching Permaculture at the College. Through their hands-on classes, many Swarthmore College students have now completed their college years with valuable agricultural skills as well as a first rate liberal education. Dharma Enterprises also runs a series of hand-on workshops on goat and sheep farming and animal powered agriculture which are attended by interested folks from all over the East Coast.<br><br>Over the years of their association with Dharma Enterprises, the college learned of Dr. Chenkin's passion for herbal medicine. During the great recession of 2008, Chenkin began bartering information on herbal remedies and psychotherapeutic services to residents of Swarthmore who had lost their insurance coverage. When petroleum scarcity led to a breakdown of the US transportation system and medicines could no longer be imported from Mexico (where most of them were being manufactured), many residents were already growing their own herbs, which were used in a number of emergency situations to treat college students and staff, as well a local residents. <br><br>The approval of the high hoop house will enable Dharma Enterprises to grow herbs through 10 months of the year instead of 5.

Within that limit, take your time and make the story work. <br><br>Ando, if you've found my peak oil books useful in creating your imaginary future, that's fine. Not required by any means, but fine. <br><br>Adrian, I'm not sure they're "forms of forms," so much as that the Forms themselves are far more abstract than we tend to think at first glance, and what we think of as the forms -- our conception of the function of support, for example -- actually exist at what Plotinus called the psychic level, the level of mental images and similitudes. An alien, contemplating the function of support, would express it in wholly different mental imagery and ideas, but its equivalent of a chair -- bizarre though that would look to us -- would still bear weight, because in its own way, it would participate in the idea of support. That's my take, at least!<br><br>Goat Path, fun! Now give it characters and a plot with a conflict, and you've got the beginnings of a story. <br><br>Antonio, Scribd won't let me download your story, so I can't add it to the stack.

I look forward to reading these stories!<br><br>One comment about Kunstler’s “World Made By Hand” novels. I read them with interest, and I’m glad he wrote them, but I feel that he stacks the deck a bit. Epidemics and two nuclear strikes create massive social change and depopulation within a very short time.... there are plenty of empty houses on Main Street, the electricity still comes on occasionally, and people still remember hot dogs. Well, that is one possible scenario... it makes for dramatic novels... it doesn't strike me as the most likely scenario. <br><br>A couple of questions for people who’re thinking about writing a story: I find myself wondering how people of the cell phone generation, constantly plugged in, will adapt if/when this level of technology is no longer available. I wonder how all of us will adapt if/when the local grocery store no longer carries out-of-season fruit and twenty varieties of chocolate bars.
