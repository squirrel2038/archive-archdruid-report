When I commented last week that I was going to have to discuss the intersection of peak oil and magic, I had a pretty fair idea what the immediate response would be, and that duly followed. Before the metaphorical ink on the post was dry, people were already popping up on the peak oil blogosphere to denounce in advance what they were sure I was going to say. For those of us who belong to the small community of people who study and practice magic, this is familiar ground; there’s a wry amusement in watching such antics, but no least trace of surprise.<br><br>Being an operative mage in the contemporary industrial world, really, resembles nothing so much as being an evolutionary biologist at a convention of Southern Baptists—or, for that matter, an educated theist at a meeting of the more intolerant sort of atheists. The great majority of the people around you know essentially nothing about the subject that concerns you, though they have an ample fund of misinformation culled from books and websites written and read exclusively by people who share their prejudices. They consider themselves qualified to judge the subject because they’ve lifted some canned polemics from these same books and websites, and if you show them that the canned polemics are riddled with ignorance, irrelevancies, and straw man arguments, they’ll just give you an irritated look and go right back to the canned polemics.<br><br>Those of my readers with a background in sociology will have no trouble recognizing this as a textbook case in the sociology of deviance—specifically, the way that human groups use seeming statements of fact the way baboons use bared teeth and threat postures, to stake out territory and drive off outsiders. As far as we know, baboons don’t try to use their territorial displays to make sense of their world, and this is to their credit. Human beings, alas, are not always so clever, and the resulting confusions play a massive though rarely recognized role in mangling communication in any complex society.<br><br>Try to talk about magic and this sort of mangled communication shows up early and often, as a recent and topical example shows clearly enough. About the time I started work on last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post, <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/ >The Oil Drum</a> posted without comment this year’s most serenely idiotic statement about peak oil. The source was investment analyst Porter Stansberry; he was being interviewed about why peak oil isn’t a problem, and his reasoning ran as follows: "[G]eology doesn’t create oil; capital creates oil. The more capital you put toward oil, the more of it there will be." (You can read the whole interview <a href=http://jutiagroup.com/20110913-porter-stansberry-u-s-shifts-to-gas-export-role/ >here</a>.)<br><br>Consider that statement for a good long moment. It’s not unique to Stansberry; the late Julian Simon used to make essentially the same claim, and you’ll hear it from quite a few economists these days. What Stansberry is saying is that if you have enough money to invest, geological limits to petroleum extraction don’t exist. Money, though, is a symbolic system consisting of abstract representations of wealth, and Stansberry is thus claiming that the manipulation of symbols wields occult powers that can override the laws of nature and conjure up petroleum from the depths of the Earth.<br><br>Most people would call this an example of magical thinking, and it corresponds very closely to the sort of thing people do in Harry Potter movies and other media portrayals of magic. It may be worth noting, though, that this is not what operative mages claim to be able to do. In point of fact, I’ve carried out a very modest survey over the last few years by presenting claims like Stansberry’s to the operative mages I know, and noting their responses. The typical reaction, edited for printability, is on the order of "You’ve got to be kidding. People actually <i>believe</i> that?"<br><br>What our society calls magical thinking, in other words, is not the kind of thinking that mages actually do, and the frequent denunciations of magical thinking flung at operative mages would be much more sensibly directed at economists. (I suppose there isn’t much hope of getting it renamed "economic thinking," though that’s a more accurate term.) This state of affairs unfolds from the very tangled history surrounding magic in the Western world, and is best understood via a thought experiment.<br><br>Imagine, then, that the cultural struggles of the late Renaissance that launched the scientific revolution and consigned magic to the crawlspaces of our society went the other way, and magic, rather than science, became the core cultural project of the modern world. You live in that alternate world, and one fine afternoon you step out of a bookstore on a street near the local university and head for the next stop on your list of errands, as carriages rattle over the cobblestones alongside you. It’s graduation day, and students in star-bedecked robes and tall pointed caps pass you on the sidewalk in droves. They’ve just completed degrees in astrology, alchemy, and other serious subjects; some will go on to graduate school, others to jobs—you overhear an excited young astrologer telling his friends that he’s just gotten a position at a brokerage, where he’ll be casting horoscopes to predict stock values.<br><br>You’re none too interested in the chatter, though, because you’ve just bought a bestselling novel that you’re dying to read—<i>Harry Potter and the Scientist’s Stone</i>. You already know half the plot, of course, since everybody’s been talking about it since it hit the bookstands. It’s about this orphan kid who’s stuck in this horrible home situation, but it turns out that his parents were actually scientists, and pretty soon a lab assistant comes and takes him away to the mysterious Warthogs Institute where everybody goes around wearing lab coats and muttering algebraic equations. There he gets to study science, which amounts to chanting chemical formulas and building big clanking machines to cause the changes in consciousness that ordinary people get done by magic.<br><br>In this alternate world, mind you, there are people who actually try to practice science—this despite the efforts of the Committee for Paranormal Investigation of Claims of the Scientific, whose members go around heaping disdain on anybody who claims to have experienced a repeatable cause and effect relationship. A lot of would-be scientists simply dress up in lab coats, fill their apartments with test tubes and similarly spooky decor, and leave popular books with titles like <i>Secrets of the Physicists Revealed!</i> on the coffee table to impress dates. Those who get beyond this sort of thing, as often as not, still have a great deal of Harry Potter mixed up with their science, and keep on trying to figure out how to make science do what magic does, with no significant success.<br><br>It’s only among the more experienced and serious practitioners in this alternate world that you find people who have realized that the difference between science and magic isn’t a difference of means but of ends—that science isn’t about causing changes in consciousness, as magic is, but about learning and then applying the properties of matter and energy on their own terms. In a society that embraces magic as its central cultural project, mind you, most people don’t see much value in this latter endeavor. The irony is that some of the most serious problems facing the alternate world can’t be solved by changes in consciousness. They could conceivably be solved by using the properties of matter and energy, but if you try telling people that, you’ll get an irritated look, and then a bunch of canned polemics.<br><br>Step back through the looking glass at this point, and you’ll find that the same situation applies once you reverse all the signs. Science, not magic, became the core cultural project of our civilization, and the things that science and technology can do—learning and applying the properties of matter and energy—are the things we consider important. Popular images of magic thus have it imitating science and technology in one way or another. The sort of fake magic you get ad nauseam in the Harry Potter franchise is as good an example as any; Harry and his classmates fly around on brooms, zap people with wands, and manipulate matter and energy directly, which is exactly what magic does not do.<br><br>The apotheosis of this sort of thinking is Arthur C. Clarke’s famous Third Law: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." I mean no disrespect whatsoever to Clarke, who was among the best of SF authors; it’s hardly blameworthy that he shared misunderstandings of magic that were all but universal in his culture. The point remains that since magic does not do what technology does, and vice versa, the Third Law should properly be renamed Clarke’s Fallacy; no matter how advanced a technology may be, it does the kind of thing technologies do—that is to say, it manipulates matter and energy directly, which again is what magic does not do. I’d like to propose, in fact, an alternative rule, which I’ve modestly titled Greer’s Law: "Anyone who is unable to distinguish between magic and any technology, however advanced, doesn’t know much about magic."<br><br>To understand what it is that magic does do, it’s crucial to look at the specific purposes for which magic is used in practice. Since every human culture known to history has practiced magic, this isn’t exactly hard, and the purposes of magic have varied remarkably little over the centuries. Why do people turn to magic? To tilt the odds their way in hunting, gambling, war, and any other activity that combines high uncertainty with high stakes; to establish, improve, and shape the whole range of human relationships; to heal illnesses of body and mind; to integrate the personality and bring it into harmony with the structures of the cosmos, however those are understood; and, not least, to deal with the fact that other people are using magic for these same purposes, and not always with your best interests in mind.<br><br>What do these things all have in common? They all deal with mental phenomena, individual or collective. Grasp that, and you start to grasp what magic is all about.<br><br>Philosophers and psychologists down the centuries have tried to bring our attention to two important but generally neglected facts: we know more than we realize, and we affect more than we realize. Look at the human organism from an evolutionary standpoint and this isn’t hard to understand. Our rational, conscious, symbol-using minds are recent and rather rickety structures built over the top of a superbly adapted mammalian nervous system. The tangled relationship between the two shows up, for example, in the way that athletes have to learn to get their thinking minds out of the way in order to reach peak performance. It’s a dirty trick well known among tennis players to ask your opponent just how he holds his thumb when hitting backhand, knowing that the unwanted awareness will mess up his coordination and quite possibly cost him the game.<br><br>The same factors apply in most other aspects of human life. When two people fall in love, for example, their rational minds have little to do with the matter; the same nonrational, nonverbal patterns of mutual communication that handled pair bonding for our prehuman ancestors do the same thing for us, and as often as not our rational minds simply get hauled along for the ride, squawking and complaining all the way. Social status is determined the same way; read up on social hierarchies among baboons and then visit, say, an activist group trying to find consensus, and if you pay attention to body language and other nonverbal cues, you’ll quickly spot identical patterns at work. In my experience, at least, the more egalitarian a group claims to be, the more completely it depends on baboon politics to maintain group cohesion and direction—though if you mention that in such circles, you’ll get an irritated look followed by canned polemics.<br><br>I could list any number of other examples, but I trust my readers will have gotten the point: a great deal of what goes on in our lives depends not on our rational, linguistic, symbol-using minds, but on an intricate and richly communicative nonrational substructure inherited from our animal ancestors, most of which we never notice at all and much of which is highly resistant to any kind of conscious control. The main current of our industrial culture, which has made the rational mind central to its core cultural project and fixates on a particular mode of conscious control—more on that in a later post—has few resources to offer for dealing with that substructure, other than ignoring it, white-knuckling it, or drugging it into temporary submission. There are better tools to hand, though: the tools of magic.<br><br>Consider a healing spell, the sort of thing that shamans, sorcerers, and mages have practiced down through the centuries. Do these work? Quite often, yes, and the mechanism in many cases seems to be what today’s science calls the placebo effect. Today’s science treats the placebo effect as an obstacle to be gotten out of the way, and it’s right to do so. If you’re trying to find out the properties of matter and energy on their own terms, the placebo effect and its kin are major sources of confusion. You need to keep mental phenomena from bollixing up your perception of physical phenomena, or the results aren’t good. What’s an obstacle to the scientist, though, is the mage’s bread and butter.<br><br>The operative mage doesn’t want to get rid of the placebo effect. Quite the contrary, he or she wants to amplify it and use it, to direct the body’s healing resources toward a cure. That’s what the psychologically charged symbols, the ritual psychodrama, the emotionally evocative herbs and incenses, and all the other tools of operative magic are there to accomplish. Apply the same logic to the other purposes of magic mentioned above, and the same interpretation applies. We know more than we realize, and affect more than we realize; tapping into that unnoticed knowledge can lead to better choices, just as tapping into that unnoticed ability to affect situations can lead to better outcomes. These two taken together are what’s generally known as "luck."<br><br>But what about the spirits, planes, powers, and all the other metaphysical hardware that fills books on magical theory? Are those real? That’s a very good question with a very complex and uncertain answer. Anyone who takes up serious magical training will start to experience such things within a year or two of beginning daily practices; the effect is reliable enough that those of us who teach magic all know to expect the panicky phone call or email that comes right after each student has his or her first experience of the kind. The experiences we’re discussing are mental in nature, not physical; they have the appearance of real beings, places, and so on, but then the same thing is true of the people and places encountered in dreams.<br><br>There’s a lively and continuing debate among operative mages about the ontological status of these things—are they hallucinations? Dissociated complexes? Archetypes of the collective unconscious? Actual entities existing on a continuum perceived solely by the mind?—but so far, at least, it’s proven wretchedly hard to come up with a verifiable answer. The traditional lore offers useful guidance in how to deal with these experiences while maintaining a state of relative mental balance, and for the time being that’s about all that can be said for certain.<br><br>The debates over the nature of magical experience stray into some weird territory on occasion. Still, I’ve been studying and practicing this stuff for more than three decades, and in my experience, the only way an operative mage is going to get a broom to fly is to buy round trip airfare and take the broom as checked baggage. It really is that simple.<br><br>The same logic applies at least as forcefully to the intersection between magic and peak oil. Porter Stansberry can brandish the arcane symbols of the stock market and intone the ritual gibberish of economic textbooks all he wants; his incantations aren’t going to cause petroleum to materialize in the depleted reservoirs of America and the world. Chanting "Drill, baby, drill" may well put the chanters into a trance state—certainly the people who’ve made this their mantra seem to have achieved a blissful unconcern with the realities of petroleum geology—but that’s all it’s going to do. "The planes," to cite a magical maxim, "are discrete and not continuous," which means in ordinary language that petroleum reserves are one thing and daydreams quite another, and trying to insist that the former has to follow the same rules as the latter is a sucker’s game.<br><br>That being said, there’s another side to the story, because peak oil is not only, or even primarily, a problem of what magical philosophy generally calls the physical plane. The finite nature of petroleum and other fossil fuel reserves, and the very limited prospects for replacing fossil fuels with anything else, are a function of hard physical limits, of course, but the three decades of bad decisions that have backed America and the industrial world into a corner of their own making, and foreclosed any number of technically feasible responses to the impending end of the age of cheap energy, are not physical in nature. They belong to the plane of consciousness—to the realm of choices and worldviews, of the unrecognized motives and unacknowledged desires that run rampant through our civilization’s profoundly murky inner relationship with its technology and the energy sources that power the latter.<br><br>Over the last decade or so, quite a few people have tried to solve the technical issues of peak oil without grappling with, or even recognizing, the existence of this other dimension of our predicament, and the result has been a great many technically appealing solutions that sit gathering dust on the shelves. (Mention this to those who are busy coming up with new additions to the same dusty shelf and—well, you know what kind of look and response you’ll get.) The green wizardry of the Seventies, to its credit, went deeper, and attempted—with some success—to address these other issues: issues that could be called cultural, or psychological, or (let’s whisper the word) spiritual. To make sense of their explorations and build on them, though, we’re going to have to go a good deal further into the topic of magic, talk about the black hole in the history of Western philosophy, and—why not?—break out a bottle of Love Potion No. 9. We’ll do that next week.

As someone who has looked at many spiritual paths and arcane subjects but is also very attached to data, I have an open mind at this point.

It seems we're in an issue of semantics here. What most people call "magic" I would term "conjuring." What you have termed "magic" I would call mysticism. Your descriptions of magic are very similar to the writings of oriental Scholar John Blofeld, specifically in his book "The Tantric Mysticism of Tibet," which I highly recommend. He makes the point that the seemingly "supernatural" elements of Tibetan religion are simply tools to manipulate consciousness toward a desired end - the attainment of enlightenment. Once the end is reached, the tools can be discarded.<br><br>I think you would very much enjoy this essay on the BBC Web site last week from John Gray, "Can religion tell us more than science?" A taste:<br><br>"We tend to assume that religion is a question of what we believe or don't believe. It's an assumption with a long history in western philosophy, which has been reinforced in recent years by the dull debate on atheism." <br><br>"In this view belonging to a religion involves accepting a set of beliefs, which are held before the mind and assessed in terms of the evidence that exists for and against them. Religion is then not fundamentally different from science, both seem like attempts to frame true beliefs about the world. That way of thinking tends to see science and religion as rivals, and it then becomes tempting to conclude that there's no longer any need for religion." <br><br>"This was the view presented by the Victorian anthropologist JG Frazer in his book The Golden Bough, a study of the myths of primitive peoples that is still in print. According to Frazer, human thought advances through a series of stages that culminate in science.

Basic to magic is the training of the will and the imagination; the odd experiences that come up now and again are side effects, and students of magic are normally well advised to ignore them and get on with the work.

The end result might be the same, or the latter option could provide less discrimination about when it was useful and when it wasn't... <br><br>What of the idea of one of the fruits of the enlightenment being a stronger ability to make that sort of distinction in the first place? Though come to think of it, trying to directly affect the world with efforts that can only affect the mind seems to be a description of the unsuccessful attempts of economists and their ilk to make the world behave according to their models and the like, so I guess it might not exactly be one of the main results.<br><br>On the topic of mental influences to health, I just yesterday attended an absolutely incredible talk here at grad school that is related and I thought would be of interest... A visiting researcher presented basically his life's work, studying the immune system for more than 20 years. His latest work, just being published, found a direct connection between the brain and the immune system which regulates the whole body's level of inflammation and the general strength of immune responses.<br><br>Turns out that there is a direct connection via a nerve to your spleen that actually connects to immune system cells inside it with what look for all the world like synapses, and those cells then carry the signal to other immune cells that circulate throughout the body with chemicals that are usually only found in nerves. That <i>one</i> nerve winds up regulating about 75% of the signals responsible for causing inflammation and other whole-body reactions. What's more, the nerve is connected to bits of your brain that regulate other body functions like heart rate and blood pressure with mood and are strongly affected by behavior/thought/meditation/exercise etc, <i>and</i> he found that the nerve is suspiciously quiet in people with arthritis and lupus and other inflammation-based diseases. Physically messing with it in mice could even slow or accelerate the course of genetic arthritis by a factor of <i>two</i>. It's almost certainly not the only such circuit around. The causal connections between our brains/minds and the rest of our body are quite real, and not to be underestimated.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c3068382594026027509 title="comment permalink">9/21/11, 9:15 PM</a><br><br>

The word 'magic' doesn't mean what you think it means. The problem is that language is a consensus based operation but there is not a definitive authority in charge of regulating that consensus. You, yourself, raised this semantic issue in the The Twilight of the Machine post over the term <a href=../../2010/04/twilight-of-machine.html rel=nofollow>efficiency</a>.<br><br> The problem is that regular lay folk have an understanding of the word 'efficiency' that is at odds with the economists use of the term. Here is the passage from your post:<br><br>It’s a credo of contemporary economics that HAL is more efficient than Rosie; since the term “efficiency” in contemporary economic parlance means “labor efficiency,” or in other words how much production you can get per worker, any machine is by definition more efficient than human labor. In a world of resource constraints, though, this definition of efficiency becomes very hard to justify.<br><br> Now we were all with you on this because the common use of efficiency was at odds with the particular use that economists had attached to it. But, in today's post you are asking us to do the opposite; you are asking us to ignore the common use of the word 'magic' and adopt your industry specific jargon.<br><br> So, back to the title of the post, referring to Clarke's Third Law as 'Clarke's Fallacy' is a tactical error because Clarke 'owns' the word the word magic against your wishes in exactly the same way that you own efficiency against the economists wishes.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c7342422954499117897 title="comment permalink">9/21/11, 9:57 PM</a><br><br>

A little later, the student has wonderful experience of the great nature of the mind, and celestial singing and whatnot. He goes to the master, excited about this breakthrough, and the master says, "Let it go." <br><br>Another story is a hoary old chestnut, but it involves the student experiencing an amazingly powerful thing, and getting The Answer. He tells the master about it, and the master vexes the student by telling him that the student's experience is totally normal, and common.

It's given me a lot to think about!<br><br>This post has given me a lot of food for thought as well. For a long time I never liked "causing change in consciousness in accordance with will" as a definition of magic. It smacked of trying to put magic into a reductionist box of psychological tricks and robbed it of its majesty. I fall pretty firmly into the "actual entities existing on a continuum perceived solely by the mind" camp of spirit interaction, and the psychological model of magic never satisfactorally presented a mechanism to me of how magic can affect other people at a distance, even with Jung's theories. The more I practice magic and talk with other mages, the more I'm starting to change my mind about consciousness. In the end, from my perspective, the mechanism doesn't matter so much as long as the eventual effect comes out the way you want. I want to equate consciousness with the idea of spiritus, as in the traditional animus/spiritus/corpus model, but I'm unsure if that's too narrow of a definition.<br><br>Looking forward to future essays!<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c5557572171229664958 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 2:35 AM</a><br><br>

He is also an organic gardener" (I approve of the second bit about organic gardening as well!). In dialogue with you this is never far from my mind and I consider it both an honour and a privilege to be able to communicate directly with you.<br><br>I haven't lived as long as you, but during this time I've had interactions of one sort or another for varying periods of time with sociopaths / narcissists. Very unpleasant people.<br><br>So, realising that something was deficient in myself, I began learning about all sorts of things so as to avoid these types in the future.<br><br>Learning, however requires an open mind, it can take you on unexpected journeys and the end product can mean a change in your belief systems. It can also come from the most unlikely sources. It also never finishes as there is no end point unless you choose a line in the sand. The breadth of knowledge that is available exceeds any one individual by a big margin.<br><br>It took me quite a while to accept that people can be manipulated or have their belief systems altered at the whim of others - some of who were naturals whilst others weren't. Yet once I accepted it, and learned some of the methods, I could see it literally going on all over the place. <br><br>Marketing, relationships, economic and political announcements - they are covered in it. Our society stinks of it.<br><br>Oil is just another example. How anyone could think that a non renewable resource that is mined out of the ground can continue to be mined and used without thought for the future is beyond me. Yet, the thought persists that it will go on forever and you can thumb your nose at anyone who dares speaks differently. A scary thought.<br><br>So, I find myself on an organic farm in the middle of nowhere important, focused on producing an increasing quantity and diversity of fruit and vegetables on a long term sustainable basis wondering at what point others will see the delusion for what it is. Who knows what will happen then, they surely wont be happy though.

(Why else are Unix experts called "gurus", who manipulate "daemons", etc.?) Possibly, it's because we're all nerds who immersed ourselves in Tolkien, Clarke, and Dungeons and Dragons before taking up "real" work, and so this language and imagery naturally bubbles up.

I have always been impressed with Fritz Schumacher's explanation of that notion. He makes that point very well by explaining how things like physics are always focused on reducing problems to their simplest form by eliminating almost all variables from experiments so that you are only studying one variable at a time. It is a powerful technique. The problem though, as he points out, is that almost all of the real problems of the world are on a completely different plane - and we cannot apply scientific thinking to them. <br><br>Even a lifelong scientist and engineer like me came to that realization as I grew older and hopefully wiser.<br><br>Looking forward to future posts.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c6333034892160761193 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 4:45 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you for the clearly articulated thoughts, John. Maybe it's only because I tend to seek out such things, but it seems to me that awareness of the nature of magic as you explain it here -- in other words, of the nature of magic as it has always really been, despite the plethora of misreadings and misunderstandings -- is currently spreading in modern corporate-technocratic society. A function of the Internet combined with certain seriously influential pop cultural trends and figures, maybe (such as the continued broadcasting of these ideas and clarifications to a mass audience by the likes of Alan Moore and Grant Morrison).<br><br>I'm particularly interested to see how such things "play" among the peak oil crowd, which is why I'm so fascinated, but not surprised, to see you tackling the matter here. When Kunstler brought a bit of magic into <i>World Made by Hand</i> and <i>The Witch of Hebron</i>, a lot of readers, especially those who reviewed the books in "high" places, didn't know what to make of it. But the intersection of such things, such themes, seems a patently obvious and mythically inevitable development to me, especially since, as Kunstler pointed out in an interview that I read someplace or other, when the external structures of industrial-technological society begin to falter and crumble, the corresponding psychological structures will be similarly affected, and older (ancient) psychic ways of being that they obscured and supplanted for centuries may well come to the fore.<br><br>Regarding the ontological status of the entities and forces encountered in magical work, don't be surprised if I quote you in a series of articles that I've been publishing at my Demon Muse blog about the question of whether the muse / daimon / genius of creative artists is "really real" or just a function of the unconscious mind in the modern biological materialist sense.

The weekly posts that have given me over towards considerations of, say, the very practical nature of thermodynamics in the daily rounds of my life. I know I wouldn't be sewing up thermal drapes if it weren't for the magick practiced through this medium.<br><br>My sense of magick arises in part from the work of David Abram, who being a sleight-of-hand magician and philosopher has written a wonderful book on the nature of language and perception called The Spell of the Sensuous. His argument concerning language and particularly writing is fascinating. I consider that we don't often notice language as magick in the way that folks in prior civilizations did where literacy was not near universal and those who had the power of inscription could wield quite some power.<br><br>In thinking of economists, I tend to think of them as part of the priest-magician caste of modern society who maintain the spell of industrial civilization.

However, like in the aforementioned example, these practices are no longer rooted in anything physical which means it is not long before its power suddenly disappears.<br><br>To me this is critical, because one of the major stories of our time is that there is a difference between "mind" and "body."

From it I learned that living from your ego is usually going to be a very serious impediment to wisdom and maturity, and to live fully, one must necessarily embrace a greater sense of self that comes from our spirit. I'm guessing that the proper study of magic also teaches its students that very same lesson, though like many fundamentalist theologies, <i>ACIM</i> is very anti-magic. ("All magic is an attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable.") But considering that fundamentalist theologies tend to attract people with rather serious neurotic emotional problems {cough}Marianne Williamson{cough}, the command to avoid the practice of magic is probably sound advice for such folk.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c3110568232600125276 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 6:08 AM</a><br><br>

Even some of the contributors whom I consider more enlightened were excusing the Archdruid's more eccentric side. My only comment during the thread:<br><br><i>Funny, I too 'wish' that folks would spend their decision making energies more pragmatically, but, considering human history and the role that magical thinking has played to this point in forming and driving societies and 'progress', to think that humans will change is, in itself, stretching magical thinking about as far as you can. You may as well run around and wave some anti-magical-thinking magic wand. <br><br>The problem with the pragmatists who, rightfully IMO, want to move humankind into a more sustainable mode, is that they haven't been able to cast the right magic spells to obtain their goals. That humans, en mass, are far more easily swayed by "magic" than logic is something the scientists and engineers haven't figured out how to deal with.

Quite the contrary, he or she wants to amplify it and use it, to direct the body’s healing resources toward a cure."<br><br>This got me thinking about my father, a respected neurosurgeon, who drifted away from his surgical practice to concentrate on the control of chronic pain. For decades he had a clinic at a major medical center. He was a sort of last resort for people suffering from migraines, back pain, and the like. In addition to detoxifying patients from overprescribed medications, and utilizing certain practices such as actupuncture and transmagnetic stimulation, his clinic's main focus was biofeedback. Via monitoring their own sweatgland activity and the like, patients could learn to relax and "control" their body's response to pain. (Some are better at this than others.) A certain percentage were "cured" by this and similar "mind over matter" techniques.<br><br>Given your account of magic and science, how would you describe this? Magic? Science? Some sort of hybrid that illustrates how the two aren't so neatly separable? (I take this latter to be one of your central points.) <br><br>My father is very much a no-b.s. man of science. Yet when derided by ignoramuses about his "mind over matter" methods being (pejoratively) magical or some such, he would simply hold out his hand and clench his fingers into a fist. He would then explain that the fist clenching he had just accomplished was nothing other than "mind over matter". I always loved that example. Always leaves the crude materialist at a loss! <br><br>Anyway, my question then is how you would describe the patient-centered pain control techniques such as biofeedback? (btw, if unfamiliar, google "pain control and biofeedback" and you'll find plenty of info). Perhaps an example of a very specific form of "amplifying the placebo effect"? Yet nothing un-scientific about it, and in fact very well-studied and published in medical journals, etc.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c3966823288816057627 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 7:08 AM</a><br><br>

Is it the (what seems to me) perfectly natural human tendency to engage in wishful thinking about getting some kind of "free lunch" from the universe without actually having to work for it? I mean, it would be nice to be able to turn lead into gold, for example (even though doing that would wreck more havoc on the economy than even the Federal Reserve and Congress combined could do), but you'd need a really big particle accelerator to make it happen, and the electricity bill to run the damn thing would be more than the value of the gold, even at today's inflated prices. So, why is the misconception about the nature of "magic" so widespread?<br><br>And speaking of magical thinking in Washington and on Wall Street, Porter Stansberry is not the only one engaged in that practice. The Dow fell almost 300 points yesterday after the Fed announced its latest plan to "save" us, and is down another 300 points as I write this. Oops.

What is more interesting is seeing there are several other engineers down in the comments who are willing to tag along with this line of thought. I guess we all somewhat share the mindset of "if it works, use it" and leave the theory to the physicists and other theologians.<br><br>I do have a question that I have puzzled over on and off over the years. As the materialistic mindset rose to dominance in Western thought over the past several hundred years, societies all over the globe fell one by one to this march of materialism. Cultures that had deep roots in practicing various forms of "magic" fell to bullet, artillery shell and Cartesian "logic." While acknowledging that Western thought has for the most part neglected the integration of the personality and denigrated spiritual pursuits, is this not the result of watching it overcome older methods of relating self to the world around us?<br><br>Maybe I am off base here, but if:<br><br><i> "...it’s crucial to look at the specific purposes for which magic is used in practice. Since every human culture known to history has practiced magic, this isn’t exactly hard, and the purposes of magic have varied remarkably little over the centuries. Why do people turn to magic? To tilt the odds their way in hunting, gambling, war, and any other activity that combines high uncertainty with high stakes; to establish, improve, and shape the whole range of human relationships; to heal illnesses of body and mind; to integrate the personality and bring it into harmony with the structures of the cosmos, however those are understood; and, not least, to deal with the fact that other people are using magic for these same purposes, and not always with your best interests in mind."</i> <br><br>Then is the materialist mindset nothing more than a method of doing all the above? A method that maybe got out of hand and has gone to the extreme in looking for a material explanation for everything? (This is assuming the psychological interpretation of "magic." I won't dive down the rabbit hole of evocation to manifestation or other such topics)<br><br>I guess what I am trying to ask is, what would magic, as interpreted above, have to offer a world in decline that we can't obtain from the various types of self-improvement philosophies that have circulated in Western thought since at least the late 1800s?<br><br>If it truly is all in our heads, would that mean that the writings of Napoleon Hill might have the same significance as those of Agrippa or Paracelsus?<br><br>Apologies in advance if I am butchering your line of thought.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c6269775380807125578 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 9:09 AM</a><br><br>

So once we acquired the screwdriver of science, we threw away the hammer and we've swung to the other side of the pendulum.

This is the same problem that eminent scientists have in explaining things to a mass audience. In the realm of the educated, a "theory" is a framework for explaining things, which really needs no proof, and a "hypothesis" is an unproven guess. The problem is that in the vernacular (spoken by 99%+ of the population) the word theory literally means an "unproven guess." This causes all sorts of trouble!!! It's already hard enough to explain scientific concepts to the masses but this just creates another battle that scientists have to fight (and it's an uphill one). They could eliminate so much trouble by merely inventing a new word entirely. <br><br>As others have pointed out, you have the exact same problem. Why fight a battle that doesn't need to be fought? Don't waste your energy trying to fight years of accepted usage and the full force of the Harry Potter franchise. You have more important things to do with your time. You might as well try to tell us that from now on you're going to call a table a chair, even while the rest of us go on calling a table a table. <br><br>Call up all the certified mages and come up with a word. You could have a contest. Make it fun. Call it "change-in-consciousness," call it "greer-ic," call it whatever you want. But as long as you insist on calling it "magic," you will be fighting two battles instead of just one.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c8125548768211705725 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 10:09 AM</a><br><br>

You could hardly have selected three better examples of cases where success or failure depends so heavily on your mental processes: awareness, insights, complex understanding, and quick decisions are what dictate outcomes! Wander absent-mindedly through the woods with a rifle and you will go hungry (or get shot by accident...). Show up at the rumble with big muscles, a big knife, and a fuzzy head and you will be the first casualty. Check your brain at the door for the poker game and you will be begging for cab fare home after having lost all your money AND the title to your car. <br><br>One of the many things that magical working accomplishes in these situations is to improve the synthesis of perception, awareness, intuition, conscious and subconscious choices and actions to help lead to the outcome you want even when you cannot initially (consciously) imagine how it could possibly be achieved... and even in hindsight as you stand there triumphant you might not really quite comprehend all that happened on the way there.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c5468540324506066965 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 10:13 AM</a><br><br>

As a scientist (PhD in physical chemistry), Zen practitioner, person who has trusted her intuition since she was a very young child, and practitioner of green wizardry (under the name of voluntary simplicity) for well over a decade, I appreciate your work. <br><br>I could write a lot more but will confine myself to two questions at this time. It has to do with the ethics of magical practice. You’ve already owned up to your magical practice as being at work in your blog. I know I’m here because the quality of your writing and the importance of your ideas draws me to it and then encourages me to go beyond where I already am in my green wizardry practice. In that sense you’ve changed my consciousness, and in a way that is in harmony with Gaia, the living system in which we are all embedded. You’ve also alluded to advertising as a magical practice, certainly a very effective one, that has power to change our consciousness in ways not in harmony with Gaia. Presumably our own practice of green wizardry, and for those of us who choose, the magic you write about in your Druid books, can also have effects on changing the consciousness of others. How can we be sure that we are using our green wizardry / magic in ways that help ease the predicament we are in rather than exacerbate it as advertisers do? (I can think of one: practice what we preach.) And in a broader way, how can we use the sort of magic you discuss in skillful ways to counteract the advertising magic more broadly, to ease the predicaments of more people than we might be able to reach on our own? Perhaps you will be addressing these questions in future columns. If so, I wil be happy to await your response.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c382578524465578663 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 10:19 AM</a><br><br>

But once you are able to affect the non-physical human, you can then begin to affect everything else, physical and non-physical, human and non-human, through the admittedly limited non-physical human portal, and using some "unique" tools.<br><br>At least this is my "diving board" into the realm of magic.

When I challenged the use of the word "efficiency" in that earlier post, I was pointing out that there are several definitions of efficiency and the one that was being used by economists wasn't helpful in terms of the issues we as a society have to face. In this post, I'm pointing out that there are several definitions of magic, and the one that's being used by popular media isn't helpful in terms of the issues we as a society have to face. I have a hard time seeing any contradiction there. <br><br>Robo, good. We'll be discussing that in a bit. <br><br>tOm, magic doesn't equal patterns of thinking, and magic and religion aren't the same thing. (I've noticed that the only people who confuse those latter don't practice either one.) You might also try reading my post, rather than simply trotting out the irritated look and the canned polemic -- the business about how science supposedly moves toward consensus while magic and religion don't is one of those straw men from the books and websites I mentioned, for example. <br><br>Stan, that is indeed a word worth knowing. As for authors and titles, that's a challenge -- it's been a very long time since I've kept up with what's in print that's suited to beginners, and the stuff I originally studied is written in a jargon that a lot of people these days find off-putting. I'll have to revisit that. My <a href="http://redwheelweiser.com/detail.html?id=9781578633975" rel=nofollow>The Druid Magic Handbook</a> might be worth a look, and for those who aren't uncomfortable with Judeo-Christian symbolism, <a href="http://redwheelweiser.com/detail.html?id=9781578633180" rel=nofollow>Learning Ritual Magic</a>, which I wrote with two other operative mages, is a good practical handbook. <br><br>Jose, you don't have to read everything in the three Paths to start -- quite the contrary. The point is to spend the initiatory year reading, reflecting on, and practicing the stuff in the book. As for the Earth Path, here's a small challenge: find three little things, not huge life-changing ones, that will cut your impact on the biosphere, but that you've never thought of before, and do those for your Earth Path work. <br><br>Lance, collective action is always tricky in magic. You're quite correct that there's some seriously slimy magic being worked by way of marketing and advertising, and we'll be talking about that down the road a bit, but I've generally found it more useful to teach people to work the counterspell for themselves, one at a time, so the other side doesn't notice that they're losing their grip. <br><br>William, thank you!<br><br>Tom, I don't have a great deal of familiarity with Buddhism, as it never really appealed to me -- no criticism expressed or implied, it's simply not my style. Thus I don't know how much useful I can say about that. <br><br>Girl, I'm not familiar with the book, but if it works for you, by all means.

If it works with the nonrational parts of consciousness, yes. <br><br>Mage, good. I'd equate anima with consciousness, and spiritus -- well, there we start getting into the role of the old vitalistic philosophies in magical theory, which is a can of worms I don't propose to open yet, but if you equate spiritus with prana, ch'i, etc. I suspect you're on the right track. I agree about the dangers of reductionism; they have to be balanced against the equal dangers of reification. More on this later. <br><br>Hadashi, Wiccans like to talk about coming out of the broom closet, but I don't know of a comparable bit of slang for operative mages! I'll look forward to your story; a bit of philately will be a pleasant change. <br><br>Cherokee, you're quite right; our whole civilization stinks of it. I'll be offering a useful label for that in a later post. <br><br>Jason, got it -- you're in the contest. <br><br>Zach, oh, granted, the current set of popular misunderstandings of magic have taken on a life of their own, not least because they've become an inkblot onto which a lot of people project their dreams of a less dreary world than the one progress, so called, has given us. As for computers, though, every single kid I knew in high school who went on to join the first generation of computer geeks was up to his eyeballs in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, so my money's on that explanation!<br><br>ChemEng, I wasn't a great fan of the books, but that's a matter of personal taste, of course -- if you enjoyed them, great. It just got very irritating to have most of a generation of would-be students show up with their brains full of Harry Potter cliches, all of which had to be gently removed in the course of training -- though it wasn't half so bad as the kids who watched <i>Charmed</i>, or some such TV program, and wanted to know how to use magic to make their hair turn blonde. <br><br>Texas, very good! Science is precisely like classical logic -- an incredibly effective tool within its limits, mostly useless outside them. It took quite a while after the formulation of logic for people to really get the fact that logic isn't an answer to every question, and we're still fumbling toward that same point with the scientific method. We'll get there -- well, as a species; my guess is that it'll be a while yet. <br><br>Ando, thank you. <br><br>Raven, got 'em. <br><br>Bill, no argument there. Once scientists stop making predictions that can be falsified by experiment, they've stopped practicing science.

Magic is one very traditional way to help make sure your nervous system is working with you rather than against you, so you react the right way rather than the wrong one. <br><br>Teeming, it's an interesting detail of history that magic in the post-Renaissance West has much more often than not been the tool of choice of the poor, the ethnically or socially discriminated against, and so on; it's an option that comes quickly to hand when you don't have access to the levers of power and wealth. As industrial civilization comes apart and those levers of power and wealth snap off in people's hands, one live option is turning to magic instead. It'll be interesting to watch that unfold. <br><br>Tony, it varies. Most societies in the past tended to use magic for purposes that it can actually do something about -- I suspect that's because, if a mage routinely promised to do things but couldn't follow through on them, his chances of having his head stuck on a pike went steeply upwards. Still, there have been exceptions now and then; the results have not been good, and in fact I'll be discussing this in a future post. <br><br>Grrl, I'd rather just reference an agricultural implement by its appropriate cognomen!<br><br>South Florida, it's not necessary to be convinced of the objective reality of magical phenomena to know that they can be dangerous. The hallucinatory voices that drive some psychotics to suicide or murder are purely mental phenomena, after all. As I mentioned in my post, the traditional lore of magic includes quite a bit of material about managing these experiences without going off the deep end; most of what students learn first, in any reputable system of magic, is the equivalent of sterile procedure -- how not to be affected by the odd experiences that follow on systematic magical practice. <br><br>As for the economists, quite the contrary -- they need to be much more concerned about such issues than they are. The hallucinations of a mage, if that's what they are, rarely affect anyone besides himself or herself; the hallucinations of economists are dragging the entire industrial world toward ruin. <br><br>Evan, everyone practices magic, all the time, whether they want to do so or not. The mage does it consciously and with intent; that's the difference. Yes, technologists and economists are practicing magic, but very few of them realize that that's what they're doing, and the results are much like those in the old story of the Sorcerer's Apprentice. As for Tainter's account, he's quite right, but there's an important magical law that applies to such cases: magic is not going to save you from the consequences of continually making the wrong decision. We'll touch on the reason why in next week's post. <br><br>Sekenre, oh, I'm sure I've chased off some readers. I do that fairly often!<br><br>Ahimsa, thank you. <br><br>Mr. R, true enough. One of the standard (and very necessary) rules in magical training is that magic is not an escape from your emotional problems, and if your emotional problems are such as to interfere with your ability to lead an ordinarily functional life, you need to deal with them first, before getting involved in magic. <br><br>Maria, thank you!<br><br>Robert, I've forwarded this to the moderation team -- hopefully things will get straightened out shortly.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c1631672166532348847 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 12:58 PM</a><br><br>

Randomly choosing from a few good hunting grounds, for example, prevents your prey from consistently avoiding you. Neal Stephenson came up a while back; Cryptonomicon explores, among other topics, the value of truly random numbers in war.<br><br>Counter-intuitively, the best quality of information for such purposes is the sort that has the least connection to the topic at hand. Our nervous system is laughably bad at generating random numbers, so it would make sense to use some sort of cognitive prosthetic for that purpose. I suspect the technology most responsible for our species' ability to hunt so many others to extinction had nothing to do with the physical chore of ending life once prey has been found, but some kind of sortilege, like throwing knucklebones to determine who led the hunt. <br><br>I've never encountered a book on poker that recommends memorizing lists of random numbers or using a digital watch or bank password fob to make decisions pseudo-randomly, but I think that sort of method could be really valuable.<br><br>Sortilege counts as magic, from what I've read, but would you still call it that if it were used within the framework of game theory?<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c8103093030656159743 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 1:06 PM</a><br><br>

There were probably systems of psychedelic drug work in ancient Europe, but it's an oddly fragile method of doing things, and the ways we do things nowadays are a good deal less vulnerable to changes in set and setting. <br><br>Yupped, thank you!<br><br>GHung, I saw that -- thank you for speaking up. Still, it was highly amusing to watch people working themselves up into a lather about what their canned polemic insisted I had to be about to say. As for TV -- bingo. There's a reason I won't have one in my house. <br><br>David, you've just brought up one of the test cases that shows the limits of the magical maxim I mentioned, "the planes are discrete and not continuous." In certain places -- the one that matters most to each of us is the human nervous system -- the planes of mind and matter come into contact, and it's possible for each plane to influence the other. What your father is doing is right on the border, where material technology (the biofeedback device) interfaces with magical practice (changes in consciousness). If the scientific community wasn't generally so pigheaded about magic, there could be a lot more work of this sort done. <br><br>Susan, most people on Earth have a much less garbled idea of magic. Magical practice is very common and relatively accepted in many Third World societies, and even in some relatively industrialized ones. It's primarily the nations of the industrial West that have the really distorted idea, and that's a product of three and a half centuries of religious and scientific propaganda following on the reality wars of the late Renaissance, when mainstream Christianity and materialist science allied with one another to squeeze out the alternatives -- and then just kept on squeezing. (Yes, they ended up fighting over the spoils eventually, but that's hardly the first time.) <br><br>Hal, excellent. Yes, that's also what's going on in magic; since I practice t'ai chi as well, I think I can say that with some confidence! The direction of ch'i though the body is very closely akin to some of the things done in magical workings, in fact. <br><br>Nox, from the standpoint of the One, all things are one. This does not make it safe to mistake a grizzly bear for a pet gerbil. As I commented to David a bit higher up the queue, the human nervous system is one of the places where influences can spill across from one plane to another. That doesn't make them one and the same, any more than your mouth is the same as your anus just because they're connected!<br><br>Z, good heavens. I didn't know that. <br><br>Petro, that's a great story. Thank you!<br><br>Ghung, have you ever read Morton Smith's interesting book <i>Jesus the Magician</i>? For that matter, Christian magic has a long and honorable history, though it's been discountenanced by most of the established churches. I know some very capable Christian mages, who do all their workings in Jesus' name and apply Christian ethics to their actions; it seems to work well for them. <br><br>Flagg, no, materialism isn't an effective way of doing most of the things that magic does well. It's a very effective way of doing other things -- among them, building weapons and transport systems that will allow you to conquer the world, which is what materialist technology did for Europe in the centuries from 1500 to 1900. The Europeans took their ideologies with them -- first Christianity, then scientific materialism -- and imposed these wherever they went. <br><br>As for the difference between magic and Napoleon Hill, though, we'll be getting into that in a big way in an upcoming post. The short version is that New Thought and other self-improvement systems approach the subject matter of magic with a very different set of attitudes and expectations, and fixate -- as of course Hill's book did -- on the most crassly material end of things. Magic goes much deeper and, in its most developed forms, has far higher objectives.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c593470177143077933 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 1:46 PM</a><br><br>

Base on an earlier post of yours, I wrote a sermon on the “Need for Magic in the Age of Depletion.” After all, just because I know nothing about a topic doesn’t mean can’t I talk about at length – after all doing so is a national sport.<br><br>I’m happy to say that what I wrote appears very consistent with what you are writing here. The sermon even starts off “Drill baby, drill. A magical incantation if I ever heard one.” I’ve given the sermon twice, at two different churches. The second time was earlier this year, which was ironically the opening weekend of the final film in a very popular fantasy series adapted from a best-selling series of books.<br><br>As my comments in the past have shown, I was extremely aware that our current difficulties have little to do with technology per se, and much to do with our worldview, our myths. As you may recall, I am in the Transition movement. It too very much deals with magic; although most, at least on this side of the pond, wouldn’t recognize that fact. I am eager to see what else you have to say on this subject.<br><br>Lastly, this is for your stupid trivia that I wish I didn’t know file. I’m afraid that your comment that “If Harry Potter does it, it isn’t magic.” is not one hundred percent correct, only 99.999%. In one passage Harry does practice actual magic. He makes his best friend think that Harry has doped his breakfast drink with a Luck potion. His best friend, thinking that he has been given the potion, goes on to lead their team to victory in that weird intramural sport they play on broom sticks. It could be debated whether the Luck potion could be actual magic or not. It was the perceived use that I think should be counted – and I’m sure Harry wouldn’t have done it if he had known he was practicing real magic.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c4268817045713032131 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 4:50 PM</a><br><br>

I did not expect this positive a response to a discussion of magic, that's for sure. <br><br>Justin, thank you. <br><br>Blue Sun, very good! That's quite correct; magic is a tool, science is a tool, classical logic is a tool, mathematics is a set of tools -- and no one tool is really a substitute for any other. Magic, though, isn't specifically from Pagan traditions; as I mentioned a bit earlier, there's a long and honorable traditions of Christian magic, and in fact just about every religion I've ever heard of has at least one magical tradition closely associated with it. I suppose you could say that magic is to religion what medicine is to biology.<br><br>As for the vocabulary thing, you could as well say that I shouldn't have titled this blog "The Archdruid Report," since a lot of people have mistaken ideas about Druidry. Euphemisms are very rarely a good idea; the word "magic" may be misunderstood in some cases but the shock value has benefits of its own, and -- as the response to this post shows -- people are starting to be willing to learn. <br><br>SLClaire, I will indeed be discussing the ethics and practical applications of magic in upcoming posts, but one of the core concepts is easy enough to grasp: you must always start by changing your own consciousness. It's the refusal to do that that produces advertising and kindred forms of black magic. <br><br>Artinnature, that's certainly one way to approach it. I like to speak of consciousness, because after a while people start to notice that everything they experience in the cosmos around them is experienced through the structures of their own consciousness, and then -- sometimes -- they begin to get a glimpse of just how much of what they think of as "out there" is actually "in here." That's when the doors start to open. <br><br>Matt, I don't think I knew that you were a Greener! I went to Fairhaven up in Bellingham -- not too different in some ways, at least back in 1980-83.

Of course there's a sense in which it's deliberately provocative; I'm well awaare of how much of my work involves flicking people on the raw, in the hope that it'll direct their attention to a sore they hadn't noticed. Still, a good psychotherapist is second cousin to a mage; they don't use our tools (unless they're Jungians, in which case they use a few), but they deal with some of the same territory. <br><br>JC, thank you. <br><br>Ceworthe, yes, I've watched the use of coercive consensus methods more than once.

There is a book by Ioan P. Couliano called "Eros and Magic in the Renaissance" that is very relevant to your essay. From the introduction of the book: "The magic that concerns us here is theoretically a science of the imaginary, which it explores through its own methods and seeks to manipulate at will. At its greatest degree of development, reached in the work of Giordano Bruno, magic is a means of control over the individual and the masses based on deep knowledge of personal and collective erotic impulses. We can observe in it not only the distant ancestor of psychoanalysis, but also, first and foremost, that of applied psychosociology and mass psychology." For those with a conspiracy inclination, Ioan Couliano was murdered in the bathroom of the Divinity School of the University of Chicago, motive and killer unknown.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c1534873158244185788 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 5:28 PM</a><br><br>

Of course sortilege remains magical when its game-theory dimension is kept in mind; the deliberate cultivation of useful bits of randomness is a common tactic in magic. <br><br>Tyler, an applied psychology and, if I may coin a word, noumenology -- the study of the objects of mental experience -- some thousands of years richer than the one that's taught in universities these days. As for Persinger, yes, I read up on him while researching my book on <a href="http://www.llewellyn.com/product.php?ean=9780738713199" rel=nofollow>the UFO phenomenon</a> -- I didn't know that Dawkins was blind to that class of human experience, but I suppose it should come as no surprise. <br><br>Whiffle, it's been a very long time since I've read Feyerabend. I don't mean to impose any kind of strict definition on scientific method -- there's rather a Wittgensteinian family resemblance among the different methods used in scientific research, at most -- but the basic concept that a hypothesis must be capable of disproof is essential to any form of science I can imagine; that's all I mean by it. <br><br>WwoofBum, the cost of extracting a barrel of oil is basically the cost of running a pump. It's the cost of finding a barrel of oil to replace the one you just extracted, so you can keep on extracting oil indefinitely, that you need to look up. That's what determines whether we can keep on using oil into the indefinite future or not. <br><br>Sofistek, and all I'm saying is that all words have a variety of meanings, and it's always fair game in reasoning with others to challenge a popular definition in favor of another that makes more sense. Socrates used to do that all the time, as you may recall. <br><br>Thijs, good. Of course magical training isn't for everyone, any more than everybody ought to go learn a martial art or play a musical instrument -- two pursuits that take a comparable amount of time and effort to master. <br><br>Doctor W., one of my concerns about the Transition movement on this side of the pond is the extent to which some of its main public proponents seem to be practicing the black magic of marketing and advertising; I'm sure you'll recall my comments about a certain video back in late 2008. That way lies some very unwelcome possibilities. I hope that enough people catch on to more constructive forms of magic, and move the movement in that direction instead. <br><br>Siddrudge, well put. We'll be talking about that very point quite soon. In the meantime, I'll look forward to your story!<br><br>Craig, I'm quite familiar with Couliano's work -- as a student of Giordano Bruno and a practitioner of geomancy and the art of memory, I share three of his main interests. The book of his you've mentioned will be discussed in some detail in an upcoming post, though I have some criticisms of his take on magic that'll come out at that point. <br><br>Richard, good. The difference between magic and miracle is worth keeping in mind; I don't propose to court an argument over whether or not miracles of the loaves-and-fishes variety actually happen, but it's fair to say that magic does not achieve such things.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c5169279488811811598 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 6:26 PM</a><br><br>

I even saw a figure or two from that paper during the talk. That paper is from 2008, there is more recent work they've done (some still unpublished) in which they teased out much more of the actual mechanism of control of the immune cells by the nerve (like most evolved systems, it's more complicated than you'd expect and yet strangely elegant), and ongoing work in human patients and a mouse study confirming the link between this system not quite working right and inflammatory disease.<br><br>@ Tyler August – Hah!

They have some of the most interesting writing I've ever found on cognitive science and decision theory and statistics and epistemology, some of which I've actually put to good use. But then I just sit back and chuckle as I watch them spin off into messianic superiority complexes, transhumanist/singulatarian fantasy (with a hefty dose of combined progresso-apocalyptic mythology), and the general idea that they can think their way out of having ape brains.

Once you clarify your definitions – something that always seems to get in the way of useful discussion of almost anything – the main points of contention are really only likely to be the ontological status of experiences involved, the usefulness of the practice/its effects on and requirements from thought patterns, and your interpretation of the history of such practices and the history of their efficacy. <br><br>I do not pretend to have studied the last historical/sociological question enough to make a case either way, and the word-definition quibble has played out. As for the usefulness and ontological status – even though we reductionists would tell you that a human mind is easily capable of creating experiences out of whole cloth based entirely on internal states, that does not necessarily make such completely internal experiences unimportant. That internal state got that way somehow, is vast and complicated, and it's <i>your</i> internal state.<br><br>When I was a Christian I felt that I had multiple encounters with a being that I now regard as entirely mythical which certainly affected my behavior and state of mind at the time, and since then I have had dreams involving what can be called Jungian archetypes which colored my emotions for weeks, rather negatively. I can easily imagine affecting this sort of thing in ways that work for you rather than against - or where you try VERY carefully to extract the influences that caused them. The more mild and much more common case of intentionally changing the way one parses their reality to reframe things, or coming to realize how much of what one sees as reality is actually internal seems even more possible and useful. Just how much of what we think about the external world is driven by how we parse it has been driven home to me rather strongly lately.<br><br>This being said, I am not yet sold on the end-usefulness of magical methods with more layers than somewhat simple applied psychology (like you have been practicing on us, hah). This is mostly due to the fact that I have relatively low confidence in the human ability to not latch onto false beliefs about the external world (human or simple physical) and how to live in it based on internal states that don't always have to directly correspond to external things. I'm also generally wary whenever <i>anyone</i> begins explaining how useful their Favorite Thing is. But I easily see the importance of beliefs having to do with internal states of myself and others, and you have already spoken of the use of ideas/personifications/etc as focuses for emotion and reflection by the irrational mind rather than rational 'belief'. This makes sense, and I've even recently resurrected parts of my old nightly prayer ritual, even though I now just talk to myself, because I find it is a good way to reflect on my life and goals and to help convince myself to be the sort of person I want to be. I look forward to more of your thoughts and perspectives, and you could definitely yet convince me of something (or fix errors I undoubtedly have in my conception of your methods).<br><br>I also look forward to any further explanation of the idea that “we know more than we realize and affect more than we realize” - a concept you very eloquently expressed via the Halka in <i>Shalsha</i>. I've never been the best at reading social cues, but I am amazed at the skills of some of my friends and family at reading the tiniest of subtle hints, figuring out complicated relations between people from such little observation. I've also found that I can often predict my own decisions with high accuracy long before I formally make them, and am not sure if this indicates bias towards snap uninformed decisions or might involve unconsciously knowing things that I later dredge up into consciousness.<br><br>You've gotten my attention...<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c1741315934402073458 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 8:40 PM</a><br><br>

When you described the chart as one of the cost of extracting oil, I took you at your word without going to the chart; the cost of extraction has, in fact, remained pretty flat for decades. The chart you actually referenced, as it turns out, was a rather inaccurate chart of oil prices -- <i>not</i> the cost of extraction. Did you notice that it shaved nearly $50 a barrel off the 2008 peak, for example? <br><br>That said, now that we've got the misunderstandings out of the way, the answer to your question is quite simple. The price of oil was relatively low, and relatively stable, during the period when US oil production was still increasing; whenever the price started to rise, new fields could be brought on line to bring it back down. After 1970, when US oil production started to decline, that was no longer the case, and from then on prices were low only for a relatively brief period in the late 1980s and 1990s, when the market was being flooded with cheap crude for political reasons. Now that the world has passed peak production, the higher prices are here to stay, because new production being brought on line is no longer keeping up with old fields running dry. <br><br>Tony, I'd say first of all that magic is certainly not for everyone. It's been central to my life since my teen years, but here again it's rather like being a serious musician, say, or a martial artist -- if that's what calls you, that's one thing, but most people are better off with a less strenuous life, or at least one focused in other directions! There are a range of relatively simple practices anybody can use, and some useful perspectives that can be of help to most people, but the deep reaches of magic, no. <br><br>One of the simple practices you might consider adding to your evening nonprayers is the old custom of recollection: remember the day, in as much detail as seems relevant, in reverse -- as though watching a movie backwards, starting with the moment you begin the recollection and ending with waking up in the morning. It's a good way to slip past the usual memory filters. As you recall the day, of course, it's good to assess your choices and actions and make notes for improvement where that seems useful. <br><br>Glenn, bingo. A culture of entitlement will never be a culture of mages. It's a running joke for me that when somebody says "that worked like magic," I think, "Okay, it involved years of training, intensive preparations, and a tautly focused ritual performance that left sweat running down every limb. Got it."<br><br>Candace, fair enough! I'll be talking about some of those as we proceed. One basic step, though, is to deny access -- this is one of the reasons I encourage people to throw away their televisions, for example. If you deny the black magicians easy access to your brain, you've taken a major step in the right direction; of course you need to fill the empty space with something better, as I discussed in <a href=../../2011/08/twilight-of-meaning.html rel=nofollow>a post a few weeks back</a>.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c5070611480229982969 title="comment permalink">9/22/11, 9:21 PM</a><br><br>

In your response to me you said that you were challenging "a popular definition in favor of another that makes more sense". Actually, Clarke's third law makes more sense when the first definition of magic (as found in Chambers) is used. That his "misunderstanding" is almost universal is probably because the common definition of the word "magic" is not the definition that you like to use. The "magical thinking" you referred to also makes more sense with the first definition.<br><br>Yes, you're right that many words have multiple meanings but that's not all you were saying, as you claimed in your response to me, otherwise you'd simply link to your previous post on the subject and leave it at that.

I've been talking in front of juries in the courtrooms of Alabama for about 25 years. In that time, I've regularly glimpsed snatches of that made evident. As they say, when you are good, it always looks easy, but it is nothing of the kind. I've had the privilege of watching and learning from some of the best civil trial lawyers alive, on both the plaintiffs' and defendants' side. What happens when the collective focus of that many people comes to bear on a single set of facts is pure-d alchemy.

When, however, the discipline is a reprehended one (as is the study of magic), then most dictionaries ignore its technical terminology altogether. <br><br>Technical terms are needed because common, everyday language is a wretched and woefully inadequate instrument for any sort of precise, technical, impersonal thinking. Human speech did not evolve to do that kind of thinking. Rather, it evolved to serve other purposes, for example, to create social cohesion, or to persuade others to some common course of action, or to play all the varied "games" of power-over that our species enjoys so much. <br><br>This is why those of us who are magicians by virtue of our long study and practice -- magicians by profession, if you will -- must insist on the necessity of using the technical terms of our discipline without any concession to common speech, much less to any generalist dictionary. <br><br>Of course, we can explain this terminology when others find it unclear, at least to the limited extent that it can be explained in common speech. But requiring us to adapt our technical terminology to common usage makes no more sense than requiring a carnivorous animal to stop eating meat and subsist on vegetables alone.

His doctoral dissertation was on the phenomena of spirit mediumship, taking a cousin of his as the subject and reporting the results of seances with her as the medium. In my book, Jung counts as a well-read occultist throughout his adult life, but an occultist who pragmatically made himself "pass" as a scientist according to the standards of his age, and who managed to build a respected career on the basis of his interests. The similarities between his technique of Active Imagination and some aspects of magical practice are not an accident.<br><br><br>As for the ontological status of the entities encountered in such practices, it may be useful to begin with a distinction between "imaginary" and "imaginal," both of which are different from "physical" or "real" (as materialists use the last terms). <br><br>Loosely, what is "physical" exists in the material realm, and it can produce effects in that realm; what is "imaginary" is not, and cannot. <br><br>Between them lies the imaginal realm. It is like the imaginary realm in that does not exist in the material world, but it is like the physical realm in that it can produce effects in the material world.<br><br>The clearest example of something imaginal, for most of us, is being-in-love. Being in love has its physiological components in the material world of the body, but it is more than *just* the sum of those components. Among other salient points, being in love has a structure and an aim. The material world knows no teleology, and has no aims, but by its nature love is teleological, that is, it has aims and desires). <br><br>One might say, "Yes, but being in love is a useful and socially valuable fancy, nothing more." We do have fancies of that sort, but usually they are hard for another to detect at a glance. When, however, one is in love, even if one has not yet admitted it to oneself, any friend can instantly see that something important has changed: one's behavior, one's body language, one's whole external presentation to the world, alters in distinctive and recognizable ways. This is the realm of the imaginal, and it contrasts sharply to the passing fancies with somewhat similar content that arise, say, as one sits down and samples the books in the romance or the fantasy sections of a bookstore. What these books yield belongs to the imaginary realm, not the imaginal one. <br><br>Likewise, deciding to make a fist belongs to the imaginal realm if one's own hand then clenches. Also, using words or gestures that inspire others to clench their fists and brandish them is also an example of work in the imaginal realm that has effects in the physical realm. Among other things, magic is a means of working effectively in the imaginal realm.<br><br>So the entities encountered in magical practice of Jung's Active Imagination, whatever else they may or may not be, also have their being in the imaginal realm for the practitioner (rather than the imaginary or the physical one). As such, they can impact the physical, material world in a mediated fashion at the very least.<br><br>There is much more to magic, or to Active Imagination, than can be accounted for by distinguishing "imaginal" from "imaginary," but at least it gives one a useful starting point.<br><br>(Footnote: It was Henry Corbin who introduced the distinction between the "imaginal" world and the "imaginary" worlds into these discussions, on the basis of a similar distinction in Islamic (Shiite) philosophy.

Is there training or learning for this, I'd appreciate some advice?"<br><br><br>Here is some of that advice:<br><br>T. S. Eliot ("Burnt Norton") sets the scene for a walk in a garden full of unheard music, with unseen creatures behind the dead leaves of autumn, and other worlds hidden from us in other ways. A bird -- a thrush -- calls out to the spooked walkers:<br><br>"Go! go! go! said the bird: human kind / Cannot bear very much reality."<br><br>The thrush has said it rightly: too much reality is more than we humans can naturally bear, and when a body has too great a burden to bear, it experiences pain, both experiential and social. <br><br>The pain will always be there, if one pays attention to oneself and the world in which one lives. <br><br>But one can also learn *by hard, stubborn practice* to do one's work in the world despite the pain, so long as it is not too intense. For me, concentration on work can also alleviate pain, and the harder the work, the greater the relief. <br><br>And if the pain gets too intense, well, often -- not always! -- one can reduce it to bearable levels by implementing the placebo effect on oneself. I have found it to be just as strong if you know you're using a placebo, as if you don't know. And it doesn't need to be administered or prescribed by an authority figure to work strongly, either. (Placebo effects work in and through the imaginal world, as do nocebo effects, so we are moving into the territory of magic here.)<br><br>I have always felt the experiential and social pain that you mention, from my earliest childhood up to now. Very early on I found -- by chance! -- that concentrating on work eased the pain, and so I became a scholar (and eventually a professor) in fields that did not come easily to me, but took me very hard work and deep concentration to master. Because that hard work and intense concentration eased the pain, the work and concentration themselves became, and remain, a source of abundant joy for me. (When pain finally goes away, there is always an upwelling of joy.) <br><br>And then, for the last quarter of a century, I have also had to live with the sort of full-body pain that is sometimes diagnosed as fibromyalgia. Chemical painkillers of any sort have never worked very well for me, and the stronger ones badly impair my concentration and ability to work. So I have begun to learn how to make he placebo effect work for myself to ease pain, and I have had some success with it so far. (Basically, I am experimenting on myself, on my own.)<br><br>Part of the secret here is not to fear pain all that much. It is, by now, an old and familiar companion of mine -- not a friend, precisely, though it has taught me much, even also some things about magic. For me, a human life, fully lived,will bring pain, then death, and finally even the total erasure of one's very self and memory. Who am I to fear such things? I hardly matter that much, except to my own ego? As for the ego, who now knows the names of the men who built Göbekli Tepe, or the litter-box attendants for the sacred cats in a temple of Bastet? YMMV, of course.<br><br>I don't know whether any of this may help a little, but I hope it might.

He considers himself an accomplished theologian which n practice means he knows multiple interpretations of scripture and thus is unassailable when it comes to all things spiritual and religious. He brushes off the claim that an individual can “be spiritual without being religious” which means you cannot have a spiritual experience without attending trappings of religious practices; this in clear contravention of the very scripture upon which he bases his notions and many of the hymns sung during religious services. Unfortunately I do not agree as through my now long life I have had spiritual experiences far more often when in nature than within a spiritual artifice such as a church.<br><br>Such attitudes seem be common among nearly all lines of discipline whether it be political, economic, scientific, social or religious.

This practice also seems to be an attempt to provide individual or group discipline by discouraging disparate beliefs and in the process make the so-called expert indispensible.

It's a very good and careful piece of scholarship, so it can be tough going even though it's written for a popular audience rather than a technical scholarly one. In general, Smith was an absolutely first-rate scholar with an impressively broad reach.<br><br>To be sure, the available evidence doesn't reach far enough to settle all the open questions with which Smith deals, but by and large I found his arguments and readings of that evidence to be convincing. <br><br>What Smith does argue, I think, is not precisely that Jesus was a magician, but rather that he was not a mere rabbi or exorcist, or even *primarily* an ethical teacher, but either (1) a magician or (2) an actual incarnate god . . . but Smith himself takes an atheist position in the book (and in his own life), and does not admit the existence of any gods, which leaves only the first of these two options for him.<br><br>Other, less skilled and less scholarly authors have followed up Smith's work in recent years. See Robert Conner's _Jesus the Sorcerer_ and _Magic in the New Testament_, and Pieter F. Craffert's _The Life of a alilean Shaman: Jesus of Nazerteth in Anthropological Historical Peerspective_. All three of these books have lots of interesting details and tidbits for someone who has already mastered Smith's book, but they are really not helpful for a reader coming fresh to the problem.<br><br>More valuable than Conner and Craffert's books are Margaret Barker's later works, especially _The Great High Priest_ and her subsequent books on what she calls "temple theology." Barker is the real scholarly deal, an accomplished academic in the field of Biblical studies and a past president of one of the professional societies in that field. And she is a good writer. <br><br>Although Barker greatly downplays the fact, she has also read and profited from high-level works on the practice of magic, e.g., the first edition of William Bloom's _The Sacred Magician_, which is a thoughtful account of Bloom's successful completion of the Abramelin work and the considerable effects it had on his life afterwards. (The first edition includes valuable preface by Peter Sommer, which she also cites.)<br><br>So there's lots to read now on the subject of Jesus's own magical practices.

Changes in the content of consciousness are not equivalent to changes in consciousness. <br><br>Ploughboy, that's fascinating; I can well imagine the law courts as a focus for magic. <br><br>Spartiate, thank you. Unfortunately such a book would be very short, and not very effective. No known explosive is powerful enough to blast open a thoroughly closed mind. <br><br>Mirror, fascinating!<br><br>Wwoofbum, that's why you want to show that chart along with a chart showing the rate at which production has been outstripping new discovery. That's the one that tends to catch the attention of those people who are willing to think about the subject at all. <br><br>Jan, there's a very simple and solidly proven alternative, which is relatively egalitarian and tends to keep the baboonery from overwhelming the process. It's to have an explicit system, such as a constitution and bylaws, and some sort of basic rules of order to govern meetings. You might want to research, for example, how highly egalitarian organizations such as the Grange, say, or the old-line unions, used to manage their meetings and decisionmaking processes.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c3347053016248610976 title="comment permalink">9/23/11, 2:23 PM</a><br><br>

For if these spiritual entities are real apart from the mind, then one is putting him- or herself in their hands, it seems to me, in a manner that makes one profoundly vulnerable to being harmed by them. The potential harm they might cause, moreover, may happen in ways of which one very well may not even be aware. <br><br>One is furthermore placing his or her trust in their basic benevolence, if they happen to be real.

There is no event that you can imagine (or even that you cannot) that completely violates the known, empirically tested, proven laws of nature. So you suddenly found yourself transported to a new place and time without having expended any energy getting there? Extremely unlikely. But not impossible, and not a violation of the laws of physics. The claims of "supernatural" magic I have seen have generally been far smaller than this, of course. You received information from a remote location through an unknown mechanism? Nothing wrong with that so long as the information did not travel faster than light. Even if the info did come superluminally, this is still not impossible, just very very unlikely. The fact that you do not know how the information came to you is certainly not supernatural, just ignorant. <br><br>JMG etc. about consciousness... As JMG pointed out, we are not talking about changing your ideas, beliefs, or knowledge. Magic involves changing STATES of consciousness. Images, words, ideas, can help foster this state change. but they do not per se comprise it. Awake versus dreaming is a consciousness state change. Attentive versus daydreaming is another. The magician learns a whole multivariate spectrum of conscious states and how to shift among them at will. In each state, the processes of the mind are tuned differently, using the same inputs and knowledge in different ways. Stare at this screen and read some of the words. Now stare out the window and gaze at a leaf. That is a change in state of consciousness. You will not spot the caterpillar while reading the screen, you will not be exposed to JMGs written ideas while gazing at the leaf. It all depends on what you wish to achieve.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c7209868989285197421 title="comment permalink">9/23/11, 3:29 PM</a><br><br>

I've pointed out mistakes you've made in the past and in your books but you've been very reluctant to accept those mistakes (regarding me as a troll, to begin with, and, in the end, not even acknowledging your mistake).<br><br>I note that you did accept that words have different meanings but only in a brief comment to me.

Magic does not teach that it's a good idea to presume on the benevolence of the apparent entities that are experienced as a result of magical training -- quite the contrary. As I tried to explain, among the basic elements of magical training are methods to chase off these apparent entities; that's what any capable teacher of magic teaches first. <br><br>Sofistek, I considered your opinion and disagreed with it. I still disagree with it; as I've tried to point out, the meaning of words is always contested and negotiated, and I'm making use of that property to make some of the points I feel are important to make in this discussion. Now of course you can disagree with that if you wish to, but that's not going to change my view of the subject. 'Nuf said. <br><br>Vicky, I don't think anything will make magic acceptable or respectable in modern industrial culture, and replacing the scary "m word" with a euphemism -- well, it's been tried many times, as I've pointed out more than once already, and it doesn't do any good; the biases of materialism still exclude what I'm discussing, whatever you label it. It's proven more effective to keep the name and let it serve as a protective screen -- the fact that people insist on confusing magic with bad fantasy is, among other things, a good way to evade attention. <br><br>As for societies becoming paranoid and ill-willed because of magic, well, isn't that a good description of where we are right now? Wvery society in all of human history has practiced magic.

We know more than we can say that we know". I read a review of "The Tacit Dimension" some time ago, and never quite got around to following up on it. Now, I'm wondering if Polanyi's work is relevant to the practice of magic. (Thre's a capsule review of his work at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Polanyi#Theory_of_knowledge).<br><br>Something I hope to see discussed in this "tour of magic": I've been recently mulling over the different ways that people perceive and use time and time-related concepts. For example, one can think of a hierarchy of durations of "human perceivable time", from "instantaneous" to "generations". For another, I had a dream a while back of visiting a civilization that created its "buildings" by planting and shaping trees over generations -- a new "building" would be begun with the idea that it would be completed by the "builders'" grandchildren. (Bernard Lietaer has described something like this with regard to the medieval builders, who literally built their structures to last for centuries.)<br><br>A thought on magic and science: it occurs to me that training in magic could be very useful to a scientist, particularly during revolutionary periods.<br><br>@Bill P.: re modern physics, particularly string theory: thanks! I'd suspected as much. Math can be subtly addictive, and not just for economists.<br><br>@JMG: "collective action is always tricky in magic": leave out the last two words and it's still true (e.g., the problems of consensus, or democracy for that matter). For a good case study, consider collective action by stakeholders in a commons, treated in depth in Ostrom's "Governing the Commons".<br><br>Re "baboon politics": I suspect that JMG had more in mind here than just a pejorative label. From what little I've read, baboons have a pretty complex and dynamic social life, one constantly in flux. At http://is.gd/nSXJv8, there's an interesting essay called "Redefining the Social Link, From Baboons to Humans", which contains a short history of baboon studies. (In a nice bit of irony, the essay is in a book titled "Primate Politics".)<br><br>@Cherokee: "only those that look ahead, get ahead". Reminds me of a quote from Alvin Toffler: "In a time of drastic change it is the learners who survive; the 'learned' find themselves fully equipped to live in a world that no longer exists."<br><br>@Uwe: You write "for some time now I have been looking for creative community". You might be interested in a work I started a while ago, and would like to return to, if I can find some collaborators: http://dwigki.wikispaces.com/On+Community.<br><br>Re the planes of existence: As a software engineer, this puts me in mind of some ideas I've had. The basic idea is that hardware doesn't determine what a computer can do. Rather, it provides a space of possibilities that software "lives in". In turn, basic software (operating systems, software languages, system libraries, ...) elaborates on that space, both narrowing it (by foreclosing some possibilities) and extending it (by creating new possibilities). I've thought that this might point to a useful way to understand the relationship between body and mind (animus and/or spiritus). At least, it could provide a good argument against reducing mental activity to "sequences of sets of synaptic firings" or some such.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c6685769784697274428 title="comment permalink">9/23/11, 10:17 PM</a><br><br>

The thrush indeed sounds correct in its assertion.<br><br>Physical pain has not been much of an issue for me as I learned to switch it off through a few decades of long distance running - which I no longer do. It is akin to the meditative state that you achieve through hard work. I too like nothing better than clearing my head with a bit of music and a days hard work. It rests the mind.<br><br>Years ago I fractured my fore arm when a jackhammer fell over and I stupidly reached out to stop its fall. It connected with with my arm and well, lets say I saw stars and felt a bit sweaty. Still, there was work to be done, so I kept going. A few weeks later, I thought I better go and see a doctor, who promptly sent me off to an x-ray and found the fracture had formed a callus on the bone and it was too late for anything to be done. He had a sense of humor and asked me for a DNA sample because he thought I was an alien having not come to see him earlier.<br><br>I've always thought that the pathways into the brain for pain can be unlearned as well as learned.<br><br>I'm sorry to hear about your ailments, but I reckon you are on the right track to getting by day to day with it. There is nothing like hard work to clear the mind and refresh the body.<br><br>The mental side is another thing all together for me. I have no idea what to do with the information I glean from interactions with others. I used to use the word "gaming" to describe what I see, but well, magic is as good a usage, if not better for various reasons.<br><br>The knowledge of what is going on around me is very useful, however, I have also had to deliberately limit my inputs - no free to air commercial television for example because I find it to be disturbing - particularly the marketing and PR exercises - which are so frequent as to be wrong. <br><br>My ethical base is "do no harm" and some people take this for a weakness, when I consider it a strength. It can sometimes very occasionally lead to difficult situations as some people find the limits of my boundaries. <br><br>There are a type of people that like testing other people. When they get a response, they escalate their programs to the next level. I feel sorry for them because they are on auto pilot and it is the only progam they know for interactions with others. It is these types that occasionally give me grief. Ahh, more learning.<br><br>I'm interested to see where JMG leads us in this discussion, it's sure to be some place interesting. I suspect the Green Wizards project requires more than just talk at the end of the day and I accept that outcome.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c4899335943265044047 title="comment permalink">9/24/11, 3:27 AM</a><br><br>

Both good beginners’ books for the interested. <br><br>I just wrote a <a href="http://lightningoak.wordpress.com/?p=418&amp;preview=true" rel=nofollow>blog post</a> about what that Ericksonian hypnosis approach can do in the way of change to those nonrational internal maps. It’s jolly to see people buying books on ‘hypnotic language patterns’ who wouldn’t look even once at a Book of Gramarye!<br><br>I’m also glad JMG might talk about spiritus/ch’i later on, since that’s my favourite way in to magic. Again plenty of weird science there, which people can prove to themselves any time they want, although always shading into places science can’t reach. There’s a lot known about how the brain and nervous system interact with that energy (check out <a href=http://www.issseem.org/ rel=nofollow>ISSSEEM</a> for a start). I learned from martial artists, especially the late great Glenn Morris, how to use ch’i as a gateway into the magical and mystical. Directing energy (through the body and beyond it) for certain effects was and is a big part of the <a href=http://hoshinbudo.com/ rel=nofollow><i>ryu</i>/lineage</a>, although enlightenment is the primary goal. But they are all connected.<br><br>JMG, I’m sure you’d’ve enjoyed Glenn’s company and/or a session hacking at each other with swords and magic! A very different way from Hermetics and druidry, but in magic I think dissensus is valuable too. His Ph.D was in Communication and he favoured the study of rhetoric, which has its magical elements. A propos of this post, he once wrote:<br><br><i>Spirit is not just an attitude or something invoked by a pretty cheerleader. ‘To inspire’ is not what a thrill it is to meet a personal hero. Our language is not without symbolic content. We have just elected to be familiar with the easier meanings of the words.”</i><br><br>Thanks for bringing the hard meanings back into the conversation! And for encouraging flexibility of language.<br><br>This blog is a masterclass in long-term thinking.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c1451040486116022952 title="comment permalink">9/24/11, 4:05 AM</a><br><br>

It's all around us all the time in every space controlled by man. I have worked hard to train myself not to see the advertising, not to listen to the propaganda.

So rather than trying to withstand it, one must try not to see or hear it. <br><br>I find that when I am forced into a situation where I cannot avoid it, like being stuck in a waiting room with a TV blaring, it is a lot of effort to block it out and focus on other things.

It's very easy not see things that way -- it's called 'negative hallucination'. You know, what economists do with ecological laws? :)<br><br>I've had success using a feeling I had when a kid on holiday, looking at adverts I didn't really understand and which were obviously aimed at someone other than myself. They seemed laughable -- even when young I thought, what a relief! I was floating free of it all. It was literally 'somebody else's problem'.<br><br>I retrieved that as a resource and applied it to all advertising, along with some other things. Worked very well. The usefulness of the hypnotic approach is that you just find yourself doing it, you don't have to expend any conscious effort.

Their number is also out of range from other much more precise measurements. This is a media frenzy, not a revolution in science.

Neither does anyone else since it turned out to be nothing.

The paper also deals with concepts such as "task-relevant levels of abstraction" [ needing memory]. This study seems to lend credence to the notion, "we know a great deal more than we might think". Memories appear to be more detailed if attention is paid during memory acquisition. It seems to me personally to be possible to usefully test some 'task-relevant' abstract propositions, quite fast, by asking questions of the slightly below conscious substrates of the mind, where memory might suggest "truth", falsehood" or "maybe" for any one proposition (answers "like magic"?). The implicate knowledge embodied in vast sets of examples if they are drawn from the observed world, or our own bodies, and if we have paid enough attention, must be beyond any normal 'conscious' attention? Mental 'tests' could be applied to questioning anything, from the result of a physical action (e.g. use of a tool in a practical task) to more complex cognitive tasks like 'imagining' the stresses and strains of a flying buttress when building the original Gothic Cathedals?<br>The scientific paper for anybody interested is at http://www.pnas.org/content/105/38/14325.full<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c1966850554815693796 title="comment permalink">9/24/11, 2:33 PM</a><br><br>

There will never be time for for the kind of training necessary. I will have to make due with a simpler kind of magic for a simpler man. Long ago I learned to be still, to listen to and cultivate those quieter voices within, and most of the major decisions of my life have been made not by deciding, but by trying to uncover the decisions I had already made. Somehow I have been quite aware that “we know more than we realize, and we affect more than we realize.” If nothing else I will be putting more attention and effort in those areas as best I can.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c8251052552073673010 title="comment permalink">9/24/11, 4:15 PM</a><br><br>

Dabbling in a bit of magic here and there is tolerably often a recipe for trouble; it's much better either to do it seriously or to leave it alone. As for whether advertising is or is not magic, of a particularly grubby variety, we'll be discussing that down the road a bit. <br><br>Doctor W., the original comment was <a href=../../2008/11/facing-peak-oil-in-motown.html rel=nofollow>here</a>, and a more extensive discussion of the subject is <a href=../../2008/11/premature-triumphalism.html rel=nofollow>here</a>.

You get tonight's gold star; Michael Polanyi's writings, and in particular <i>The Tacit Dimension</i>, were strongly recommended to me years ago by one of my teachers in magic, and have influenced my ideas substantially. <br><br>Joel, that's an interesting interpretation of the story. <br><br>Jason, I wish I'd had the chance to meet Glenn Morris, and for more than the obvious reasons. The extent to which magic is a deeper form of rhetoric -- to use medieval terms, a rhetoric of <i>res</i> rather than <i>verba</i> -- has been much on my mind of late, and it would have been good to discuss that with someone else who would have gotten it. <br><br>Greg, well, we'll see. Might be an anomaly, might be a measurement error. <br><br>David, well, not quite. Again, it's quite possible to learn something on a rational level -- to learn it thoroughly and completely -- and not touch on the realms of magic. Magic comes into the picture when we go beyond the content of consciousness and begin wrestling with the structure and orientation of consciousness.

If you dig deeply enough, there are old counter-cultural traditions here which have persisted from Colonial times until now, and some of them include magic. But they lie very much outside the country's dominant historical narrative, which is overshadowed by successive layers of Puritanism, Enlightenment rationalism, and secular Progressivism -- all of them hostile to the very possibility of magic.<br><br>England's dominant historical narrative is enormously older, of course.

You're quite correct that the psychological impact of the end of the age of cheap abundant energy, not to mention some of the crises that will be involved in that process, is going to be massive, and yes, magic is one of the ways to deal with it. Perhaps even more important, though, is the simple process of coming to terms with the fact that it's happening, and the shining future promised by the religion of progress not only isn't going to happen, but never was.

It goes like this, "we have (or are developing) a plan to deal with the situation / crisis or whatever". Obviously it's stated a bit better than that, but that is the gist of it.<br><br>It is a tool to buy time and stop people worrying or agitating about an issue because it is in hand. Doesn't make it go away though... When I hear this, I can be pretty certain that they have no idea or that there is a lot of dissension either way is not good.<br><br>I'm not trying to be all doom and gloom either, because even in the Great Depression here when unemployment was at 30%, you have to remember that 70% were still employed. Though they probably fiddled with the definition of unemployment to make it look better than it was.<br><br>What it actually means is that the standard of living that you are all used to is on the downward trajectory. Brace yourselves! It's not the end of the world though so don't panic.<br><br>I've always imagined that the long descent is like a downwards staircase, with each crisis represented by a drop down to the next stair. The going on the stair represents a period of stability. Sometimes the next step may be up instead of down. But overall, if you plotted a regression through it, it will be downward.<br><br>Good luck and grow some fruit trees - they take years to produce a good quantity of fruit!<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c1941930877209687331 title="comment permalink">9/25/11, 7:24 PM</a><br><br>

And it seems that I am also of the same opinion as you on this subject. <br><br>This may not be an accident, but a generational thing. <br><br>I myself never received any systematic training in magic. At first it was hints from my family. My family's view was that any child who had what it takes to do magic should be able to figure it out for himself with just hints along the way. I began to get hints from my mother (at least, the hints that I remember) when I was about eight years old. <br><br>Later, in high school, I spent many evenings talking about magic with my advanced physics teacher, Mr. Harvey. He was an occultist as well as a superb science teacher, and he soon became a trusted friend as well. But he, too, never offered anything like systematic training or a rigorous course of study in magic. (What he did offer was the rigorous study of Old Egyptian grammar.) It was just one conversation after another, wherever the mood of the evening led us. Much of the time we simply translated parts of the Old Egyptian Pyramid Texts together, and talked about what they meant. <br><br>To be sure, there are risks in magic, on occasion even great risks. My family thought that, by and large, children could manage to survive these risks by themselves, and that it was good for children to be exposed to risk, and to deal with those risks themselves. How else could children learn how to cope with the very risky business of living as an adult in the real world? <br><br>It was religion, not magic, that my family thought was much too dangerous for children. "Magic is for children, religion for grown-ups!" One shouldn't encounter the Divine too closely until one has gotten some sense of one's own abilities and power, they thought.<br><br>Many decades later, after I turned fifty, I began to teach magic to a few students of my own, who found me through my university courses on the history of magic and home-grown American magical religions. A small handful of them were gifted natural magicians, who had figured out much of it on their own years before they ever entered my university. Others had a real aptitude for magic, but had not gotten very far on their own. I soon learned that each of these students had her own set of gifts for magic, and no two of them could develop their magical skills to the fullest by the same series of steps, following the same regimen of training. I had to study each student as carefully as I have ever studied anything, and figure out what each one of them most needed from me. Each of these students was a magical autodidact. I was just there to facilitate the process, not to direct their studies. <br><br>By now I have begun to suspect that magic is not just one thing, in the sense that chemistry, or number theory, or locksmithing, is just one thing that a person can master fully. Rather, magic seems to me to be many related things, and a person who is able to master one of these things called magic is unable -- inherently unable! -- to master some of the other things called magic. YMMV, of course.<br><br>Robert Mathiesen / Mageprof<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c8571425889122965923 title="comment permalink">9/25/11, 9:06 PM</a><br><br>

Of course they do; nothing is more harmful, to my mind, than the Harry Potter notion that some people have some particular facility for practicing magic, and the rest don't. My experience has simply been that most of the people who get in trouble via the practice of magic are dabblers -- and in particular, dabblers who don't realize that they're dabblers, and think that a little lackadaisical practice here and there is enough to prepare them to tackle, say, goetic evocation without harm. As always, there's plenty of room for dissensus, but I felt it was appropriate to offer my own viewpoint and advice. <br><br>Ando, I hope you find it useful. <br><br>Doctor W., glad to hear it. <br><br>Cherokee, John Kenneth Galbraith talks about the use of incantation by political and economic leaders in 1929 in his book on the Great Crash; like the rest of that book, things have not changed at all.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c7655466420825374320 title="comment permalink">9/25/11, 9:41 PM</a><br><br>

My father tried to hypnotize me to regress me to a former lifetime. It was in the 50's during the Bridey Murphy craze. Didn't work. Although in my adult life I did do some past life regression with a therapist. And also was in a group regression with a Psychologist that was doing statistical analysis of the data. I did these things as a way of seeing what was hidden in my psyche, more like dream analysis. <br><br>Even though I had experiences that might indicate the existence of reincarnation, I abjure the concept. It now seems to me a perverse and superstitious belief system. Only an unfriendly universe would come up with this kind of torture. <br><br>I went to a psychiatrist when I was in my early twenties and asked him why I was so afraid to die and he said it is because you are afraid to live. He was right. Getting off the wheel of karma requires that you treat this life as a one-off, no do-overs.<br><br>I wended my way through all kinds of pop psychology and eventually to some esoteric materials of various degrees of believability. Tried it all on for size. <br><br>All of this simultaneously with an interest in science. I got that I was trying to ride two horses pulling in different directions. My only way of reconciling the worldviews was that I had a firm conviction that the universe was of a piece and had no internal contradictions or paradoxes. The paradoxes had to lie within the human mind. <br><br>I dabbled in New Thought [sorry JMG] sufficiently to recognize some of the unsolved quandaries that occur. I have since learned more about why it does and doesn't work. I even learned some techniques that solve a bit of the problems with it. <br><br>Neo-paganism came my way. It was fun and completely in harmony with my other religion. Gardening. I worked with small groups of women doing magic for the purpose of fulfilling our personal intentions. Very mundane stuff like getting a job, while enjoying the creative aspects of devising ritual for the purposes. <br><br>My orientation to magic remains in the realm of psychology and the way the brain works. The Great Work of magical tradition is way too much for this Valley girl. <br><br>Being happy with what is, is my main objective these days. That is a practice too, with a long tradition. I had the great good fortune to experience an extended period of grace that revealed the ordinary and mundane as totally sufficient. The magic is right here now.

To me it is strange that both the Abramelin Operation and spitting three times to avert the Evil Eye is lumped together simply as "magic", when they are as alike as engineering a power plant and building a snare to catch birds.<br><br>The same with "dabbling." Certainly dabbling in Goetic evocation (whether one believes the demonic is part of internal or external reality, or concurrent reality) should not be considered in the same category of risk as divining who one is going to marry by throwing apple peels on the floor at New Year's to see what letters are formed. <br><br>There is a difference in learning and training for running events in varsity track and field to break world records in the Olympics, versus running cross country in the mountains while escaping enemies or hunting like the Tarahumara. Both are running, both need excellent physical conditioning, and just because one is an excellent runner doesn't mean one is adept at both. <br><br>Draja Mickaharic says in "Practice of Magic" (p. vii-viii): "...Magic must have a real physical result to be worthy of the name. ...It is currently popular to define magic as the art of changing consciousness at will. This is not my definition of magic. [But] being able to change consciousness at will is a prerequisite to any real practice of magic. The student of magic must gain control of the mind the magician gains the ability to change the -perception- [emphasis mine] of earthly reality at will. ...Being a magician is [only] a stage in the process of developing spiritually. It is not the height of development. In fact, it is only a step in the first part of the range of real human development."<br><br>Different people have different natural gifts, different "knacks." Some people are natural runners, all can improve their running through rigorous training.

I know exactly the canned jargon, the icy silence, the baboon politics (the only complaint is why drag honorable baboons into the sorry mess of human self-destructiveness?). Why does all that bother me so much? Or, as Jung would put it: Why is this happening to me?<br><br>It seems to me there's another layer of reality besides the entirely physical. In that layer human attention is the currency. Milking atttention and keeping it stuck - that's how a lot of marketing works. And even culture. Locking attention. As long as my attention is stuck in the embarrassment of that icy silence, I am not doing what I want to be doing. My attention is being milked for the benefit of something else. Long time ago I noticed that what is usually called evil is often something that has a sort of stickiness to it, something that is very hard to detach one's attention from. That made me see attention as the thing to treasure and guard. As long as my attention is wandering all over the world, chasing the goodies and baddies, my self is left in the cold. And it seems that if there's unoccupied territory, there are entities that can and will claim it.<br><br>Just had a dream about a demon yesterday. It made me realise I need to think through what those entities are. They seem to me quite powerless - they seem to want to sit on my chest but typically they can't - as if there's some difference in the electric charge that makes them unable to touch me. With this blog and discussion I am finally admitting that there are such entities and that I can feel them. But their treatment in magic has typically been somewhat disappointing. Banishing is ok, but as they exist, there must be something they could do. Some tantric stories about the graveyard demons that can be somehow made to help (sometimes with mean tricks or fighting) - sometimes they turn back to deities that were cursed, if the tantrika knows how to lift the curse. Undoing curses would be very useful knowledge.<br><br>I've had a bit of a problem with magic for a long time. I've been interested, and all the little divination I have used on myself has been positively glowing with promise if I ask should I pursue the interest further. But when I start looking, I always bump into the reality of people seeking compensation for the perceived unfairness of life - being dumped by someone, insulted and so forth. Using magic to force someone to love me: sounds incredibly rude and aggressive. To me, life is the ultimate teacher, and I have always found rich pickings when I simply ask Why is this happening to me? Why do I get so worked up for not finding a parking spot? Why do I get so worked up about helpless people? Why is my attention locking into these things? That way I have got a flood if insight into myself. Would not want to use any magic to escape that.<br><br><a href=clarkes-fallacy.html#c7821812002304222653 title="comment permalink">9/26/11, 11:45 PM</a><br><br>

If the outline you've provided is correct, the author is embarrassingly ignorant of the history of magic.
