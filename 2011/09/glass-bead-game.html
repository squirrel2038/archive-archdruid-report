When I proposed in last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post that readers write science fiction stories about the crisis of industrial society, I wasn’t thinking of Fed chairman Ben Bernanke as a potential author. Still, <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/business/economy/fed-speech-offers-no-new-aid-for-economy.html>a speech of his</a> that made the New York Times a few days back suggests that he’s got a sufficiently wild imagination for the job.<br><br>In that speech, while trying to explain why shoveling trillions of dollars of money into the coffers of the banks that caused the Great Recession hasn’t done anything besides enriching bankers, Bernanke insisted that what’s wrong with the economy is that Americans are irrationally depressed about it. That, he claimed, is what’s keeping consumers from engaging in the binge spending that will get the economy moving again. You have to hand it to the man; it’s an extraordinary leap of fantasy.<br><br>Out there in the real world, after all, <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14903732>a sixth of the US population is living below the poverty line</a>. Most Americans who are still employed are taking steep cuts in salary and benefits where they aren’t waiting day by day to see who gets a pink slip next. Then, of course, in a little over two years, Obama’s health care legislation will place yet another massive burden on working people by requiring them to buy health insurance whether they can afford it or not, at whatever price the industry chooses to charge for it, with only airy assurances of subsidies from a government already drowning in debt to balance against health insurance rates that are currently higher, for many families, than the monthly cost of the home they live in.<br><br>In other words, Americans are frantically paying off their debts, cutting their expenditures, downscaling their lifestyles, and trying to get some cash put by, because they have plenty of good reasons already to worry about their financial survival, and will have an even better one come 2014. It’s tempting to add another reason for worry to the list—a political establishment, on both sides of the aisle, that’s blatantly out of touch with reality—but there’s more driving Bernanke’s essay in science fiction than a simple case of common or garden variety cluelessness. The core issue, as I see it, is that the economy is not behaving the way economic theory says it ought to behave.<br><br>Among many other things, we’ve begun to see the first stirrings of stagflation—the theoretically impossible combination of a contracting economy and rising prices for necessities. That this round of stagflation follows the peak of world conventional crude oil production, just as the last round followed the peak of US crude oil production, is hardly an accident, but the connection is one that mainstream economic thought has an inborn inability to address. The dogma that demand creates supply, or more generally that financial forces can trump the laws of physics and geology, is so deeply ingrained in contemporary economics that the obvious connection between rising resource costs and economic malfunction is quite simply invisible to most of today’s economists.<br><br>Bernanke’s attempt to blame it all on an irrational epidemic of national gloominess will likely prove to be the first of many excuses we’ll see over the years to come, as the mismatch between economic theory and the facts on the ground becomes harder and harder to ignore. Connoisseurs of imaginative fiction will want to keep an ear tuned to the utterances forthcoming from centers of power across the industrial world; we’ll doubtless hear some whoppers. Still, I have to question whether any of this flurry of fantasy has much to offer as we rattle and bump down the rough roads on the far side of Hubbert’s peak, and with that question in mind, I’d like to turn to a very different work of fiction that brings up some points the Ben Bernankes of the world seem most disposed to miss.<br><br>This is all the more interesting in that the work in question, though it’s set in the future and makes some very subtle speculations about that future, doesn’t seem to have been recognized as a science fiction novel at all. This was probably a good thing at the time, because it won its author a Nobel Prize for literature, and you don’t get those for science fiction. Still, it seems to me that it’s past time that the work I have in mind be assigned to its proper genre. The novel is <i>The Glass Bead Game</i>, and its author was Hermann Hesse.<br><br>When I first started college, Hesse’s name was one to conjure with among the young and hip. He’d developed a cult following on American campuses about the same time J.R.R. Tolkien did, and for similar reasons; though the two authors differed in just about every other way you care to think of, both wove hard questions about the presuppositions of 20th century industrial civilization into their fiction. Both were accordingly dismissed as unreadable by most Americans until the social changes of the late 1960s called those presuppositions into question. When the reaction set in during the 1980s, Tolkien’s life’s work was neatly gelded by being turned into raw material for an industry of derivative fantasy that borrowed all his imagery and none of his ideas, and tacitly ignored the hard questions he posed about the lust for power welded into the heart of modern technology. Hesse’s novels were harder to stripmine for cheap clichés, and so in America, at least, they were simply forgotten.<br><br>Even in the days when every other college student you met had a copy of <i>Siddhartha</i> or <i>Steppenwolf</i> tucked in a garish backpack, though, <i>The Glass Bead Game</i>—for some reason, most American editions retitled it <i>Magister Ludi</i>—was a more rarefied taste. It’s a very odd story: a hagiography, more or less, compiled by a bumbling and officious scholar in the early 25th century, about a controversial figure of the previous century whose deep ambiguities of character and action go right over the narrator’s head. There are plenty of things that make it a more challenging read than some of Hesse’s shorter and more popular novels, but I’ve come to think that one of those relates directly to the theme of this blog: the 24th century setting Hesse shows the reader in brief glimpses around the life of Magister Ludi Josephus II, aka Joseph Knecht, master of the Glass Bead Game, is not a 24th century that most people in the 1970s and early 1980s were willing to imagine.<br><br>It’s one of the deft touches of the novel that Hesse paints that future with a very sparing brush, but the transition between our time and Joseph Knecht’s gets explained in enough detail to make a definite kind of sense. The early 20th century, in Hesse’s future history, ushered in what later scholars would call the Age of Wars, a century-long periond of prolonged and brutal violence that saw most of Europe repeatedly ravaged and the centers of global power shift decisively to other parts of the world. When lasting peace finally came, what was left of Europe tried to figure out what it was that drove the frenzy. The answer they settled on was the profound dishonesty and political prostitution of the intellectual life of the age—a time when, to quote a professor of the Age of Wars cited by Joseph Knecht in a letter, "Not the faculty but His Excellency the General can properly determine the sum of two and two."<br><br>In the postwar era, accordingly, the scholarly professions reorganized themselves on monastic lines as ascetic Orders, and each of the surviving European nations set aside a portion of land as a "pedagogic province," supported by the state but free from political interference, where talented youth could be educated, schoolteachers could be provided for the rest of the country, and scholars could pursue their research in relative security. Nearly the entire story of <i>The Glass Bead Game</i> takes place in one such region, Castalia, the pedagogic province of Switzerland. There and in equivalent provinces elsewhere, in the wake of the Age of Wars, the most gifted minds of each nation pursued research projects full time, and created a future...<br><br>If you were expecting that sentence to end "...of dramatic technological progress" or the like, think again. This is where Hesse’s future history bounces right off the rails of our expectations, into territory that may seem surprisingly familiar to regular readers of this blog. It’s worth remembering that science fiction of the more standard kind, with plenty of whiz-bang technology, was widely read in the central Europe Hesse knew. Nobody likes to talk much these days about pre-1945 central European science fiction, because a very large part of it enthusiastically pushed the aggressive authoritarian populism that got its lasting name from Mussolini’s Fascist Party and helped launch the metastatic horror of Nazi Germany, but there was a lot of it, packed with the usual science fiction notions of endlessly accelerating social change driven by limitless technological advances. It’s pretty clear that Hesse deliberately rejected those notions in his own work.<br><br>The future the busy scholars of Castalia create, rather, is a period of ordinary European history differing from earlier periods mostly in its lack of war. Technology, far from progressing, stabilized after the Age of Wars, and most modern machines seem less common than in our time. A trip by railway makes a brief appearance early on, but only that once. Automobiles exist, but only two of them appear in the story; one is owned by a wealthy and politically influential family, while the other is assigned to take a high official of the Castalian hierarchy to important meetings. Most of the time, when a character goes someplace and the mode of travel is mentioned at all, the trip is made on foot.<br><br>Other high technology isn’t much more common. Broadcast media, type not specified, play a minor role in the story at one or two points, and there’s some kind of projection system that allows equations to appear on a large screen as they’re being written, but that’s about it. Doubtless astronomers have big telescopes and the like—Castalia has astronomers, yes, but it’s the only science that Hesse mentions by name. Most of the scholars of the pedagogic province work in fields such as mathematics, musicology, philology and philosophy, or take part in the jewel in Castalia’s crown, the Glass Bead Game.<br><br>The Game is arguably Hesse’s greatest creation, a stunningly successful piece of social science fiction so far ahead of the conventions of the genre that its implications haven’t even registered yet with other writers in the field. Unlike most modern thinkers, Hesse realized that historical periods value different intellectual projects; the contemporary conceit that treats technological progress as the most, or even the only, valid use of the human intellect is simply one more culturally and historically contingent judgment call, no more objectively true than the medieval belief that scholastic theology was the queen of the sciences. In 24th century Europe, attitudes have changed again, and an abstract contemplative discipline, half game and half art form, has become the defining cultural project of the time.<br><br>For reasons I’ll develop in a forthcoming post, I want to take a moment here to talk a bit about the Game itself as Hesse envisioned it. It emerged, according to his invented history, out of the fields of mathematics and musicology, as scholars found common patterns underlying the two disciplines—the structure of a geometric proof, let’s say, sharing the same abstract form as a Bach fugue or a Gregorian chant. Early on, the game was played with an abacus-like device with wires representing the conventional musical staff, and glass beads of different sizes, colors, shapes, and so on—thus the name of the Game—providing a more complex alphabet in place of simple musical notes. Later on, a formal mathematical script was developed; more scholarly disciplines took up the Game, finding their own abstract patterns and relating them to the musico-mathematic core; meditation exercises became part of the toolkit; public Games, attended by crowds, broadcast to large audiences, and surrounded by festivals of music and the arts, became major annual spectacles.<br><br>It’s another of Hesse’s defter touches that by the time of Joseph Knecht, the golden age of the Glass Bead Game is already past. Public Games that once extended for a month straight now run for two weeks at most, attended by smaller audiences and fewer public officials; the first stirrings of discontent about the funding allotted to Castalia and its equivalents are beginning to be heard; political events in the Far East have raised the specter of an end to the long period of European peace. How this plays out in the course of the story is something I’ll leave to those of my readers who decide to try Hesse’s novel for themselves, but it’s not giving anything away to say that Hesse’s sensitivity to the pace of historic change was a good deal keener than that of most other authors of science fiction.<br><br>There are two reasons I’ve chosen to discuss <i>The Glass Bead Game</i> here—well, three, counting the simple fact that it’s an old favorite of mine that deserves more attention than it’s gotten in recent decades. Aside from that, first of all, Hesse’s future Europe may not quite be an ecotechnic society, but it’s the kind of society that could exist and flourish in a future on the far side of peak oil. A nation or a continent in which automobiles are a rare and expensive luxury, railroads provide the bulk of what mechanized transport is needed, high technology is relatively scarce, and the values of society focus on pursuits that don’t require burning up immense quantities of cheap energy, could probably get by tolerably well, and provide a decent standard of living to its population, in the absence of fossil fuels. At a time when most people can’t conceive of a world that lacks our current glut of cheap abundant energy without turning immediately to the fantasies of squalor and savagery our culture habitually projects onto the inkblot patterns of the past, Hesse’s novel suggests an alternative view—though he’s quite clear, of course, that the route there leads through some very harsh territory.<br><br>The second reason follows from this, and heads in directions that will be as uncomfortable for many of my readers as it is unavoidable. It’s pretty much standard practice for every society to assume that its particular tastes and values are universal truths, and to think that any society that doesn’t share those tastes and values is by definition ignorant, or backward, or—well, you can fill in the putdown of your choice; there are plenty to go around. Our culture’s obsession with replacing human capacities by machines is a case in point. It’s very nearly unquestioned in modern industrial societies that getting a machine to do something that human beings would otherwise do is a good thing; even nations with crippling rates of unemployment persist in using a definition of productivity that amounts in practice to seeing how many people can be put out of work by replacing their labor with machines.<br><br>Our machine fetish, as I’ve discussed here more than once in the past, could only be indulged in so long as the extravagant use of fossil fuels made mechanical labor cheaper than human labor. That’s already started to reverse—there are good reasons, after all, why most of the world’s manufacturing is now done in Third World countries using cheap human labor rather than in the industrial world with expensive automated machines—but the cult of the machine retains much of its grip on our collective imagination. Even among those who recognize that the age of cheap energy is ending, the most common first reaction is to try to find some way to keep some favorite type of machine running—automobiles, the internet, the space program, you name it.<br><br>Among the most crucial tasks facing the pioneers of the deindustrial age, in turn, are those involved in slipping free of that now-obsolete mindset. Machines, as I think most of us have noticed by now, make very poor replacements for human beings, and the reverse is almost as true. Shifting from a machine society to a human society in the wake of peak oil, then, is not simply a matter of replacing one set of components with another that happen to be human. It’s necessary to replace attitudes, values, and expectations that are suited to machines—and nearly the entire modern worldview can be summed up in these terms—with the very different attitudes, values, and expectations that produce good results when applied to human beings.<br><br>That leads in turn to issues that have been implicit in the project of this blog since its beginning more than five years ago, but that I’ve been doing my level best to avoid bringing up. At the core of these issues lies a topic so heavily loaded with ignorance and deliberate misunderstanding on all sides that it’s seemed far wiser to leave it well alone. Still, if we’re going to finish the project of exploring a toolkit for green wizards—a set of skills and a knowledge base suited to the crisis of industrial society and the hard work of beginning to build a new way of life while the old one is tottering around us—it can’t be avoided any longer. For that reason, despite serious misgivings, I’m going to begin a series of posts next week that will talk about the relationship between peak oil and magic.

Is learning all just a game for minds to play? Why do we rush about burning fuels? <br><br>I think science has proved more than a game. Instead of half the world starving, the green revolution has fed them, at the cost of more fertiliser and mechanization and fossil fuel usage. More people are living better around the world than ever before. More people are living longer with fewer ailments and in less pain. <br><br>So learning became more than a game for the idle rich and their progeny. With the industrial revolution, it became Serious. We had more people on the land than were needed, and industrial enterprises offered fairly steady wages, better than the current farms could provide while population was steadily increasing. The Quebecois farms could only become so thin. Extra sons and daughters had to make their own way. <br><br>Machines, your bugbear, need not always take much more energy. Indeed, the bicycle saves energy compared to all other transportation forms save sailing. Apple corers, potters' wheels, windmills, and many other machines make life easier and save energy and drudgery. <br><br>Medicine may now be made in factories, but we have now learned to grow more varieties of it in genetically modified plants. Take a pea, anyone? <br><br>Medieval life, in fact, was not so bad. They had many more holidays(Holy-days) and fewer taxes. With better medicine, they could have been very happy.<br><br>There are many scientific advances which can reduce energy usage while reducing drudgery or suffering. While science may have polluted the air, it has also cleaned it. The computers we call cellphones can each, on just a few milliwatts, do wonders you would have needed hundreds or thousands of people to do.<br><br>We do need to reduce our use of energy, water, and other resources, personally and as a society, to match not just what is available now, but what will be available.<br><br>But the era of the isolated ivory tower is over.<br><br><a href=#c7373644246618511280 title="comment permalink">9/14/11, 8:59 PM</a><br><br>

We don't live in the world of the Game, as I explained, because we've got a machine fetish -- more specifically, a fetish for using fossil fuels to power machines when much simpler tools usually do the job at least as well. (Apple corers come to mind; I suspect they use them in Castalia.) We build gargantuan, energy-gobbling machines for exactly the same reason they play the Glass Bead Game in Hesse's imagined future -- because our values and self-image define that act as what's important and meaningful. As times and values change, the activities that absorb human passion and commitment change as well, and the particular activities you favor aren't exempt from that process. <br><br>Poet, there I'd disagree. Most of his early work can be neglected with advantage, unless you're really a fan, and the major novels are very much aimed at certain specific questions, or even personality types; the kind of person who can really get into <i>Steppenwolf</i> and the kind that absorbs <i>Siddhartha</i> are not the same. <br><br>Rich, thank you! That's the wave of the future -- less automation, more skilled labor, as energy costs go up and labor costs go down.<br><br><a href=#c6604358614769140578 title="comment permalink">9/14/11, 9:30 PM</a><br><br>

There is plenty of demand out there for more stuff, new cars, the latest fashions, etc. What seems to be lacking, and why so many people may actually be depressed (which, I think, is why they call a big economic downturn a "depression") is the means with which the demand can be satisfied. In simple terms, the demand is there, but the money to pay for that demand is not.<br><br>We have been living beyond our means for so long (individuals through maxed-out credit cards; whole nations through trade deficits and budget deficits), that having to actually live within our means is viewed as completely unrealistic. Thus we have stimulus packages, and government mandates requiring banks to give us low-interest loans that we are not honestly qualified to get, and massive central bank bailouts for whole countries, and all the rest of it. <br><br>All of the current political debates in Europe and America are centered around trying to figure out how to keep the gravy train rolling merrily along while trying to palm the bill off on someone else. In Europe, the someone else is the German taxpayer who is on the hook for bailouts of the PIIGS; in the US, the someone else is all the future generations who will be stuck with our unpayable debts.<br><br>The obvious solution is to change the mindset of most of the population to accept the proposition that we not only should, but also CAN live within our means and stop the insane consumerist rat race. Of course that will put millions of people out of work when everyone else stops buying the goods and services that they produce...<br><br>I have a bad feeling about this.

I agree, it needs to be talked about, and I admire your courage in bringing it up in a forum such as this. I am looking forward to seeing how you address the subject.<br><br>2) I haven't read anything by Hesse, but the Game described seems to bear some resemblance to the Game in <i>The Gameplayers of Zan</i> by M.A. Foster. Of course, the resemblance may be pretty superficial, as the Game in Foster's book ends up having a technological application.<br><br>3) I particularly appreciate your comment that "Tolkien’s life’s work was neatly gelded by being turned into raw material for an industry of derivative fantasy that borrowed all his imagery and none of his ideas, and tacitly ignored the hard questions he posed about the lust for power welded into the heart of modern technology." Many people seem to miss the fact that his work, aside from being a mental playground for his invented languages, has a heavy dose of theological exploration woven throughout it, and it is not a theology of progress (to put it mildly). Also, referring back to magic, it is notable that very little "magic" (as our society has been conditioned to think of it by most mass-market fantasy) appears in Tolkien's work, even though one of the major characters is a wizard.<br><br>4) In Kunstler's <i>The Witch of Hebron</i>, I find the title character to be one of the most compelling characters in the book, precisely because she is not readily explained by a rationalist worldview. Some reviewers have criticized Kunstler for this and other bits in his books that are not rationally explainable, but I think his ideas may fit tolerably well with what you are proposing to discuss in this blog.<br><br>5) I hope to have a submission for your contest, but spare time is at an extraordinary premium for me right now, so no promises.

I am so looking forward to this! <br><br>However . . .<br><br>I discovered Magister Ludi around 1962, while an undergraduate at UC Berkeley. Just back from a summer in Germany. I was already devoted to the German academic ideals of Lernfreiheit (a student’s right to study anything and everything that caught his fancy) and Lehrfreiheit (a professors right to teach study anything and everything that caught his fancy), and to hell with anything like a centrally planned university curriculum. I had also found Helen Waddell’s Wandering Scholars and her Medieval Latin Poetry, which introduced me to the life of the wandering student in the Middle Ages and the Goliardic poets produced by that life. Thanks to Waddell, I discovered the Archipoeta and his Confession of Golias, and I was captivated:<br><br>“Boiling in my spirit's veins / With fierce indignation, / From my bitterness of soul / Springs self-revelation: Framed am I of flimsy stuff, / Fit for levitation, / Like a thin leaf which the wind / Scatters from its station. <br><br>“While it is the wise man's part / With deliberation / On a rock to base his heart's / Permanent foundation, / With a running river I / Find my just equation, / Which beneath the self-same sky / Hath no habitation. <br><br>“Carried am I like a ship / Left without a sailor, / Like a bird that through the air / Flies where tempests hale her; / Chains and fetters hold me not, / Naught avails a jailer; / Still I find my fellows out / Toper, gamester, railer.” . . .<br><br>. . . and all the many wonderful verses that follow.<br><br>So I was all set to become hooked on Hesse and to be a serious fan of Magister Ludi. <br><br>Alas, Magister Ludi did not take on me, and Hesse’s vision of mathematics was half of why it did not take. He had no detailed and rigorous vision of mathematics at all – no vision that I could relate to any part of the Berkeley mathematics curriculum that I had taken so far, up to and through number theory. If Hesse’s vision of mathematics reminded me of anything, it reminded me of symbolic logic and its precursor, the so-called “algebra of grammar” propounded in the 19th century – which brings me to the other half of why it did not take. <br><br>The other half was due to anthropological linguistics, to Dell Hymes (Gary Snyder’s friend and classmate, who taught that subject at Berkeley), and especially to Benjamin Lee Whorf. Whorf had shown in a series of compelling articles how deeply the grammatical and lexical structures of one’s native language permeated and shaped the lines along which one’s thoughts ran without one even noticing. (The shaping is not absolute, and what is now called by linguists the "Whorf hypothesis" is not very much like what Whorf actually thought.) The languages of Western scholarship all came from a common ancestral language, and their lexical and grammatical structures resembled one another to a much greater degree than any of them resembled, say, the structure of Chinese, or of any of the languages of the First Nations of British Columbia, or of Xhosa, or of Bantu, and or of languages in many other families. <br><br>So . . . an insufficiently rigorous and deep understanding of mathematics, and flawed assumption about the relations between grammatical structures and the patterns of thought (and of culture). That is what I found in Hesse when I first read Magister Ludi. <br><br>Three decades later, when I turned again to the study and practice of magic, I finally came to appreciate more what Hesse was trying to do in Magister Ludi. It actually is a good jumping-off place for a discussion of magic in front of a Western audience, and I like your choice of it for this week’s topic. <br><br>I am very much looking forward to this next series of articles, even if it will be written for an audience that has no use for what it supposes magic to be, rather than for magicians.<br><br>Robert Mathiesen<br><br><a href=#c3371672887009425714 title="comment permalink">9/14/11, 10:22 PM</a><br><br>

As for Tolkien, exactly; there's a rich stratum of philosophy and theology in his work that's completely missed by the copycat fantasies. <br><br>Poet, well, I disagree -- I see his work as a much less linear process than you've sketched out, and deeply influenced by Hesse's own explorations in a variety of directions, not all of which ended up in the same place. Still, whatever works for you...<br><br>Robert, oh, granted -- it's a work of fiction, and attempts to construct an actual Glass Bead Game have generally flopped.

In my talk I mentioned various library &amp; archive projects that have been started to preserve and protect knowledge, including esoteric knowledge.

Of course magic, though being related to glamour, is not always full of the same glamour people expect. I picked up a nice translation of Bruno's Cantus Circae while at the conference. The Art of Memory is one of the key areas of Magic I am exploring myself.

"Palpable baloney and hornswoggle" is a fine reminder that profanity's far from the only way to express a strong opinion about, well, palpable baloney and hornswoggle. As for the rest, granted -- the level of schizoid dissociation that's taken for granted in today's world is frankly terrifying. <br><br>Anagnosto, I've heard of it but haven't played it. Hesse actually mentions in the book some of the medieval and Renaissance idea-games as precursors to the Glass Bead Game. <br><br>Cherokee, got it, and thank you -- a peak oil murder mystery will be a pleasant variation. <br><br>JacGolf, remember when I said that I had misgivings about bringing up magic in this conversation? The countless people who basically take your bit of satire literally -- see <i>The Secret</i> and similar pieces of, er, palpable baloney and hornswoggle -- are one of the reasons. <br><br>Les, thank you for the story! I wonder whether it's the Indian government, or whether it's simply the fact -- Kipling talked about that in some detail -- that in India, if you don't do things the way that India wants them done, you somehow just never quite manage to get them done at all. "...and the epitaph drear: 'A fool lies here who tried to hustle the East.'"<br><br>Grrl, okay, you've rendered me speechless. "A satire on ivory-tower academia..." Sheesh. <br><br>Bryan, true enough -- Capek's great. <br><br>Scyther, you're quite right that I should talk a bit more about the machine, and clarify what I mean -- it's been a while. The very short form is that tools in and of themselves aren't the issue; the issue is the fetish that treats the replacement of human capacities by machines, and the replacement of human relationships with the relation of power and mindless obedience tht people expect from their machines, as the goal of human life and the proper use of human intelligence. More on this down the road a bit. <br><br>DE, excellent! Yes, and we can also start asking the hard questions about just what it is that we're demanding, and why it is that consumer products never seem to satisfy that demand. <br><br>Mart, thanks for the link! No, Hesse wasn't talking about tuning theory, though it was a plausible guess on your part, and the Pythagorean relationships between mathematics and music are certainly one angle along which a real-world equivalent of the Game could evolve. I'm at least a little familiar with the different tuning theories -- you run across the ancient versions of that all the time when studying the old philosophical geometry, which I've done.<br><br><a href=#c1227146011064010004 title="comment permalink">9/15/11, 6:11 AM</a><br><br>

I never read Hesse, and I went to college to learn to make the machines. But then again a lot of water has passed under the bridge since then. I've found one of the things that most fascinates me is the difference between what we in our modern western view think of as old, compared to just how long creatures just like us have walked this earth. I suppose that your long view of history is one of the things that appeals to me about your work as well. I grew up in an “old” house, and it used to give me comfort to know that others had lived their lives in those same rooms, dealt with their issues and problems, and made their way somehow - and by implication and that I could and would find a way too. <br><br>The same is true when I think about all the lives that came before in societies we may not even know about. In some ways those people were just like us, but in many others they were very different. I know just enough to understand that I cannot see the world as, say, an ancient Egyptian did, but that does not invalidate their view. I can only try to understand it through the filter of my own accumulated experiences, and there are too many differences. But if there are different ways to see the world, to perceive what is real and what is not, then it must follow that ours is just one and perhaps not any more “real” than others. Since we are not physically much different, it must be our own mental filters that create this difference. Changing these perceptions is the realm of magic.<br><br>BTW, thanks for making sense of stagflation – the reason economists thought it an impossible anomaly was because of the lack of understanding of energy and entropy. Certain costs – primarily those tied to energy – cannot follow their rules. It's an obvious demonstration that economics is not a science, just a belief system – and one about to be revealed as inconsistent with the world people see around them.<br><br><a href=#c8219980898799080080 title="comment permalink">9/15/11, 6:26 AM</a><br><br>

I have discovered that I'm a much better thinker and forward-predictor as a result of the magical work, that I'm calmer and that my thoughts are more organized.

I've long noticed the short references you've made over the years ("causing change in consciousness in accordance with will"), and have been anxious to see if anything more would come of them. <br><br>Interestingly, your repeated references to magic have always reminded me of another Herman Hesse work--'Demian.' Have you read it? Some years ago, when tortured by the "what am I gonna do with my life?" question with which you might expect an eighteen-year-old to grapple, 'Demian' provided me with a source of guidance and meaning. <br><br>In it, Hesse describes "magic" in similar terms to the definition you so often quote. Clearly influenced by Jung, in 'Demian' Hesse's characters attempt to determine the proper path for their own lives by communicating with what occult types might term a "higher self," and what psychology types might call a "collective unconscious." The book's iconic image--of a bird being born by tearing itself free from an eggshell--relays the idea that, for an individual to discover their own source of will and meaning, the individual must first break free of the sources of will and meaning provided by their culture. To accomplish this, Hesse's characters employ techniques that carry magical implications. <br><br>Anyway, I'm not sure if your description of magic will bear any similarity to the above, but I'm excited to see what you have to say.<br><br><a href=#c8304529993644936008 title="comment permalink">9/15/11, 6:55 AM</a><br><br>

What a whack the two most recent posts have been, veritably sent me reeling. First the invitation to write the story: the way you frame it absolutely waters my mouth. How the heck am I going to arrange time to make an attempt at it? And now this – bringing up magic in this context. I have been a lurker some time, came here by the way of Naked Capitalism, or maybe Club Orlov. Never noticed you had background in magic, as the books on top of the list seem to be post-peak-related. And even the druidry did not ring any bells – thought it was more in the vein of being connected to nature, not the magic stuff.<br><br>So, what is it about this that makes me reel? I have been (really slowly) researching Goethe's Faust from philosophical standponint. Ostensibly for a dissertation, but really it is the issues Goethe presents that haunt my mind/body. Faust has adventures of love, sex and technology – I keep wondering if Goethe wrote a spell, or is it a prediction? We are living Faustian lives, and it seems to me that maybe the spell could be broken if I (or we, humans) could figure out why Faust forever remains unsatisfied. Because that is us, our culture – can't get no satisfaction...From every potential satisfaction we manage to wring out repetitive obsession - addiction. Sex, money, power, celebrity – they've all become addictions.<br><br>I came to look at magic through practice of yoga, then shamanism, and have so far not found any single ”affiliation” that I would be willing to declare, except for Goethe and Jung – and some interviews of Alan Moore (the graphic novelist turned magician) – oh, well, gnosis, understood as straight knowing, not as a doctrine/faith/religion would probably be my thing. Goethe had a vivid dislike of Newton as a person and a scientist, and offered an alternative, morphological theory of science. It seems to me he may have the elements necessary for a sustainable view of life. Of course, his insights on science never got any attention, he got gelded (what an excellent expression, thank you) by the public only wanting his poetry and novels. So what you are proposing to do is something I have been chewing for years: a world-view that would incorporate the magical dimension of life. It is sorely needed, as the mind-field of this culture is simply sick and it is going to die, sooner or later.<br><br>I had not read your books before, but now I've ordered a bunch - more that i can actually afford. I'm looking forward to what you're going to say – and I have to invent the time to give that story a try. There's been some interesting articles on Naked Capitalism by David Graeber, an anthropologist, on the invention of money, that are quite refreshing, and point to a very different reality than the economies of lack that money produces and promotes. And the archeological site at Göbekli Tepe in Turkey keeps haunting me – a culture that had nothing to work with, but built an amazing temple area with sculptures (http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/gobekli-tepe.html). We are magical creatures, our culture has just refused that.<br><br><a href=#c5747541701983571254 title="comment permalink">9/15/11, 7:20 AM</a><br><br>

Hadn't thought of <i>The Glass Bead Game</i> in a very long time--it's odd how when you are reminded of books you've perhaps forgotten, you see how deeply they've continued to influence your thought and therefore life; and that perhaps what you have thought were your own ideas turn out not to entirely be--and then thinking of GBG reminded me for some reason of More's <i>Utopia</i>. I wonder why?<br><br>You mean Bach fugues don't contain geometric proofs? ;-)<br><br>Regarding Bernanke and others: the word "fear" comes to mind, and whistling past the graveyard. I am reminded of the <i>Wizard of Oz</i>--lots of "wizards" and they none of them know what to do, so they put up magic lantern shows and hope no one will notice they're sitting in the corner, flummoxed. They could talk to people like Herman Daly or even some of us regular folks and take what they have to say seriously, but then… <br><br>Excellent points regarding Tolkien--I'd only add that his philosophic thought and the deeper themes woven into his books were also the product of deep learning and long thought and meditation, which implies a different orientation to that of many modern writers of fantasy who are churning out fast work to feed the commercial book production maw. <br><br>And perhaps because he made use of such deeply familiar motifs and archetypes, they were seemingly, deceptively, all the more easily borrowed. Our culture sometimes confuses surfaces for depths, and prefers sugar (well, high-fructose corn syrup) iced cake to a nutritious meal. Another example would be the difference between Grimm's grim tales and Disney versions of same. <br><br>Since I know little about what you call magic, I look forward to reading about it. Will you start with a definition please?<br><br><a href=#c5243990424483920267 title="comment permalink">9/15/11, 9:53 AM</a><br><br>

I began crafting my variant games at Jan Valentin Saether's Bruchion School in Los Angeles, and introduced them on various hermetic listservs in the early nineties. My game with LeGrand Cinq Mars exploring the ideas of Yeats and Jung would be an example from that period:<br><br>http://home.earthlink.net/~hipbone/Yeats.html<br><br>But these things take time to develop. That was fifteen years ago: I visited the Game Developers Conference around that time, and Chris Crawford (Balance of Power), Alexey Pajitnov (Tetris) and Brian Moriarty (Trinity) were among the handful of game designers at the time who knew of Hesse's work.<br><br>Since then, psychotherapist Walter Logeman has used my games for a depth-psychological group investigation of dream symbolism, Israeli and Palestinian kids have exchanged love songs in their respective languages and claimed links between them in a game designed to facilitate mutual understanding and conflict resolution, and the games are currently in play in Howard Rheingold's online classes – with software for web-based play in development.<br><br>Hesse was just very much ahead of his times, and his notion of play -- which accords well with Ficino's motto, *studiossime ludere* -- isn't faddish in the least, so the "modern" mind has been a little slow to catch on, that's all.<br><br>*<br><br>If I may, and since I'm here, I'd like to offer a quick greeting to Robert Mathiesen, whose writings I followed assiduously some years back, and to say it's a delight to read him again.<br><br><a href=#c5516931623853255394 title="comment permalink">9/15/11, 10:00 AM</a><br><br>

I wonder whether it's the Indian government, or whether it's simply the fact -- Kipling talked about that in some detail -- that in India, if you don't do things the way that India wants them done, you somehow just never quite manage to get them done at all. "...and the epitaph drear: 'A fool lies here who tried to hustle the East.'</i>"<br><br>I think a great deal of it has to do with India's large population - when you have that many people (an economist would call them 'surplus population', a term I find a bit chilling) it's simply cheaper to do things by human labor than automate them. When that's your operative assumption, and the average middle class family employs at least one or two servants, having things like a company employing a coffee wallah don't seem so odd. <br><br>It's like that quote from Agatha Cristie: "I never thought I'd be so wealthy as to enough to afford a car, or so poor that I couldn't afford a servant." Here in the US we've gotten used to this situation, but in India and much of South and Southeast Asia the reverse situation (relatively expensive machines and cheap human labor) is still the case. Peak oil will entail that everyone has to get used to cheap and available human labor once more.<br><br><a href=#c7101467117463246619 title="comment permalink">9/15/11, 10:30 AM</a><br><br>

This is something I miss in most other blogs and books that deal with the coming resource scarcity. Many people seem to confine themselves to the discussion of reports, statistics and vaporware energy concepts (most of which are aimed at what you fittingly describe as "trying to keep one's favorite technology alive").<br><br>Regarding Hermann Hesse, I tried to read Siddharta when I was ten (around 1990), and even though I was intrigued by it I gave up after a few chapters; maybe I was too young to really understand what Hesse wanted to say. Thanks to your post I've now decided to re-read it, though, and I'm probably going to get a copy of The Glass Bead Game (or rather Das Glasperlenspiel, as my native language is German) as well.<br><br>Funnily enough, when I went to school in the late Eighties and through the Nineties, we never really heard much about Hesse, even though he was one of the German-speaking authors that won the Nobel prize for literature.

This is going to be fun. One of the things you learn early and often, if you study magic, is that personifying and fixating a lot of emotional energy on something -- any kind of emotional energy -- is one of the best ways to give it power. I know there are pagans who worship Lady Liberty as a goddess; if the fundamentalist fringe is starting to fixate on her, too, that's going to be one powerfully charged archetype. Have you noticed, by the way, that every time Perry does a pray-in for rain, the drought in Texas gets worse?<br><br>Hawlkeye, good. Yes, there'll have to be a conversation about the impact of the industrial world's machine fetish on human thought one of these days. <br><br>Twilight, good. Very good. <br><br>Andrew, I've noticed consistently that people who look into the Art of Memory but don't practice it always end up dismissing it -- I figure that that's what shaped Spence's take on it. Those who practice it, by contrast, realize very quickly just how powerful a tool it is. Glad to hear you're teaching it -- your palace is a nice introductory system. <br><br>Mage, that's a common mistake made by people who are assigned the status of deviants -- trying to change their label to something acceptable. It never works; the more effective approach is to affirm the rejected label, the way African-Americans did half a century ago with "black" and gays more recently with "queer." Look into deviance theory in sociology one of these days and you'll see why it works. <br><br>Glenn, that's exactly how I got through <i>Ouroboros</i> the first time. I was fortunate enough not to try <i>The Glass Bead Game</i> until I was in college, and ate it up. Enjoy!<br><br>Dltrammel, thank you for the list -- and for the link!<br><br>Grrl, I bet whoever wrote that review went on to a successful career as an economist.<br><br>Adrian, fair enough. I'll be talking about the origins and purpose of that modern meaning in some detail. <br><br>Chris, Hesse ran with Jung, but the two of them were both part of the huge early 20th century counterculture scene in southern Germany and Switzerland, and Jung in particular drew far more heavily on that scene than his modern defenders like to admit. The approach to magic that was central to my own training came out of the parallel British movement of a slightly earlier period, so yes, there'll be some common ground. <br><br>Kristiina, have you read Oswald Spengler, by any chance? He used Goethe's <i>Faust</i> as a primary metaphor for Western civilization, and with good reason. Even beyond that, Goethe's a hugely important figure -- just for starters, he's the one who took the ideas of late central European alchemy and reshaped them into what became, among other things, the basis for the rise of ecology. <br><br>As for magic, Dion Fortune used to call it "the yoga of the West," and though that's an oversimplification -- there's more than one "yoga of the West," just as there's plenty of magic in Asian cultures -- it's a useful metaphor.

We were looking down at the bottling plant from a glassed in walkway up above. They run two lines there, one for cans and one for bottles. At the end of the bottling line sat 6 women watching the bottles of beer come by.<br><br>I asked the tourguide, "What do those women do?"<br><br>Tourguide: "They check for clarity and make sure the bottles are filled to the proper levels."<br><br>Me: "Don't you have machines that do that?"<br><br>She then proceeded to point out the machines that measured the levels and checked the clarity. They were fully automated and actually had a little kicker that would knock out any bottles that weren't proper. <br><br>I quickly realized that these women, and their jobs, were completely redundent and unnecessary.<br><br>At this point I asked: "So what do these women do?"<br><br>Her answer was: "Everybody needs to do something."<br><br>At the time I thought that it was very inefficient, but, after many years I realize that I was just thinking in the old "machine centric" manner that you describe in your post.<br><br>That being said, I still think it would be good to find meaningful work for everyone.<br><br><a href=#c8422064924294733280 title="comment permalink">9/15/11, 11:01 AM</a><br><br>

People put away their credit cards for a while when it looked like things might roll over and die in a hurry; now that it looks like a slower road down, they're using the available balance to cover essentials that may not be there indefinitely. <br><br>Ghung, yikes indeed. <br><br>Justin, yes, that was Joseph Max, and the two of us did indeed put on a very strange demo at a pagan convention a few years ago; he played the theremin and I operated my homebuilt Hieronymus machine.

There aren't many branches of Western esoteric practice I haven't at least dabbled in, though radionics isn't really one of my specialties. <br><br>Susan, funny you should mention that. My tentative title for next week's post is "Clarke's Fallacy," which might give you a hint...<br><br>Wendy, bingo. If Harry Potter does it, you can safely assume it has nothing to do with actual magic. <br><br>Kevin, I'll look forward to it!<br><br>Thomas, I'd say rather that economists are fundamentally irrational at all times!<br><br>Adrian, "the art and science of causing changes in consciousness in accordance with will." I'll be spending most of a post explaining what that means, but at least you've got the definition to chew on for now. <br><br>Zach, bingo. It's been a lasting source of annoyance to those of us who actually do the stuff that both Christian orthodoxy and scientific materialism have their own pet definitions -- it would not be too extreme to call them straw men -- labeled magic, which they like to beat up from time to time, but which have essentially nothing in common with what those who practice magic actually believe and do. <br><br>Charles, I did say "generally" rather than "universally," you know. I have yet to meet a fan of Hesse's novel that didn't at least harbor the hope that somebody, someday would at least make a start on the evolution of the Game, and if you've managed that, that's great news.

I know that the novel does not lay out the actual rules of the game, and they are not really the point, but mathematics and computing theory haven't stood still since Hesse's day. One startling finding is the extent and depth of equivalence between different rule systems, to the point where we can be nearly certain that no matter what the rules of the GBG are, if their application results in games with any kind of complex behavior at all, then it is fundamentally equivalent to all other systems of symbols and rules, including all branches of mathematics. That is, anything that could be proven or computed by traditional geometry, symbolic logic, number theory, algebra, or a computer program could also result from a Glass Bead Game if <a href=http://www.xkcd.com/505/ rel=nofollow>given enough time and beads</a>. <i>Why</i> this is the case might be a mystery as deep as the nature of consciousness or time.<br><br>I plan to read the novel, to (among other reasons) find out whether that knowledge reinforces or undermines Hesse's insights.<br><br><a href=#c2602453254782337311 title="comment permalink">9/15/11, 12:49 PM</a><br><br>

I'll be going through all of these as time permits -- also, of course, your game with LeGrand, who I did quite a bit of work with, back a couple of decades. Fascinating guy, and a Glass Bead Game with his input would be well worth seeing. <br><br>Whiffle, nah -- much, much more nonsense has been written on the subject of magic than on that of peak oil, as the nonsense mills have had much longer to grind on the former topic. <br><br>Myriad, I'll be interested to see your response to the next few posts. Since magic as I define it is the art and science of causing change in consciousness in accordance with will, an empirical approach to magic has to start with the question of how consciousness is experienced, and how changes in consciousness are experienced, rather than (say) with a set of presuppositions about what consciousness is and what can and can't be changed about it, etc. That's not a controversial stance when applied to matter, but it tends to become very controversial when applied to mind. <br><br>As for cellular automata, the Glass Bead Game as Hesse describes it is more an aesthetic arrangement of patterns leading to an experience of meaning -- one of the things Hesse was talking about with the Game, I've long thought, is the experience of reading a novel. Still, the workings of cellular automata would have made a very elegant theme for a Game. <br><br>Bruce, excellent! Of course you're quite right; the original root of the word "energy" is an important technical term in Neoplatonism, for example, where its meaning is about as far from the modern concept as it's possible to get. Myself, though, I try to avoid using "energy" for ch'i et al., since that language tends to confuse communication more than it furthers it. <br><br>Grrl, that's one of the standard postmodern ways of speaking about magic. I don't find it useful myself -- and I don't know anybody who practices hoodoo that uses that sort of language, interestingly enough -- but I'm sure plenty of people on the postmodern end of magic find my comments about the intentionality of consciousness and modes of experience completely opaque. One thing, though: there's vanishingly little fantasy fiction that writes about magic as I understand it, and Emma Bull, though she's a fine writer, is no exception to that generalization.<br><br><a href=#c3599746148217391326 title="comment permalink">9/15/11, 3:00 PM</a><br><br>

Slightly related, my wife got a copy or “the Secret”, and had me watch it with her.

(Seems to be a feature of our species: finding entirely new ways of misperceiving reality – but then again, how else can you perceive something as unfathomable and slippery as “Reality” except by misperceiving it?)<br><br>I didn’t like Magister Ludi much. I kept thinking, “Why are these guys wasting their time and money playing this stupid glass bead game when the Asians are about to eat them for breakfast?”<br><br>I might have been too young to appreciate the book. But that would probably be my response if I read it again: Mundane survival concerns come first.<br><br>But I have a special affection for Steppenwolf. Not that I liked the book (because I didn’t); but the really depressing 1974 movie of Steppenwolf starring Max von Sydow had a major positive influence on my life.<br><br>My girlfriend at the time was a former showgirl-turned-cocktail-waitress (yeah, okay – the hot babe thing again). Over the years of traveling around the world skating with an ice show, she had – how shall we put this gently? – developed a tendency to overindulge in alcohol. <br><br>We sat through that awful, depressing Steppenwolf movie (Magic Theater – for madmen only), went to a bar, mutually overindulged, got even more depressed, got into a really depressing argument in the parking lot, and that was the end of it. Which was a good thing, because she was a nice person and a lot of fun, but the relationship was doomed from the start.<br> <br>So I am eternally grateful to Herman Hesse for writing Steppenwolf, and to Hollywood for turning it into such a terribly depressing movie, because it played at least a small part of saving me and her from doing something really stupid; namely, trying to make a doomed, crazy, youthful adventure into something it could never, ever be: namely, a mature marriage.<br><br><a href=#c1556950207030807454 title="comment permalink">9/15/11, 8:56 PM</a><br><br>

I've always assumed that this was because he conceived and wrote them before, during and after WWII which was in the early decline of the British Empire. The mood of the times affected his writing. The whole lot is covered with it, especially if you read the background books to LOTR. Still makes for great and yet at the same time sad literature - but it is a consistent theme. What do you think?<br><br>Speaking of which and I understand why you don't want to comment on the submitted entries so far, I've noticed a dark - actually very dark - tone to the entries. I would suspect that this is either a reflection of your readership, or an accurate reflection of the state of US culture. Either way it concerns me. Which then brings me to:<br><br>We are also subject to the same, "Consume or perish articles", here which you referred to. Retail is doing it hard, do your best to support them etc. <br><br>In an accurate reflection of the state of the nation here, they are describing us as a two speed economy that is - mining/energy (energy is mining really) and everything else. Local manufacturing, which was mostly killed off in the early 1990's is now having its death rattle. Which also leads on surprisingly to magic. You wouldn't think it, but it does.<br><br>The average person is getting further disconnected from reality. Marketing is a powerful tool and wields a disproportionate influence on peoples lives. I've long understood the concept of "station" as in a persons economic / social station. The expectations of people here seem to be far beyond their station, to the point of not being based in reality. The things have I listen to with no comment now kind of disturb me.<br><br>Someone mentioned credit cards and there has been much discussion in the press here as their use has increased. It is a funding source of last resort and is probably indicative of expectations exceeding reality. It's a good metaphor for the whole Western economic system really.<br><br>Stagflation is good to mention, as we're seeing it here too as basic goods rise in price in line with the cost of oil. I noticed my favourite bran cereal (and bran is a by product of the wheat milling process) recently dropped about 120g per box, but kept the price the same. On the box, they said something about consumers asking for a new look product - what a joke. C'mon it's a cereal people.<br><br>Still stagflation is a step on the road to the eventual default. It's inevitable. The cost of borrowing rises with each new loan to the point at which it eventually becomes impossible to service that debt. Simple enough concept, it can occur on a household or national level.<br><br>Your upcoming health insurance situation is just odd. To me it sounds detatched from reality. Insurance is a gamble - on both sides - for the insurer and the insured. Surely it makes no sense to fine people if they can't pay for insurance. Such legislation makes a mockery of all legislation as it encourages mass disobedience, which in turn reduces the respect for the rule of law. It's a slippery slope from there. <br><br>I've always been surprised that there isn't a place for those that don't wish to take part in a society. I've always wondered about this matter.<br><br>I can see some pretty heavy magic is required over in the US. The culture of individualism is eventually doomed and perhaps that is what I am reading into the stories written so far. They are a reflection of this culture. Few are focusing on community.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c8238716267311027550 title="comment permalink">9/16/11, 2:58 AM</a><br><br>

In the hot parts of the continent, this led to the importation of vast numbers of Africans. In the parts with real winter, Africans tended not to live very long, so the northern farmer became obsessive about setting up the farmstead so as to minimize labor costs because labor was the scarcest and thus the most expensive part of the operation. In later generations, it was these northern farms that produced many of the great inventors of the 19th and early 20th centuries and the stereotype of "Yankee ingenuity." They also enshrined labor efficiency as the cornerstone of economic success, and that belief, useless in most of the world, nevertheless became widespread simply because America was the most successful country in the world and therefore everything we do must be right.<br><br>As for the notion that 'if we don't use these trees, they'll just get sick and die,' it's absurd if you're talking about a natural forest, but in an area where some fast-growing species was deliberately planted too densely for long-term health, it could be the simple, ugly truth.<br><br><a href=#c5286612971684465894 title="comment permalink">9/16/11, 2:15 PM</a><br><br>

Much was made of "Injuns" kidnapping hapless colonials. But it turns out (from authentic documents, correspondence, etc) that a larger problem for the colonial administrators was the defection of oppressed colonists, particularly youths, indentured servants and women (but I repeat myself), to the indigenous villages. Many of the "kidnap victims" could not be persuaded to remain among the colonists after their "rescue," but repeatedly escaped to rejoin the natives.<br><br>So there was, at one time, a place where people could go who did not want to be part of the system.

The hero is an actor, whose mask of Apollo is link to the god; and the play is "The Bacchae."<br><br>Just so, our own Limits to Growth comes out of the Faustian culture and is offering the same sort of reality check.

It gives a hint toward explaining the mystery you outlined: All of mathematics seems to be founded upon a few cognitive functions, most of which are crucial for interacting with the world and instill in us a solid and fairly predictable body of associations (conflations, technically) in our toddlerhood. Any math we can conceive of is just a carefully-constructed pile of metaphors that allow us to apply those basic cognitive functions in a novel way. Beginning from that hypothesis, of course all math is intimately related!<br><br>I think a fair number of Christians look at the Christianity espoused by famous people, and see among its fruits very little love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, or self-control. I don't personally know many others who read the scriptures as prohibiting the use of little engraved images of the sort Geithner's signature appears on so frequently, or as mandating frequent visits to people in prison...I guess it's tough to acknowledge how high the bar really is, and how many compromises we make.<br><br>JMG, I recently realized, while reading Illich's <i>Tools for Conviviality</i>, why computers have bothered me so much.

The practice itself has some potential to help heal the psyche, depending on how you go about it.<br><br>In the tradition I practice, people are discouraged from attempting magic on their own until they have spent a period learning about it under the supervision of an experienced teacher. The issue you bring up is one of the reasons. <br><br>Students are also encouraged (sometimes required) to go through a course of psychotherapy or journal writing or some other discipline that will press them to face unresolved emotional issues and their own shadow material before getting into advanced magical work. <br><br>For people who are determined to try magic without either guidance or personal work, rules have been developed on the level of "look both ways before crossing the street" to limit potential consequences to the unwary. <br><br>I think that it is impossible to learn a new skill or refine a talent without some feedback on the results of one's efforts. If there is no observer to provide feedback, the environment will provide it sooner or later; sooner makes it easier to correct oneself.

Magical training can help resolve common or garden variety neurotic issues, but if there's anything persistent or serious, that needs to be dealt with completely before even considering magical training.<br><br>Robert, thank you.<br><br>Chris, as I see it, most of today's fundamentalist Christians aren't conservative -- and indeed most of the people in America today who call themselves conservative are nothing of the kind. Authentic conservatism means recognizing the value of existing systems and advocating for a go-slow approach to social change; most of today's pseudoconservatives want to push social change as radical, and as driven by abstract ideology, as any Marxist ever did. Lewis, by contrast, was an authentic conservative -- which means that he would have skewered current American religious and political pseudoconservatism in fine style.<br><br>Lewis, you're in good company there. Every capable diviner I've ever known considers the tools of divination to be simply a way to get the conscious mind out of the way of a deeper kind of knowing.<br><br>Myriad, in my experience, most people who don't practice magic have very little idea just how much of what they consider real about themselves and their world is simply a function of their state of mind. The obvious and rather simplistic example is the person who insists "I am a failure," or what have you, as though it's a statement of fact, when it's actually a decision constantly reinforced by repetition. There are many other examples, far less obvious and far less simple.

I realise that you probably don't eat bread, but here goes anyway...<br><br>I live about 10km from the nearest bakery and I refuse to eat pre-package bread on the grounds that anything that can stay that fresh for that long can't be good for you! Anyway, a couple of years back I started baking my own bread from scratch and I finally settled on a crusty peasant loaf recipe. I usually make a small loaf most days and can cook thme in the wood oven. The ingredients are sourced from a specialist bakery supplier in bulk. Simple enough.<br><br>When people come over to visit, I serve them up the crusty peasant loaf and there's usually much appreciation for it. Some then ask me for the recipe and I oblige them. <br><br>Now, here's the interesting bit though.<br><br>It takes about 5 minutes max - by hand - to prepare all the ingredients so that they're mixed, everythings cleaned up and the loaf is then left to rise.<br><br>Everyone who requested the recipe, also asked if it can be made in a bread maker machine. Everyone!<br><br>I've tried showing them, how easy it is to do and they still insist on using a bread making machine.<br><br>I feel that this may be the tip of the iceberg.<br><br>Thanks for the colourful imagery in your response too!<br><br>Thanks also to everyone who responded.<br><br>DeAnander brought up an interesting point too.

If you could let me know your last name, I'll add that to the file!<br><br>Kieran, the Goebbels lineage is an oversimplification -- marketing methods on the same lines existed in America in the 1920s. Still, there's a family resemblance, to be sure. <br><br>Cherokee, I do indeed eat bread -- homebaked, without benefit of machine. I've also noticed the bread machine fetish; it takes more time to clean a bread machine than it does to do the actual labor to make bread without it, but that fixation on the machine makes it impossible for many people to grasp that.<br><br>Les, I've long thought that there's going to be a lot of that, in one form or another, as things wind down.

The core of the Faustian Culture was endless expansion, and the loss of that sense, as it spreads, could mean a very short-lived and feeble Civilization (just as, say, the Egyptian and Chinese Cultures both set the stage for enduring Civilizations, since the core spatial metaphors in both cases fostered duration). <br><br>I don't think a new Culture will pop right up here; more likely, the Faustian land base will fall into the hands of another Culture or Civilization; but the stirrings of the Faustian culture can be traced in the West very far back before it really took fire, and I suspect the same thing may be happening in this case as well. More, much more, of this in a later series of posts.<br><br><a href=#c4145869416843042990 title="comment permalink">9/18/11, 7:37 PM</a><br><br>

So far, I see it as an interesting perspective but not a deep insight. Finding a pre-existing conceptual metaphor that the Mandelbrot set comes from, for instance, appears problematic. Demanding proof that not only all mathematics but all apparent correspondence between mathematics and the behavior of the universe don't just come from our own minds, is flirting with solipsism.<br><br>Render under Geithner that which is Geithner's! Seems at least one verse of scripture has that particular "graven image" issue covered. But overall, point taken. Christianity overall is in a deplorable state, but the fracturing of churches (dissensus?) at least allows some ideals to survive in isolated pockets. I interact several times a week with monks of the Brothers of Charity, and I don't live in the Bible Belt or tune in to "Christian" broadcasts, so I'm privileged to observe more of the good than the evil.<br><br>Regarding the psychology of machine dependence: my favorite example is an ad campaign for an electric garage door opener with a battery back-up system. The desirability of the latter feature is highlighted, in the ads, by depicting the plight of a suburban family <i>trapped in their car in their own driveway because the garage door won't open due to a power failure.</i> Of course it's advertising hyperbole, but one must assume that the target audiences they tested the ad on did <i>not</i> simply break out laughing at what is essentially a variation of the old joke about people so dumb they were trapped on an escalator in a power failure. Presumably they instead identified with the family facing the brutal prospect of walking a few meters in the rain.<br><br>I'm a lot more sympathetic, though, to Motel the Tailor becoming "dependent" on a sewing machine to do his job efficiently. Or a dentist preferring to use a motorized drill instead of a hand-cranked one. And I much prefer my banker to use a computer instead of pencil and paper arithmetic. I hope the examples of frivolous use of machines that save no time (for me, snow blowers are right up there with bread machines in that category) or effect only trivial conveniences do not become an excuse to overlook the fact that most machines are work tools and actually do have a large effect on productivity.<br><br><a href=#c3699574095360595881 title="comment permalink">9/19/11, 10:08 AM</a><br><br>

My comment seems to have been eaten, so I'm reposting<br>with minor revisions. <br><br>JMG, the interior of the Statue of Liberty was closed to the public a long while after 9/11/01, then reopened, closed again more recently, and I don't know if or when it reopens. When the Statue is closed, the museum in the base is still well worth a visit. It contains a full scale model of a foot which you can sit on, and a lot of information on how the statue is engineered, why it was built and how it was paid for.<br><br>The climb inside the statue requires standing in line for a couple of hours (perhaps less if you arrive ahead of the groups of school children). My first trip was as a child brought by my parents. I noticed something then that I made use of on a second visit decades later, not long after the statue had been repaired for the bicentennial (the patches in her copper skin were still bright on the inside).<br><br>The climax of the climb up the spiral staircase is to file past the windows in the crown and look out over New York Harbor. One only has moments to do this because many people are in the line behind one, waiting for their turn.<br><br>Just before that point, one passes a platform large enough for one person to stand out of the line of traffic. On my first visit, I saw it, and on my second, I stepped onto it. <br><br>In that spot, one can stand for a while not bothering anyone, and meditate on Liberty Enlightening the World. If one practices magic, the platform is located about where the frontal lobes of the Goddess would be, on the vertical axis from the sky down Her double helix iron spine through the star shaped base of the pedestal into the rock of Bedloes' Island. It is a good place to align one's intentions with Hers, or with the Freemasons who created Her image.<br><br>If I ever did something that snagged me an invitation to the White House, I would ask the Park Service to let me climb the second staircase inside the torch arm and step out on what appears to be a viewing balcony around the flame of the torch. The torch has been closed to the public for many years.<br><br><a href=#c2948829027430317820 title="comment permalink">9/19/11, 4:05 PM</a><br><br>

I have just been away for a couple of weeks and returned to discover that the local council has destroyed an area I regarded as a nature reserve. It was a few acres of 'wasteland' of demolished factories that had been knocked down in the 60s on which a very varied forest had sprung up. Giant snails lived there and unusual - sometime unidentifiable - flowers sprung up there in the spring. <br><br>When I returned it was simply gone, with just stumps left and a few large machines parked up that had done the dirty work. A large number of formerly resident ravens were sat on a nearby barbed wire fence surveying the wreckage philosophically. <br><br>Nearby was a sign with a computer generated image of what the council plans to put on the spot - a 'Nature Area' complete with neat grass, a couple of tree species and some fancy looking benches with computer generated people sat on them. <br><br>Gah, it breaks my heart.<br><br>Anyway, apologies for the digression, I am working on my 'short' story (just need to cut about 10,000 words from it) and looking forward to the forthcoming discussion on magic and the nature of consciousness.<br><br><a href=#c7878771100761930605 title="comment permalink">9/20/11, 3:25 AM</a><br><br>

The question of what are necessary aids-to-work is interesting. What about differences of scale? On the home front, while I use very few motorized aids-to-work, I do find my computer, vacuum cleaner, washer, and blender to be very useful tools (used with discretion and mindfulness). <br><br>Over the years, while we were never ever in the electric toothbrush/bread machine/electric tie rack category, we have let more things go, e.g. when our dryer broke some years ago we started using the clothes line instead of buying a new one.<br><br>On an industrial scale, I suppose a blender-like machine in a factory that produces processed food falls in the machine category, running 24/7 for reasons mentioned. <br><br>But I use my blender in part because I don't buy industrially mass produced food products. So what is less damaging to the ecosystem? The big factory or lots of people like me? (Taking into account the embedded energy of the motorized tools I do use.) <br><br>One realizes one's use at home of motorized aids-to-work may go away: A post-peak story could be written about a young person educated for a pre-peak profession but looking for work and hired as a domestic servant in a society in which manual labor is replacing the use of machines/tools in households.<br><br>Speaking of stories, the ones linked at the Green Wizards site make for interesting reading.<br><br><a href=#c8132389861054122251 title="comment permalink">9/20/11, 7:29 AM</a><br><br>

And for good reason -- those things are tools for shaping consciousness, and stay in use because they still have the required effect on the mental states of the participants.</i><br><br>Oh, certainly. (In fact, that reminds me... must see about robes for our acolytes...)<br><br>I think I see where I became confused. You've been busy for weeks now exploring how "magic" is a wider practice than one might have previously thought, and yet in this first "Lesson in Practical Magic" you're involving funny robes, chants, and symbols (FRC&amp;S). My confusion is because I failed to keep distinct what magic <i>is</i> ("change in consciousness according to will") from the tools one might use to practice it (FRC&amp;S).<br><br>This also gets back to the distinction I wanted to keep clear between religion and magic.<br><br>So: from your perspective, when we enact our liturgy using <i>our</i> funny robes, chants, and symbols, what we are doing is magic, because it is using one of the standard "toolkits" of affecting states of consciousness. And also at the same time, what we are doing is religious, because we are doing it as a response to the Divine.<br><br>Then for this weeks post, you are advocating the use of ritual magic (as well as fasting from media) for what I would call a "secular" purpose -- namely, creating a mental space between yourself and your society, from which you can critique it rather than mindlessly participating in it.<br><br>Am I back on the same page?<br><br>It occurs to me that we Christians are all urged to this practice -- after all, we <i>do</i> have "Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind...", "Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?" etc. as part of our Scriptures. These passages are often misunderstood, especially by non-Christians, as urging contempt for nature -- but in traditional Christian theology, the <i>kosmos</i> we are to remain separate from are the patterns and perceptions of one's culture and age. So in terms of this blog, perhaps a good paraphrase might be "Don't let yourself get suckered by the mass thaumaturgy going on around you."<br><br><br>peace,<br>Zach<br><br><a href=#c8330643974965361649 title="comment permalink">10/21/11, 10:45 AM</a><br><br>
