The tenor of the response to last week’s post on the intersection of magic and peak oil was, at least to this archdruid, as startling as it was pleasing. Oh, there was a certain amount of fluttering in online dovecotes, as well as a certain amount of blank incomprehension, but a great many readers took the time and made the effort to follow a discussion of what is, after all, one of our culture’s taboo subjects.<br><br>The strength of that taboo nonetheless managed to show itself in the most common objection to my discussion of magic as the art and science of causing changes in consciousness in accordance with will. A number of readers insisted that I was redefining the word “magic” to suit my own purposes, and that there was something underhanded in such a procedure. We could get into an interesting discussion here about the meaning of words, which is always contested, negotiated, and polyvalent, but there’s a more important point: I didn’t invent the magic, or the definition thereof, that I discussed in last week’s post.<br><br>This point gets missed so often that it’s probably necessary to go over it in detail. Right now, across the modern industrial world, a great many people—to judge by book sales, perhaps a million, perhaps more—are engaged in the study and practice of ceremonial magic. There’s nothing new in this; a comparable fraction of each generation have busied themselves at this very unfashionable pursuit for a long time now. Specific systems of magical practice can be traced back down the years—for example, the Golden Dawn tradition, the most popular magical system in the English-speaking world, came together in English occult circles in the 1880s, and drew heavily on older systems with their roots in the late Renaissance; other traditions have lineages of similar length; the Druid order I head, for all that, was founded in 1912 and drew on a heritage nearly two centuries old at that time.<br><br>The word “magic” is the proper term for the activities these people engage in. Of course the word has other meanings, but insisting that I must have made up a meaning that the word’s had since the days when it was spelled <span style="font-style: italic">μαγεια</span> and spoken by ancient Greeks—well, it’s a bit as though somebody was to insist that since more than half of all Americans believe that the word “evolution” means that human beings are descended from chimps, that’s what it means, and when an evolutionary biologist tries to correct the misconception, it’s fair to accuse him of redefining the word to fit some personal agenda.<br><br>Now of course in modern America we don’t compare discourse on magic to discourse on evolutionary biology; one is the subject of a centuries-old taboo, and the other—well, it may end up being the target of a similar taboo before the current round of culture wars are over, but that’s a topic for another post. The myth of progress, which serves as the central religious narrative of our time, insists that magic is something that only primitive people do, and most people in the contemporary industrial world will do the most spectacular mental backflips to avoid noticing the fact that a small but significant fraction of their friends and neighbors are, in fact, practicing magic—not in any metaphorical sense, either, but in the straightforward sense of putting on robes, lighting incense, tracing strange diagrams in the air with wands, and using these traditional tools to cause changes in consciousness in accordance with will.<br><br>There are at least two ways to apply the toolkit of the operative mage, though, and since the difference between them bears directly on the intersection between magic and peak oil, I’d like to bring in an example here. (Those of my readers who enjoy rhythm and blues can get the appropriate soundtrack <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA6wySeeb6I">here</a>, courtesy of the Clovers, the classic R&amp;B group that originally recorded it in 1959.)<br><br>Love magic? Of course. I hope none of my readers are under the illusion that falling in love is a rational process. Rather, as last week’s post mentioned, it depends in very large part on the nonrational and nonverbal reactions that managed pair bonding for our prehuman ancestors. The rational mind, that evolutionarily recent and distinctly rickety structure of linguistic feedback loops propped up on top of a highly adaptive animal mind and nervous system, has little direct influence over the archaic reactions that cause one person to fall into or out of love with another, and even less with the tangled patterns of emotion and memory that so often gum up the works in one way or another.<br><br>Every human society in recorded history has worked out indirect ways to reshape and redirect those reactions and to resolve at least some of their pathologies, and those indirect ways are the stock in trade of love magic. Some of them are extremely simple—for example, a man with weak self-esteem is going to repel potential partners, because he triggers the same sort of reaction that makes female baboons turn up their noses at potential partners toward the bottom of the troop’s pecking order. Change that self-assessment by some bit of appropriate psychodrama, and you change the reaction and the person’s chances of attracting a partner. Other patterns of self-defeating behavior are more complex, but most of them can be affected by tinkering with the nonrational levels of the mind.<br><br>This is where things get complex, because broadly speaking there are two ways you can do that. You can manipulate the nonverbal conversation between people, and if you do it skillfully enough and your client isn’t a total wart, you often get results. Sometimes you get lucky, and one round of magic is enough to shake the client out of whatever self-defeating behavior was getting in the way; most of the time, though, the effects are temporary, and then your client with low self-esteem is right back where he started and his erstwhile partner is walking away, wondering what on Earth she was thinking when she agreed to date him. Then your client comes back to you for another bottle of Love Potion No. 9. It can be a lucrative gig, so long as you can handle facing yourself in the mirror each morning.<br><br>Then there’s the other option. It works on the principle that the only sure way to attract love is to make yourself lovable. You can do that with magic, but it’s not the same kind of magic; instead of tweaking the nonverbal signals you give off and leaving your self-defeating emotional patterns unresolved, you use magical tools to bring the emotional patterns into consciousness and then resolve them. That’s not usually a pleasant experience; it requires a willingness to deal with the fact that you may not be lovable but have the capacity become so; and this, in turn, requires a willingness to think of the personality, not as the be-all and end-all of the self, but as a ramshackle structure of petrified opinions, habitual emotions, and behavioral tics amassed over the course of a lifetime, which is what it generally is. All of this may explain why this approach to love magic is much less popular than the other.<br><br>The less popular option, though, is one expression of a way of magical practice that, oddly enough, also counts as one of the Western world’s enduring philosophical systems—and thereby hangs a tale.<br><br>When I went back to college in 1991 to finish my degree, one of the things on my notably eccentric agenda was getting a good general grasp of the history of Western philosophy before the industrial revolution. The philosophy department at the University of Washington in those days offered a set of three survey courses, Ancient, Medieval, and Modern Philosophy, the first two of which seemed to fill the bill. It turned out, though, that there was an odd feature to this broad survey. The class in Ancient Philosophy ended in the fourth century BCE with Aristotle; the class in Medieval Philosophy started up again with Augustine of Hippo in the late fourth and very early fifth century CE, and then jumped immediately to Anselm of Bec in the eleventh century. Inquiries about the gaps brought a shrug and an insistence that nothing interesting had happened in philosophy during those centuries.<br><br>It’s harder to find a better example of the way that intellectual history, like every other kind, is written by the winners. The years between Aristotle and Anselm weren’t a philosophical void; it’s simply that the kind of philosophy practiced in those times isn’t ancestral to the kind that’s practiced now, and moved in a direction that today’s philosophers by and large find acutely uncomfortable—and yes, magic is part of the reason.<br><br>Classical philosophy in general passed through three broad eras, in which three different questions were of central importance. For the Presocratics, who got started with Thales of Miletus in 585 BCE, the question that mattered was "What is real?" Their proposed answers varied all over the map, and so their successors, notably Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and the philosophers of the New Academy and the Old Stoa, asked instead the more fruitful question "How can we know what is real?" The attempts to answer that question ended up creating classical logic, one of the great achievements of the human mind.<br><br>By Aristotle’s time, though, a third question had already begun to emerge. The tools of logic proved to be effective ways to figure out at least part of what is real and what matters, but the ancients, like a great many people before and since, quickly discovered that it’s one thing to understand logically what needs to be done and quite another thing to do it, or to motivate others to do it. The question that came to dominate the latter two-thirds of the history of classical philosophy, then, was "How can we live in accordance with what we know to be real?" Plato was ahead of his time here; some of his later work focused on this third question rather than the second, and from this part of his work, later philosophical movements headed off in their own ways.<br><br>One of those movements has earned more than one mention in this blog already. This is Stoicism, the philosophical school launched by Zeno of Citium around 300 BCE. The Stoics—the name comes from the Stoa Poikile or Painted Porch in Athens, where Zeno used to meet with his students—argued that what kept people from living in accordance with reason was, on the one hand, misguided opinions about what was and wasn’t important, and on the other, simple lack of courage. Along the lines of some modern systems of thought, they insisted that if people studied logic and gained an accurate sense of their very modest place in the universe, they would be able to respond to life’s events in a sane and constructive manner, rather than being batted around at random by the forces of passion and prejudice.<br><br>It’s an appealing notion, and the best of the Stoics were impressive figures by any standard. The problem, though, was that Stoicism proved impossible to teach to anyone who didn’t already find its ideas and practices emotionally appealing. Anyone else trained in Stoicism simply ended up learning how to pursue irrational ends with a Stoic’s focused will and utter disregard for popular opinion. The Roman emperor Claudius, for example, arranged to give his stepson the best available Stoic training at the hands of Seneca the Younger. The young man’s name was Nero; you may have heard of him, but probably not as a model of Stoic virtue. The Stoic emperor Marcus Aurelius tried the same thing with his son Commodus, and the results were nearly as bad.<br><br>Such obvious difficulties in the Stoic approach fed the growth of a different philosophical school, which eventually became the philosophical core of late classical culture: Neoplatonism, which took Plato’s tentative probings toward an answer to the third question and ran with them. Central to Neoplatonism was the idea that the human mind had irrational as well as rational dimensions, and that there had to be better options than ignoring or browbeating the irrational side of the self. In one of his dialogues, Plato had compared the whole self to a chariot in which reason was the driver and two irrational parts, the biological appetites and the social reactions, were two very unruly horses. <br><br>The challenge that had to be solved, to the Neoplatonists, was how to train these horses so that they would pull the chariot the way the charioteer wanted to go. Several centuries of work went into finding the best ways to meet that challenge, and the toolkit that became central to Neoplatonism from the third century CE on—well, that’s where magic comes in.<br><br>In the writings of late Neoplatonist philosophers such as Iamblichus and Proclus, the word used was <i>theurgy</i>—"divine work," distinguished from thaumaturgy, "working wonders," which was the common or garden variety magical practice that went on in classical society in much the same way that it goes on in ours. The practice of theurgy was exactly the unpopular kind of magic I’ve described above; in the technical language of the time, it was practiced to purify the vehicles of consciousness; in the terms I’ve been using, it was intended to see to it that the baboonery of biological drives and social reactions didn’t interfere with the reason and the will.<br><br>The theurgists, in fact, summed up their magic as a preparation for philosophy—not philosophy in the modern sense, of course, but in the classical sense of an active life in the world lived according to the dictates of wisdom. It was far from the only preparation for philosophy in Neoplatonist circles in those days, mind you; the same students who performed magical rituals also immersed themselves in the study of logic, Euclidean geometry, and the most up-to-date natural science of the time. Strange as though the procedure seems by modern standards, it seems to have worked; Neoplatonism never produced a Nero or a Commodus, while it did produce a substantial and impressive crop of teachers, statesmen, philosophers, and the like. <br><br>Still, the great final synthesis of Neoplatonism came together, rather as our own final syntheses seem to be doing, in a collapsing society. As the classical world imploded, theurgy suffered the same fate as most other aspects of classical culture. A reworked and sanitized version of Neoplatonist theurgy found a home in Christianity, with the sacraments filling the role of theurgic rites, and stayed in use in some parts of the Western World until the Reformation and Counterreformation put paid to it. In its original form, the tradition went underground, and maintained a hole-and-corner existence in various corners of the Mediterranean world until the Renaissance, when most of the core texts found their way back into circulation and helped launch a revival that hasn’t stopped yet. Read standard texts of the major magical traditions nowadays—the papers collected in Israel Regardie’s <i>The Golden Dawn</i> are as good an example as any—and you’ll find classic theurgic Neoplatonism in there at the core of it, beneath 1500 years or so of miscellaneous accretions.<br><br>All this may seem irrelevant to the discussion we’ve been having to the future of an industrial society wrestling with the consequences of overshooting its own resource base. Still, it’s worth noting that a central aspect of our predicament is precisely that even the people who have managed to grasp just how severe that predicament is haven’t been able to turn that realization into a motive for meaningful action. Al Gore’s new mansion and frequent-flyer miles are a well-known example of this, but there are plenty of others. By and large, even those who recognize that today’s SUV lifestyle is an arrangement without a future, and that abandoning it in favor of more modest and more sustainable lifestyles is very nearly the only option that offers a way out, seem unable to make the necessary changes in their own lives.<br><br>For all that, these are the people who have at least noticed that there’s a problem; to borrow Plato’s metaphor, the charioteer may not be able to rein in the horses but at least he realizes that the route they’re galloping is going to take them and him right over a cliff. Most Americans haven’t gotten that far yet. Many of them have realized that something’s gone very wrong, but if you ask them what exactly it is that’s gone wrong, you can pretty much count on a great deal of baboonery. Social primates like you and I have a strong and wholly nonrational propensity to force-fit our problems into a social mode—no matter what’s happening, we want to put a face on it, which in practice amounts to blaming it on the troop over there, or the baboons at the top of our troop’s hierarchy, or maybe the ones at the bottom. We also like to define any problem so that its apparent solution doesn’t make us feel that the fulfillment of such basic biological appetites as food, sex, status, and security are put in question. Add to those distorting factors a widespread ignorance of logic and history, and a great deal of straightforward dishonesty on all sides of the political continuum, and you’ve got a pretty fair mess.<br><br>Thus we’ve arrived as a society, and at a very late stage in the game, at the same point that classical philosophy reached after the execution of Socrates, when it became uncomfortably clear that having a small minority of people passionately interested in asking and answering the right questions was no guarantee against catastrophic levels of collective stupidity. The Neoplatonist answer was a personal answer, the development of a toolkit to make clear thinking and decisive action possible for anyone with the self-discipline, patience, and persistence to put the tools to work, and it’s as valid an approach now as it was in the days of Iamblichus—though it’s only fair to say that there are other ways of getting to the same place, some similar, some very different.<br><br>The question that comes to many minds these days, though, is whether something similar can be done on the large scale—whether, to be precise, it’s possible to banish enough baboonery from our collective conversation about the future that we as a society can confront the real sources of our problems and do what has to be done. We’ll talk about that next week.

Thank you again for peeling back a hard and difficult skin to show off a deliciously ripe fruit.<br><br>I have found, in my own magical practice, that the more theurgy I practice, the more that people around me want thaumaturgy. I've amassed quite a collection of oils and bottles and "painted bits of wood" with which to do ceremony for myself and for others. But the real treasures were rarely to be found in the ritual experiences — more in the most simple meditations before a nearly empty altar. <br><br>And yet. And yet... The most profound conversations and the most deep experiences in group work have come from sharing a harvest meal after the Alban Elued rites a few weeks ago, and a Golden Dawn equinox ritual a few days before that. And a St. John's day discussion with a WM comes to mind... By candle light, with silk tabards of gleaming color, and candles, and painted bits of wood... people's mnds really are changed and moved to see and feel new thoughts.<br><br>I'm gong to have to go back to my Plotinus and Iamblicus. And Picatrix, too. Thanks for being involved in that project — the mansions of the moon and the stuff you dd with Meister Warnock has been quite instructive...<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c790570152663563539 title="comment permalink">9/28/11, 8:02 PM</a><br><br>

I was wondering if you will be talking about exactly how magic works. What are the specific methods that you use? I'm asking because way back in my college psychology classes, we did learn about negative feedback and self-fulfilling prophecies and so on and so forth and at times I've felt that, for example, in order to overcome bad self-esteem I've had to make some changes in my way of thinking--kind of like change of consciousness in accordance with will. So what is the difference between anything I might have done, and what you term magic? I'm having a hard time finding a difference, and all I ever did was just really simple stuff.<br><br>To be honest, I kind of like the idea of some kind of alternative spirituality and had been hoping for something more interesting than anything I've ever done. :) I admit that I am a fan of Harry Potter, though I do admit that so much stuff that's popular is pure escapism, which doesn't really bother me all that much. At least I don't watch TV. I know you mentioned some of the people who put on robes and do signs in the air and so on, but what exactly is the purpose of that?<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c6600248943575957148 title="comment permalink">9/28/11, 8:18 PM</a><br><br>

But to that now I guess one must add magic - for me at least that's a useful way of looking at the challenges involved in communicating these concepts.<br><br>Of course, the beauty of this approach is that with most people, on some level, they have some vague understanding of the importance of the symbolic or ritual, even if they don't know it's history, and this gives me some hope that these magical tools can be used in some form. <br><br>I love this history and philosophy, but most don't, but it shouldn't stop them from using whatever consciousness-changing systems you have yet to reveal to get us through civilisation decline.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c1827696121529167204 title="comment permalink">9/28/11, 8:35 PM</a><br><br>

I won't be going into the details of magical practice here -- this isn't the place -- but my books on magic cover the questions you've asked in quite a bit of detail. <br><br>BrightSpark, add magic to those three and you're not far off the mark. Still, I don't know that I'd agree that death is the most extreme taboo. To my mind, it's money -- the vast majority of chatter about money is an attempt to evade the real issues raised by that particular set of arcane symbols, which nobody wants to talk about at all.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c6835303319278881242 title="comment permalink">9/28/11, 8:48 PM</a><br><br>

They put together a hodgepodge of military tradition, frontier skills, native American lore, and muscular Christianity, very much for the explicit purpose of changing consciousness in accordance with will. I'm not sure whether their philosophy verged more toward Neoplatonism or Stoicism, but they managed to incorporate some simple rituals (mostly affirmative oaths, but also including some quasi-Masonic inner-circle mystery) and symbols, while not just flying under the radar of the dominant churches but being openly embraced by them. Given their aims, they decided to concentrate on the demographic they thought most likely receptive to, and most in need of, such a program: preadolescent through adolescent males.<br><br>Their names were Beard, Seton, and Baden-Powell. Some of the shortcomings of their approach should be obvious from even this brief description, but I wonder if anything of value might be learned from the results (both positive and negative) of their little experiment.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c4606325368670017199 title="comment permalink">9/28/11, 9:18 PM</a><br><br>

There's a magic in that, too, but of a different kind. <br><br>In any case, yes. The question of "How should we live, given what we know is true?" was deeply discomforting to all my philosophy professors in college, even though it was obviously underlying some of the discussions of the medieval authors we read, and even the classical ones.

Whether it fits your preferences or not, though, what I talked about is the kind of magic I do -- the kind that most operative mages in the mainstream of the Western tradition have done for nearly 2000 years.

Maybe you got a warmer than accepted reception last week because you'd already won over the audience. As you are fond of pointing out, people aren't all that logical, the messenger often matters at least as much than the message.<br><br>Don't know about where this is going now, though. Honestly, I don't get as much of the warm fuzzies. When you start talking too much about the hoi polloi going through life with this ramshackle mental construct they call a personality, and how do we change that, you know what rather quickly comes to mind? Bulldozers demolishing a shanty town, usually in the name of some high ideal like sanitation or crime prevention, but I think on some level messiness really just offends certain sensibilities. "How can these people live like this, don't they know they're poor and really need to do something about it sooner rather than later? Guess we have no choice but to force the issue, for their own good of course." The party line is always that it's for the good of the demolishees, and the majority of the demolishers probably do usually end up convincing themselves of that, but it pretty rarely ends up that way in practice. A handful of people with sufficient will can summon up bulldozers pretty easy; tackling public santiation, education, health care, employment, not so much, no matter how much they talk about it or even beleive in it. In the end, you're usually making poor people even poorer, not improving their lives through some misguided sense of tough love.<br><br>I dunno, these messy constructs that people call personalities really are somewhat important. Maybe they're not sparkly clean with shiny edges and widgets that lock into functional configurations like a well-oiled machine like the one you labor to create for yourself, but you know, they still pretty much do the job. A shanty can still keep a person warm, in some ways better than a mansion, and maybe they have other things they'd rather spend their time on that polishing and repolishing it, as seems to be your self-stated preference. Not that I can really argue that much over your apparent results on the mental self-improvement front, just my quick take on it.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c2475743334674914733 title="comment permalink">9/28/11, 10:34 PM</a><br><br>

It's fascinating to see what a long history it has and how it evolves. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was my first introduction to this concept and the Sophists.<br><br>The collective delusion as I see it is that we have far exceeded our sustainable carrying capacity. The resources that make this situation possible are still abundant and available, but perhaps people acknowledge sub consciously that this situation cannot continue for much longer - yet still we demand growth. We are on the other side of the inverted bell shape curve (Hubbert's is a good example) now and the only way is down - its a question now of how fast will the fall be.<br><br>You can see this at the edges of public debate, where people are battling it out for the final spoils in the name of ideology, but it is really just self-interest and tribalism.<br><br>Sacrifice, self-denial, work and self-discipline are clearly noble objectives and an appropriate response to the times, but few are interested in such things. I embrace these responses but still manage to have some fun along the way too!<br><br>Which brings me to an interesting aside. Within the past month, I have had two people state that they’d like to usurp me (by means fair or foul) in my little patch of forest. My history with both tends me to think that they would not survive the requirement for hard work and like the rest of society they would unthinkingly utilise all of the easily available resources without a thought to the future (until it’s too late, of course).<br><br>PS: Spring has roared into life here. I received 3 inches (74mm) of rain yesterday. Drought is hard, but floods do far more damage in a quicker time span. The thing that a lot of people just don't seem to get about industrial agriculture is that it has no resiliency and therein lies its weakness.<br><br>Hey Adrian,<br><br>Good luck with the hedgerow project – it doesn’t sound dissimilar from establishing a food forest. Observing and understanding natural systems and processes puts food on the table and like magic it takes years (and I'm sure many successes and failures) to learn.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c6650855598298233607 title="comment permalink">9/29/11, 1:00 AM</a><br><br>

Even when such spells are successful (they often aren't), all they do is engender a momentary biochemical confusion in the brain of the individual upon whom the spell was cast. IOW, they don't really fall in love with you. And when the spell runs its course, they're going to know that you did something to mentally mess with them, even if they're not sure what it was you did. Such acts like all Black Magicks also incur what is known as the "Threefold Return", in which the negativity perpetrated on others with the spell in question gets visited back upon the mage (almost always an ignorant amateur) multiplied by a factor of three.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c961338171515129679 title="comment permalink">9/29/11, 6:17 AM</a><br><br>

My other less important comments follow.<br><br>I hope nobody said you were redefining the word magic to fit some personal agenda. At least that's not what I meant. No one would disagree that you are correct, 'uayeia' is the proper word! And your predecessors and cohorts have been practicing it the past millenia. Meanwhile, completely outside your control, everyone else around you changed the definition of the word. As I mentioned last week, a similar thing happened to scientists with the word "theory." I sometimes hope that if scientists traded another word for 'theory' then the mass of people might actually have a shot at comprehending what actually happens in the world. It's a vain hope, I know.<br><br>While I despair of ever getting people to understand each other on a large scale (I better go re-read that story about Babel), I do have some questions.<br><br>Perhaps this will require too long of an answer, but does "magic" try to do the same thing as meditation/prayer/yoga, etc.? Speaking in the paradigm of E.F. Schumacher's Levels of Being, you could say that meditation/prayer/yoga attempts to "go up" to a higher level. But when you speak of "nonrational and nonverbal reactions ... for our prehuman ancestors," doesn't that involve "going down" to a lower level? (Your description of "theurgy" certainly sounds to me like an attempt to go higher, but perhaps I am confused.)<br><br>Additionally, if some meditation/prayer/yoga/tai chi (you pick whichever suits you) is something that *everyone* should do (in the same way that everyone should exercise), then should "magic" be left to the mages, in the same way that science should be left to the scientists and economics left to the economists? <br><br>On the other hand, we all studied math in school, that doesn't make us all mathematicians. Is there some basic level theurgic study that we all should have, and how do we get it?

When I first learned about this, it was hard to understand: accustomed to our modern atheist/scientific/technological model, in which educated people shouldn't believe in god or mysteries, I couldn't understand how such revered philosophers could simultaneously participate in an ancient, pre-Greek fertility cult. Yet it was clearly so much more than this, and, I believe, contributed another immense, supra-material, magical, context from which emerged, in part, those questions about reality they were grappling with--and thus also influenced their Neoplatonist successors. <br><br>You offer much material for meditation. Oddly, this post helps me understand why the Puritans sometimes thought Quakers were witches and warlocks: it has to do with Neoplatonism, I think, and also the idea that Quakers have (and many straight Christian sects don't), which is that many spiritual traditions center around a common core of spiritual reality. I keep mentioning Quakers in my comments because that is my own spiritual tradition and because much of what you say about druidry makes so much sense; I keep drawing connections between the two. I've got your <i>Druidry Handbook</i> on order. (And I'm not so familiar with the late classical Neoplatonists, myself, owing to similar curriculum-based gaps.)<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c6627023998368648550 title="comment permalink">9/29/11, 8:09 AM</a><br><br>

My horses have gotten me into some pretty deep holes, but then, I'm not sure the charioteer would have done a better job. Coming of age in the 60s, it seems to me it was my horses that bolted from the narrow groove that the racetrack provided. By that I mean it was passionate instincts that told me things were going in the wrong direction, and I didn't want to be a part of it. Yeah, I read a lot of ecology and current thought on resource limits, but it's pretty hard to look back and say my decisions were rational.<br><br>The rational charioteers of my day stayed in the groove and are now the doctors, lawyers, and Indian chiefs of the world. Then the cliff turned out to be a bit further off than it appeared to me at the time. Maybe a more rational charioteer would have decided to stay the course for a while.<br><br>I could have certainly made some better decisions, but would they have been ethical, knowing what I knew?

Does magic change consciousness? Find out for yourself. If not, no need to waste bandwidth arguing about it: you'll know from experience, at least as far as you yourself are concerned. If it does work, does it have anything to offer our current situation? If not, no need to continue practicing it. But if it does, how can we fine-tune its effectiveness? If we never prove it for ourselves, we are no more qualified to opine about it than the everyday observer who can offer seemingly incontestable visual evidence that the sun revolves around the earth, though in fact it doesn't.<br><br>Yes, some of us here are academics or egg-heads in the sense that we haven't stopped learning, whether inside or outside the academy. Last I looked, it was folly not to play to one's strengths. Besides, magic tests this particular form of knowledge, as it does others, and counterbalances it with its own, also valid and useful. Magic offers itself to experimental proof, and levels the playing field. The intellect alone confers the same advantage to mage that it does to musician: it may help you read the score.

I came to it rather late in life, as far as actually reading the primary sources. Marcus Aurelius as thesis with a careful dollop of Epicurean enjoyment as balancing antithesis-spice, all laid into a matrix of animism, is my current construct. Accept and prepare for the worst with endurance, character, dignity and grace. Gather ye roses while ye may and don't turn down a good time when it presents itself. And remember the world itself is alive, with all the seen and unseen all around us, and stand in good relationship to it. This is life, live it, for no one really knows what comes after. <br><br>See, JMG, you are helping us prepare for the downslope of empire and the decline of ready and cheap energy. Which is invaluable, and may the gods and goddesses bless you. Besides sociopolitical decline and peak oil, there is that other nasty thing that people are often loathe to include in the mix, for them it really becomes overwhelming: climate change. A geologist friend sent this out to my sister who forwarded it to me:<br><br>"Say I have been reading about the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) lately and it is a gripping tale. This was a pulse of CO2 that moved levels from 1000 ppm to 1500 ppm at 56 million years ago. We are at 390 ppm today, up from 200 ppm during the last glacial period from 65,000 to 13,000 years ago. The PETM event lasted about 150,000 years and caused sea levels to rise about 220 feet higher than they are today. Temperatures also soared – bottom water in the arctic was 65 degrees all year and the world was totally ice free. New York and New Jersey had a climate like the Caribbean today with ocean temperatures of 75-80 degrees. Most of the United States had temperatures well north of 100 degrees 24 hours a day and for most of the year. Whole families of mammals got started in this punctuated equilibrium period including the earliest primates, horses and camel like creatures. The climate near the north pole was similar to a swamp in northern Florida today. Rocks &amp; fossils in northern Wyoming tell us this story along with PETM aged deposits in Asia. The CO2 source may have been volcanoes associated with the spread of the Atlantic ocean basin at the time or maybe destruction of methane hydrates on the continental slopes – these oxidize to CO2. By 42 million years ago, CO2 levels had plummeted and oxygen levels were up to 30-35%; land mammals got huge, some were 20 feet at the shoulder and weighed 25 tons.<br> <br>67,000 years ago, things got warm enough, probably due to a C02 spike at least in part, to raise ocean levels 90 feet higher than today. There was another 700-800 year warm up period commencing about 9500 years ago that raised sea levels 8-10 feet above today’s level and temperatures warmed up enough to push tree lines about 1000 feet higher.<br> <br>Today humans are the source of most added CO2 but as things warm up tundra areas will not be in permafrost mode and huge amounts of natural methane and CO2 will be released; once these levels get into the 1000s of ppm, sea levels will once again rise and a hot time will be had by all – probably this will happen in the next 200 years as we continue a natural inter-glacial warm up added to by human activity….it would not surprise me at all to see a 3-5 foot sea level rise in our lifetimes."<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c8671354456844837865 title="comment permalink">9/29/11, 10:00 AM</a><br><br>

The rational discussion quickly stops, and if it's replaced with anything that's not baboonery , it's usually an incantation of how people won't change until they're forced to by economic factors. <br><br>I'm really looking forward to reading your view of what magic we can work as the "peak oil community" to focus on effective changes.<br><br>--<br><br>Last evening after a long day of harvesting, putting food by, seasoning the new woodstove, and making plans for next year's expanded garden, I cracked a couple of homebrews with my next-door neighbor.

Maybe in the Greek transition between the first stage of philosophy, which seems to have been quite mystical, and the more rational subsequent stages, his function was usurped by the rational mind. (Maybe it was like the Biblical parable of the unjust steward who took over his master's property for himself as soon as he went away for a while.)<br><br>Even in reality, the charioteer was acting for someone else. In the Olympic chariot races the honours went to the rich men who owned the chariots and horses, and employed or owned the charioteers. In Homeric and Celtic warfare the charioteer drove to the instructions of the Heroic fighting man behind him.<br><br>Certainly the charioteer should look after the horses and the vehicle, and pay attention to the road signs and the traffic. Perhaps he should pay more attention to the 'still small voice' coming from the back of his mind, which could be telling him that he's heading for the wrong destination.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c8357929923105642756 title="comment permalink">9/29/11, 11:59 AM</a><br><br>

What you're doing is actually very close to one of the introductory practices students of magic are asked to take up...but the technical methods of magic don't end there. <br><br>Thijs, magic is very much like mathematics -- everyone does it in a small way, a few people specialize in it. Yes, that involves some communication issues. I don't use the spelling "magick" for, yes, political reasons -- that's a habit popularized by Aleister Crowley and his followers, and popular on the avant-garde end of the occult scene, to which I emphatically do not belong. <br><br>Mister R., a good point, but there's another dimension to it. I've seen several people, despite warnings, trying magic to make a specific person fall in love with them. In every case, what happened was that the magic-using person ended up utterly besotted with the intended target, while the target reacted against the spell and ended up with an unaccountable loathing for the would-be love magician. John Lennon put it best: "Instant karma's gonna get you..." <br><br>Blue Sun, theurgy aims at much the same goal as other forms of mystical practice, such as yoga. Thaumaturgy has more pragmatic goals. There are aspects of theurgic magic that can be practiced by anybody -- most of them have ended up as practices in the various religions, and indeed late classical Paganism had quite a bit of theurgy in it -- but serious work in that direction is a very demanding discipline, and is probably best left for those who are willing and able to commit the time and dedication it demands. <br><br>Jennifer, got it -- you're in the contest. <br><br>Katsmama, exactly.

Please remember that I only know that side of the story and am only extrapolating to what the other side might have been.<br><br>I was taught that chemistry grow out of alchemy. I do not know if mages currently practice alchemy, but if you do I would imagine that its aims and purposes are different now from what they were before the two fields split.<br><br>Again, I was taught that one thing that alchemy was trying to do was change base metals into gold. I would also imagine that this was somewhat look down on upon by wiser mages, so it was probably consider either grey or even black magic.<br><br>Greed being a firm part of us, I would also imagine that alchemists did continued to pursue attempting this transforamtion even after it was clear that the two fields had split.<br><br>As you know chemistry, or rather nuclear physics, has achieved this desired transformation. But we now know that doing this on earth, versus in a dying star, is like planting footprints on the moon. It is something that the most wealthy and resource rich society that the earth will ever see could do for bragging rights only, and will probably never happen again on our planet (unless it gets swallowed by our sun when it becomes a red star).<br><br>So if alchemy is still practiced, I would imagine that trying to physically turn lead into gold is not something that educated mages would even attempt, although the ignorant and uneducated may still be attempting to do it.<br><br>I would guess that this weeding process went on in many other areas of magic as science defined the boundaries of what was possible in the physical world.<br><br>My gut feeling is that some of the popular misconceptions about magic (the Harry Potter syndrome) arose because the marginalization of magic started before this weeding process could take place and what often got seen by the larger culture tended to be the charlatans and exaggerators (after all, in our culture practicers of the black magic of advertising would never exaggerate, now would they?).<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c7206081260322611514 title="comment permalink">9/29/11, 3:39 PM</a><br><br>

I prefer the path I follow, though!<br><br>Hal, I'd argue that the rational charioteers were not actually that rational -- that they were rationalizing various kinds of baboonery, rather than actually asking the hard questions about whether (say) the presuppositions of American society made any kind of sense. Rationalization masquerading as reason is a major issue. <br><br>Richard, the point of all this isn't to abandon your ordinary life and move into a cave; it's to address the choices in your ordinary life in a wiser and more focused way. <br><br>DE, you get today's gold star for stating the necessary. Magic, to borrow a phrase from theology, is justified by works rather than faith; those who practice it learn relatively quickly that it does actually have the effects it claims. A good scholarly education is not at all a hindrance to practicing it -- though certain kinds of scholarly background can prejudice people against giving it a try, of course. <br><br>h0neanias, nicely put. The notion that history has to be going somewhere is what Karl Popper called "historicism," and it's a common and highly counterproductive bad habit. <br><br>Maria, I'm sorry to hear that your therapist likes "The Secret"! You might give him/her a copy of the recent and very worthwhile Barbara Ehrenreich book <i>Brightsided</i>, which is about the ways that the cult of positive thinking has been a highly destructive force in our culture. <br><br>Lance, I still value the Stoics, since I'm the kind of person who finds that approach naturally appealing; Epictetus' <i>Enchiridion</i> got me through the year or so after the death of my son, too, so it's an old and trusted friend. (I never liked the Epicureans much at all.) Thanks for the climate change info; it's good to have a bit of data to balance against the exaggerations on both sides of that issue. <br><br>Steve, as long as people frame the discussion in terms of "everyone else has to change their way of life before I'll change mine," which is usually what it comes down to, nothing is going to happen. Thus the theme of the Green Wizardry posts up to this time, and some aspects of the work ahead. <br><br>WVjohn, glad to hear it! The OBOD course was my first introduction to Druidry, too, and it's a good one; I still use material I learned there. <br><br>Tyler, I'm not a psychiatrist, and I don't even play one on TV, so I'm far from qualified to offer advice in a case like this one -- and could potentially get in legal trouble for offering it. <br><br>Carolyn, small steps are better than no steps, and some of the steps you've taken are not small by any scale I know.

It has a very good approach to learning backyard astronomy. The author also gives his choice of the best beginner's telescope: "There may not be a perfect telescope for the beginner, but the closest thing to it is the 6-inch Dobsonian-mounted Newtonian reflector. These telescopes offer the best combination of modest price, versatility and practicality available in a commercial telescope. For about $500, you get a complete telescope of astonishing capability. It will reveal Cassini's division in Saturn's rings, Jupiter's red spot, the polar caps and dark regions on Mars, thousands of lunar features, the Trapezium at the core of the Orion Nebula, hundreds of stars in the Hercules cluster and galaxies 60 million light years away." Also Schmidt-Cassegrain are favorites of some (but stay away from those produced during the fad for them during the 1980s, go earlier or later).<br><br>Another useful guide to beginning to learn some of the night sky is the Stikky Guide to the Night Sky: "Learn 6 constellations, 4 stars, a planet, a galaxy, and how to navigate at night-in one hour, guaranteed."

This sequence was first put online in 2001 and generated the feedback that lead directly to the Stikky series.

The question of whether traditional alchemy tried to create metallic gold or not is in some ways even more complex -- "our gold is not the common gold" is a very common refrain in the old alchemical texts. I don't happen to know anybody in the field who's trying to make gold, but alchemists are an uncommunicative bunch. <br><br>The core difference between alchemy and chemistry, though, is easy enough to state. You've doubtless noticed that a good cook and a bad one can make the same recipe with the same ingredients in the same way, and come up with very different results. That personal equation is what chemistry, like all other sciences, tries to exclude -- thus replicability as the touchstone of science -- but it's the foundation of alchemy. It's the participation of the alchemist in the alchemical process that makes things happen -- in the alchemist as well as in the flask. <br><br>Bruce, early Christianity did indeed end up absorbing a great deal of Neoplatonism early on -- it was the philosophical lingua franca of the late Roman world, thus hard to avoid -- but in the western world, at least, spent most of the Reformation era ditching it. As for parallels with Taoism, my knowledge of the latter is limited to English language books, but to judge from those, there are significant parallels.<br><br>Zympht, thank you. That strikes me as an eminently useful approach to the time of troubles before us. <br><br>Richard, I have only a nodding acquaintance with Thomism; since I'm not Catholic, and Thomism is specific to that faith, it hasn't been a subject of interest to me. If you find Catholicism a viable path for you, then studying what the Doctor Angelicus had to say is probably a very good idea.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c70707080223405554 title="comment permalink">9/29/11, 8:07 PM</a><br><br>

It is more the case that those who took up the mantle of studying ancient philosophy during this period, namely Muslim Arabs, were those who were considered beyond the pale by those Christian Europeans who much later called what they were doing Western Philosophy. It was philosophers like Averroes and Avicenna who kept Aristotelian philosophy alive during the so-called medieval period when Islam was ascendant and Christianity in retreat. Arguably the lack of awareness of these thinkers among your college professors had more to do with the latent effects of centuries of cultural and religious prejudice than with a turn toward magic in medieval times.

It is a great thing to have a disparate yet connected community of people with which to ask for assistance. I particularly appreciated the offer of extended help. It is no small thing. I'm going to digest on the responses for a few days.<br><br>Back to this week’s post though. I can't help myself! JMG mentioned love potions and such. For those that are non-believers I can only suggest a ride into the surreal. What I mean by this is that as part of my research into marketing and how we are manipulated on a day to day basis which has led my life in strange directions, I read a contemporary book by Neil Strauss called "The Game". It is a story of one individuals search on the secret as to how to start up relationships. Actually, that was too nice a description, the book was a biography of his time in developing his skills as a pickup artist. Seriously. <br><br>A strange read. Was it magic? Maybe? JMG's definition inclines me to think so. He has a very methodical and inquisitive brain and writes about himself as if he were the most affable guy around. Plus it is a very entertaining read.<br><br>The really funny thing though is that once I became aware that this sort of thing was going on every day in all sorts of interactions, it kind of changed my perspective. Magic, well kind of happens - all the time.<br><br>The other strange thing though is that you could see that whilst he was very good at starting relationships, it was a whole different set of skills to maintain those same relationships. Therein, was his downfall.<br><br>Most that I have spoken to about this don't want to believe that these sorts of things go on. I see the same disbelief in some of the comments here. Beware though, we are not all on a level playing field.<br><br>Interestingly enough too, I tend to avoid people who can start a relationship, but have difficulty with maintaining it. Sociopaths and just bad people fall into this category and are to be avoided. They can be superficially charming - at first anyway.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c3556571514601389560 title="comment permalink">9/30/11, 4:59 AM</a><br><br>

Traditionally we consider the survival impulses as the primary ones. But modern persons think of their thinking apparatus [at least that which is apparent to them - conscious thoughts] as a primary survival mechanism rather than an adjunct to the others. That is, we will think our way out this problem. It is somewhat glorified. Rationality is given top dog status and non-rationality is considered 'the problem'. <br><br>So for simplicity's sake I would say we are talking about the whole organism.<br><br>I'm not concerned with who or what created creation. Experiencing the divine is not the same thing as having a clue as to how the this whole thing came about. I prefer to not get too teleological.<br><br>We are the horse and the charioteer. But that is because we are modern persons living lives un-integrated with nature both culturally and psychologically. A split in consciousness has occurred which we define as our self [charioteer] and horse [body-instincts]. We fear nature because we fear ourselves. The wild is who we are and where we belong. Scary huh?<br><br>Notice that we describe a person or other creature as un-selfconscious when they are acting natural and unstilted. They are not self-absorbed in their self presentation or lost in their mental dialogue or monologue.<br><br>In a technical sense I would say that the problem arose when we changed our lifestyle from our original hunter-gather economic life. So to that extent we did start using our intellects in a different way and the consequences of that lead to a type of consciousness that over-valued self-consciousness. Or it could have just been that social restrictions made us monitor ourselves more closely and it became a habit of thought. <br><br>Was this inevitable? It happened. <br><br>Most modern people do not experience or even conceive of the possibility of being yourself without the add-on of self-consciousness. Excepting when they have fully surrendered to the moment at hand. And probably while fulfilling some primal instinct. smiley face<br><br>I think the question, 'how do we live knowing what we know' is a distraction in the sense that what we think we know [the eternal truths derived from thinking] leads us to false solutions.<br><br>Bet you are sorry you asked.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c9033669448359932631 title="comment permalink">9/30/11, 11:40 AM</a><br><br>

Some of his descriptions of the symbolic nature of money remind me of what you've been saying.

I know Buddhist thinking isn't your thing, but I wonder how well the practice described in the article matches your concept of "changing consciousness ...". If it does, is there something at least roughly equivalent in Western magic?<br><br>Which leads me to a fundamental question: what is consciousness? What is it we change when we "do magic"?

I always enjoy learning about different approaches to the challenge of changing consciousness. My experience has been that the key to changing your mind, and then your behaviors, is to really and truly understand how messed up your mind and behaviors have become. Once you’ve done that, there seem to be quite a few paths available to the individual to rebuild their mental framework and their behaviors. <br><br>For me, it turned out that I needed a major and quite painful mid-life crash before life was successful in getting my attention. I was down for the count for a while, and when I got back up I just couldn’t reboot my old ego, so I had to start fresh. I got onto a spiritual path that emphasizes awareness and quiet meditation and that helped me see and confront (gently) my bundle of thoughts/opinions/behaviors. That in turn brought me to an awareness of how I should simplify and rebalance my physical life. It was a quiet miracle in a way. <br><br>I’ve met a lot of friends and fellow travelers over the last few years; many stories of personal awakenings, which do lead to changes in behavior changes, but which seem to start out in some sort of pain or other.

This greatly distressed all his fellow monks, one of whom (Reginald of Piperno) finally persuaded him to say just a little about what had happened. What he told Reginald was roughly as follows: "After what I have seen, all my work seems to me to be just straw." (The Latin word is *palea*, also translated "chaff"). He died about three months after his experience.<br><br>Straw is what they used to put on the floors of college lecture rooms, among other public places. It collected all kinds of dirt, dropped food and drink, etc., and it soon became lousy with vermin. Eventually it was raked out and burned. <br><br>For one of the greatest masters of intellectual argument ever to call his own very impressive writings "straw" is quite a statement! Perhaps Thomas had had the sort of mystical vision that perceives a higher reality beyond all possible human words, speech and language. <br><br>If so, it would be entirely natural, afterwards, for him to despise all his own verbal efforts as mere "straw."

That each of our individual charioteers make what are for them "rational" decisions, which turn out to be disastrous for the whole. I know, those decisions might not be thought of as rational, from the bigger picture, but, then, rationality implies some sort of systematic decision-making process, and that always begins with defining and delimiting the scope of our inquiry.<br><br>We all love to beat up on the "science" of economics, and deservedly so, but it actually does a fair job of predicting how aggregations of people will behave (market behavior, anyway) using the model of "rational," self-maximizing individuals. Where it falls apart is in assuming these market activities can be predicted apart from resource constraints. And actually, truth be told, it has a pretty good short-term track record in predicting that people will often find market solutions to shortages. Have you caught the news in the last couple of days with respect to "rare earth" minerals? The market at work. It works like... you thought I was going to say "magic," didn't you... like, well, something really good, right up until it doesn't. Just giving the devil his due.<br><br>So getting back to the point I was trying to make in my first comment. Is it possible that listening to our horses every once in a while could be a good antidote to that "rationality" that, while maximizing the individual, is really bad for us all? And could this have something to do with ethics? I think maybe I'm getting at the same question as those arguing for the Higher Copilot in the chariot, but looking for the solution with what we already have, rather than supposing Plato must have meant something other than what he said. Not that I've actually read Plato, of course, so I'm figuratively talking out of a different orifice, if you catch my drift.

I remember it well.<br><br>Tatanka, glad to hear it. <br><br>Jagged, that accounts for the second half of the period I mentioned, not the first -- and there was quite a bit going on in the Muslim world along the magical lines I've outlined; you might consider the writings of the Brethren of Purity or Thabit ibn Qurra, just for starters. You're right to a certain degree, but there's more going on than that. <br><br>Cherokee, that's fascinating -- and it's interesting to see the confirmation of the standard magical teaching that it takes one kind of working to get somebody into bed with you, and quite another to establish a lasting relationship!<br><br>RainbowShadow, it makes plenty of sense, as long as you remember that we're a bunch of social primates rather than, say, the lords of creation. It's the delusion that we're the latter that makes it so hard for so many of us to make sense of our situation. <br><br>Evan, good luck. You can't do without the instinctual and the social dimensions of your mind, which are the two horses; try it, and all that happens is that you think you're walking, while your ability to manage your horses is sharply impaired. <br><br>Glory, actually, the Irish monks got most of their manuscripts either from Gaul or from the Monophysite church in Egypt; still, your broader point stands, of course. I didn't know that the Greek philosophers rate icons these days -- that's good to hear. <br><br>Maria, you're most welcome. Glad to hear it. <br><br>Zach, whether you start talking about magic with philosophy or end up there, it can't be avoided -- if you do the kind of magic I do, at least. <br><br>Ainslie, most of this blog is about magic in one way or another, but one result of that is that I have to cover a lot of very basic points. Yes, that may make for slow going for the initiated now and again. <br><br>Kevin, there's been quite a bit of work reconstructing Neoplatonist theurgy on an academic level; I don't happen to know of anyone who's actually doing the work just now, but it's a worthwhile project.

The point is that the patterns of behavior we share with them, when not recognized as such, drive quite a bit of dysfunctional thinking and action these days. As for the nature of consciousness, well, how many hours do you have to discuss the matter? <br><br>Deborah, I understand the relation between the human soul and the divine -- if you'd like to use those terms -- in a rather different manner than the one you and OR have proposed, but that's not really relevant to the project of this blog. <br><br>Bill, good! We'll be getting to that next week. <br><br>Yupped, heck of a question. Some people seem to be born with a drive to engage with these things; other people get there, as you did, as a result of painful experience; but even those who seem born to the work very often phrase their motives in terms of the painful nature of so much of human experience, or of specific experiences they've had. <br><br>Mirror, if it doesn't work for you, then by all means leave Aquinas to his astrology!<br><br>Roy, I've made it a rule to steer clear of the running quarrels between different Golden Dawn groups, and of the groups themselves, and so am not in a position to recommend one or another. I do strongly recommend getting a basic knowledge of the system on your own, before looking for a GD temple; it's very nearly the only way to be sure the people you're contacting know what they're talking about. <br><br>Richard, I don't; there are so many other useful philosophies to study that one specifically designed to provide a framework for Catholic doctrine is not going to interest anybody but Catholics. Have you taken a look at Aristotle directly? A great deal of Thomism is derived from Aristotle, of course, and Aristotle was a pagan by any definition. You might find his version worth comparing to Thomas'. <br><br>John, well, Idries Shah is entitled to his opinion. The alchemists I know think differently. <br><br>Hal, I've already noted that the wise charioteer pays attention to the perceptions of his horses, just as he recognizes their limitations. The issue I'm trying to raise, which I think you're missing, is that a great deal of the distortion of reason going on is a function of the unrecognized intrusion of nonrational material into supposedly rational discourse. Of course the charioteers think they're being rational; that's the point that the Neoplatonists made -- that much of what we think of as rational thinking isn't, and that it takes quite a bit of work to sort out the content of consciousness so that instinctive drives and social pressures (the other horse, which you and Vicky have been ignoring here) don't get confused with the ideas and opinions that so often veil them. <br><br>As for Matt's comments, er, Vicky engaged in blatant name-calling and used frankly insulting language, and I let her comment through.

I didn't know there were still druids around, much less an Arch one. I took a look, though, and over the last couple of years, I've developed a confidence in you that, to my mind at least, has to do more with clear thinking, clear writing and clear vision than with putting on robes and making signs in the air. I appreciate the impetus that led you to the ancients (who are actually us in a way that I grasp more and more forcefully the older I get), which, to express it succinctly if not completely, is that understanding the past is the primary key to understanding the present and to avoid (if possible) a heedless and fearsome rush into a future that none of us will like very much. <br><br>I have little to add to a discussion about magic. Except to say that though I do think it is real, for me at least, using the word itself to refer to a way to understand existence and how to affect it positively is more metaphorical than not.<br><br>What I can say without hesitation is that I stand amazed at one or more points every time I read one of your posts at your ability to cogently render ideas that urgently need to be considered and dealt with. <br><br>My wish for you is that you have more readers and that knowledge of you becomes more widespread. I do my small part by mentioning you and your blog (the only one I read regularly) to anyone who seems to be receptive to the notion of finding out what is really behind the uncertainty that lurks in the background of our lives, an uncertainty that seems more and more troubling than it ever was in any of my previous five or six decades.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c3520082162588754081 title="comment permalink">10/1/11, 7:47 AM</a><br><br>

In retrospect, I've realized that various events in life had been trying to get my attention for years, but I'd just been too fixated on other things to notice. Most of the fixations were the type of things that have caused such a lot of trouble for us all (getting, grabbing, consuming, coming and going, etc), and that we now need to wean ourselves from. If someone had sat me down at a young age and told me about how fear works, how the mind distracts itself from the fear and how these behavior patterns build and build, then I might have been able to become aware earlier. The absence of this type of understanding for young people in society may be a strong root of many of our problems.

I've seen depression self-admittedly <i>caused</i> by addiction to that way of being. You have to know how to gentle those horses. (People who don't like the horses should read <i>Symposium</i>. Thomas Taylor was a big guy for many romantics.)<br><br>It was when those romantic promises of freeing the horses failed that twentieth century philosophical nihilism really got underway, and that tagged the beginning of psychology, with Freud in particular. Jung is a magic-friendly rejoinder but Abraham Maslow, with his emphasis on gradually coming to a life of virtue with peak experiences of truth goodness and beauty, is even more Platonist.<br><br>As a result there's quite a bit of new method now to place alongside some older methods, not without some science behind it.

Guys, he has never hidden his conservative/apollonian slant, never said all the million mages he mentions did things his way, and states clearly "there are other ways of getting to the same place, some similar, some very different"; his master mage take is worth a read whether your own methods jibe or don't.<br><br>And I love that disctinction between the fake method and the real confrontation with the shadow.

Paragraphs 8-11, the Love Potion No. 9 discussion, explain much of my love-hate relationship with what’s now oxymoronically called Natural Horsemanship. Its followers all too often seek Harry Potter magic. Of course, so do many hard-nosed horsemen who blindly continue their quest for the ultimate clinic or the perfect bit. Few want to hear that even bare bones competency takes at least six months of study and true horsemanship takes years of observation, study, visualization, and meditation, as well as endless practice of forms. <br><br>As a result, truly horse-centric people almost invariably flip the horse/human metaphor to reflect the rationality of the horse's instincts and the destructive, potentially lethal instincts of the human. Seriously, would a rational being weighing 100-200 some pounds think it could pull a 500-2000 pound being to a stop by pulling on reins? Isn’t this especially irrational when the pulled-on being happens to be a prey animal given to understandable and often spectacularly powerful panic when in pain and believing itself to be restrained, trapped, and hence in danger of being eaten? <br><br>Thanks, also to Evan for the mention of Paul Shepard. I’ve ordered a book. <br><br>One last question of JMG. What did you mean when you said, “Andrew, if you ride a chariot, your horses are always going to appreciate their feed!” Does “ride” refer to a warrior behind the driver? Even if you meant “drive,” I don’t understand the connection to feed. <br><br>Considering all the horse/human comments on this thread, I can’t resist ending with my own: Never ask Mongols to lengthen their stirrups.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c3435587870936917438 title="comment permalink">10/1/11, 8:26 PM</a><br><br>

Sometimes I copy before I send - but this time, no.<br>I really wanted to hand on a recent reference to the historical development of heirarchical human societies. You have identified and attracted some of the 'better' strands in American society, and recognized many of 'our' antecedents back to classical times. Likewise you confront the expression of 'human versions of baboonery'. The latter can be seen to be not unrelated to heirarchical status, it seems?<br>QUOTE from this article http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0024683<br><br><i>"How did stratified societies—those with institutionalized inequality—spread and become the dominant form of societal organization during the Neolithic period?"</i><br><br>My question; what are the dynamics in latter day America? As well as the more obvious 'Institutions', and their assumptions, I personally wonder about high school experience, as well as tight birth-spacing and subsequent rearing of infants and the indelible experiences of sibling rivalry and mayhem down at the Playgroup. Don't know; though I have been thinking and looking for answers for a long time. I have long wondered at associated social divisons and social and health pathologies.<br><br>Again QUOTE: <i>"Empirical data on cultural transmission indicate that norms, values, social structures and other foundational features of culture tend to be transmitted conservatively and vertically within groups ... Counterintuitively, inequality (the presence of high-ranking cooperative individuals) promoted the evolution of cooperation by providing successful nodes around which other cooperators could cluster. ".</i> [Compare perhaps modern Sweden and their relatively recent (horrific) 17thC past.]<br><br>The relationsip with the resource base, however, appears complex [see the article] - but as an aside, 'baboon bevior' does not appear to have been our dominant species style during evolution and first 100K (?) years. There seem to have been extra priorities; our evolutionary position appears odd and in many ways different from not only other primates, but other mammals. Sexual di-morphism while still obvious is reduced. Human females are a-seasonal; in our evolutionary past and 'small bands' we evolved, perhaps precariously, 'colonial monogamy' (c.f. sea-bird colonies) and long term pair-bonding. We are also comparatively very long-lived having a post-reproductive phase, as well as a long childhood. (The latter seems to have shortened markedly in modern culture, though.)<br><br>As I say you have attracted many of the more 'sustainable' (?) strands of American culture, and your 'band' increasingly brings to the table many hopeful antecedents and understandings to hand on. Despite the 'baboonery' America is not 'one thing'?<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c6362946645946770464 title="comment permalink">10/2/11, 3:10 AM</a><br><br>

What we've found is certainly a bunch of people shunning the public school culture, but with a good degree of openness. Generally, the other parents are a diverse crowd: rebellious, artsy, sensitive, spiritual without being religious. Our daughter attends a couple of co-ops for day events, and takes courses and in organic farming, yoga/meditation and signing. So it's working out well and I wish we had thought of it earlier and for our other kids as well. <br><br>Nick, well depression is certainly a teacher. I can honestly say now that I'm really glad that I've been there. Although when I was deeply in it, the idea of it being a good thing just didn't compute. But then nothing did at that point. But it opened me up to a lot of new perspectives and fresh life. Mental entropy in action, or something, perhaps. Cutting back the garden so that something new can grow.

His book on their characteristics was based on a survey from one of the major survey organizations, maybe Pew.

This morning I was in the bath, looking down the hill through the trees at the frost in the valley below me. Nice.<br><br>Then into my mind out of nowhere popped this thought. <br><br>We have the wrong goal posts!<br><br>I better explain myself or you'll think I've gone loopy.<br><br>There is a concept I read about over the weekend in accounting which says, "what can be measured, can be managed". It started me thinking.<br><br>So, I'm thinking about businesses and all their KPI's (key performance indicators), goals, strategies and budgets. Then I start thinking about World of Warcraft. Yeah, the game. I'm serious here, hang with me. I've never felt inclined to play it, but I lost a couple of friends to it for a few years - you know who you are if you're reading this.<br><br>Now that game is rich in symbolism, story, challenge (without risk), social order and goals. I could never get my head around why they were addicted to it. It did seem to me like the challenge to achieve goals and status was a strong driver in the addiction. Fascinating stuff.<br><br>Anyway, I'm thinking back to businesses and the drive of people in them to achieve the goals of that particular business.<br><br>Then, I'm thinking about well, McMansions, boats, luxury cars - status symbols (or goals to achieve). These symbols are kind of lost on me. Oh well.<br><br>It all ended up with the thought as to what the goal of society is. The goal is growth. It's that simple, there really is no other reason. If I was a brutal realist, I'd also say that the only reason most of us exist is to reproduce. So, it's little wonder growth is such a strong driver.<br><br>Getting back to the measuring though. A large component of the metric for growth "gross domestic product", is consumption. Consumption can make up around 60%-70% of that number. It's hardly surprising that consumption is pushed, cheap and easy credit is pushed, investment in the tertiary market is pushed. What's great about it too, is that we rise to the challenge because it's an inbuilt driver! We feel bad when its in decline.<br><br>Wouldn't it be awesome, if we stopped measuring growth and started focusing on some other metric like what do we actually produce? It would be a pretty scary metric.<br><br>Anyway, I had a strange encounter with a neo liberal a couple of days ago who had all the fervor (and closed mind) of a fire and brimstone preacher. They worry me.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c3279861163700620900 title="comment permalink">10/3/11, 4:30 AM</a><br><br>

I've found the book an immensely valuable addition to my mental library. To massacre the premise, it's basically a study of the biopsychological foundations of epistemlogy -- i.e., how we know things, and the relation of that way of knowing to our biological and psychological development. The author is a research and clinical pscyhologist.<br><br>To use the author's terminology, most humans on the planet possess a 3rd-order consciousness, which one can analogize to "traditional" ways of knowing. A small minority are in the 4th order ("modern"), and a vanishingly small minority in the 5th order ("post-modern", or transcendental). The 3rd order is characterized by abstract thinking, while the 4th order subsumes abstractions to an overarching paradigm (or world-lens), and the 5th order transcends paradigms. I think of the 5th order as being almost Buddhistic, but that is probably inaccurate.<br><br>To cut to the chase, a lot of what gets talked about here (i.e., changing the culture) relies on people having at least a 4th-order degree of knowing, if not even a 5th-. People locked in the 3rd order simply cannot grasp it (and I don't mean this as a knock on them; it is a basic a biopsychological fact). Two solutions immediately propose themselves: help people develop their minds to the 4th order, and/or work to alter the 4th-order "group mind." Unfortunately, right now, a lot of very smart 4th-order people control our mass communications media, and have no interest in providing a moral/ethical group mind for the vast majority of Americans that still need one.<br><br>As an aside, this hypothesis of psychological development helps explain the Tea Party movement, the common complaint against which is that they don't even seem to understand their own self-interest. That is literally true. Most Tea Partiers (though not all), like most Americans, are locked in the throes of a 3rd-order way of knowing; i.e., someone else controls their paradigm. This someone(s) else also provide them the pscyhological stability the modern world does not, which keeps the situation attractive from their 3rd-order-minds-in-a-4th-order-world perspective.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c4152818695996103430 title="comment permalink">10/3/11, 8:41 AM</a><br><br>

Equally, shifts in ideas and understandings have a very broad range of effects on everyday life, so the history of thought is far from an ivory tower concern. A lone eccentric writing a book can set in motion a chain of events that a hundred years from now can topple governments and redefine the lives of millions -- think of Karl Marx as one example, and Lao Tsu as another. <br><br>Phil, it's risky to base arguments on human prehistory, since all we've got are currently fashionable speculative reconstructions of our prehistoric ancestors, and these have always been powerfully influenced by current cultural tropes and themes.

I read history of philosophy when I was in school and the Neoplatonists are definitely under-represented in the normal course of studies - or have no representation whatsoever. But it also seems that the Kabbalah is understudied in the history of philosophy, and its influence appears to have been profound. <br><br>I come from the Jewish tradition, and it wasn't until I started reading this blog that I began interpreting Kabbalah as a system of magical practice. Is that your interpretation as well? I would be curious if you came across anything in your past researches in the primary sources...it's not always clear to me if the kabbalistic library (Yetzira, Zohar, Tanya, meditation texts, etc.) understands itself a a system of magic. It would be interesting to know if there are works of Kabbalah that are explicitly practical manuals. <br><br>If so, clearly something beyond the p'shat (surface) reading of the Torah's words on sorcery is called for! - fortunately there are at least three higher levels of interpretation available.

The notion that growth is always good is very much a goal post in the wrong place. <br><br>Planner, there have been a lot of books recently making the claim, basically, that people's political views are a function of their mental or spiritual status, and of course the normal corollary is that anybody who disagrees with the author's politics is basically an Epsilon sub-moron while those who agree with him are obviously intelligent and spiritually advanced. (David Korten's <i>The Great Turning</i> is another example.) I find that entire line of argument specious -- and it also feeds the culture of vilification that's crippled our political system. "The reason you disagree is that you're only capable of third order thought!" is in no significant sense different from "the reason you disagree with me is because you've rejected Jesus!" Both make the believer feel a warm glow of self-righteousness, and make communication less possible than it would otherwise be. <br><br>William, I wouldn't tax your meat at all. You'd pay tax on land, water use, and any runoff from your ranch, but there'd be no sales tax on the meat -- it's a nonfinancial good -- and no income tax on your income, since it's earned by producing a nonfinancial good. All in all, you'd probably come out well ahead. <br><br>David, my background in Cabala is entirely in the version of it that was, er, borrowed by goyische occultists in the Renaissance and has been distinct from the Jewish tradition ever since. That's a magical system, no question, but the Jewish Kabbalists I know insist -- and I have no reason to doubt their word -- that the "kosher Kabbalah" is a very different kettle of fish from the Hermetic Cabala now practiced in traditions such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. You'd probably have to talk to some Jewish Kabbalists to get a meaningful answer to your question. <br><br>Scepticus, it's irrelevant. Certain kinds of magical work require some form of communications media, but they've proven just as functional with clay tablets and handprinted broadsheets as with the internet. <br><br>Ceworthe, let's see what we can do!<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c5366067184544786129 title="comment permalink">10/3/11, 2:16 PM</a><br><br>

'Magic' is a bit far out for me, but you never know...Do you know the discussion of 'magic' in R G Collingwood's The Principles of Art? I don't think it is a million miles from some of the things discussed here - though from a rather different viewpoint: that of a British idealist of the 20th century battling against the philosophy of his time. Collingwood thinks magic is very important in much of human life, but is keen to distance art from magic (and from craft and amusement, which he thinks are also confused with art). He thinks that confusing magic and art is a mistake - mainly because he is keen to get to the bottom of what 'art' is - but what he thinks 'magic' is comes out as an interesting by-product. Among other aspects he discusses the magic in bonding a football team and in medical cures. Anyway,combining 20th century British idealism with 21st century druidism would be an interesting project!

I was not trying to say the hypothesis discussed in the book relates to people's political viewpoints, but rather their <i>way of knowing.</i> It's entirely possible (to be flip) to be either a saint or an jerk at any "order" of consciousness. The orders are not predictive of political party, ideology, or worldview.

Collingwood is certainly right that art and magic are distinct -- related, but distinct; there were quite a few efforts to fuse them in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which consistently produced either second-rate art or second-rate magic, or (most often) both. I'll see if I can scare up Collingwood's book. <br><br>Planner, thanks for the clarification! I apologize for jumping to a conclusion; I've seen way too many efforts to use one or another misunderstanding of evolution to rate political viewpoints as more or less evolved, as a way of insisting that the other side can't possibly have reasons, including some valid ones, for the views they hold.

I have a lot of friends who would instantly accuse any talk of magic being utilitarian or rational as inherently irrational, but I'm usually able to gain some ground by dispelling its prevailing perception and working in some physical corollary to the mental control of will.<br><br>I sort of see personalities (individual or collective, constantly in interdependent motion yadda yadda) as a collection of wills... or contractually obliged intentions. So, your fundamental contracts of will are able to influence every act of choice down the line for better or worse. It simply becomes habitual, with occasional opportunities I refer to as "choice-points" which allow you to change out some of the machinery.<br><br>A lot of our less-than-optimal emergent behavior is because our fundamental contracts are bound up in less-than-optimal arrangements. So ritual magic -- to me -- seems like a process by which we can bypass a lot of the superficial layers above (that we are able to be conscious of) and call up another routine/program/contract that we desire on a much deeper level with a much more powerful cascade of effects. In this way, we are able to rewrite over a lot of our unconscious baggage.<br><br>Would you say that gels with your experience?

But an analogy to cancer would be wrong: debt is not a physical phenomenon but a mental construct, a bit like mass hypnosis or an evil spell. It is enough for everyone to declare "We won't pay" for the spell to be broken. But people who are slaves to their own unrealizable dreams cannot do that. Here, there is a huge and powerful industry devoted to keeping these dreams alive and setting people against each other, through fake journalism and advertising, through the lottery and other forms of gambling, even through game shows and so forth. A warped sense of fairness doesn't help either: many Americans would rather go hungry than live with the idea that somebody, somewhere, might get a free lunch." -D.

I haven't read Kegan's book so I won't comment directly on that, but I think it's a subject that needs more attention. While I'm hesistant to put modes of consciousness into that sort of a heirarchy, it's pretty clear that some ways are more functional or dysfunctional in certain situations.<br><br>In my experience, the majority of people do not look at the big picture, and spend their whole lives inside the bubble of their personal situations, without steeping back to look at the bigger picture. As someone who's always most easily thought in terms of the big picture, and understand the details of life as how they fit into the larger pattern, conversations with those who think in a more atomistic manner often end up going nowhere. This is true of practical matters as well as theoretical of philosophical, I always search for the overarching pattern while many others just learn details by rote and can't see how they relate to one another.<br><br>The question of how much of that can be changed through conscious effort is a matter about which I'm not sure. We all have things which come more easily to us, but can learn those that don't through effort. I have no natural aptitute in mechanical matters, but I can learn through practice, it just takes a lot longer than someone who's naturally mechanically inclined. In the same vein, I think those not naturally attuned to thinking in patterns and paradigms can learn to think that way at least to enough of an extent to understand the predicament of our society. That can only happen if they have the will to learn those things, as it's always easier to take the path of least resistence and stay within your own personal comfort zone of thinking.<br><br><br>P.S. I've made a couple minor revisions (but one is a correction of an important mistake) to my submission at <br>http://ozark-chinquapin.blogspot.com<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c2602377409174476834 title="comment permalink">10/4/11, 4:05 PM</a><br><br>

Of course the meditations and imagery are used in conjunction with the other therapy I am receiving and I would most certainly recommend consultation with appropriately trained care providers when choosing a course of treatment for your troubles, be they mental, physical, spiritual (or all three, as I suspect many troubles are). <br><br>Closer to the topic at hand, it occurs to me that this type of imagery/word therapy could be considered a form of magic - words and music and sound used with the express purpose of creating a change in consciousness for the listener. It isn’t a quick process, and different people (or the same person at different points on the journey) will respond to different types of healing meditations/imagery/etc, but there are a variety of things available. The Druids in the UK have created two albums of this type: the most recent one, Sacred Nature, was expressly designed to facilitate healing and sleep - both of which I am in much need of, and I have to say that I feel touched by something quite marvellous and ‘beyond the ordinary’ when I listen to the voices and the music. Perhaps it is the sense that I am listening to something that was created with magical intention. <br><br>In the hopes that this is of help to someone else, I humbly offer my personal experience for consideration … and I’m curious to know if the Archdruid would agree with my assessment of this type of work as ‘magical’ in nature.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c8919803939772046589 title="comment permalink">10/5/11, 7:10 PM</a><br><br>

The central thesis is that people's ways of knowing gradually grow more complex as they develop (age). The author categorizes children as having 1st-order consciousness (very much "in the moment": object impermenance). Toddlers and children up to around middle or even high school years are 2nd-order (they have object permanence, but aren't yet capable of abstract reasoning or really understanding that there are "other" people out there); in fact, if a child doesn't develop beyond 2nd-order, we would probably call them, as adults, sociopaths (the book contains many interesting examples of this). Finally, adults may be at either 3rd-, 4th-, or 5th-order, as I noted in a previous comment.<br><br>The author, a research and clinical psychologist, provides a great deal of evidence in support of his thesis. The book In Over Our Heads is his second on the topic.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c6491078155090006559 title="comment permalink">10/6/11, 6:42 AM</a><br><br>

The term Thaumaturgy piqued my interest, in a "Perdido Street Station"ish way.<br><br>John, you wrote: "A reworked and sanitized version of Neoplatonist theurgy found a home in Christianity, with the sacraments filling the role of theurgic rites, and stayed in use in some parts of the Western World until the Reformation and Counterreformation put paid to it. In its original form, the tradition went underground..."<br>Do you claim that the Protestant Reformation caused the Roman Catholic Church to abandon their traditional sacraments? Do you have a view on the present day traditional sacraments of the Eastern Orthodox Church, seeing as they shared these with the Papists until the great schizm and (so they claim) were not affected by the western Reformation.<br>The only Church ordinances instigated by Jesus of Nazareth are the Lord's Supper (bread and wine) and water baptism for disciples of Jesus in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. So I find your claim that the Christian church of the 5th century imported Neoplatonist theurgy to be at least possible, and if true, one good reason that the Reformation was necessary within Christianity.<br><br>It is interesting that such a course of events may be common knowledge amongst the educated pagan community, yet be the subject of strident denial by millennia of Papists.<br><br>Why do you think the supernatural is taboo in Western culture? Do you think this is a vestige of a time when the general populace claimed Christianity as their formal religion? If so, it seems at odds with the obvious acknowledgement of a supernatural realm implicit to the Judeo-Christian heritage and indeed the modern Orthodox Christian faith.<br><br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c1750019058422907253 title="comment permalink">10/13/15, 8:39 PM</a><br><br>

Augustine, for example, was known to be deeply influenced by Porphyry and Plotinus (who, it must be said, seemed to misunderstand the main thrust of neoplatonism, at least according to such great neoplatonist philosophers as Iamblichus and Proclus, though in a way that was convenient to the monotheizing tendencies of Christianity). I think that what JMG is saying is that the theurgical aspects of the sacraments were quietly dropped as part of the Counterreformation. Removing neoplatonism generally from Christianity would be nearly impossible at this point, since some variation of its precepts underlie nearly every theological assumption of that religion.<br><br><a href=preparation-for-philosophy.html#c8913763136949052530 title="comment permalink">10/14/15, 3:43 PM</a><br><br>
