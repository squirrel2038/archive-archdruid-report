The way avatar sizes were handled is a bit of a mess.

 - Each comment has an *original* full-size avatar image.  The Atom feed uses
   these images exclusively.  These images are typically non-square-shaped and
   are usually much larger than 35x35.

 - The Atom feed has width/height values that always(?) correspond to the size
   of the original image when rescaled to fit in a 32x32 box.  Exceptions I
   know of:

    - If a comment has the stock Blogger or OpenID avatar, then the feed avatar
      size is 16x16 instead.

    - Sometimes the feed size's largest dimension is only 30.

    - One avatar (comments from 2007/06 to 2007/11) had a feed size and HTML
      img size of (34, 6).  (Carpool Crew.)  The user doesn't appear to have
      commented after 2007/11.

    - There are many non-square feed avatars with a 33 width.

    - NOTE: The feed avatar width is *never* greater than 34, and the feed
      avatar height is *never* greater than 32.

 - Each comment sometimes also has a resized and/or cropped image
   (*thumbnail*).

 - The desktop site (for all comments) and the mobile site (for the first ~200
   comments) uses the *thumbnail* image if it exists and the *original*
   otherwise.

    - The desktop site's img tag has width/height properties that
      stretches the image to fit in under 35x35, in all but two comments:
       - img size (36, 27) : http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2006/11/solstice-2100.html?showComment=1165946460000#c116594646485106471
       - img size (36, 24) : http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2008/12/why-dissensus-matters.html?showComment=1229715240000#c3601999970574213501

    - The mobile site's img tag has a max-width style that rescales the image
      to 36px wide (and any appropriate height).  The height is then capped at
      36px in a parent div tag.  (There is a 1px border on all sides that tends
      to be cropped off.)  When the mobile site's image is tall and bigger than
      a thumbnail, the effect is to crop off the bottom.

    - The mobile site has a "Load More" button that uses the *original* avatar
      images from the Atom feed rather than thumbnails.

In the earlier comments, the *thumbnail* avatar was sometimes rescaled without
cropping and sometimes was center-cropped to a square.  Starting around late
2008, all avatars are center-cropped to a square.  These later comments
*always* have a thumbnail.

 - There are a few comments caught in the middle of the transition, where the
   avatar is stretched rather than rescaled.  The ones I noticed all happened
   on one page.  The HTML img size is 35x35 even though it uses a thumbnail img
   of varying ratios.

Without access to the cached HTML pages, it's mostly(?) good enough to simply
center-crop the feed avatar to a square.  It will badly fail on this one
comment by "The Dutchman" (https://draft.blogger.com/profile/15634052176803455348):

This avatar is two squarish photos of faces stacked vertically.

Finally, the desktop site has "Post a Comment" pages that display avatars.  In
these pages, the avatar appears to the right of the text.  Comments can be
collapsed and expanded, which may or may not hide the avatar.  The avatars
appear to be rescaled down to fit within a 60x60 box, with no cropping.

AFAIK, the blog never tries to provide hi-DPI avatar images, except by
accident (1) for the earlier comments, and (2) the "Load More Comments"
avatars.
