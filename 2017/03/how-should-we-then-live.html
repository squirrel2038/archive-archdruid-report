<div class=MsoNormal>
The philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, which we’ve been discussing for several weeks now, isn’t usually approached from the angle by which I’ve been approaching it—that is, as a way to talk about the gap between what we think we know about the world and what we actually know about it. The aspect of his work that usually gets all the publicity is the ethical dimension. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s understandable but it’s also unfortunate, because the ethical dimension of Schopenhauer’s philosophy is far and away the weakest part of it. It’s not going too far to say that once he started talking about ethics, Schopenhauer slipped on a banana peel dropped in his path by his own presuppositions, and fell flat on his nose. The banana peel in question is all the more embarrassing in that he spent much of the first half of <i>The World as Will and Representation</i> showing that you can’t make a certain kind of statement without spouting nonsense, and then turned around and based much of the second half on exactly that kind of statement. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s review the basic elements of Schopenhauer’s thinking. First, the only things we can experience are our own representations. There’s probably a real world out there—certainly that hypothesis explains the consistency of our representations with one another, and with those reported by (representations of) other people, with less handwaving than any other theory—but all the data we get from the world out there amounts to a thin trickle of sensory data, which we then assemble into representations of things using a set of prefab templates provided partly by our species’ evolutionary history and partly by habits we picked up in early childhood. How much those representations have to do with what’s actually out there is a really good question that’s probably insoluble in principle. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Second, if we pay attention to our experience, we encounter one thing that isn’t a representation—the will. You don’t experience the will, you encounter its effects, but everything you experience is given its framing and context by the will. Is it “your” will?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The thing you call “yourself” is a representation like any other; explore it using any of at least three toolkits—sustained introspection, logical analysis, and scientific experimentation—and you’ll find that what’s underneath the representation of a single self that chooses and wills is a bundle of blind forces, divergent and usually poorly coordinated, that get in each other’s way, interfere with each other’s actions, and produce the jumbled and self-defeating mess that by and large passes for ordinary human behavior. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Third, the point just made is difficult for us to accept because our culture prefers to think of the universe as consisting of mind and matter—more precisely, active, superior, personal mind and passive, inferior, impersonal matter. Schopenhauer pokes at both of these concepts and finds them wanting. What we call mind, from his perspective, is simply one of the more complex and less robust grades of will—it’s what happens when the will gets sufficiently tangled and bashed about that it picks up the habit of representing a world to itself, so that it can use that as a map to avoid the more obvious sources of pain. Matter is a phantom—an arbitrarily defined “stuff” we use to pretend that our representations really do exist out there in reality. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fourth, since the only things we encounter when we examine the world are representations, on the one hand, and will in its various modes on the other, we really don’t have any justification for claiming that anything else actually exists. Maybe there are all kinds of other things out there in the cosmos, but if all we actually encounter are will and representations, and a description of the cosmos as representation and will makes sense of everything we meet with in the course of life, why pile up unnecessary hypotheses just because our cultural habits of thought beg for them? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the world Schopenhauer presents to us is the world we encounter—provided that we do in fact pay attention to what we encounter, rather than insisting that our representations are realities and our culturally engrained habits of thought are more real than the things they’re supposed to explain. The difficulty, of course, is that imagining a universe of mind and matter allows us to pretend that our representations are objective realities and that thoughts about things are more real than the things themselves—and both of these dodges are essential to the claim, hammered into the cultural bedrock of contemporary industrial society, that we and we alone know the pure unvarnished truth about things. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From Schopenhauer’s perspective, that’s exactly what none of us can know. We can at best figure out that when this representation appears, that representation will usually follow, and work out formal models—we call these scientific theories—that allow us to predict, more or less, the sequence of representations that appear in certain contexts. We can’t even do that much reliably when things get complex enough; at that point we have to ditch the formal models and just go with narrative patterns, the way I’ve tried to do in discussing the ways that civilizations decline and fall. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice that this implies that the more general a statement is, the further removed it is from that thin trickle of sensory data on which the whole world of representations is based, and the more strictly subjective it is. That means, in turn, that any value judgment applied to existence as a whole must be utterly subjective, an expression of the point of view of the person making that judgment, rather than any kind of objective statement about existence itself. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s the banana peel on which Schopenhauer slipped, because having set up the vision of existence I’ve just described, he turned around and insisted that existence is objectively awful and the only valid response to it for anyone, anywhere, is to learn to nullify the will to live and, in due time, cease to be. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Is that one possible subjective response to the world in which we find ourselves? Of course, and some people seem to find it satisfying. Mind you, the number of them that actually go out of their way to cease existing is rather noticeably smaller than the number who find such notions pleasing in the abstract. Schopenhauer himself is a helpful example. Having insisted in print that all pleasure is simply a prelude to misery and an ascetic lifestyle ending in extinction is the only meaningful way to live, he proceeded to live to a ripe old age, indulging his taste for fine dining, music, theater, and the more than occasional harlot. I’m not sure how you’d translate “do what I say, not what I do” into classical Greek, but it would have made an appropriate epigraph for <i>The World as Will and Representation</i>.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course a failure to walk one’s talk is far from rare among intellectuals, especially those of ascetic leanings, and the contrast between Schopenhauer’s ideals and his actions doesn’t disprove the value of the more strictly epistemological part of his work. It does, however, point up an obvious contradiction in his thinking. Accept the basic assumptions of his philosophy, after all, and it follows that the value judgments we apply to the representations we encounter are just as much a product of our own minds as the representations themselves; they’re not objective qualities of the things we judge, even though we’re used to treating them that way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We treat them that way, in turn, because for the last two millennia or so it’s been standard for prophetic religious traditions to treat them that way. By “prophetic religious traditions” I mean those that were founded by individual persons—Gautama the Buddha, Jesus of Nazareth, Muhammad, and so on—or were reshaped in the image of such faiths, the way Judaism was reshaped in the image of the Zoroastrian religion after the Babylonian captivity. (As Raphael Patai pointed out in quite some detail a while back in his book <i>The Hebrew Goddess</i>, Judaism wasn’t monotheistic until the Jews picked up that habit from their Zoroastrian Persian liberators; quite a few other traits of post-Exilic Judaism, such as extensive dietary taboos, also have straightforward Zoroastrian origins.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A range of contrasts separate the prophetic religions from the older polytheist folk religions that they supplanted over most of the world, but one of the crucial points of difference is in value judgments concerning human behavior—or, as we tend to call them these days, moral judgments. The gods and goddesses of folk religions are by and large no more moral, or interested in morality, than the forces of nature they command and represent; some expect human beings to maintain certain specific customs—Zeus, for example, was held by the ancient Greeks to punish those who violated traditional rules of hospitality—but that was about it. The deities central to most prophetic religions, by contrast, are all about moral judgment. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The scale of the shift can be measured easily enough from the words “morals” and “ethics” themselves. It’s become popular of late to try to make each of these mean something different, but the only actual difference between them is that “morals” comes from Latin and “ethics” comes from Greek. Back in classical times, though, they had a shared meaning that isn’t the one given to them today. The Latin word <i>moralia</i> derives from <i>mores</i>, the Greek word <i>ethike</i> derives from <i>ethoi</i>, and <i>mores</i> and <i>ethoi</i>
both mean “customs” or “habits,” without the language of judgment associated with the modern words. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To grasp something of the difference, it’s enough to pick up a copy of Aristotle’s <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, by common consent the most important work of what we’d now call moral philosophy that came out of the ancient world. It’s not ethics or morals in any modern sense of the word; it’s a manual on how to achieve personal greatness, and it manages to discuss most of the territory now covered by ethics without ever stooping to the kind of moral denunciation that pervades ethical thought in our time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Exactly why religion and morality got so thoroughly conflated in the prophetic religions is an interesting historical question, and one that deserves more space than a fraction of one blog post can provide. The point I want to address here is the very difficult fit between the sharp limits on human knowledge and the sweeping presuppositions of moral knowledge that modern societies have inherited from the age of prophetic religions. If we don’t actually know anything but our representations, and can draw only tentative conclusions from them, do we really know enough to make sweeping generalizations about good and evil? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The prophetic religions themselves actually have a workable response to that challenge. Most of them freely admit that human beings don’t have the capacity to judge rightly between good and evil without help, and go on to argue that this is why everyone needs to follow the rules set down in scripture as interpreted by the religious specialists of their creed. Grant the claim that their scriptures were actually handed down from a superhumanly wise source, and it logically follows that obeying the moral rules included in the scriptures is a reasonable action. It’s the basic claim, of course, that’s generally the sticking point; since every prophetic religion has roughly the same evidence backing its claim to divine inspiration as every other, and their scriptures all contradict one another over important moral issues, it’s not exactly easy to draw straightforward conclusions from them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Their predicament is a good deal less complex, though, than that of people who’ve abandoned the prophetic religions of their immediate ancestors and still want to make sweeping pronouncements about moral goodness and evil. It’s here that the sly, wry, edgy voice of Friedrich Nietzsche becomes an unavoidable presence, because the heart of his philosophy was an exploration of what morality means once a society can no longer believe that its tribal taboos were handed down intact, and will be enforced via thunderbolt or eternal damnation, by the creator of the universe. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nietzsche’s philosophical writings are easy to misunderstand, and he very likely meant that to be the case. Where Schopenhauer proceeded step by step through a single idea in all its ramifications, showing that the insight at the core of his vision makes sense of the entire world of our experience, Nietzsche wrote in brief essays and aphorisms, detached from one another, dancing from theme to theme. He was less interested in convincing people than in making them think; each of the short passages that makes up his major philosophical works is meant to be read, pondered, and digested on its own. All in all, his books make excellent bathroom reading—and I suspect that Nietzsche himself would have been amused by that approach to his writings.. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The gravitational center around which Nietzsche’s various thought experiments orbited, though, was a challenge to the conventional habits of moral discourse in his time and ours. For those who believe in a single, omniscient divine lawgiver, it makes perfect sense to talk about morals in the way that most people in his time and ours do in fact talk about them—that is to say, as though there’s some set of moral rules that are clearly set out and incontrovertibly correct, and the task of the moral philosopher is to badger and bully his readers into doing what they know they ought to do anyway. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From any other perspective, on the other hand, that approach to talking about morals is frankly bizarre. It’s not just that every set of moral rules that claims to have been handed down by the creator of the universe contradicts every other such set, though of course this is true. It’s that every such set of rules has proven unsatisfactory when applied to human beings. The vast amount of unnecessary misery that’s resulted from historical Christianity’s stark terror of human sexuality is a case in point, though it’s far from the only example, and far from the worst. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yet, of course, most of us do talk about moral judgments as though we know what we’re talking about, and that’s where Nietszche comes in. Here’s his inimitable voice, from the preface to <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i>, launching a discussion of the point at issue: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Supposing truth to be a woman—what? Is the suspicion not well founded that all philosophers, when they have been dogmatists, have had little understanding of women? That the gruesome earnestness, the clumsy importunity with which they have hitherto been in the habit of approaching truth have been inept and improper means for winning a wench? Certainly she has not let herself be won—and today every kind of dogmatism stands sad and discouraged.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nietzsche elsewhere characterized moral philosophy as the use of bad logic to prop up inherited prejudices. The gibe’s a good one, and generally far more accurate than not, but again it’s easy to misunderstand. Nietzsche was not saying that morality is a waste of time and we all ought to run out and do whatever happens to come into our heads, from whatever source. He was saying that we don’t yet know the first thing about morality, because we’ve allowed bad logic and inherited prejudices to get in the way of asking the necessary questions—because we haven’t realized that we don’t yet have any clear idea of how to live. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To a very great extent, if I may insert a personal reflection here, this realization has been at the heart of this blog’s project since its beginning. The peak oil crisis that called <i>The Archdruid Report </i>into being came about because human beings have as yet no clear idea how to get along with the biosphere that supports all our lives; the broader theme that became the core of my essays here over the years, the decline and fall of industrial civilization, shows with painful clarity that human beings have as yet no clear idea how to deal with the normal and healthy cycles of historical change; the impending fall of the United States’ global empire demonstrates the same point on a more immediate and, to my American readers, more personal scale. Chase down any of the varied ramblings this blog has engaged in over the years, and you’ll find that most if not all of them have the same recognition at their heart: we don’t yet know how to live, and maybe we should get to work figuring that out. </div>

I’d like to wind up this week’s post with three announcements. First of all, I’m delighted to report that the latest issue of the deindustrial-SF quarterly <i>Into the Ruins</i><a href=https://intotheruins.com/issues/issue-4-winter-2017/ target=_blank> is now available</a>. Those of you who’ve read previous issues know that you’re in for a treat; those who haven’t—well, what are you waiting for? Those of my readers who bought a year’s subscription when <i>Into the Ruins</i> first launched last year should also keep in mind that it’s time to re-up, and help support one of the few venues for science fiction about the kind of futures we’re actually likely to get once the fantasy of perpetual progress drops out from under us and we have to start coping with the appalling mess that we’ve made of things.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
***</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Second, I’m equally delighted to announce that a book of mine that’s been out of print for some years is available again. <i>The Academy of the Sword</i> is the most elaborate manual of sword combat ever written; it was penned in the early seventeenth century by Gerard Thibault, one of the greatest European masters of the way of the sword, and published in 1630, and it bases its wickedly effective fencing techniques on Renaissance Pythagorean sacred geometry. I spent almost a decade translating it out of early modern French and finally got it into print in 2006, but the original publisher promptly sank under a flurry of problems that were partly financial and partly ethical. Now the publisher of my books <a href=http://us.karnacbooks.com/product/not-the-future-we-ordered-peak-oil-psychology-and-the-myth-of-progress/32927/ >Not the Future We Ordered</a> and <a href=http://us.karnacbooks.com/product/twilights-last-gleaming/34386/ >Twilight’s Last Gleaming</a> has brought it back into print in <a href=http://www.aeonbooks.co.uk/product/the-academy-of-the-sword/38721/ >an elegant new hardback edition</a>. New editions of my first two published books, <i>Paths of Wisdom </i>and <i>Circles of Power</i>, are under preparation with the same publisher as I write this, so it’s shaping up to be a pleasant spring for me. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div align=center class=MsoNormal style="text-align: center">
***</div>
Finally, this will be the last post of <i>The Archdruid Report</i> for a while. I have a very full schedule in the weeks immediately ahead, and several significant changes afoot in my life, and won’t be able to keep up the weekly pace of blog posts while those are happening. I’m also busily sorting through alternative platforms for future blogging and social media—while I’m grateful to Blogger for providing a free platform for my blogging efforts over the past eleven years, each recent upgrade has made it more awkward to use, and it’s probably time to head elsewhere. When I resume blogging, it will thus likely be on a different platform, and quite possibly with a different name and theme. I’ll post something here and on the other blog once things get settled. In the meantime, have a great spring, and keep asking the hard questions even when the talking heads insist they have all the answers.</div>

I think I’ve been following your blog every week since 2010, and it’s been quite a thrill ride. When I went back to grad school, your weekly posts became hot topics for me and my friends, argued over beer. But perhaps it is time for a new cycle and a new stage. As you recently noted, “collapse now and avoid the rush” is rapidly becoming an outdated slogan, as the rush has well and truly begun. Even if America’s dominant optimisms deny this in their rhetoric, most of the time they will have to affirm it in their own lives.<br><br>So, to this blog, which has weathered years of get-out-of-EROEI-cheap scams (remember biofuels?), blogosphere manias (remember near-term human extinction?), and constant denial of the problems we face, here’s to a job well done! You have ended it on possibly the most crucial note of them all: if all our intellectual and ethical scruples are only post-hoc rationalizations spun into existence by old religious imperatives, where do our behaviors really come from, and what should we really be searching for?<br><br>It was here in Japan that I first learned that there was once a word called “<a href=../../2017/02/a-muddle-of-mind-and-matter.html#c5015834144925291169 rel=nofollow>voluntarism</a>” in English and that it was not only the property of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche but was a widely held philosophical position, even among our Puritan ancestors. Japanese academics, unlike English speakers, still use this word, so I can have some fun with them by describing how bewildered American intellectuals are by the reappearance of the will in the political sphere. Our idiocy, in forgetting about the power of the will, stretches back 100, perhaps 200 years, so that even the cleverest American intellectuals of 2016 had forgot what they had forgotten.<br><br>But in Japan, despite the general awareness of the will at a personal level, there is still the same difficulty in acknowledging it and coping with it intellectually that Nietzsche describes. As in every nation, nearly all of those Japanese who claim to have figured out life are rather demanding a different life from the one actually granted to us. Only the country’s greatest thinkers have attempted this most difficult of integrations. So, to readers out there who want to accomplish great things during this blog’s hiatus, I recommend you seek out those great integrative thinkers in your own native literatures, and try to read them. And JMG, have a good break, and thank you for many great years!<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c9051177218659804759 title="comment permalink">3/8/17, 3:13 PM</a><br><br>

We make up these strings of syllables and assign them meanings that make sense to us, but if others don’t grasp their meaning in the same way they fail. I find I am not at all sure of the differences between mind, consciousness, soul and will. To me will seems more like a verb than a noun, more of an energy flow or force than an object, but I cannot turn that distinction into much of meaning here. I can look at synonyms for will, but that helps little. Note that I do not mean to imply you aren’t doing a good job, it just that words are such poor tools.<br><br>I confess that I cannot quite grasp a disembodied will – who’s will? It cannot be my mind’s will if the mind is a manifestation of will. Especially so if “my” is but a useful representation. The words end up chasing each other in circles until they collapse in a lump, and I begin to think about beer. <br><br>I believe that some core portion of what we are is immortal and exists outside of this plane or universe, but I’m much foggier on what that portion is let alone what to call it. Soul or perhaps Will could work fine I suppose. I’ll try to follow alone gamely and hope some comprehension comes through. <br><br>Please keep us informed of where and how you will be posting in the future - I'm sure you could use a bit to time to regroup, as I cannot imagine how you've kept up the pace for this long!<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c8660713790481578524 title="comment permalink">3/8/17, 4:57 PM</a><br><br>

A metaphor here about life itself? For my last comment on this intricate thread of thought spun since the blog began, let me quote a man who shared some of Schopenhauer's ideas but took them in an opposite direction, and was thereby empowered to lead an exemplary life.<br><br>"The volition which is given in our will-to-live reaches beyond our knowledge of the world. What is decisive for our life-view is not our knowledge of the world but the certainty of the volition which is given in our will-to-live. The eternal spirit meets us in nature as mysterious creative power. In our will-to-live we experience it within us as volition which is both world- and life-affirming. ...The simple world- and life-affirmation which is within me just because I am will-to-live has, therefore, no need to enter into controversy with itself, if my will-to-live learns to think and yet does not understand the meaning of the world. In spite of the negative results of knowledge, I have to hold fast to world- and life-affirmation and deepen it. My life carries its own meaning in itself. This meaning lies in my living out the highest idea which shows itself in my will-to-live, the idea of reverence for life." Albert Schweitzer, "Philosophy of Civilization"<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c997332173178878202 title="comment permalink">3/8/17, 5:40 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you and may the blessings of whatever gods you pray to be unguent upon your soul.<br><br>Before you go though, do you have any advice for me regarding Spengler's Decline of the West? I ordered the volumes through interlibrary loan and have just managed to get through the 40 page introduction in time to send it back to the musty shelf it came from. Perhaps it's the translation, but it feels like having my head stuck in a barrel of wet oatmeal... and yet, I have gotten a few genuinely huge ideas out of it already. Notably: the cyclical nature of the history of cultures, the impossibility of REALLY understanding a culture other than one's own and the apparent inevitability of cultures that develop 'civilization' to proceed through an increasingly materialistic imperialism, quickly followed by decline and ultimately demise. So tell me, please, is there more there? Enough to make it worth slogging through the writing? (as an aside, are you following the fairly recent findings confirming their own stories, that the Australian Aboriginal people have resided, essentially in their pre-contact locations, without migrations or even much mixing with related, nearby groups, for upwards of 50,000 years? Their culture never developed agriculture as we define it, though, of course they DID 'manage' the landscape through fire and doubtlessly other, lesser known methods. It's an interesting anomaly in the culture-civilization-replacement theme) Best wishes, and thanks for the fine writing!<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c8983713961710244097 title="comment permalink">3/8/17, 7:17 PM</a><br><br>

I hope you enjoy a pleasant and productive hiatus in the meanwhile. <br><br>The ADR is the first blog - or material of any kind, for that matter - that awoke me to the true historical situation of industrial civilization in general, and that of the United States as the currently collapsing global empire in particular. I've seldom missed an installment since I started reading it in 2008. Until then I was a firm believer in a Star Trek future in all its metastatic and imaginary inevitability. I don't know when, if ever, I would have noticed what has actually been going on otherwise. <br><br>A big factor in the blog's persuasiveness, to me at any rate, is your patient way of explaining things, and your insistence on maintaining civil discourse. You're the only blogger I know of who in the thick of discussion *never* sinks to name-calling, no matter how annoying or clueless your interlocutor. I consider this important. <br><br>How indeed should we live? I myself have hardly the foggiest of notions, even as applies just to myself.

Will you keep up the Well of Galabes?<br><br>Your blogs have benefitted me hugely. During the last 11 years, I have turned aside from rational materialism, acquired a perspective that allows me more equanimity (a real need for me), and my first big lesson I kept from your blog is "Many stories bring life, with no stories you can manage, one story brings death". I am cultivating a non-dogmatic spiritual life. I discovered Implicit Learning by way of your recommendation of Polanyi's "The Tacit Dimension", which in turn led me to discover a vast well of toxic sludge from my deep past that has taken me 4 years to even begin to figure out how to grapple with... I have discovered that classic (and some not-so-classic) literature is a resource I can use to help myself in a way that I never could previously. I made it a point to study some systems theory and put that under my hat. I could go on... <br><br>BTW, I just noticed that your archives only go back to Oct 2006, they used to go back to May, 2006.

It has come to mean a lot to me over the years, and has led to some big changes in my life. A little story about how I found my way to your blog - around ten years ago I had just returned from a trip to West Africa studying drumming, wasn't really thinking very much at all of global affairs, sitting in front of the computer one day when the words 'peak oil' appeared in my mind. As far as I remember, this was the first I'd heard of it (of course there are other possible explanations for how this occurred!). A quick visit to google led me to Matt Savinar and Life After the Oil Crash, and eventually to your blog. Since then, I moved with my family from the west coast of British Columbia to a small farming community in Ontario near the St. Lawrence river (not far from the Lakeland Republic), gave up my day job to pursue homesteading and the home economy, took up organic gardening, food preserving and raising poultry, and joined the local church community (perhaps the hardest change for me!). This just barely scratches the surface of what needs to be done, of course, and the question of 'how then, should we live?' is only beginning to be explored. Although I am rather selfishly hoping your return to the blogosphere is sooner rather than later, I also know you have given us so much over this past decade that I could start working on. Anyhow, I just wanted you to know that you have had a big impact on this particular reader.<br><br>All the best with your life changes!<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c5055576667799820952 title="comment permalink">3/9/17, 5:25 AM</a><br><br>

Unlike some posters here, I'm not of the opinion that you're gonna permanently disappear (seems they didn't really read what you said thoroughly enough). I'll be glad when you're back though, in whatever format you find comfortable. It seems from the outside perspective like things really started to get out of hand for you when you began writing about contemporary politics, as that's when the comments started to reliably get over 200 per week. I remember back in the good old days when you'd get sixty four comments and back arguments would be slapped down before fifty. It's kind of astonishing in retrospect that a blog this idiosyncratic has taken off to such stratospheric heights. I have noticed as well that nowadays you seem to be selling a bit more books than back in 2008, although I'm not aware of the underlying economic meaning of that considering how many people use Amazon.<br><br>These philosophical posts have been a breath of fresh air after all the political posts. I remember back in the day I thought there might be a meaningful political response to the Long Descent, and I'd always be shaking in my chair thinking, "but when is he gonna post about something that will actually accomplish something, i.e., politics!" Now that I see what the attempted pseudo solution is going to be in the political realm I think I'd better duck and cover. I used to think it was sad that most generic people weren't into politics, now that politics is fashionable I think it was better off left to the policy wonks and real geeks. I ordered the first volume of Schopenhauer and I can see that it is a magnificent tome, probably will bore me to tears, and I'm the kind of guy who will slog through almost anything. The worldview that he espouses epistemologically is so simple and so elegant and so vital that I couldn't resist giving him a try.<br><br>I hope things are going well in your personal life, I've always kept in mind that you're a human being, not just a brain in a jar that spits out essays, and it would be sad to me to see you take any kind of hit after all you've provided for us.<br><br>When you come back, I'll be there, and I hope you elaborate more on this series of posts because I feel you've just scratched the surface.<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c2346145741401006895 title="comment permalink">3/9/17, 5:39 AM</a><br><br>

And so here is but one of many brilliant bits, that I quote here as an important flashback regarding our boom bust leave em in the dust upward climb to nowhere : <br><br>Oct 5, 2006 courtesy of the illustrious JMG :<br><br>"Plausible as these claims are, I suspect they’re missing the core of the situation, as well as the lessons taught by twenty years of violent economic gyrations. It’s a mistake to expect hallucinations to obey the laws of gravity. It’s doubly a mistake when the institutions charged with keeping them in midair – the Federal Reserve Board in the US and its equivalents elsewhere – have proven tolerably adept at manipulating markets, flooding the economy with cheap credit (that is, more IOUs) to minimize the effects of a crash, and inflating some other sector of the economy to take up the slack of a deflating bubble. It’s triply a mistake when the American middle class and, to a lesser extent, its equivalents in other industrial countries display a faith in speculation so invulnerable to mere reality that their response to a crash in one market is invariably to go looking for a new speculative bubble somewhere else.<br><br>To say that the economic empire of hallucinated wealth will continue to exist, though, does not imply that it will continue to produce the goods and services and provide the jobs that people need. Arguably, it doesn’t do that very well now. The “jobless recovery” of recent years saw most economic statistics rise well into positive territory, while most people saw their expenses rise and their income shrink when their jobs didn’t simply fold out from under them. Things could go much further in the same direction. It requires no particular suspension of disbelief to imagine a situation where the stock market hits new heights daily and other measures of economic activity remain in positive territory, while most of the population is starving in the streets."<br><br>It's 2017 and many of us have still not recovered from the last bust as we hurtle toward the next. While my 1%er type acquaintances revel in their new and even bigger piles of illusory wealth, they continue to fail to see that this boom bust upward redistribution of assets cannot go on as an infinitely repeated loop before their aren't enough left of the little people left that will stand to be bled without some sort of retribution.<br><br>You can look back at the early posts on peak oil, renewables, and transitional economics that points to the same boom bust phenomenon, with bits of technological progress thrown in along the way to temporarily make the worries go away. But these "fixes" such as hydraulic fracking may briefly correct prices lower, they only further reduce the understanding that a non-infinite source is being depleted, and we aren't far enough along realizing the true cost of replacing this source. And I wonder who that costs falls on? Oh, you can assure yourself at first it wont be the top of the food chain. But keep this fiction going long enough, and see how it turns out. The tough thing for me to grasp is that I probably won't live long enough to see the outcomes that we have baked into the cake. Maybe it is better that way. <br><br>Good luck to us all. WASS. <br><br>Thanks again JMG!<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c8764340556908942171 title="comment permalink">3/9/17, 6:22 AM</a><br><br>

While I wait, I’ll do my best to catch up, reflect, and get ready for the next round of lessons wherever they may lead.<br><br>As for this week's discussion: I spent this week finally working through A Guide For the Perplexed. I had naively expected it to be a fast afternoon read and instead found myself constantly having to read in spurts with ample time for digesting and reflecting. Even when I agreed I was spurred to deep thought on the themes, and when I disagreed (especially in those places where my disagreement was accompanied by strong emotional reactions), I found that I had to do a lot of hard introspection and examination of my own presuppositions to find out why I felt the way I did. It's been a long time since I have encountered a challenging landmark read like that.<br><br>I found it interesting, re-reading your discussion of Schopenhauer (who I’ll tackle soon enough I’m sure), how much of a balance he was for some of Schumacher’s weaker points. And reading your analysis of Schopenhauer’s shortcomings I am seeing that the same functions very well in reverse as well. The two very much counterbalance each other. One of my biggest struggles with Schumacher were some of his false binaries and unexamined assumptions rooted in his own Christianity. For instance, in his cosmogony (which to my complete and utter delight was drawn pretty much verbatim from the Western Mystery Tradition), he makes the assumption that, due to their apparent behavior, stones exist purely as inanimate matter with no “inner life” of their own. The only alternative he leaves to this hierarchy that makes Man the crown of creation is a materialist disenchantment of the world (not leaving much discussion open for approaches such as, say, traditional animism, in which stones exist on all five levels of being just like people and our inability to slow down to their level to talk to them is our failure rather than theirs). He also draws a false binary between classical monotheism and secular materialism (which he then lumps in with religious pluralism in his claim that devotional piety towards many gods is the same thing as consumerist idolatry), when he says that "when there are many gods [...] and no supreme god, good, or value in terms of which everything else needs to justify itself, society cannot but drift into chaos."<br><br>Much of his philosophy on this level falls apart from not only under the scrutiny you place in it through study of philosophers like Schopenhauer, but under his own idea of the four levels of knowledge in which the broad ontological assumptions he makes about God and his necessary place in any humane order are assumptions made on the fourth tier of knowledge and are therefore derivative, rather than foundational (which means that someone can go through that same progression from self knowledge through social knowledge, through the establishment of a working representation of the outer world and come to quite different conclusions about the nature of things without lacking in adequacy towards them).<br><br>However, his concept of the four levels of knowledge provide a perfect path out of the nihilism of Schopenhauer and Nietzche, suggesting that while a completely true representation of the “thing in itself” may be impossible to achieve, a functional knowedge of the world we inhabit can be arrived at through a path that leads from self-knowledge to social knowledge and ultimately to knowledge of “higher things.” With a recognition that all things other than that initial Will (which would be Tier 1 on his progression of knowledge), are divergent. I’m not sure if you’re going to be finishing this philosophy series or not, but a synthesis of those two ideas: Schopenhauer as a check to some of Schumacher’s Christian presuppositions, and Schumacher as a path away from Schopenhauer’s nihilism (which is a result of losing oneself in Field 1 and not being able to make it from there to Field 3 of knowledge) seems like a natural eventual progression of this discussion.<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c2724201152084052674 title="comment permalink">3/9/17, 6:56 AM</a><br><br>

I'll miss your posts here but hope to find you back again in the not-too-distant future.<br><br>One statement did give me pause: "[B]ut all the data we get from the world out there amounts to a thin trickle of sensory data, which we then assemble into representations of things using a set of prefab templates provided partly by our species’ evolutionary history and partly by habits we picked up in early childhood. How much those representations have to do with what’s actually out there is a really good question that’s probably insoluble in principle."<br><br>Perhaps insoluble in principle, but nevertheless must be dealt with in practice. I'm quite certain that there's a pretty decent correspondence between our representations of the "outside" world and our representations of it. Otherwise... evolution, you know. Without at least a working correspondence, we wouldn't be here. And, yes, I know that even the concept of evolution is a bit filmy, but it's a concept that seems to work well in practice.<br><br>As you say, "Notice that this implies that the more general a statement is, the further removed it is from that thin trickle of sensory data on which the whole world of representations is based, and the more strictly subjective it is." This being the case, the ancient meanings of the words "morality" and "ethics" (akin to the modern word "customs") are probably more appropriate than the modern meanings. But ethics/morality (in the sense of "customs") are still important. Humans are a social species, and societies are also subject to evolutionary pressures. Successful societies are those that have developed customs that have proven effective: they have enabled the members of the society to survive, thrive, and reproduce.<br><br>Which is all well and good until cultures clash. The U.S. is a prime example of what happens. During good times, cultural diversity is fine: everyone's partying! When times get tough and people have to pull together to forge ahead, though, different cultural norms make it difficult to agree on a direction, and then things start to get ugly. People forget (or never realized) that their different social mores are really just a collection of strategies that enabled their particular social group to compete successfully, and begin to cast these differences in moralistic (in the modern sense) terms. And so it begins... It would take a pretty sick person to call the result "living the good life".<br><br>Thanks for all you good efforts here JMG. I look forward to your return at some future date.<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c3204516880508322260 title="comment permalink">3/9/17, 7:49 AM</a><br><br>

Rather than assuming their truculence derives from ignorance about philosophy you could have just as fairly assumed they are well educated and informed and simply have historically justifiable confidence in science — as in fact Schopenhauer himself did: <br><br>“Philosophy…is a science and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.” Parerga &amp; Paralipomena, vol. I, p. 106., trans. E.F.J. Payne. (Arthur Schopenhauer Wikipedia page) <br>and<br>“This actual world of what is knowable, in which we are and which is in us, remains both the material and the limit of our consideration.” World as Will and Representation, vol. I, p. 273, trans. E.F.J. Payne. (Arthur Schopenhauer Wikipedia page)<br><br>Assuming Tyson, et.al., are even aware of Schopenhauer’s writings it is more than likely they just don’t find Schopenhauer’s concept of “will” useful or even intellectually interesting. When trying to make sense of the universe it is not philosophy but empirical, analytical science that provides the best tools for describing and understanding this actual world in which we live. <br><br>Like innumerable other once fashionable ideas Schopenhauer’s will had it’s day on the stage but quickly faded as serious thinkers examined it closely and found there was little there, there.<br><br>But what little there is there appears to be more than enough for some to belligerently claim that Schopenhauer’s Will is the gateway to the power of a universe beyond rational understanding. You cannot see it, touch it, measure it, or in any rational way understand or describe it, but with the right combination of spells or rituals and of course, will, you too can become a superhero. <br>LLP<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c6748123114283103669 title="comment permalink">3/9/17, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

(Nietschze himself was fond of the 17th century French sages such as La Rochefoucauld who brought the aphoristic style to a pinnacle).<br><br>It's interesting that Schopenhauer considers his essay a contribution to eudemonology, or "the art getting through life as pleasantly and successfully as possible" (not the study of good demons (ha!). What he says after this is an apology for his writing such an essay in the first place because it does not gibe with his chief work (WWR):<br><br>"Now whether human life does or ever can correspond to the conception of such an existence [i.e. in accordance with eudemonology, also the focus of Aristotle's ethics], is a question that, as we know, is answered in the negative by my philosophy...Now this is based on the inborn error which is censured by me in the forty-ninth chapter of the second volume of my chief work. However, to be able to work out such an answer, I have therefor had to abandon entirely the higher metaphysical ethical standpoint to which my real philosophy leads. Consequently, the whole discussion here to be given rests to a certain extent on a compromise, in so far as it remains at the ordinary empirical standpoint and firmly maintains the error thereof [313, P&amp;P, vol.I, trans.

Nor is it necessary if one believes in a divine unity to think that the divine being has supplied some people somewhere with a linguistically expressed set of rules that they otherwise would not know, nor that such rules are in any way arbitrary. <br>Rather, the basic ethic flows naturally from the state of existence itself, and that ethic is most simply defined as the golden rule. So far as I know, most all religions and probably (but I'm not sure) most pagan systems understand it, although it appears Islam may lack it.<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c2425830627680972720 title="comment permalink">3/9/17, 6:02 PM</a><br><br>

How much those representations have to do with what’s actually out there is a really good question that’s probably insoluble in principle... <br>", nicely complemented by Helix: “Perhaps insoluble in principle, but nevertheless must be dealt with in practice. I'm quite certain that there's a pretty decent correspondence between our representations of the "outside" world and our representations of it…Without at least a working correspondence, we wouldn't be here.” <br> Best wishes to you and Sara for your life transition and looking forward to finding you on your next blog. <br><br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c179365311603285354 title="comment permalink">3/10/17, 1:25 AM</a><br><br>

Then in early March, temperatures fell into the upper teens. The last few days have been back into the low 70s, and now it appears we will be getting a nor'easter early next week, with the risk of significant snow, but surely more severe cold.<br><br>It has been a project of mine to reforest a 40 acre patch of land with tired soils. The trees that I have planted and tended these last 20 years -- they are dazed and confused. Some will not survive this craziness. It is very sobering. It is not like we didn't know this was coming. For me, it really hammers home your final comment this week: "we don't yet know how to live."<br><br>That really is the issue, isn't it? And that comment works on all scales: we don't know how to live individually, or on the scale of communities, or on the scale of countries, nor on the scale of all of humanity. I feel I need to think about this long and hard. Perhaps re-read many of your writings.<br><br>I will add my voice to the chorus thanking you for your efforts. As I watch almost everything around me fly apart with increasing force, I would be in a panic, except I remind myself that I knew this was coming. Thanks to you.<br><br>On a personal note, I happen to be pretty good at dealing with these tools we call "computers". An odd term, "computer", when you think back to its origins, LOL! As with any tool, they have their uses. But when I see people using them as hammers, when they need a screwdriver instead -- I cringe. Back in another life, my boss used to introduce me to visitors: "Meet our resident Luddite. Oh, and he also runs our supercomputer center." Well, to get to the point, I am physically close to Cumberland, and there is a small possibility that I may be able to help you to some extent with your attempt to make the best use of these tools for your purposes. I have no way to know if my talents would mesh with your needs, however. If you want to pursue that possibility, you would need to let me know somehow.<br><br>I wish you all the best for however things work out for you! I selfishly hope that you return to writing your columns sooner rather than later. But in Academia there is a long standing tradition called the"sabbatical".

In this case, when you state, "...every set of moral rules that claims to have been handed down by the creator of the universe contradicts every other such set..."<br><br>Perhaps you are not claiming that such a set of rules does not exist, but I got that impression. I would disagree that one doesn't exist. I think C.S. Lewis does a great job of elucidating this idea when he talks about the universal "natural law" (i.e. moral law). I won't try to match his eloquence on the subject, except to say that he makes a strong case that such a set of moral rules does objectively exist. I am persuaded by his argument. <br><br>I grant that there are contradictions around the edges of these (claimed) sets of rules, both between religions and even within the religions themselves, but I would argue that there is a core that is essentially the same. I also grant that the only way we can know about a set of moral rules is through representations, but that does not rule out the existence of one, and I am persuaded by Lewis's argument that such a set objectively exists. <br><br>His argument also explains the reasons why, as you say, "every such set of rules has proven unsatisfactory when applied to human beings." (Which, by the way, is very nearly the crux of his point made in Mere Christianity, because (hint) it has more to do with the human beings than with the rules.) I confess I would love to witness a discussion between you and C. S. Lewis on this topic, if such an occasion were possible!<br><br>On another note, thanks for raising all these important topics over the years.

The first part is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzwfs3DjSJg&amp;list=PLA7E2840B724C6695 and for a good while the rest was available only in audio form for purchase on Google Play, but it seems it's back up now. Despite the video feed of Ebert talking it's really an audio-only affair, so perfect for listening while doing work that allows for it, etc.<br><br>For what it's worth, the first time I tried reading Spengler, I stumbled with a translation of the abridged edition. It felt disjointed and rambling and I never got very far. Later on, having listened through all of Ebert's series, I shelled out a fair bit of cash for the two-volume edition, and made my way through it fairly slowly but without too much effort and enjoying it immensely. <br><br>I've not read it in English translation, mind, but I imagine the it's pretty good.<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c3817008009128864037 title="comment permalink">3/10/17, 6:38 AM</a><br><br>

Sorprisingly Schopenhauer says exactly the opposite. According to him, existence is pain, but i think maybe this is a cultural way of thinking. Indeed, old myths and religions praice life, existence, preservation and continuation (by the next generation). Also, in most human history, dead and extintion were part of everybody experince.

You have been a help to easily thousands of us. <br><br>Your work on Schopenhauer got me thinking about things. I was accordingly hoping firstly somehow to make some philosophical postings this spring at <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a>, and secondly to remark on those postings here at TADR. Now, however, while the first part of my plan continues to seem feasible, the second part seems to fall away. <br><br>With a view to the impending regrettable closure of TADR, I will today post three quick-and-sloppy philosophical fragments to TADR, as a sort of going-away present for you. The fragments are compressed formulations of my thoughts, composed in haste this winter for a professional philosopher a little to the south of me. (Whereas I am north of the current Canada-USA frontier, this professional lives to its south.) <br><br>In writing my thoughts up for more general public consumption, as opposed to my friend in professional philosophy south of the Niagara frontier checkpoints, I would have to expand them by a factor of perhaps four or five or so. <br><br>It would be best to read these fragments on their own, not trying to compare them with other writings. One in general discourages the question, "Is this fragment in agreement with, or in opposition to, Schopenhauer?" <br><br>I do, however, remark in a mildly cautionary spirit, without here making a concrete reference to Schopenhauer, that what dead Germans write does not always in all cases necessarily rise to the dignity of error. It is a bit like what some ancient Athenian said about Plato's Theory of Forms: it's not that it's true; it's not that it's false: it does not in fact succeed in having a meaning - being in this regard akin not to ordinary human marketplace discourse but, rather (this Athenian said), to the whistling noises made by birds. (So, I mean, when some dead German says "The Veldtsvelte is a Schauspiel of Vorschnizel" - I'm making this German up, as Charlie Chaplin does in "The Great Dictator" - the appropriate response is not to protest, indignantly, "It is FALSE that the Veldtsvelte is a Schauspiel of Vorschnizel," but to say, rather, "That particular professorial utterance was neither true nor false, as the sparrow's chirp is neither true nor false.") <br><br>When (two or three weeks from now?) I start my hoped-for springtime philosophical postings over at <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a>, I hope to signal the start of my series clearly - perhaps with a polite Open Letter to a nice dead mediaeval philosopher, or perhaps in some other equally clear way. What is posted at the blog so far (this week, a polite Open Letter to my presumed FSB or SVR case officer) is, alas, itself unconnected with philosophy. <br><br><br><br>Hastily, sadly,<br>about now to try posting my three quick-and-sloppy fragments to TADR<br>as a kind of going-away present for you, <br><br>Tom = Toomas Karmo (near Toronto) <br><br><a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.ca/</a><br><br>Toomas(dot)Karmo(at)gmail(dot)com<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c8415397898722271138 title="comment permalink">3/10/17, 12:44 PM</a><br><br>

In my view, moral prescriptions (and proscriptions) have a very simple basis that is easily understood. The basis of morals only appears self-contradictory and complex when it is overlaid with religion and the supernatural--when morals are presumed to have religious/supernatural origins. <br><br>I also tend to (maybe mistakenly) make a distinction between morals and ethics. I tend to think of morals as governing the personal life and ethics as governing the affairs of business and commerce. <br><br>Morals and ethics are based on pure self-interest:<br><br>1. Life is a reproductive cycle, in which individuals seek to maximumize personal survival and to maximize their reproductive success.<br><br>2. The best way to maximize your chances of survival and reproductive success (for humans) is by means of cooperative group affiliations: families, extended families, communities. The ideological foundation of these affiliations is morals.(We are not going to kill each other, steal from each other, or undermine each other through quarrelsome behavior or adultery.)<br><br>3. Human groups are in competition with other human groups for the resources needed for survival and successful reproduction. It is good to have strong defenses against competing groups of humans, since humans are hard-wired to be predators of their own species. Often the easiest way to obtain the resources your group needs (or desires) is to steal them from another human group. This can be accomplished by killing them--which is the customary approach if the desired resource is the land the occupy. If you just want some of their "stuff," killing them is a waste of your own valuable energy resources and thus stealth or limited violence will be the preferred approach. Thirdly, you may want to set up a system of continual exploitation by enslaving them. One way to do this is to kidnap them and enslave them through the direct application of violence, but the more modern method is to batten on the, as is/where is, with a State system. Moral law requires that you defend your group. Sometimes moral law requires that you seek to benefit your group through violent aggression against other groups. Both of these moral requirements may well involve personal sacrifice. <br><br>4. It is good to have cooperative and mutually beneficial relations with other communities (foreigners) for trade purposes and the exchange of ideas and technologies. The ideological foundation of this is ethics. (We treat non-threatening and potentially useful foreigners hospitably and do not attempt to rob them or cheat them in business relationships. Being particular about honesty and justice in these relations is often very beneficial to us, and to our group.) Ethical relationships with other groups are based entirely on perceived advantage for your own group. Where there is no perceived advantage, there will be no ethical relations.<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c8485906374039031547 title="comment permalink">3/10/17, 11:50 PM</a><br><br>

In traditional Christian sexual morality, the rule is that men aren't allowed to have sex without first agreeing to assume economic responsibility, and that women aren't allowed to have sex without first securing such an agreement from the man. The agreement to assume economic responsibility is known as "marriage." Hence the proscription of fornication. A woman who fails to secure such an agreement in advance of sexual activity shifts economic responsibility for offspring onto her parents and extended family, and often the whole community. She has been a party to the "baby daddy's" fraud against these others. In the case of adultery, the adulterer or adulteress is attempting to shift economic responsibility for offspring onto someone other than the offspring's parent. I.e., an adulterous woman's husband could find himself in the position of providing for someone elses kid. The adulterous woman has been a party to fraud against her husband. The adulterous man in both the above cases is a mere fraudster attempting to evade economic responsibility.<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c2503961697608137594 title="comment permalink">3/10/17, 11:51 PM</a><br><br>

I wish both yourself and Sara all the very best in your future endeavours and struggles.<br><br>Can I also cheekily suggest that John-Michael has left the building? ;-)! Of course that also suggests that one part of blogging is that of the performer and it is worthwhile noting that some performers can change tack and produce even better work using everything they have learned from the past. Many examples pop into my mind. I would suggest to you to follow your heart in such matters as you are an outstanding writer and critique (and communicator) of ideas.<br><br>As a parting gift, I will tell you something I saw about you (it is rarely to peoples advantage, but you never know as you are stronger than most):<br><br>By avoiding walking the talk, "we display intolerance of indefinite things which overflow boundaries and plunge us into the confusing stream of direct experience. We tend to single out experiences which we can handle, with which we are comfortable, with which we can live. Other experiences go by the board, thrown back into a world we repudiate as Other and try to forget." I read those words the other day and thought of you, as you are one that is clearly comfortable with indefinite things that overflow boundaries. However, you are also clearly aware of the intellectuals dysfunction to "walk the talk" and given the nature of the topic which may well be your final blog essay here, I heard you stumble when you were called on that dysfunction. This creates internal tensions for you, but it needn't. If it means anything to you I felt that the call was arranged so as to score a cheap shot and for no other purpose (I realise Santa is not arriving anytime soon, but your interviewer still held onto the belief and was angry and upset). However, at the same time it was a fair call and is not a matter which can be easily ignored because you yourself have called others on that matter. You waded into a very complex matter.<br><br>As I noted, it is rarely to peoples advantage, but I took the gamble anyway hoping for the best.<br><br>I look forward to your future works.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c3507273505945549921 title="comment permalink">3/11/17, 2:59 AM</a><br><br>

I have read almost all of your weekly posts since late 2010, oftentimes reading most of the comments. It has become a weekly ritual for me, one that I look forward to. Your writing has altered my worldview and affected me in many ways, big and small, and inspired many pursuits in my life.<br><br>At the same time, I feel a sense of relief. Especially in the last six weeks or so, life has become overwhelming for me and I haven't been able to keep up with most of the posts and nor read any comments. I was contemplating making a decision to stop reading comments altogether from now on, just being aware the limits of time. This would be hard for me because if I had more time I'd want to read them! So your decision to take a break relieves that pressure, and gives me an excuse to use the time I would be spending reading the AR on other areas that have been beckoning me more: reading more physical books and less Internet reading, taking on more writing projects, and learning new skills (for one example, I am currently learning how to use a slide rule thanks to a gift from a fellow commenter here).<br><br>I had also been feeling that your Archdruid Report project has run the end of its course, and it's interesting that you had that sense too. After these 6-plus years I've read your writing, I think I've firmly grasped your core thesis which you expressed and explored in its many details, and now it seems a new baby must emerge from the womb of the Archdruid Report project. I too feel my interests are pushing in new directions. Over the last decade I've devoted much time to the study and contemplation of energy, peak oil, the limits to growth, etc. But other interests have captured my focus more in my current life: particularly children's literature, mythology and folklore, and storytelling arts. I do not at all wish to abandon my interests in the limits to growth and navigating the deindustrial future (as I know all my eclectic interests are interconnected), but I'm feeling the necessity in channeling these in new ways...<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c27688349877966788 title="comment permalink">3/11/17, 1:00 PM</a><br><br>

After a Christian’s tour through the decline and fall of western civilization, Schaeffer’s solution was to follow the understanding of Christian faith that had been filtered through the philosophies of the Enlightenment.<br>I like that you, JMG, have left it an open question! It is likely that our collective problem is larger than “How Should We Then Live?”; When civilizations collapse, there is a period of chaos where conventions, god(s), ideas and foundational assumptions are re-formed. For better or worse, what emerges from the chaos becomes a foundation or framework on which the next civilization is built. <br>As in “The Weird of Hali,” my sense is that we are approaching just such a fulcrum of history, so it is not just about “How should we then live” but also having concern for what we leave succeeding generations as a model for how to put things together in a way that’s appropriate for the coming millennia. I think this is what “Green Wizardry” is all about. So maybe your next blog could be named something like, “Green Wizardry Forum.” <br>Over-all, well done JMG!

I have been disillusioned by library trends for a long time, but in small ways have tried to subversively perform my job duties as much as I can. But this past week I've felt hopelessness about my efforts to work within the system -- seeing large quantities of books being discarded, the administration's lack of concern for maintaining a quality collection, and the utter waste involved in destroying a building, despite the supposed eco-friendly characteristics the new building will have.<br> <br>On Thursday there seemed to be one thing after another that left me on the verge of tears at the end of my work shift. It began when I arrived and decided to check the large discard bins in the basement to see what books I'd find. I looked into one, and what should I see? The Long Descent, yes by you, John Michael Greer. The only copy that had been in our system (that I had requested to order several years ago). I stared at it for a moment. Seeing it lying there, I felt it was a symbol of something, awakening me to the urgency of embarking on a new direction of my life. I managed to fish it out without falling in. Not sure why it was discarded. It didn't look brand new; it showed signs of being read multiple times, but it was in fine enough condition, in my opinion. It was especially telling to find work with your name in our discard bin, because my story that was published in After Oil 2 edited by you was about libraries and mass book culling, and I know you have similar feelings about libraries, based on your "The Twilight of Meaning" blog post, your comments, Retrotopia narrative, and other writings.<br><br>Every few months for our library's website, I write a list of book recommendations with short reviews around a theme of my choice. I had listed The Long Descent on one I wrote last September: http://www.dclibrary.org/node/54295 Now I'm thinking my next theme should be "Great Books No Longer Found in Our Library System." Though I doubt that would get approved for publication on our library website...<br><br>I could write many pages describing what I've experienced working at the library, especially during the past several weeks. I'll share a couple things:<br><br>-- My manager recently encouraged our department to "Weed like the wind" "Be ruthless -- if you are on the fence about discarding a book, don't give it thought -- just discard it." I kid you not! I've lost all faith in the library profession if thinking is discouraged.<br><br>--My manager has encouraged us to discard books that, basically, don't look brand new (yellowed pages, minor signs of wear, etc.): "When the new library reopens, there are going to be lots of new, shiny books. Patrons won't want to see old-looking books amidst the new-looking ones." Actually, I feel the opposite. When I walk in a library and all the books look new and shiny, I find it depressing, because I know I won't find the obscure out-of-print books I'd might like. When I walk in a library and I see some old-looking books, with reasonable signs of wear, I feel a sense of richness, that there's a good chance I'll come away having found some treasure. I'd much rather have access to a rarer book that's moderately worn than none at all!<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c5257824997404012167 title="comment permalink">3/11/17, 6:30 PM</a><br><br>

There are some essays on libraries I've been mulling over that I want to write and publish. You rewrote the Emperor's New Clothes tale to focus on the art world. I was thinking that someone (maybe me) could write a really provocative "The Emperor's New Libraries" tale. I would also like to work on post-petroleum children's fiction, as you encouraged me to do.<br><br>I'm also wondering, since I know you really care about libraries, do you have any intention in the coming years to start a library (or library movement) to counter the demise of libraries? I think there are droves of people -- both within and outside the library profession who would enthusiastically throw all the support they could to such a project.<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c553696794436413627 title="comment permalink">3/11/17, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

This was back in the late '00s, when the alt-right was starting to form in response to the financial crisis, and still had a small but vocal green wing. My first introduction to you, Mr. Greer, was a citation of TADR in one of James Howard Kunstler's books. I have been an avid reader and (very) occasional commenter since.<br><br>I now count "Star's Reach" and "Twilight's Last Gleaming" among my favorite works of fiction. "The Fires of Shalsha" was fun, too.

By my calculations you've put down around 2.5 million words on the Archdruid Report over the last 11 years, including your replies to comments. If it were a book it'd be about 8,000 pages thick — truly a wizardly tome!<br><br>I'll gladly admit that stumbling across your books and blog has been a very life-changing experience for me (for the better), and I know a lot of others feel the same way. Anyway, I look forward to seeing you re-emerge at some future point in time with a new blog. All the best to you and Sara.<br><br>Jason<br><br>p.s. For anyone wanting to keep a bit of JMGesque spirit going during the intermission I'm running a writing competition similar to the ones for the After Oil series. You can enter your post-industrial science fiction stories up until May 1st, and the 'winners' will be published in an anthology I am producing.

My own experience: back in the 1970s I became interested in, among others, two writers, James Branch Cabell, and Knut Hamsun. At our local city library, the capital of a mid-western state I found numerous novels by both these men. One, Jurgen, by James Branch Cabell, was published in the 1920s but the pages had never been cut past about page 20. I was, apparently, the first library patron to read it clear through in 50 years and yet the library had not discarded it! Of Hamsun, there were at least ten of his many novels there to be checked out. I think I read all of them. Alas, those days are gone. I doubt that that library has even one book by either author now. On the other hand, out of print books are easily and cheaply available for purchase on ebay &amp; Amazon - at least for now - so I'm amassing a library of my own.<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c6655048875442018238 title="comment permalink">3/13/17, 3:42 PM</a><br><br>

Nah - I expect firearms of some description to feature in warfare for a long time to come - but it is worth considering that pack animals have been used in every major war of the 20th century. Only the rich Western nations could, post WW2 do everything with trucks. Even in World War 2, the Americans used only one gallon of gas per soldier per day in Europe. The Germans actually used an incredible amount of horses for logistics - especially as they lost access to oil fields and had to conserve every drop for tanks and planes.<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c8528435827374204900 title="comment permalink">4/2/17, 11:08 AM</a><br><br>

I can argue here and there but you've gone to the essence of our problem which struck me around 1990. We have no real metaphysical/mythological framework to base our morality on as Nietzsche noted back then but we've acquired some virtual "values" which are based on fragments of these frameworks that are attempting to merge into a new whole that fully encompasses our current human situation. This is happening through our being a being that is not separate or alienated. <br><br>The most important thing we can do beyond any social, economic, political or intellectual revolution that is even remotely possible is to examine and creatively nurture this emergent system with all our abilities and energy. This may or may not involve metaphysical speculation but rather living a whole life and paying attention to everything that draws us out. In my own life, and in those around me is see the energy of withdrawing, of shutting down, warring with the forces of exapansion and life. It it the Freudian struggle between Eros and Thanatos that I see playing out more nakedly in life than I've ever seen in my life. People know that there is no basis for their moral ideas so they either try to hide from that thought or embrace it by stepping out and wrestling with those forces within our own system which is a combination of, as the I Ching describes it, the "Great Man" and the "Inferior Man" which means that part of us linked to "heaven" (or higher consciousness) and the practical world of our contemporary "reality."<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c5157518809331950369 title="comment permalink">4/8/17, 10:37 AM</a><br><br>

It has been an interesting six weeks, and ideas that were pupating at the start have begun to emerge into the light to briefly represent themselves in colour, beauty and purpose.<br><br>I thank you for the enchantment laid upon all the pages of this blog - such that many will, as I did, read and "wake up" to the awareness that there is work to be done and the grace that there is a work that is mine to do. <br><br>Be well.<br><br><a href=how-should-we-then-live.html#c7808639110773262053 title="comment permalink">4/19/17, 12:09 AM</a><br><br>
