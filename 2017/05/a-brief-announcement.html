</style> <![endif]-->As promised earlier, I have some announcements to make about my future blogging. My new blogging platform is mostly up and running at <a href=http://www.ecosophia.net/ >www.ecosophia.net</a>, and I plan on starting regular posts there around the summer solstice. I’ve also established an account on the social media site Dreamwidth at <a href=http://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org/ >ecosophia.dreamwidth.org</a>. The main site will get substantial essays, at least one of them a month; the Dreamwidth account will feature book reviews, announcements of new publications, wry commentary on fatuous media articles, and other shorter bits.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="mso-pagination: none">
While my blogs always tend to have a mind of their own, and head off in directions I don’t expect, my intention is to focus from here on out on a theme I’ve discussed only in passing here and on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">The Archdruid Report</i>: the emergence of a new fusion of ecology and religion in our time, not simply as an abstract worldview but as a way of life and a system, or system-of-systems, of spiritual and esoteric practice. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="mso-pagination: none">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="mso-pagination: none">
I make no apologies for that change of focus, though I know some of my readers will not find it to their taste. Over the eleven years I spent writing weekly posts on<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> The Archdruid Report</i>, I said pretty much everything I can think of saying about the decline and fall of industrial civilization; over the few years that I’ve spent doing monthly posts on<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> The Well of Galabes</i>, I’ve sketched out some of the foundations on which I plan to build as we proceed—and now it’s time to move on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="mso-pagination: none">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="mso-pagination: none">
I do have more to say about some of the topics touched, peripherally or otherwise, in the course of eleven years of blogging; among other things, I’m looking for a print or online periodical that would be interested in hosting further discussions of politics and culture in late imperial America from my jaundiced and idiosyncratic perspective—but we’ll see whether anything comes of that. In the meantime, there’s much to be said about getting out from under the crackpot fantasy of Man the Conqueror of Nature and relearning how to live as part of the Earth’s biotic community, and I propose to say some of it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="mso-pagination: none">
<br></div>
Please note the following, though: as of the end of June, <i><b>both my previous blogs will be going away</b></i>. The posts on <i>The Well of Galabes</i> will be hosted as a read-only archive on my new site; the posts here on<i> The Archdruid Report </i>will be going offline permanently—though they’ll be available soon in a complete ten-volume published edition, in print and e-book forms, from Founders House Publishing. Thank you all for reading my blogs, and stand by for the next giddy leap into new territory! <br>

[First part of 2]<br> For your restarting blog, there is, of course, still a whole mess of topics to be examined…<br><br> Off the git go, I am absolutely floored that this whole Russia-did-it meme, and Trump-is-virtually-a-Russian-stooge has any traction. This is a transparently manufactured crisis, and I can’t see why this isn’t obvious to all. While I understand that opinion polls do in fact show the public mostly isn’t buying it, every one in my circle swallows this stuff hook, line and sinker. My circle consists wholly of Hillary supporters, so it would be the “deplorables” who haven’t drank the kool-aid. What can this demonization campaign on Russia, Putin and even Trump by the US establishment possibly signify? How confident were the PTB that this media campaign wouldn’t backfire and undermine the public’s (or at least the Hillary Muppets’) faith in the credibility of the MSM? Are they attempting fill the public mind space with a red herring that distracts the public with any excuse to avoid examining the Hillary fail, which might lead to basic questions about whose interests she really represents, or what? Somehow I get the sense the PTB must have known they were taking a gamble, but felt panicked or desperate, and that some big disruption of some sort or another might be at hand.<br><br> A year or two ago, you posted a piece on “Bracing for impact”, noting that decline can be punctuated by events or crises of the Black Swan variety that basically reveal to anyone with eyes that the status quo just went up in smoke. Your take seemed to be that some “impact” was lurking out there. Much later, I inferred from something you wrote (can’t recall what) that your thinking has walked back from this view. Personally, I feel like there is something big in the asteroid belt, on some eccentric orbit crossing ours, but I can’t imagine what’s going to happen… I can’t help but recall the Orlovian (as in Dmitry) economic/social collapse in Argentina, 2001. Precious little has been written about that, and I wonder if you think that event suggests anything about our possible future.<br><br><br><a href=a-brief-announcement.html#c421307401896711026 title="comment permalink">5/22/17, 5:14 PM</a><br><br>

Several years ago, as I was walked from my clinic to my car, a group of 3 or 4 young men (same race as me, caucasian) about 100 feet away, noticed me and began shouting some menacing epithets. They didn’t actually accost me, they just hurled some verbal abuse and that was the end of it. My sense was this was class-based hostility, and the experience made a big impression on me. I felt they would have strung me up on a lamp-post if they had a rope and thought they could get away with it. My response has been to dress down (redneck lite) as a form of social camouflage, while, I hope, also not marking myself as a potential target for law-enforcement, who can be even more dangerous. I have given thought to firearms, but haven’t really taken action on this; I do have a 22 cal rifle which I obtained back when to hunt small game. I haven’t gone so far as to obtain a concealed/carry permit and pack iron. I’m far from certain that would be an optimal form of self-defense anyway, as it is only an option to use/threaten deadly force, which would be hard to justify in most situations. So maybe a “walking stick” or “trek pole” that is in reality a fighting staff might be more practical. Many traditional martial arts cover the staff; Systema, the indigenous martial art of Russia, looks particularly interesting. Still, studying/practicing any martial art is no small thing. The sling is a potentially useful weapon should one need defense-at-a-distance as in 2001 Argentina; the book “The Sling For Sport and Survival” by Cliff Savage is an intriguing read, as it appears that with the sling, you develop instinctive aim, which can be extremely accurate, and reportedly, can be developed rapidly by just about anybody. My wife, like all good liberals it seems, views the topic of self defense as suspect at best. To her, it seems the only legitimate self defense is a cell-phone and maybe a good pair of running shoes. <br><br>So JMG, do your muses incline you to meditate and write upon self-defense? I recall you’ve mentioned that you will never discuss personal firearms on your blog for the understandable reason that you don’t want to launch fireworks indoors. But maybe you might reconsider a way to approach this?… I thought your Retrotopia piece on the drone shooting competition, and related scholarly remarks, e.g. the MASER, were deft ways of handling one very dicey topic.<br><br><br><br><a href=a-brief-announcement.html#c1779798741094637386 title="comment permalink">5/22/17, 5:14 PM</a><br><br>

I'll miss the old ADR and its highlights on today's outrages &amp; absurdities, but welcome the new blog and am looking forward to reading both ecosophias. <br><br>A side note of interest and amusement - 30 years ago, David Brin predicted the rise of new ecological-based religions among the youth of 2038, as well as a shifting focus in the mainstream. One quote (from memory, but this is the gist of it) "These days the Virgin Mary takes a serious interest in planetary health."<br><br>Alas, the alternative religions were done rather badly, though I can see his female-run Gaian faith becoming your priestesshood somewhere down the road.<br><br>Also alas, he averted crisis by pulling a techno-rabbit out of the hat, being unable to envision any other outcome - even though the people in his novel had all, by and large, done exactly what Brin thought should be done. A quote from much younger columnist/author Rebecca Solnit seems appropriate here, "It isn't a fact universally acknowledged that a person who mistakes his opinion for truth may also mistake himself for God." Which in my private correspondence with a close friend I now call "Brin's Disease."<br><br>Anyway, I'll be hitting your new blogs with some regularity.<br><br>Hasta la vista!

My only regret in the blog disappearing is that I will never get to go back to read through all the comments, watching their tone and nature change over the course of time as the depth and rigor of your mystery initiation by correspondence worked its magic. You have already had a profound impact on so many lives by teaching people how to think and showing how what passes for thought is so often its antithesis.<br><br>Congratulations on having meticulously laid the groundwork necessary for us to stand in the void left by the crumbling philosophies and religions of our age in order to build and strengthen the nascent value systems of the future we have so foolishly ordered up. I can think of no richer goal than guiding people out of the distorting hall of mirrors of progressive humanism, where our grandiose man-made reflections cast us always as gods or demons, out into the clarity of the natural world, where our rare reflections in the eyes of a predator or as a tiny dot on the vast blue surface of a still lake invariably remind us how puny we must appear to the demons and gods surrounding us.<br><br>I hope you will complete the analysis you started of philosophy, as a way of placing ecosophy in an historic context. Laying down cherished but antiquated values so that we can embrace ones better adapted to our current environment will surely be more successful if we are aware how regularly that has happened throughout human history and how resistant the passing culture has been to that needed change. Despite that resistance, I bet you will bring the term ecosophy into much broader use, as you already have done with archdruid, dissensus, catabolysis, thaumaturgy, and so many other terms.<br><br>The cover art of An Archdruid's Tales is a beautiful piece of ecosophic iconography. The discarded cars are no longer central symbols of decline and collapse, but merely balanced sacramental offerings in the cathedral of the natural world. Long live the world tree; may her roots grow deep and strong!<br><br><a href=a-brief-announcement.html#c276636358784875548 title="comment permalink">5/23/17, 5:25 PM</a><br><br>

Fingers crossed, I'm hoping that this is within five years, due to overall economic headwinds, instability of the power grid, and problems w/revenue and profitability of the internet's ad dependent economic model. Also, as far as collapse is concerned, we're pretty much at the point where Mephistopheles drags Faustus down into hell. Of all the people I've referred to the this site over the years, and I'm judicious about who I share it with, not one person grabbed hold of it and ran with it as if they'd struck gold.

However I want to make an urgent plea for you to keep the arch druid blog on the internet, even it this is in a read only archive. I am sorry if what follows is too long but I thinks its important.<br><br>I first became aware of peak oil in 2008 and since then I have followed the thinking and fortunes of the peak oil movement closely. I have read much that is of value in writers such as Mr Kunstler, Mr Heinberg and Mr Orlov, but you are different from them because you have a background in history, philosophy and religion, which has given you a deeper insight into the cultural, psychological and spiritual forces that have driven our civilisation into this crisis and prevented it from backing away from it. To paraphrase an old Heineken advert, you reach the parts which other writers cannot reach and you have had an invaluable influence on the peak oil movement. It was your writing that helped to steer it away from the notion of an apocalyptic fast collapse and to see that collapse is likely to be a slow drawn out process of crisis followed by period of partial recovery and then another crisis. The events that followed 2008 have proved you correct.<br><br>The peak oil movement has taken a real knocking since the shale boom, but it is still going. You can see that in my country in the continued existence of the dark mountain project and the Transition movement. It is likely that there will be another oil crisis and financial crash in the next few years, which will spark another surge oil interest in peak oil and the limits to growth. I think this surge of interest will be much greater than 2008 because the old political order is collapsing and millions will be looking on the internet to find out the reason why we are in this dilemma and I am sure that many will will find references to the arch druid report and when they try to find it, it won’t be there. I know you will have a new web site, but I understand it isn't going to be dealing with peak oil and the collapse of industrial civilisation. All that great wisdom you have accumulated on the internet over 10 year will be lost and you will have lost the chance to influence the new generation of peak oilers.<br><br><br><a href=a-brief-announcement.html#c3160939539159409913 title="comment permalink">5/26/17, 9:20 AM</a><br><br>

However the only reason thousands of people have been influenced by your views and gone out to buy your books is because they could read your blog for free on the internet. This was certainly the case with me. In 2008 I was curious and wanted to know more, but was not yet convinced that industrial civilisation was collapsing. I was in a boring job and used to spend the lunchtime going through your weekly blogs from 2006 and 2007. If your blog was not available for free, then I would not have been influenced by you and you would be poorer as I would never have brought any of your books and I am sure that there are thousands who would say the same. Your blog was the bait that hooked my money and brought it into your bank account.<br><br>Because our political consensus has been broken I think that the next few years are going to be vital in determining the course our civilisation takes in the ongoing collapse. Our society has suddenly become malleable as millions have started looking for a new way of thinking. It is vital that you do all you can to strike while the iron is hot and influence as many people as you can. This is why it is vital that the arch druid report stays on the internet so that its wisdom can influence anyone who goes in search of it. Of course I’m aware that the internet will one day go and that it is too late to save out industrial civilisation. But there is still a hell of a lot we can do to cushion the descent and save a lot of things and ideas that will be of value to future generation and keeping the Arch Druid Blog on the internet will play a vital part in it. So please, I implore you to do your karmic duty and keep your blog on the net.<br><br><br><br>PS: The collapse of the old political order is well under way in this country. We had Brexit last year and I hear today that Corbyn is only 5% behind Teresa May in the election. When the election started Corbyn was 20% behind May and all the commentators were convinced that the Labour would be wiped out. And this poll was taken after the Manchester terrorist attack which you would think benefit the conservatives. I still think May is likely to win, but the fact that Corbyn is only 5% behind is astounding. The way in which the press have lambasted him as a left wing nutcase is incredible, but people don't seem to be listening any more<br><br><br><a href=a-brief-announcement.html#c7531595936149545428 title="comment permalink">5/26/17, 9:22 AM</a><br><br>

The comment sections have blossomed as your readers have met to discuss the issues and their own solutions to the practicalities of dealing with the altered circumstances we face. Losing all that seems a terrible waste.<br>Despite the fact there will be a printed version of ADR for those who will be able to maintain copies in the future, I hope you will reconsider keeping the current Report online either here or as an archive at your new website.<br>Once again, I offer my thanks for all you've done,<br>Susan<br><br><a href=a-brief-announcement.html#c7847759717184041191 title="comment permalink">5/28/17, 5:44 AM</a><br><br>

The emphasis of the new blog will be different from the arch druid blog. However you will often have to refer to ideas and themes from arch druid blog. and that might mean going back to basics and repeating things that you have already gone into detail about on the arch druid blog. Surely it would make your life as a writer much easier if you could avoid this and just refer to the relevant post from the arch druid. Why would you want to waste time rewriting what you have already written. It would also make your life easier when having to reply to commentators if you can just put a link to a relevant post not he arch druid blog.<br><br>In order to understand the need of a new fusion between ecology and religion it is first necessary to understand all the ideas and themes that you have so extensively covered in the arch druid report. The arch druid blog is the school you have go to before you can go to the university of your new blog. Those of us who have been reading the arch druid blog for years or have a good knowledge of this stuff from other sources, probably have no need of if any more. But there are thousands who may come across the arch druid blog in the future and be influenced by it and then move onto your new blog. Of course if the arch druid blog in no longer there, then this will not happen.<br><br><br><a href=a-brief-announcement.html#c691620643258076067 title="comment permalink">5/28/17, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

At least, I certainly was.

I have also reduced the time I have my washing machine operating for from 54 to 28 minutes and am getting my clothes cleaner. The trick in this case is to soak the clothes overnight in a tub of hot soapy water with a bit of borax in it. The clothes get wrung out and popped into the washing machine and the soak water goes on the grass in my Sacred Grove. <br><br>Looking forward to the journey to the heart of Hobbiton with the TADR gang.<br>Yours under the red cedars, <br>Max Rogers<br><br><a href=a-brief-announcement.html#c207846624737550190 title="comment permalink">5/29/17, 3:21 PM</a><br><br>

So many paradigm shifting ideas brought to life and I think you have thoroughly succeeded in making it clear how important understanding and accepting the history of the rise and fall of past civilizations is going to be if modern industrialized civilization is to pivot to a less violent relationship with the environment (a phrase Fritz Schumacher used often).<br><br>I would like to add my voice to those requesting that you keep a read-only copy of the Archdruid Report on line for many of the same reasons. Like so many others it was through the results of a google search (in my case about any association between Stoicism, cardinal values and Fritz Schumacher) that led me quite by accident to a post of yours http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com.au/2013/05/the-rock-by-lake-silvaplana.html and your writing immediately drew me in.<br><br>No one else was tackling the mix of the questions of faith and values as bound inside the history of ideas, mixed with philosophy amid a discussion of a future of constrained resources in the way that particular post was.

The new blog site at <a href=http://www.ecosophia.net rel=nofollow>www.ecosophia.net</a> is coming along well -- between me and my hardworking IT person, most of the construction has been done, and a little further tweaking ought to have it ready for regular posting come the solstice. My Dreamwidth account at <a href=http://ecosophia.dreamwidth.org rel=nofollow>ecosophia.dreamwidth.org</a> is also live, with a couple of posts up and more to follow. <br><br>I understand that a lot of people would rather have this blog stay up; it would undoubtedly be more convenient for many. For a variety of reasons, though, that's not workable from my end, and sometime in the second half of June -- date not yet certain, but quite possibly as early as the solstice -- down it goes. I'd encourage those of you who are upset by this to consider it as a dry run for the much broader loss of access to resources of all kinds you can expect in the years ahead. <br><br>We've all gotten used to the idea that big impersonal institutions will take care of the job of providing us with the things we need and want. That's a strategy with an increasingly short shelf life these days. As we proceed further down the slope of decline, more and more often, if you want to be sure that something is going to stay around, <i><b>you will have to see to that yourself</b></i>, individually or as part of a group of people. Nobody else is going to do it for you. <br><br>I've already noted that I have no objection to people copying the material on this blog elsewhere on the web. I'll take that another step. If one or more of you are willing to go to the trouble of copying all 543 posts plus comments and posting them somewhere else on the internet, drop me a comment marked "not for posting" and we'll see what we can arrange. Fair enough? If those who want to see this content remain online are willing to put in the sweat involved, we can probably work something out. If not? Well, them's the breaks.<br><br><a href=a-brief-announcement.html#c4483583975572103906 title="comment permalink">5/30/17, 7:30 AM</a><br><br>

I still haven't read most of your posts (I only started reading you fairly recently), and there are posts that I might want to share with others in the future, so I was trying to figure out what I could do to keep the Report around.<br><br>Over the past week, I spent some time manually submitting every page that wasn't already there (including yearly and monthly pages, and all of the comment pages) to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine (they have a form that allows people to manually archive online pages). Although their system seems to be buggy and it wasn't always clear that something was actually archived after I submitted the form, I did some checking just now and I think they're finally all there.<br><br>I then realized that it may not be a good idea to rely on other institutions still being around in the future (as you say), and tried to make an archive of the site on my own computer using WinHTTrack. I stopped it partway through because it was getting pretty big - a whole gigabyte, while I only have 2GB left on my hard drive. Perhaps there's something I can change in the settings to have it take up less space... I suspect that it's either duplicating a lot of image data or following some links too deeply.<br><br>@Adrian Smith<br>How did you get your archive to take up just 222mb?<br><br>One good option for keeping the Report accessible in the future might be to create a lean archive of the site and then turn it into a public torrent/magnet link. That way, it should be accessible as long as the internet is around and at least one person who has the archive on their computer is still online.<br><br><a href=a-brief-announcement.html#c4222110088513706035 title="comment permalink">6/1/17, 6:09 PM</a><br><br>

In my testing, 7-Zip had the best compression for this type of file. http://www.7-zip.org/download.html<br><br>The files will still likely be too large for email. To get an idea, I compressed the HTML only of "How Should We Then Live?". With the old zip format (Using 7-Zip, compression level Ultra), the archive was reduced to 20.5% of the original size. With 7-Zip's native 7z format (Ultra again), I was able to reduce the article and comments down to 17%. More savings will come with more articles though. With the last full month of Archdruid postings, we can reduce the size to 14.7% with 7z, and 21.3% with zip. If the xml file is monolithic (one huge file), zip will have a somewhat better compression ratio. Still, if the original was 300MB, then even 7z is not enough compression to fit in an email. It would be a much smaller size for up and downloading though, at about 44.1MB. <br><br>Uploading the file to Google Drive would be a much better idea than trying to email the XML archive.

I wrote a script that downloads the existing Blogger site. It cleans the pages up, removing things like sharing buttons and fixing links from one post to another. It also (re)compresses image files and rewrites some of the blog's HTML/JS code, reducing the archive's size and keeping the "Blog Archive" sidebar widget working. The result looks similar to the current desktop site, with one page per post (with all of the post's comments) and one page per month (no comments).<br><br>As mentioned above, the desktop site doesn't do nested replies correctly, and so far, this archive also doesn't. I might fix that at some point, perhaps by including a mobile version of the archive.<br><br>I placed the archive in this Google Drive folder:<br><a href=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8Qtw5WNgYf8X2JLckdIUmcxUTg rel=nofollow>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8Qtw5WNgYf8X2JLckdIUmcxUTg</a><br><br>The file is <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8Qtw5WNgYf8X2lLd21USkF2WkU" rel=nofollow>thearchdruidreport-archive-20170616-2.7z</a> (34MB).<br><br>It's a 7-Zip archive, so as with the 7-Zip archives above, extracting them requires an archiver program like 7-Zip, WinZIP, WinRAR, Keka, p7zip, etc.<br><br>I also hosted the archive online at <a href=https://thearchdruidreport-archive.200605.xyz rel=nofollow>https://thearchdruidreport-archive.200605.xyz</a>. The site is hosted via GitHub Pages, which provides free hosting for small sites. The archive's files are hosted in this GitHub repository, <a href=https://www.github.com/squirrel2038/thearchdruidreport-archive rel=nofollow>https://www.github.com/squirrel2038/thearchdruidreport-archive</a>. The domain, 200605.xyz, is from the very new 1.111B xyz domain class, which I chose because it costs only $2/year.<br><br>In principle, anyone with enough technical know-how can also run my script. See the README in the GitHub repo. Once this Blogger site goes down, the script can instead use a "web_cache" archive containing raw HTTP responses. web_cache is located in the Google Drive folder above. Aside from the desktop site, web_cache also contains mobile pages, as well as Atom XML and Blogger JSON files for each post and for all comments.<br><br>I also briefly looked at copying posts+comments into a new Blogger blog. A Blogger mirror would presumably be easier to maintain than a static site. On the other hand, the archive I have now doesn't rely on Blogger or even on the Internet, and it preserves the #c&lt;COMMENT-ID&gt; URL fragments in comment permalinks. Given an old hyperlink to a blog comment, it's possible to find the comment in the new archive by merely changing the URL's domain. When I imported XML into Blogger, all the comment IDs changed.<br><br>Maybe it'd be nice to have a better domain name, but it would cost more. As far as I know, the thearchdruidreport-archive.200605.xyz site can stay up indefinitely.<br><br>If anyone wants to discuss the archive, I can be reached at squirrel2038@gmail.com.<br><br><a href=a-brief-announcement.html#c1383933755166737715 title="comment permalink">6/16/17, 5:05 PM</a><br><br>
