While I type these words, an old Supertramp CD is playing in the next room. Those of my readers who belong to the same slice of an American generation I do will likely remember the words Roger Hodgson is singing just now, the opening line from “Fool’s Overture”: </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“History recalls how great the fall can be...”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s an apposite quote for a troubled time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the last year or so, in and among the other issues I’ve tried to discuss in this blog, the US presidential campaign has gotten a certain amount of air time. Some of the conversations that resulted generated a good deal more heat than light, but then that’s been true across the board since Donald Trump overturned the established certainties of American political life and launched himself and the nation on an improbable trajectory toward our current situation. Though the diatribes I fielded from various sides were more than occasionally tiresome, I don’t regret making the election a theme for discussion here, as it offered a close-up view of issues I’ve been covering for years now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A while back on this blog, for example, I spent more than a year sketching out the process by which civilizations fall and dark ages begin, with an eye toward the next five centuries of North American history—a conversation that turned into my book <i>Dark Age America</i>. Among the historical constants I discussed in the posts and the book was the way that governing elites and their affluent supporters stop adapting their policies to changing political and economic conditions, and demand instead that political and economic conditions should conform to their preferred policies. That’s all over today’s headlines, as the governing elites of the industrial world cower before the furious backlash sparked by their rigid commitment to the failed neoliberal nostrums of global trade and open borders. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Another theme I discussed in the same posts and book was the way that science and culture in a civilization in decline become so closely identified with the interests of the governing elite that the backlash against the failed policies of the elite inevitably becomes a backlash against science and culture as well. We’ve got plenty of that in the headlines as well. According to recent news stories, for example, the Trump administration plans to scrap the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and get rid of all the federal offices that study anthropogenic climate change. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Their termination with extreme prejudice isn’t simply a matter of pruning the federal bureaucracy, though that’s a factor. All these organizations display various forms of the identification of science and culture with elite values just discussed, and their dismantling will be greeted by cheers from a great many people outside the circles of the affluent, who have had more than their fill of patronizing lectures from their self-proclaimed betters in recent years. Will many worthwhile programs be lost, along with a great deal that’s less than worthwhile?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That’s a normal feature of the twilight years of a civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A couple of years before the sequence of posts on dark age America, for that matter, I did another series on the end of US global hegemony and the rough road down from empire. That sequence also turned into a book,
<i>Decline and Fall</i>. In the posts and the book, I pointed out that one of the constants of the history of democratic societies—actual democracies, warts and all, as distinct from the imaginary “real democracy” that exists solely in rhetoric—is a regular cycle of concentration and diffusion of power. The ancient Greek historian Polybius, who worked it out in detail, called it anacyclosis. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A lot can be said about anacyclosis, but the detail that’s relevant just now is the crisis phase, when power has become so gridlocked among competing power centers that it becomes impossible for the system to break out of even the most hopelessly counterproductive policies. That ends, according to Polybius, when a charismatic demagogue gets into power, overturns the existing political order, and sets in motion a general free-for-all in which old alliances shatter and improbable new ones take shape. Does that sound familiar? In a week when union leaders emerged beaming from a meeting with the new president, while Democrats are still stoutly defending the integrity of the CIA, it should. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, one of the central themes of the sequence of posts and the book was the necessity of stepping back from global commitments that the United States can no longer afford to maintain. That’s happening, too, though it’s being covered up just now by a great deal of Trumped-up bluster about a massive naval expansion. (If we do get a 350-ship navy in the next decade, I’d be willing to bet that a lot of those ships will turn out to be inexpensive corvettes, like the ones the Russians have been using so efficiently as cruise missile platforms on the Caspian Sea.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>European politicians are squawking at top volume about the importance of NATO, which means in practice the continuation of a scheme that allows most European countries to push most of the costs of their own defense onto the United States, but the new administration doesn’t seem to be buying it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, I’m far from enthusiastic about the remilitarization of Europe. Outside the brief interval of enforced peace following the Second World War, Europe has been a boiling cauldron of warfare since its modern cultures began to emerge out of the chaos of the post-Roman dark ages. Most of the world’s most devastating wars have been European in origin, and of course it escapes no one’s attention in the rest of the world that it was from Europe that hordes of invaders and colonizers swept over the entire planet from the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries, as often as not leaving total devastation in their wake. In histories written a thousand years from now, Europeans will have the same sort of reputation that Huns and Mongols have today—and it’s only in the fond fantasies of those who think history has a direction that those days are definitely over.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It can’t be helped, though, for the fact of the matter is that the United States can no longer afford to foot the bill for the defense of other countries. Behind a facade of hallucinatory paper wealth, our nation is effectively bankrupt. The only thing that enables us to pay our debts now is the status of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency—this allows the Treasury to issue debt at a breakneck pace and never have to worry about the cost—and that status is trickling away as one country after another signs bilateral deals to facilitate trading in other currencies. Sooner or later, probably in the next two decades, the United States will be forced to default on its national debt, the way Russia did in 1998.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Before that happens, a great many currently overvalued corporations that support themselves by way of frantic borrowing will have done the same thing by way of the bankruptcy courts, and of course the vast majority of America’s immense consumer debt will have to be discharged the same way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That means, among other things, that the extravagant lifestyles available to affluent Americans in recent decades will be going away forever in the not too distant future. That’s another point I made in
<i>Decline and Fall</i> and the series of posts that became raw material for it. During the era of US global hegemony, the five per cent of our species who lived in the United States disposed of a third of the world’s raw materials and manufactured products and a quarter of its total energy production. That disproportionate share came to us via unbalanced patterns of exchange hardwired into the global economy, and enforced at gunpoint by the military garrisons we keep in more than a hundred countries worldwide. The ballooning US government, corporate, and consumer debt load of recent years was an attempt to keep those imbalances in place even as their basis in geopolitics trickled away. Now the dance is ending and the piper has to be paid. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a certain bleak amusement to be had from the fact that one of the central themes of this blog not that many years back—“Collapse Now and Avoid the Rush”—has already passed its pull date. The rush, in case you haven’t noticed, is already under way. The fraction of US adults of working age who are permanently outside the work force is at an all-time high; so is the fraction of young adults who are living with their parents because they can’t afford to start households of their own. There’s good reason to think that the new administration’s trade and immigration policies may succeed in driving both those figures down, at least for a while, but of course there’ll a price to be paid for that—and those industries and social classes that have profited most from the policies of the last thirty years, and threw their political and financial weight behind the Clinton campaign, will be first in line to pay it. <i>Vae victis</i>!*</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
More generally, the broader landscape of ideas this blog has tried to explore since its early days remains what it is. The Earth’s economically accessible reserves of fossil carbon dwindle day by day; with each year that passes, on average, the amount of coal, oil, and natural gas burnt exceeds the amount that’s discovered by a wider margin; the current temporary glut in the oil markets is waning so fast that analysts are predicting the next price spike as soon as 2018. Talk of transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, on the one hand, or nuclear power on the other, remains talk—I encourage anyone who doubts this to look up the amount of fossil fuels burnt each year over the last two decades and see if they can find a noticeable decrease in global fossil fuel consumption to match the much-ballyhooed buildout of solar and wind power. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The industrial world remains shackled to fossil fuels for most of its energy and all of its transportation fuel, for the simple reason that no other energy source in this end of the known universe provides the abundant, concentrated, and fungible energy supply that’s needed to keep our current lifestyles going. There was always an alternative—deliberately downshifting out of the embarrassing extravagance that counts for normal lifestyles in the industrial world these days, accepting more restricted ways of living in order to leave a better world for our descendants—but not enough people were willing to accept that alternative to make a difference while there was still a chance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile the other jaw of the vise that’s tightening around the future is becoming increasingly visible just now. In the Arctic, freak weather systems has sucked warm air up from lower latitudes and brought the normal process of winter ice formation to a standstill. In the Antarctic, the Larsen C ice shelf, until a few years ago considered immovable by most glaciologists, is in the process of loosing an ice sheet the size of Delaware into the Antarctic Ocean. I look out my window and see warm rain falling; here in the north central Appalachians, in January, it’s been most of a month since the thermometer last dipped below freezing. The new administration has committed itself to do nothing about anthropogenic climate change, but then, despite plenty of talk, the Obama administration didn’t do anything about it either. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s good reason for that, too. The only way to stop anthropogenic climate change in its tracks is to stop putting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and doing that would require the world to ground its airlines, turn its highways over to bicycles and oxcarts, and shut down every other technology that won’t be economically viable if it has to depend on the diffuse intermittent energy available from renewable sources. Does the political will to embrace such changes exist? Since I know of precisely three climate change scientists, out of thousands, who take their own data seriously enough to cut their carbon footprint by giving up air travel, it’s safe to say that the answer is “no.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So, basically, we’re in for it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The thing that fascinates me is that this is something I’ve been saying for the whole time this blog has been appearing. The window of opportunity for making a smooth transition to a renewable future slammed shut in the early 1980s, when majorities across the industrial world turned their backs on the previous decade’s promising initiatives toward sustainability, and bought into the triumphalist rhetoric of the Reagan-Thatcher counterrevolution instead. Since then, year after weary year, most of the green movement—with noble exceptions—has been long on talk and short on action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Excuses for doing nothing and justifications for clinging to lifestyles the planet cannot support have proliferated like rabbits on Viagra, and most of the people who talked about sustainability at all took it for granted that the time to change course was still somewhere conveniently off in the future. That guaranteed that the chance to change course would slide steadily further back into the past. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There was another detail of the post-Seventies sustainability scene that deserves discussion, though, because it’s been displayed with an almost pornographic degree of nakedness in the weeks just past. From the early days of the peak oil movement in the late 1990s on, a remarkably large number of the people who talked eagerly about the looming crisis of our age seemed to think that its consequences would leave them and the people and things they cared about more or less intact. That wasn’t universal by any means; there were always some people who grappled with the hard realities that the end of the fossil fuel age was going to impose on their own lives; but all things considered, there weren’t that many, in comparison to all those who chattered amiably about how comfortable they’d be in their rural doomsteads, lifeboat communities, Transition Towns, et al. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now, as discussed earlier in this post, we’ve gotten a very modest helping of decline and fall, and people who were enthusiastically discussing the end of the industrial age not that long ago are freaking out six ways from Sunday. If a relatively tame event like the election of an unpopular president can send people into this kind of tailspin, what are they going to do the day their paychecks suddenly turn out to be worth only half as much in terms of goods and services as before—a kind of event that’s already become tolerably common elsewhere, and could quite easily happen in this country as the dollar loses its reserve currency status? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What kinds of meltdowns are we going to get when internet service or modern health care get priced out of reach, or become unavailable at any price?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How are they going to cope if the accelerating crisis of legitimacy in this country causes the federal government to implode, the way the government of the Soviet Union did, and suddenly they’re living under cobbled-together regional governments that don’t have the money to pay for basic services? What sort of reaction are we going to see if the US blunders into a sustained domestic insurgency—suicide bombs going off in public places, firefights between insurgent forces and government troops, death squads from both sides rounding up potential opponents and leaving them in unmarked mass graves—or, heaven help us, all-out civil war? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b><i>This is what the decline and fall of a civilization looks like</i></b>. It’s not about sitting in a cozy earth-sheltered home under a roof loaded with solar panels, living some close approximation of a modern industrial lifestyle, while the rest of the world slides meekly down the chute toward history’s compost bin, leaving you and yours untouched. It’s about political chaos—meaning that you won’t get the leaders you want, and you may not be able to count on the rule of law or even the most basic civil liberties. It’s about economic implosion—meaning that your salary will probably go away, your savings almost certainly won’t keep its value, and if you have gold bars hidden in your home, you’d better hope to Hannah that nobody ever finds out, or it’ll be a race between the local government and the local bandits to see which one gets to tie your family up and torture them to death, starting with the children, until somebody breaks and tells them where your stash is located. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s about environmental chaos—meaning that you and the people you care about may have many hungry days ahead as crazy weather messes with the harvests, and it’s by no means certain you won’t die early from some tropical microbe that’s been jarred loose from its native habitat to find a new and tasty home in you. It’s about rapid demographic contraction—meaning that you get to have the experience a lot of people in the Rust Belt have already, of walking past one abandoned house after another and remembering the people who used to live there, until they didn’t any more. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
More than anything else, it’s about loss. Things that you value—things you think of as important, meaningful, even necessary—are going to go away forever in the years immediately ahead of us, <b><i>and there will be nothing you can do about it</i></b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It really is as simple as that. People who live in an age of decline and fall can’t afford to cultivate a sense of entitlement. Unfortunately, for reasons discussed at some length <a href=../../2016/12/a-season-of-consequences.html>in one of last month’s posts</a>, the notion that the universe is somehow obliged to give people what they think they deserve is very deeply engrained in American popular culture these days. That’s a very unwise notion to believe right now, and as we slide further down the slope, it could very readily become fatal—and no, by the way, I don’t mean that last adjective in a metaphorical sense. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
History recalls how great the fall can be, Roger Hodgson sang. In our case, it’s shaping up to be one for the record books—and those of my readers who have worked themselves up to the screaming point about the comparatively mild events we’ve seen so far may want to save some of their breath for the times ahead when it’s going to get much, much worse. </div>

Hopefully this philosophy can help people through the dark age.

They've helped me immeasurably to adjust to the unpalatable future we have staring us in the face. <br><br>on January first this year I was exposed to fragrances that caused burning in my mouth and tongue and swelling in my throat. Since then I've been markedly unwell with much lowered vitality, weird pains, loss of appetite, and fatigue, worsened, of course, by chemical exposure. Most of the spaces I've been accustomed to passing time are now inaccessible to me. The majority of my peers have little basis for understanding what is happening to me, and given that I'm limited in where I can go, it's hard to educate them. <br><br>For several months I was planning on returning to my parent's house. My mom, bless her heart, is removing all the fragrances she can. In a profound way I've lost control in my life, largely based on the feckless development of toxic chemicals and their proliferation in almost every aspect of our lives. <br><br>I don't know if I'll stay at the same level of sickness, get better or worse. My life is up in the air, and I'm awed by the enlarged degree of my vulnerability. During this trying time I've mediated quite a bit on your writing, and have found great comfort in your words. For me, collapse may have just come, and yes, I'm fully aware it may turn out to be fatal. I'm also aware that collectively, and most likely personally, things will worsen in due time, and I'm significantly less likely now to be able to survive these developments. <br><br>Such is life, which is wild, and precious and ultimately bound up in strange destinies and directions which defy our puny human understandings. For what it's worth I'm enormously excited to garden with my family and see just how much food I can grow and preserve, to plant many anise hyssop (Agastache foeniculum) in the lawn for the bees, and nettles and burdock all around, start seeds indoors, and share plants far and sundry with friends and neighbors.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c2390480974093384280 title="comment permalink">1/25/17, 2:39 PM</a><br><br>

It still pays the bills, but when I let it go, there is no good regulatory route to get it back again if that's necessary.

No amount of prepping on my part will save me if my medications become unavailable for whatever reason (I have no wife or kids to worry about, and my parents just as fracked as me if this happens, so I can't muster up much of the sense of responsibility that might otherwise have motivated me). The only thing I can hope for is that the reason for their unavailability is a crisis of sufficient locality that I can go for refugee status in some more hospitable nation.

Seriously, a lot of those heated comments just warmed the atmosphere more than it already was. What a waste of energy.<br><br>I've recounted the story of having been made redundant as a young bloke in the recession in the early 1990's and the shock at finding oneself redundant. Well, after that I never threw my weight behind the system again and looked for niches to escape it. But in recent times - as you would be only all too aware - I have since discovered that the word redundant also has an ecological meaning which actually applied to me at that time of physical redundancy. I'm not the sharpest tool around but I didn't need to be told a second time. Alas for others, as I suspect they will not heed that particular lesson as it visits them.<br><br>Of course inflation will appear. In fact, I reckon we are now in a period of stagflation (hello 1970's oil crisis) and the increase in under employment is being used to mask the real story whilst nobody speaks about the insane median Melbourne house price of $880,000.<br><br>I take all of what you wrote seriously because it accords with what I see going on in the world since that time when I was rather rudely woken up to the unpleasant realities.<br><br>Instead of people talking about approaching the future gracefully, what their dirty little secret is, is that they would prefer it if other people are made redundant (in the physical and ecological sense) so as to open room for their own. They never realise that the "do unto others" applies to that little wish and you never know when your lucky numbers will come up.<br><br>People tell me from time to time how hard I work. I'm not sure I work hard enough. Today, I'm continuing bringing in the winters firewood - a huge job to be sure - and listening to the Triple J Hottest 100 countdown (a highlight of my year as I am a self confessed music nerd).<br><br>I liked Supertramp too. My favourite was the logical song as it spoke directly to me:<br><br><i>"When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful,<br>A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical.<br>And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily,<br>Joyfully, playfully watching me.<br>But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible,<br>Logical, responsible, practical.<br>And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable,<br>Clinical, intellectual, cynical."</i><br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c4571677752235403511 title="comment permalink">1/25/17, 3:28 PM</a><br><br>

Every faith has its crazies, Druidry included. <br><br>Marcu, at this point it's a matter of surfing the wave, and trying to get as far ahead of the rush as you can. <br><br>Violet, good heavens -- I hope you manage a full recovery. That's got to be challenging. Still, you're right; that's the way life is. <br><br>Mh505, I'm delighted to hear that. I trust you'll be writing to your government to urge them to support having NATO entirely paid for by the European nations it protects, so that the 70% of its funding currently paid by the US can stay here and go to paving our roads or something. <br><br>Emmanuel, of course that's the issue, isn't it? Collapse isn't an instant event -- it unfolds over historical time, which means that people who are born well after it begins will die of old age long before it's over with. So you, like everyone else, has to live in three worlds -- the remaining scraps of the old world, the nascent fragments of the new world, and the chaotic realm of transitions between them. <br><br>Justin, and collective visions can't be imposed from without. They emerge organically in a society, starting from the fringes and working their way toward the affluent center. As for <i>Revolt Against the Modern World</i>, no, you read it correctly -- you're just remembering the first half more than the second, and it's the second that fed into his practical activities before the war. <br><br>Unknown, the "big one" began in 1914 and will probably end sometime after 2150. This is one of many downward lurches that play a role in that overall pattern. <br><br>MindfulEcologist, thanks for posting that bit of Schumacher! Anything by him is worth reading, and rereading. <br><br>James, understood. The thing is, shame isn't particularly useful. The important thing is to get up each morning and say, "Okay, given the situation I find myself in here and now, what can I do that will help?"<br><br>Marinhomelander, I admit I've long thought of NPR as the blue equivalent of Faux News. Hadn't heard your version of the acronym, though. <br><br>Jay, thank you. Could you possibly put that last bit of your comment -- the part about what you can do, rather than what you have, being the thing that matters -- on the business end of a branding iron, and apply it to the overly tender posteriors of those who don't get it?

I applaud your courage in trying to rhetorically slap people into facing reality.<br><br>I have been thinking lately (and this does pertain somewhat to this week's topic) that it seems to me that some people read Spengler (and other writers who talk about historical cycles) and think to themselves that we can break the cycle somehow and have a permanently enduring civilization. For example, you have talked in the past on this blog about how caesarism is coming, and many of the comments essentially ask, what can we do to stop it?<br><br>The answer is, you don't stop it. Can't. Just as ice turns to liquid when temperature and pressure conditions are right, democracy turns to caesarism when the conditions are right. Just how it goes. Spengler was more of a descriptivist than a prescriptivist. Or to put it another way: "Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it; those who do learn from history are doomed to stand around helplessly watching everyone else repeat it". (That joke is not original with me, by the way, but I am not sure whom to credit it to).<br><br>And now it seems caesarism is here, or very nearly so. No, I am <i>not</i> comparing Trump to Hitler or Mussolini. But even as recently as just a few days ago, the media was speculating what Trump's base would do when he inevitably betrays them and continues with business as usual, e.g. not building that wall, not having a moratorium on immigration from Muslim countries, etc., etc... <br><br>But much to their surprise, Trump has already signed executive orders starting the wall-building process and immigration restriction. Never mind that allocating money to build the wall would fall under the traditional purview of Congress. He is moving ahead with his plans while Congress and the media rage impotently from the sidelines. There is no doubt much to object to with Trump, but business as usual does not seem to be on the menu.<br><br>And here in deep-red country I can attest that his base is <i>eating it up</i>, at least so far, approvingly sharing videos and memes on social media of D.C. riot police pepper-spraying the "snowflakes". It's not a world I ever truly expected to live in. Yet here we are.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c7063744278326081441 title="comment permalink">1/25/17, 4:14 PM</a><br><br>

I complete 80 years this year, if I live that long, and have very few people in my life who want to even hear about what is obviously happening, let alone discuss it or attempt to plan for it. Railing against is all they seem to know. I, too, contributed my huge share to this decline and fall and take full responsibility for my ignorant part.

Right now AI is becoming a real thing - it's an absolutely terrifying technology, probably only matched by nuclear weapons or engineered viruses. Perhaps this is rationalization, but no amount of human comfort is worth the horrors that AI could unleash on the world in an attempt to create a world without sin.

But it seems that during the Bush administration, when the corporation for public broadcasting was having its budget cut they did two things that changed them. First they jumped on the corporate sponsorship bandwagon , and somewhere in a dark back room they agreed to toe the neoliberal party line to keep the funding that they still got from the federal government. I have a bit of an inside insight in to this as the CEO of NPR in the mid 2000s lived on the same floor as me in my freshman college dorm way back in the 80's. She was ousted from NPR because of some political correctness scandal or other, but the inside story from friends who keep in touch with her is that she was ousted because she would not follow the Neocon playbook. She was a Russian Scholar before her stint in public radio, and had spent more than a decade in the old Soviet Union and Russia before her rise to fame in broadcasting, and she refused to jump on the Russia demonization campaign that now characterizes NPR. Whenever I listen to this station it seems like its main job is to sooth the nerves of the salary class.

And what about the maintenance guys? If revolutionaries are kicking in doors, how many of the people in your life will you have to take with you?’ The questioning continued. In the end, most agreed they couldn’t run.”'<br><br>Here in the Philippines, it's still fairly common for people to grow food in their own backyard. Rural folks, having not much money, actually pay their doctors in live animals. We get a lot of American TV here, including "doomsday prep" shows.

Trump issues executive orders that entire states find offensive, e.g. attacking the "sanctuary city" status of California population centers and striking down state emissions regulations, among others.<br><br>2. States respond by simply refusing to comply. California seems most likely here, maybe accompanied by Oregon and Washington.<br><br>3. The federal government responds by withholding all federal funds.<br><br>4. These states, seeing that their federal tax dollars no longer serve them, ask their citizens to redirect money owed to the IRS to state coffers instead, to make up for the lost federal programs.<br><br>5. It's not far from this point to a formal declaration of secession, and California in particular might be able to weather it economically.<br><br>6.

So...outright civil war seems unlikely, though I can imagine loyal factions withing seceding states/regions launching an insurgency with covert support from Washington.<br><br>I'm interested to hear your thoughts on such a sequence. It is seemingly increasingly likely to me, though it could be prevented or delayed if either:<br><br>--would-be rebel states decide to cave to federal demands in order to preserve the status quo - definitely a possibility, or<br><br>--Trump is reigned in by his own party, with whom he currently has a tenuous alliance. Rank-and-file Republicans are eager to utilize Trump's ascendancy to push through their policy agenda, but at the same time they don't want to see national order disrupted, and they may break with him, forcing an impeachment or other scandal if his behavior becomes too dictatorial.<br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c2906315809022765452 title="comment permalink">1/25/17, 6:20 PM</a><br><br>

As I recall one of the criticisms of Spengler was that he held an overly deterministic view of history, ignoring the unpredictable role that human initiative plays <i>at all times</i>.

One of your bleaker posts, but an accurate appraisal IMO, and timely. These are bleak times, in so many ways, and the trajectory has been clear to so many of us for quite some time.<br><br>When I first began to realize what was coming, over a decade ago, I decided that the most important work I could do was to learn how to go about relating to the world around me, however it presented itself, in a more effective way. Personally, I chose Buddhist meditation as a way to alter the way I related to my surroundings. Instead of childishly insisting those surroundings conform to my demands, I sought to conform my own expectations to whatever was happening around me. This kind of opening to the world-as-it-is seems to me to be the very first skill so many would do well to learn.<br><br>If one needs to feel like one is in control, if one feels like the world around them must be a certain way for them to be happy, indeed if one makes happiness is one's goal in life, this is a terrific way of ensuring one will experience more than one's share of suffering.<br><br>I think there are many approaches that would be suitable aside from meditation, of course - I can attest that I'm much more able to 'roll with the punches' and not so reactive, not so demanding of my environment, not so needy. And not quite so pessimistic or scared, despite our grim collective outlook.<br><br>I also acted, of course: divested myself of the normal (aka absurdly extravagant) lifestyle that my culture had tricked me into pursuing at one time, took 'simplify' as my mantra, dug deeply (literally!) into permaculture and organic gardening, natural building, yoga, volunteering, teaching fitness on the side, and developing local-community-oriented skills - all an ongoing process, with still a very long way to go. But what a wonderful ride it's been! Especially in terms of the people I've met and come to know.<br><br>The point I'm trying to make, is that for me, and perhaps for others, jumping right into 'doing' wasn't really possible, or at least effective, until I'd slowed down and spent some serious time 'being.' I do think what often gets missed in our 'rush' to collapse is the dire need to tend one's inner life - spiritual, emotional, relational and psychological - as carefully and attentively as one's garden - as though one's very life may depend on it. For as you point out, in the end, it well may.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c8572174631984690636 title="comment permalink">1/25/17, 7:19 PM</a><br><br>

Nonetheless, I believe that just as there is a useful distinction between what is technically possible and economically possible, there is a useful distinction between what is economically possible for a society and what is politically possible. <br><br>Contrary to what you have suggested, I don't think a conscious controlled and politically directed return to a lower tech and less resource intensive society has ever been politically possible. People did not want it and still don't. This makes it politically impossible. Restraint is like death, it will come certainly ... but we all hope it will be later and we certainly don't want others forcing it on us. This discounting of the future is a typical human trait. Nonetheless, it is possible for a minority to rise above it. Many people did give simpler living an honest try back in the 70s. I think you were one of them. Few people stayed the course though. The reasons are simple enough; first among them is that significantly lower energy use implies a difficult life in poverty. We like our comforts. <br><br>I'm not suggesting nothing can be done politically on a small scale. As an example, our rural Township is in the process of relaxing its bylaw forbidding people from keeping livestock on properties less than 5 acres. This political change is real in local terms (it directly affects my supply of goat's milk traded for eggs) but still trivial on a larger scale.<br><br>But the basic course of action will still remain what it has been for the last 40 years or more i.e. burn all the fossil fuels we can and toast the planet. We are not following this course for lack of understanding of the problem (politicians did read the Club of Rome Reports, the are aware of the ecological movement etc.) or because solutions were not presented in a positive enough way (it hard to put a pretty face on poverty). <br><br>Governments may officially deny peak oil and/or climate change but they do this not out of ignorance but because they know we will shoot the messenger if they told the truth. 40+ years of oil wars are proof governments understand the global reality of oil depletion. These wars also demonstrate what they understand what is politically possible for them to do about it. As for climate change, climate weirding is evident enough to anyone. We in representative democracies just don't have political systems capable of the sort of long range planning or accountability required to address these sorts of fundamental problems and we didn't 40 years ago. Politicians survive by giving people what they want in the short term, not by giving them what they need in the long term.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c4093073253839797640 title="comment permalink">1/25/17, 7:55 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, the Trumpotus rumpus is something to see. <br><br>I guess people will rationalize whatever major problems manifest in the next 2-3 years as Trump problems, so there are quite a few more "let's elect someone to get us back to normal" elections in our future. The ability of many in our society to pretend everything's normal, even when it's not, is going to be YUGE. So we're looking at an ever decreasing pool of people not personally touched by actual problems, and an ever increasing pool of people doing the best they can to manage. The best I think we can hope for is that this process plays out slowly, and that normalcy bias keeps us hoping for better days while we do our best to adjust to circumstances. Kind of like adjusting to old age. There may well be an unfortunate encounter with a marauding war band in my future, but I'm going to continue hoping that I go out peacefully, working in the garden.

Bingo! They're all on the same team, and it's not yours. <br><br>There are a lot of good comments already this week, and I can't wait to read more of them. I think a lot of people here are trying to adapt to how things WILL be, but feel lonely because people around them are oblivious and uncomprehending.

I've told you before, but you really are a bright spot in my life.<br><br>I, like a previous commenter, have been financially unsuccessful for most of my life, mostly due to my choice of "career" - bicycle mechanic. Lately, I find that seasonal employment as same really cuts into the time I need to do things that MATTER, like gardening, preserving food, fixing my house, and riding my bike (instead of working on someone else's). I've experimented with self-employment as a bike mechanic, and while I get little business, I can make $25-30 an hour working at a calm and leisurely pace in my own very-well-equipped shop, vs. $13 an hour (this with almost 30 years' experience) in a bike shop with constant pressure to work faster. Poverty is nothing to glamorize, but in my case lack of money takes away the temptation to spend it on frivolous things; working in my own shop allows me to devote my attention to my work, and not to (my boss') profit, and to enjoy the quiet, almost holy sense of calm that comes with this. We can learn things from adversity; with any luck, we can share what we learn.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c5422602715643833392 title="comment permalink">1/25/17, 8:36 PM</a><br><br>

I am far from tasks needing done, and its not worth walking. Wonderful, because eight to ten months of the year I am going all out farming and net working. It takes a couple months to read up on heavy books and practice short hand, when there is nothing for a man to do, but sit around and think. <br><br>After eight years I am still not a great farmer, but I know about more ways to screw things up than most farmers who think they are good know. That's the problem with land owners and successful farmers, they learn what works and they do it. I never had land nor have I ever had enough faith in my ability to make a profit, so I have played at farming a lot. For those years a rich world and a silver tongue meant that many failures never cost my flesh. So today, I feel prepared to be an assistant farmer, friend and ally at no fewer than five farms with in walking distance. I show up, get fed, get products that won't sell, by blemish or by law; sometimes cash too. Though I might work long days, alot of it is in conversation, and experimenting with doing things cheaply. Turns out a lot of times the cheap way doesn't work, but I rarely have much money, nor do other farmers, and I have focused on keeping things alive with out tools or equipment. Lot to learn though, and I am grateful to real farmers with a farmers disposition, rather than a flutter fly like myself.<br><br>I have very few material resources, and my skill set isn't really that impressive, I am neither super industrious nor a firm foundation. And yet I feel ready, as ready as my heart needs to be, for these times. Those will better material resources than me I pity, so much to loose. And though I admire the craftsman, I wonder how weighed down he is by the craft. And though not a firm foundation, farms are thick with that kind, and needful of philosophers who pull weeds, and who find useful little things to do unbidden as they wander around the farm. I am glad I established a basic level of trust with so many before the suspicion of dark days settled in.<br><br>A weird creature I have become, not what my pride imagined I would become to bare collapse, but what collapse has shaped.<br><br>Strangely I am actually deeply comforted by the Trump election, knowing full well this can all go pear shaped. He acts like a leader of a collapsing society, and that is easy to process in a way that listening to Obama (who I really find very charming in affect) say that things are getting better, and I don't even know if he believes him self, or where the tangle is.<br><br>After all of that, the real thing worth saying is that finding a sense of meaning is the most important thing. When pointlessness settles in, forget about it. Reading Zarathustra again is very important to me, and finding those stories that make me fall in love with Life and Earth and Wisdom all over again.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c992564723593732615 title="comment permalink">1/25/17, 8:47 PM</a><br><br>

I so look forward to my two days of dance classes every week.

The once-venerable store had been open since the late sixties, its decor remarkably unchanged since then. By the year 2000, it was completely in a death spiral, locked in grave competition with the piano dealer in the next town for the last of the affluent, McMansion-owning, salary class, piano buyers. <br><br>I'm glad I went, of course, because it would have been rude not to pay a last visit, but it had me in tears afterward when I was alone in my car.

A long time ago you posted about living with your parents and gardening and it really touched me.

As a professional workaholic, I keep forgetting that my lack of progress in "getting ahead" financially is not due to any lack of hard work and competence on my part. This post reminded me I need to stop blaming myself for not being able to afford a house no matter how successful my business gets and not gaining any traction even though I'm as thrifty as they come, buying used, cooking healthy meals for four on $40 a week or less, and cutting my dad's and my husband's hair. As for myself, my hair is down to my behind and it's going to stay that way until I die because hair "fashions" especially women's hair fashions, are yet another unnecessary expense everyone takes for granted. I am happy and grateful for my giant hair and I'm glad I don't have to worry about cutting it.

People who have never experienced this aspect of religion, metaphysics, ritual, or magic have no idea how concrete and tangible the experiences are. We get asked "Do you believe in magic?" or "Do you believe in that stuff?" all the time. I heard a great answer, and it would probably benefit some of the Christians I know as well who have felt the hand of God in their lives, and it's just as relevant to your situation.

I can still remember when my first boyfriend’s brother pulled the vinyl out of its sleeve waving it in the air with a smile on his face and said ‘wait until you hear this’ and promptly played it. Now, so many decades later I live with an audiofile and we’ve played this exact song - tube amps and all. <br><br>Backlash it is, and round and round we go. Later this morning on the phone with my mother; she used the word surreal. Collapse now and avoid the rush was June 2012 the same month as my bankruptcy so that blog is pretty much memorized by now, and any sense of entitlement was pretty well beaten out of me. Stunned as I was, I embarked on a full time four year learning curve. I never did return to my career or my old life. The cognitive dissonance has faded as of late, I’ve worked through all 12 steps in relation to loss and recovery, but with each new story, I must admit the potential future outcomes dog me until once again, I find my center. <br><br>I learned the word fungible from you. I have been let out of prison, the place where so many still sit – there are no victims only volunteers – and they all suffer from the yeah butt disease and want to tell me ‘this is all happening because…” but never the word oil is mentioned, or doing with less, those words simply cannot be uttered. And yet in my heart I know “There was always an alternative—deliberately downshifting out of the embarrassing extravagance that counts for normal lifestyles in the industrial world these days, accepting more restricted ways of living in order to leave a better world for our descendants—but not enough people were willing to accept that alternative to make a difference while there was still a chance.”<br><br>The two tough realizations this past week were; when Adam Smith began to put forth his ideas, the second law of thermodynamics was not yet discovered, and while listening to Dmitry on a podcast he used geological terminology I was not familiar with (in relation to coastal nuclear power plants) and learned about how retreating glaciers are transforming land masses (rates of uplift due to glacial isostatic adjustment around the world) which the upside I suppose is that D.C. is sinking. <br><br>Even in the quietest moments, there are no words for how this affects me so I go outside to observe. I noticed today the wild rabbits (that have found a home here) prune the goose berry bushes in a way that is positive for both rabbits and gooseberries. I plan to take a few cuttings and start a gooseberry planting over in what we have now come to call rabbit village. I’ve learned there is no such thing as deserve, only negotiate, so way out here in the middle of nowhere with a hand full of ethics, few expectations, and keeping our heads low, if the negotiations don’t work out there’s always meditation, and my stellar hospitality featuring death camas quiche. I do my best to quell the hysteria many of my friends and family from the NE are presently experiencing and since they’re in the yeah butt crowd I sum it up by saying “well, circumstances have actions in this upside down world, hang in there”. <br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c6022347155764580059 title="comment permalink">1/25/17, 10:11 PM</a><br><br>

There's definitely a large number of the Kubler-Ross stages of grief, except the last one so far. <br><br>One of the biggest things that got undermined for mainstream US liberals is their own form of American exceptionalism, that its presidents are for the most part worthy of respect (W. Bush, Nixon, and a couple of others perhaps excluded), and that we have an economy and ingrained liberal values that will keep us all safe, despite occasional setbacks, and that the US is a force for good around the world that is inevitably becoming more peaceful, liberal and democratic, even if some of the interventions don't go as planned and end up producing atrocities of their own. They're suffering a very abrupt collapse in their own faith in the country and the religion of progress that was really believable to anyone who never went to rural areas and deindustrialized working-class cities. I became disillusioned gradually several years ago and slowly lost my faith in progress (with your help), but theirs has hit abruptly, and disillusioned people act in irrational ways until they finally come to grips with reality, for those who ever do.<br><br>And the US truly was exceptional in many ways. In the North and Midwest, the system of education that started in the 1840s produced by far the highest literacy rates the world had ever seen up to that point. Our economy eclipsed Britain's in absolute terms in the 1970s and per-capita not long thereafter. Depending on what you were looking at, the US was the "best" country in the world to live in from at least the post-Civil War era, going on for over a century. That started changing with deindustrialization, rising healthcare costs, and declining education. Now we're just #1 in military spending and other imperial excesses, and we're at or near the bottom of the developed world in all the things that actually make people satisfied. It's no longer anything like the best country in the world to live in.<br><br>Still, affluent liberals in their middle-management jobs, jobs with tech startups, and ivory towers could easily think like things on the ground weren't getting worse for most people in any meaningful way. Progress was still real to them. And now the first openly declinist candidate in history shows up and ekes out a win, showing that discussing the decline was actually popular and speaking to people's negative concerns while being as politically incorrect as possible was a possible path to the presidency. The belief in the progress of humans onward and upward in freedom and equality (and outer space!) suddenly can't be maintained. Not only that, they have to confront their deep unpopularity in the population at large.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c5256445543414759457 title="comment permalink">1/25/17, 10:34 PM</a><br><br>

Whatever. I have to say that I think that he is not really that important when set against what JMG talks about in this week's essay. Trump is not a cause but an effect of the times that we are living in. Perhaps a catalytic effect but just another bit player so now may be a good time to mostly ignore him and get back to the big questions. After all, big questions gets you big answers.<br><br> Down the track historians are going to have to sit down and work out what it was in the DNA of Western civilisation that led it to destroy itself and have such a cataclysmic effect on the planet. Maybe it was because after centuries of exploring and exploiting new frontiers, the trouble started when all the frontiers ran out and it had to turn in on itself. Maybe it was because in the past century or so Western people had forgotten or no longer cared about the value of human life. Maybe the answers will be found in the historical parchments of the Greater Appalachian Theocratic Republic's Library in a few centuries time - in the chapter after the one called 'Prophets without Honour' where JMG will likely be listed. Ask me in a couple centuries time.<br><br> Point is, as our host has pointed out, that we are way, way past the point of no return. I am hoping though that maybe now is not so much a time of slow collapse but a time of a fighting retreat. I could live with that thought. Now is the time to analyse this civilisation's collapse and understand how we got where we are. The trick is to pull the signal out of all the overwhelming noise in the air at the moment whether it being leftists allying themselves with muslims, an alt-right that most people had not even heard about till last year, false news that only now people are noticing, liberals endorsing the CIA or mental meltdowns of people because they did not get what they wanted. That last one, by the way, is most instructive and probably rates as signal rather than noise. When will there be a better time to work out how we got here? Otherwise, just wake me up when there is an outbreak of common sense and someone like Tulsi Gabbard is sworn in as President.<br><br> Our host finished off his essay with the colloquial English phrase "It sucks to lose". Perhaps a different, and more poignant phrase about the passing of what we hold dear might be more appropriate when a movie character refers to how "All those moments will be lost in time...like tears in rain."<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c6623420243858836626 title="comment permalink">1/25/17, 10:38 PM</a><br><br>

I recall reading somebody talking about the burst of enlightenment that jolted them out of New Left revolutionary circles in the 1970s; "I realized that there was no way I could bring down the system that would be faster than the speed at which the system is already going to bring itself down."<br><br>Rapier, at 65, why not watch the spectacle? <br><br>Peter, I've been to the LA airport, and I can imagine the spectacle! <br><br>Troy, exactly. Trump is a quintessentially American Caesar, watching himself on a big screen TV in the Oval Office. I've also talked to his supporters out here in flyover country, many of whom are feeling a little bit dazed just now; they were braced for the possibility that Trump would betray them the way Obama did, and ditch his campaign promises in favor of four more years of business as usual -- and they're amazed and delighted that he's actually building the wall, axing the trade treaties, doing what he promised. If he keeps it up the Democrats are going to have a very hard row to hoe come 2020. <br><br>Jeff, #1 is correct, though I'll have some political commentary from time to time as we proceed. #2 -- well, I'd considered it, but the people who are willing to consider what I have to say already get it, and those who need to hear it aren't willing to listen. <br><br>Beetleswamp, fortunately last week wasn't just people freaking out, though there was some of that. We also managed to have a very lively and, on the whole, courteous conversation in which a great many diverse voices got heard. <br><br>Dave Z, nothing's different this time. I'm not talking about fast collapse now, any more than I was in the past. Trump's election is not going to bring about the end of the world; neither is the breakup of the Larsen C ice sheet, or any of the other things I mentioned. The immediate consequences of any sudden shock will be more or less damped out by a variety of means. It's the long ragged descent into the deindustrial dark ages -- the thing I've been talking about all along, you know -- that's taken another rather visible step forward and down. <br><br>Justin, so noted! "Interesting," though, is a value judgment and thus subjective; me, I also find rig counts and EROEI interesting...<br><br>Crone, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Raymond, funny!

As I noted a year ago, the insistence on the part of his opponents that he's stupid says far more about their choice of hate speech than it does about him. He's anything but stupid; he's clearly realized that he has to seize the initiative and keep it, forcing everyone else to react to him rather than giving them a time to pursue their own agendas, in order to keep from being dragged to a halt by the bureaucratic inertia of Washington DC. <br><br>Dayton, do you know if he's written anything?

The huge swings in petroleum prices from 2004 to the present are driven by that; so are the increasingly intractable and (to economists) inexplicable problems with the economy -- mainstream economists don't know how to take into account the way that declining net energy acts as a stealth tax on all economic activity.

One thing that hasn't even begun to sink in yet is that as things get difficult, a lot of people in the world's nonindustrial nations are going to be in much better shape than people in the industrial world, because the former know how to get by without the industrial economy and the latter don't. <br><br>John, I didn't say the Mongols were cartoon villains.

A broad brush paints the future more effectively. <br><br>Repent, exactly. We simply don't know what's going to happen next -- not in detail, and the big picture isn't necessarily precise enough to give guidance. <br><br>Pygmycory, I hope you're right.

"When in danger and in doubt, run in circles, scream and shout" seems to be the order of the day. <br><br>Cynndara, thank you. That's very good to hear. <br><br>Mister R., that's a useful approach! Still, I don't know that I expect anything to snap people out of their ignorance. Enlightenment happens one person at a time, and it takes a lot of work! <br><br>DoubtingThomas, Spengler is deterministic the same way that it's deterministic to say "you are going to die someday and, if you live long enough, you'll get old first." The comparison's exact: he was talking about the life cycle of human societies, and demonstrates with plenty of evidence that (a) there is such a thing and (b) it has stages as predictable as childhood, puberty, maturity, and old age in the life cycle of the human individual. The life can be lived well or ill, and there's an element of freedom in the choices that bring one or the other about...but you can't choose not to age and die, you know. As for enlightenment, individually it's always an option. Collectively? Show me an example, or join the long, long line of people down through the ages who have waited in vain for some deus ex machina to bail them out from the consequences of their own actions. <br><br>Jay, no argument there.

You are right, much will be lost, and there's no way to wrap your head around what's coming. We can postulate and intellectualize collapse, but when people start dying in high numbers, there's no way to prepare for that in advance. <br><br>I did want to point out some of us have been experiencing loss for a very long time already. I have heard a few voices in the environmental movement, perplexed by a new environmentalism, where wind farms and solar farms are always good things, no matter where they are placed. I figured it out. The new environmentalism is the urban environmentalism. As all the wilderness has been eaten up by "progress", fewer people ever even saw wilderness in their entire lives. I can tell you, walking on the paved path of a little park in the suburbs is not wilderness, no matter how many pruned, disease-controlled, and fire-managed trees there are. Standing in a pasture in a deeply rural area is not wilderness, but it's a little closer. Those of us who have seen truly wild places and fell in love have been watching the systematic torture and destruction of the wild for a very long time. No matter what happens, I will find joy in the blades of grass breaking through the old sidewalks and the trees growing through the walls of what used to be buildings. I can't guarantee I will live long enough to watch decay and renewal outpace bulldozers and destruction, but I really want to. <br><br>If you deeply fear what is coming, go outside and walk. Look at the plants and animals. They even live in cities, but they are small and hard to find. Look at the birds. Look at the life. Maybe you will recognize it for what it is when you see it growing back, the resilience, the determination to survive, the triumphs and tragedies that happen every day, the spider and the butterfly. I saw footage of penguins surfing huge waves to be smashed up onto cliffs twenty feet high. They kept smashing into the jagged rocks and falling back into the rough sea to try again, smashing up into the cliffs again and again until they finally reached the top, to the only place in the world where they lay their eggs. I saw that and said,"There's an animal determined to live! The entire species evolved to do THAT!" <br><br>As a culture, we collectively have no idea what we've lost, what the cost was of all this progress. The last people who remember grew up at the very edges of the rural areas, looking outward onto vast reaches of wild and dangerous land and water. These last people are all heartbroken. They watch more and more beauty ripped apart as mountaintops are removed to mine coal and forests are clearcut for every imaginable wood and paper product, and even the ocean is choked to clogging with plastic. With decline, all of this recedes. The best thing we can possibly do for our ecosystem is leave it alone. Slowly, life will come back and new species will fill niches left by the old, but even before then, the wilds will encroach on everything we leave behind. Look for that, look for the easing of our collective land-use footprints as abandoned shopping malls collapse and their parking lots grow grass again. There will be many moments of astonishment and opportunities for joy, even amidst the loss. Look for it, for as our hubris is washed away by forces of nature, wild and rugged beauty will return. Don't give up hope yet, for the next epoch's tigers and woolly mammoths have not yet been born. If you are looking for the signs of collapse around you, keep an eye out for the corresponding signs of renewal and regeneration. If you learn to see it, it will feed your soul in a way industrial civilization never could. <br><br>Sincerely,<br>Jessi Thompson<br>anotheramethyst<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c506819657778647952 title="comment permalink">1/25/17, 11:38 PM</a><br><br>

One of the things that drives that return is a recognition that if you live in a troubled age, you need to cultivate ways to deal with that, and spirituality has plenty to offer in that department. <br><br>Paulo, that's certainly one way to approach things! <br><br>Logan, that's why I specified a thousand years in the future. Admittedly, 1500 years might have been a better interval. <br><br>Peakfuture, I do seem to be reaching some people, a scattering here and there, but there's no identifying sign -- predictably; I'm an eccentric, I attract those who are just as odd as I am, and in the best Discordian fashion, we don't stick together, we stick apart. <br><br>Gwizard, true enough. Of course it's necessary to let the grieving happen rather than forcing a simulacrum of it -- a lot of the culture of perpetual whining we have here in the US is a function of the endless repetition of simulated grief, which is acted out but not actually felt. Come to think of it, that applies to a huge range of faux-emotions and faux-passions. <br><br>Whitecloak, single-issue politics are among the core forces that have landed us in the mess we're in. I hope you'll educate yourself about a broader range of issues -- you'll find that support for the enforcement of immigration laws (which I also favor, btw) is compatible with quite a wide range of views. <br><br>Agent, we've been through this before. I don't know for a fact that the sustainability movement of the 1970s could have succeeded, but I also don't know for a fact that it had to fail. It seems to me that insisting on the latter, when nobody knows the truth of the matter, is a sop for sore consciences. To my mind, it's much more useful, not to mention accurate, to say, "No one knows whether it could have worked or not," and accept whatever responsibility each of us might have had for its failure. <br><br>Mark, actually, I think it'll work out best if the process is irregular in space and time -- some people getting clobbered fast, others having the time to learn from the experience. Fortunately that seems to be what we're most likely to get. <br><br>Pygmycory, I won't argue. As I noted in the post, some things of real value are going to be lost. <br><br>Tokyodamage, funny!

That's just it -- collapsing is a process, not a destination, and none of us will ever know everything we need to know as we surf the wave of decline and fall. <br><br>Astroplethorama, thanks for the link. <br><br>M, you're welcome and thank you. I can empathize; my wife's health has deteriorated enough that a lot of the things we'd hoped to do when we moved to the Rust Belt are no longer an option, and we're having to consider relocating in order to get easier access to some of the resources we'll need as age sets in. Life is change, and you do what you have to do. <br><br>Dennis, excellent! I hear Mark Zuckerberg is being touted as a potential presidential candidate, so your Democrat Trump may not be hard to find. <br><br>Donald, I agree with your second point, but only one-third of your first. Dissolution is inevitable, but autocracy and tyranny, not so much -- though a lot of people are going to have to relearn the hard art of taking responsibility for the consequences of their own choices if those are to be avoided. More on this in a future post. <br><br>Wendy, delighted to hear it! Over and above the other benefits, it's good to take time away from doom from time to time...<br><br>Mary, thanks for this. I agree wholeheartedly that coming to terms with death is crucial; I've had more than my share of such experiences, but of course not everyone else has. <br><br>Drhooves, you may well be right about the dollar, but it's still possible for another rabbit or two to be pulled out of a hat. A lot of people expected the dollar to collapse completely in the wake of the 2008 crash. <br><br>Candace, good. It sounds as though you're moving in a productive direction. <br><br>NomadicBeer, you can't avoid the rush; you might still be able to get ahead of it, if you get a move on. <br><br>Robin, to my mind, it's already biting. I expect it to bite much harder in the years immediately ahead -- but be very, very wary of predictions that start from that fact and jump straight to sudden collapse!<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c491664652610201431 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 12:25 AM</a><br><br>

I've often wondered about the insulin issue, given a few friends and family members need it. It seems to me that given that insulin production has happened for longer than I originally thought, it would seem viable that a modern person with time, access to info and tools, should be able to work out how to do it if folks could do it a century (however long) ago. It would be one more thing to do on a list that's already long for anyone, and more promising, as we all question what skills we could learn for trade, insulin production might have a few customers.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c8378907057117622094 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 12:42 AM</a><br><br>

He talked about the great abundance of oil we're witnessing at the moment and this is keeping prices down. According to him the global oil and gas industry has provable access and extraction to a vast amount of oil and gas up to at least 2050, four to five times as much oil and gas as we actually need. That was really good, he mentioned in an aside, because China and India are gonna need an awful lot of energy as they adopt western lifestyle, not least in relation to tranport where hundreds of millions of electric cars are soon going to be rollin', rollin', rollin' on hundreds of thousands of miles of roads leading us in comfort towards a bright and better future, without a bump in sight.<br><br>Well, I'm glad that's been cleared up by BP's analyst.

In the supermarkets of our rather-expensive little medieval market town, customers are finding empty shelves where their (unseasonable) salad leaves and soft fruit "should" be, thanks to the cold and furious weather currently battering southern Europe, where most of these things are grown. What they're not realising is that not only are these harvests failing, but the farmers are unable to plant the crops for future months too, as many agricultural areas are flooded (with the soil washing straight down into the Mediterranean, as there are no longer any trees to hold it in place) so one's dinner-party menus are going to be constrained for some time... <br><br>We're a long way from actual hunger, and there are plenty of unfashionable home-grown vegetables like cabbage and beets available, but prices are edging upwards rather faster than the official inflation figures suggest, and people seem very unwilling to join the dots and realise that this situation, which can only be exacerbated by Brexit, may not be a temporary blip in their comfortable lifestyles. So I'm planning what to plant in our little polytunnel, bought to house our bantams during the avian flu scare, and assuming that the birds will be able to return to free-range in Spring when the danger is past. And I'm eyeing up all available window-sill space; there may come a day when any available goods no longer get delivered to "rural" areas outside the main cities, as the roads disintegrate further and all the people with money return to places where there are still centralised services like properly-staffed schools, hospitals and rubbish (trash) collections, and it may be closer than we’d like to think...<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c9039754748695532501 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 2:18 AM</a><br><br>

Even if I get the wood gas generators up and happening (looking increasingly unlikely), I still have to cut timber to power the them.<br>While your demagogues are unlikely to affect us directly, it really is depressing to see what is now more than ten years of effort come to essentially nothing.

That would last around one generation before it starts again.<br><br>For the context:<br>Côte d'Ivoire went through a bloody civil war (nicely called post-electoral crisis) lasting from 2002 to 2011. A Rebel army fought the Security Forces, and both fought the population. <br>French army settled the matter.<br>Current president is thus the one supported by the Rebel army.

Thus they attack ex-Security Forces mutineers and kill some.<br>25th Jan ex-Rebel make a public apology for the inconvenience, but you know, "we really deserve that money"<br>Meanwhile the national football team lost in the continental championship(AFCON), all civil servants have been striking since 1st Jan (hospitals, administration, schools...)<br>Private schools are attacked by student unions to convince them to participate in the strike and to rob some wallets and phones too.<br>4 crocodiles died in Yamoussoukro, CI is represented in Seoul's chocolate fair, Bingerville celebrates their best students, ruined small investors peacefully demonstrate in town.<br><br>News look like this in such a context, plus all the rumors spreading like wild fire.<br>1/2<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c6730003000206969387 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 2:35 AM</a><br><br>

Having been ransomed by police once, I now avoid anything that wears a uniform and a Kalashnikov. I also avoid groups of people I don't know, and join groups I know ASAP.<br>I never disclose my home location or give personal details.<br>All houses are protected by walls higher than 3m crowned by barbwire or electric fences and guarded 24/7. Wealthy neighborhoods are walled around the walled houses and guarded too. This is the wall century, looks pretty medieval though mail and helmet would look nicer than those yellow uniforms ;-)<br>I've also learned to locate the source of gunshots by watching the birds. All those walls make it difficult to locate the source of a bang.<br>Nonetheless, life is rather peaceful, and as long as you are prudent, informed, discreet, and avoid the places where you don't belong, it's fine.<br><br>Daily life when you're normal:<br>You earn between 100$ and 200$ a month. Life is expensive as tomatoes, rice and onions are priced like in Europe. Cigarettes are cheap though.<br>You can afford a one or two rooms house for your family of 6-10 (parents, wife, children). Luckily, your wife makes some money by selling water plastic bags and skin bleach in the market and your cousins from the village can still provide some vegetables.<br>You have running water quite often, prepaid electricity for light and radio, and a butane bottle for cooking( thank god, you can afford it, coal is so awful). <br>You and your kids (some will die) get sick quite often: malaria, worms, typhus, gastro-intestinal problems, infections. Hospital is expensive (don't bother, they're striking now)<br>Violence is rather low, though the tailor in your street has been killed last week by microbes(machete wielding kids in search of a living and a meaning). Two of those microbes have been caught and lynched this morning by the way, pity you weren't there.<br>Your kids go to the public school (currently striking) and your elder daughter(15yo) now pregnant must marry, but the guy is nowhere to be found. You had to borrow 300000 XOF(3mo salary) from your employer to pay for the school supplies and uniforms.<br>Day in day out, life is good, much better than 10 years ago when you had to flee your ancestral country side village, burnt to the ground.<br>You have a job, a house, a wife, food on the table once a day and can occasionally enjoy a beer (koutoukou is cheaper and stronger, but you don't dare since those 12 guys died poisoned by methanol). <br><br>If you're poor or disabled, may god have mercy.<br><br>2/2<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c8342565147254742574 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 2:35 AM</a><br><br>

One skill I have learned since starting the collapse is how to brew beer and whiskey from straight grain. My production far exceeds my consumption, so I'm slowly stocking up on distilled spirits of many kinds, which I see as currency in the coming collapse. It also serves as an excellent barter item (yesterday, the guy who I buy my meat chickens from called and said he'd shot a 7-point buck and asked if I'd like it; of course; all I have to do is pay for the processing fee around $60, and I will brew him a 5-gallon batch of beer). Sort of my personal savings account. I am fortunate to have a large basement, despite living in Florida, and it makes an excellent fermentation/distillation laboratory. I could store literally thousands of jars of liquor and plan to do just that.<br><br>Meanwhile, my wife, who is also participating in the collapse process, but not as whole-heartedly (she refuses to use the clothesline and still dries our clothes with an electric dryer), is reminding me that her 50th birthday is coming up and urging me to save money so we can take a trip to the keys. I will comply and admittedly we will likely come back with a lot of good fish for the larder, but it seems so frivolous. We're likely to spend $1000, which could be better used for debt retirement (we're about 11 years away from complete absence of debt).<br><br>I am hoping against hope for a slow collapse so I can finish paying off my debts before my job gets tossed into the dust bin. Five more years and I'm done paying for my children's education, so I've got to make at least five more.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c9064218154652002188 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 5:28 AM</a><br><br>

Behind a facade of hallucinatory paper wealth, our nation is effectively bankrupt.<br><br>...That disproportionate share came to us via unbalanced patterns of exchange hardwired into the global economy, and enforced at gunpoint by the military garrisons we keep in more than a hundred countries worldwide.<br><br>and from last weeks comments:<br><br>"Unknown Mox, hmm. I well recall the level of partisan nastiness during and after the 1980, 1992, 2000, and 2008 elections, and this seems more extreme to me. As for NATO, the US currently pays 70% of NATO's operating expenses, and also maintains massive military formations and armaments on its own nickel that are only relevant to the defense of Europe. Europe is going to have to pick up those costs, because we can't afford it any more." <br><br>"NomadicBeer, the relation between social class in the US and US imperial hegemony is complex enough that it probably needs a post of its own. As for Europe paying for its own defense, er, you might want to look at the share of NATO's budget that the US pays, and the amount of our military that's specifically geared to the defense of Europe."<br><br>"Latefall, that's kind of my take on Le Pen, too, but we'll see. With regard to defense expenditures, when European nations start covering more than half of NATO's expenses, I'll gladly amend my views! The crucial point here is that we can't afford to keep paying for Europe's safety -- the US is falling apart economically. Europeans are going to have to step up to the plate, because we're broke."<br><br>"Colin, excellent! Then I trust you'll contact your government and propose that it pursue a policy of having all the expenses of NATO being paid by European nations, instead of having 70% paid by the US, as is the case today."<br><br>Although you mention that things are 'enforced at gunpoint', in the last couple of posts the 'enforcement' idea is outweighed by the number of references to the US defending other countries and 'paying for Europe's safety; is it your opinion that the US cares about the safety of other countries or do you think it is merely a cost they have been paying to keep the wealth-pump flowing in their direction?<br><br>I don't know, but it seems to me that describing the USA as the defender of Europe and other countries where it has garrisons is not accurate and it may be more about keeping everyone else in line for their own benefit.<br><br>I've seen people say that the USA feeds the world, and the idea seems almost like an unquestioned truth. Does the idea of the USA paying to defend everyone else fall into a similar category of truth that is not actually truth? Perhaps it just gives the empire's unaffordable military spending and garrisons an Orwellian language twist? <br>"Trust us, we're here to keep you safe, but you're going to need to pay for us to do that."<br>Be interesting to see how it works out.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c341774391135851648 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 6:22 AM</a><br><br>

Although us teenagers in 70s Saskatoon were into them from the get go. “Now they’re planning the crime of the century...”, no kidding.<br><br>I’ve been reading your books, the ADR and comments for years now and have never felt moved to add my 2 cents. Apparently the time has come. The reason I was drawn to the blog and have remained a faithful reader for all these years is that your broad analysis of where we are as a society and where we are going is more often than not spot on. Using history, the limits to growth, erudition and common sense as your guide you’re able to illuminate our current predicaments with a rare clarity. An absence of ideological fervor is what has made it palatable for me over the long term, I always get bored with anyone who has an ideological axe to grind.<br> <br>This week’s post exemplifies why your blog remains relevant. It’s the long view and doesn’t get caught up in the heat of the moment. I have not detected any change in your tone as some commenters mentioned last week. Your use of current events and the election to illuminate the direction the USA is heading apparently struck to close to home for some readers. All of a sudden the messenger became the target and not the message.<br><br>I can imagine quite a few comments didn’t make it through last week. As soon as the name Trump is mentioned people’s eyes seem to glass over and they run for the barricades whether for or against. You were the one who opened my eyes to what Trump represents, the keyword here is “represents”. I made quite a bit of money on that insight by placing a bet on Trump shortly thereafter. In any case Trump seems to be the end of a certain type of business as usual, although that still remains to be seen and many caveats apply. Looking at Trump’s inauguration declaration from the outside I can only think that if Bernie Sanders or his equivalent had uttered those words the “left” would have been in delirium.<br><br>As one of your commenters said recently “the left left long ago” in the USA. The left (for lack of a better word) has indeed left long ago whether it be in the USA, the Netherlands (where I lived most of my adult life) or the UK (where I am now). Their betrayal of the ordinary man in the aftermath of the Reagan/Thatcher counter revolution is now complete and they are paying the price for their betrayal. John Pilger’s recent column (http://johnpilger.com/articles/this-week-the-issue-is-not-trump-it-is-ourselves-) and interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1Ho8OrBzig) are good analyses of where the responsibility for Trump’s arrival lies. It sure ain’t Trump’s fault, that much is clear.<br> <br>It’s early days yet in our Great Unravelling and the relevance of the ADR blog is that it’s a reminder to be aware that it’s all nothing personal. Our times will unfold as they will. <br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c1016300696351033803 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 6:50 AM</a><br><br>

Much in the vain of the recent news of Silcon Valley leaders purchasing doomsteads in New Zealand, Mark purchased 6000 acres in Hawaii. He has not identified this purchase on the remote side of the Island of Kauai as a doom-stead but it has all the earmarks. He ran in to trouble with the locals when he discovered that his enclave was dotted with small parcels owned by native hawaiians. He directed his lawyers to aquire these lands through sneaky legal actions. But once word got out he has recieved much negative pushback in the Islands. <br> My wife is from Hawaii, not native but third generation of japanese and korean immigrents brought in to work the pineapple fields in the late 1800's. As she will attest, native Hawaiians and most "local kine" people detest haoles from the mainland and Zuckerbergs antics reinforce their view. He even had the audacity to justify his actions by saying that he was just doing it to protect the land and the wildlife and create a nice place for his family. As you might guess this did not make the locals any more sympathetic to him. I would guess that at this moment, somewhere in the Makaha Valley the natives are sharpening a Pololu with Zuckerbergs name on it. When decline reaches the point where the jets stop coming, and the money from the mainland stops flowing , Marks time at his "estate" will be cut short.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c1454069575561210673 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>

Your example of birth/death cycles is valid although whether such a cycle is A) necessary and B) perpetually 'fixed' is a huge topic. The inevitability of death is a subject I am very open minded about. I've personally witnessed some strange things. Read of more. Longevity itself is fluid via a variety of methods and that's without reaching for the materialistic medical technological intervention realm which is exploring that in its own way.<br><br>Would you not consider the different historical secret societies ( and unions ) as collectives? Didn't some of them have enlightened members whose ideas triggered significant paradigm shifts having profound impacts? Then too we have the world' religions, which, at their root, regardless of the veracity of their respective creation myths and principle character's histories, they can be viewed as having been founded by enlightened collectives of individuals that had profound impacts in many areas. Just having an inspired thought can be enough without the full enlightenment package.<br><br>Cyclic patterns persist until something happens to cause them not to. That's where the criticism of Spengler lies. Cycles of abuse ( individual, societal, national ) for example end as individuals learn Forgiveness. Collectives of all types form. It's like going round inside a circle thinking the circle is all until someone shouts look up.<br><br>Who says I'm waiting for anyone? When I implied I was working towards having an impact pushing towards goals I believe will be beneficial I was being literal. Will I be successful? Only time will tell. The spread of any success will depend on the free will choice of those within the network effects of whatever my sphere of influence may be.<br><br>Other interesting impacts may come from 3D Printers capable of printing themselves and printing new types of electronics as well as older tech. Re-decentralising manufacturing even down to the level of a home installation and powered locally. Materials Science is not my field but the resources for such things is an ever moving target. I find it an interesting synchronicity that 3D printing and quartz wafers have recently manifested. Likewise the efficiency gains in Solar tech. A Spanish friend of mine is bummed because he dropped 100k on Solar tech 6 years ago and conversation efficiency soon after doubled. I've seen projected possibilities of 80-90%. Solar paint is an interest notion. I won't debate EROI. I'm not versed enough. Let's also not forget the thousands of secret patents waiting to come in to the light. Maybe there's good stuff to be found there. <br><br>Physics is due for a paradigm shift too.

Of course, as I am sure you are aware, the US government has not been paying for the defence of Europe out of altruism. The US government is completely indifferent to what actually happens in Europe, as is shown by events in Ukraine. The reason the US has paid for European defence is that it has been in its interest to do so. By paying for European defence it has been buying the loyalty of European governments. The fact that it can no longer afford to do this means that it can no longer afford to protect its interests in that respect.<br><br>That is why the cessation of such subsidies has led to European leaders to start bleating. They have been conducting various anti-Russian activities, such as demonising Mr Putin and Russian participation in the Middle East, as instructed by the US. Now the US government is proposing to leave them hanging.<br><br>As mh505 implied in his comment, it is clear what will happen when the US government withdraws its financial support. After the collapse of the Soviet Union there were many in Europe who hoped that links with Russia would be strengthened, even to the extent that Russia might join the EU. The US government had other ideas, and such hopes were quashed. Now, with the US lacking the wealth to bribe European governments, the situation will be different. While present European elites may find it difficult to change track over Russia, the new political parties will have no such qualms. Marine Le Pen has already declared that she intends to recognise Crimea as part of Russia. While the EU itself may well collapse, and Russia joining it may not have been realistic anyway, some other form of alliance between Russia and the rest of Europe seems highly likely.<br><br>It may well be that Trump is aware of this potential development. Russia plus the rest of Europe will be a more formidable force on the world stage than Russia alone, and losing the automatic support of Europe will weaken the US. Cutting subsidies for European defence and cosying up to Putin may well be two aspects of the same strategy. Far from 'making America great again', Trump may be deliberately cutting America down to the size it can afford, with a foreign policy to match.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c9099570666209129966 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 9:24 AM</a><br><br>

At the conferences one meets and establishes relationships with potential collaborators/employers/etc.<br>One also flies to interviews, to research sites, and to workshops such as the IPCC working sessions.<br>(and because the IPCC is run by bureaucrats at the UN, they require working sessions be held around the world in the name of fairness, so the scientists - mostly from the US and Europe - have to fly to meetings in Africa and South America at great cost/waste due to politics, and then they get ragged on for it).<br><br>Kalmus, (and Judith Curry is one who limits her flying, tho' mostly because she doesn't like it) were already senior scientists when they stopped/limited their flying, so they already had met their collaborators, etc. Relationships already started can be easily maintained via email/phone/Skype. But Kalmus is at Jet Propulsion Labs AND UCLA, with a large community there in his specialty, and uses remote sensing data for his work. Some junior peon from podunk U who does field work with plants or animals is going to need to go to conferences/field sites to be a successful scientist.<br>Think about online dating - would you marry someone without a face-to-face meeting?<br>And asking a presenter questions, both in a session during the Q&amp;A period, and then during coffee breaks, dinner can be so valuable in developing relationships and ideas. I find this face-to-face time (and listening to other's questions) quite valuable during PV conferences, so I assume in other fields it must be as well.<br><br>Some big name types, like Phil Jones, Richard Alley, etc. are often invited keynote speakers to conferences, to testify before governmental bodies, etc. Hard for them to give that up.<br><br>I deem Kalmus commendable, and others could do more, but it's not such an easy black and white issue - unless one wants climate science to come to a halt (and some do!).<br>Often conference attendees piggyback meetings/vacation time around the conference, buy offsets (which most grant agencies do NOT pay for), limit the number of conferences they attend, or other steps to minimize impact. But one rarely hears about that. (rather shocked at JMG's blanket reply that the rest of climate scientists don't care/haven't done anything).<br><br>http://www.climatecentral.org/news/climate-scientists-flying-18864<br><br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c5367351369689759875 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 12:05 PM</a><br><br>

Well digressions are a bit of a bad habit! :-)!<br><br>Speaking of digressions, there was a song yesterday by the band Cub Sport called "C'mon mess me up" which is clearly a song about a dysfunctional relationship. Despite that content, it's a nice song though and got to about number 23 I believe, so it must have resonated with people. Anyway the next few lines are probably a bit more relevant to this week's blog essay than the "logical" song:<br><br><i>"Inside was kind of misty, I knew none of the history<br>I found comfort, I fell in love with avoiding problems<br>And that was the problem<br>‘Cause I want this, you know I want this<br>So come on, mess me up"</i><br><br>I reckon it is the melt water flowing underneath those glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica which will be the vehicle by which those ice monsters will move rapidly off the land and into the water. The glaciers themselves will take quite a while to melt once they are in the water - but that is the least of the problems I reckon.<br><br>You know the tropics are pushing further south this year than I have previously noticed. It has always happened since I can recall from memories of summers as a kid, but it is the frequency and severity which has ramped up. Up north though, many inland communities have been cut off by the heavy rains and flooding and at the moment they are able to airlift in huge quantities of regular food supplies. The only roads in and out of there are dirt roads and they are impassable.<br><br>The sort of July's (your January) that I get here (very humid, cloudy and with intermittent rain) sound like the sort of weather that you are having right now.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c5327977181131813824 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 1:01 PM</a><br><br>

I feel grateful to be able to participate in this forum; it's one of the few places where I find people older than myself and walking a similar path are accessible. It feels markedly different to be wished well by people with more life experience rather than less.<br><br>@ Rita, honestly, I feel overwhelmed by treatment options. homeopathy seems like a good modality for this; my herbal skills are perhaps providing some palliative relief, but little else.<br><br>@ Patricia, that makes sense.

I relate very deeply; I've had visions of the forests conquering roads and other paved places, and only feel at ease on a certain level seeing the steady march of irrepressible life through the ruins.<br><br>@ everyone, this conversation about preparation or lack thereof is very interesting. Structurally, to prepare is to attempt to exert control. Which is useful and essential up to a point, but alas our predicament is multi-variable, convergent, and chaotic. Even with the best preparations in the world there is a very, very limited amount of control that one person, family, or community can exert on the wild movements of contingency and exigency that are flowing into our lives. A materialistic focus on skills, which define the body as a specialized tool, is incomplete without a <i>trust</i> in one's general adaptability and acceptance of death.

It can be really hard to talk about things in systems terms, and for some reason people have incredible difficulty grasping that politics, at the end of the day, is just one of the ways the various fluctuations in the biosphere and atmosphere, and in the real economy of goods and services plays out in the realm of human ecology (what one might call the "homosphere," and that Trump is no more a cause of the problems rising up around him than a particularly bad hurricane in Florida is the cause of rising sea levels and melting ice caps. It seems as though many circles of existence are interacting in volatile ways these days, all the way up to fluctuations in the "theosphere" that are better left for the other blog.<br><br>All that said, it's definitely one thing to cope with a future of scarcity, and quite another to deal with the violence and political chaos that are part of the scenery right now. My nature and my values both are putting me in a place of standing for civility and communication even as those values become inimical to pretty much all sides of the political divide. I've been very quiet lately in most of my circles of friends when it comes to the big issues facing our world because I don't really know how to speak in a way that doesn't lead to attack. When I tried to speak to both sides after the election in a call for communication and understanding I received a patronizing rant about how I was part of the problem and was enabling evil by refusing to fight it from one friend on the left, and a sputtering set of curses, threats, and insults in all capital letters from an old friend of my father's I have known my whole life for daring to admit that Trump was anything less than a hero. This morning, I tried to share this article, because it really drives home some of the points I've been trying to make: that there are bigger issues than whether we belong to the red tribe, the blue tribe, or some other and that we need to stand together in the difficult and uncertain times to come. I got... a lot of backlash for it, mostly from people insisting that the only way to prevent a difficult future was to stop Trump (as though, once again, he were a cause rather than a symptom).<br><br>I think the hardest thing about this year for me has been the confusion and isolation as I've felt core values that I hold dear being turned against each other inside myself, and trampled by others to the point that I sometimes feel as though I don't know right from wrong anymore. And as I look at both recent and distant history, I realize that this position: standing firmly in the middle, trying to listen for both sides, calling for compassion and communication in the midst of the heat and hate all around is the best way to get a target on your back as the center disappears and both sides brand you as the enemy that must be destroyed, the decision to not join an angry mob is probably the best way to reserve a space in one of those unmarked graves you mentioned, since you're choosing to at some point, risk the loss of the safety and protection those angry mobs can offer to their members as well as the suspicion of your friends and neighbors. As I hear cries that by refusing to brand a group of people as the enemy, I am through passivity and cowardice enabling and supporting other evils that I find just as abhorrent, I sometimes wonder if I'm making the right decision. Many people who I have known and loved for a long time on both sides are telling me I'm not, and I've found that I'm forced to be silent far more often than I'd like to be. I hope it doesn't come to the sort of violence that I know is a possibility, but I also know that if it does, the decision not to join in the blood frenzy is not going to be a safe decision to make... and I suppose I'm at peace with that. Though I do rather wish that the challenges of the future were going to be as simple as mere poverty.<br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c59949603024763573 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 1:25 PM</a><br><br>

This profound sadness is now a deep cutting, acute pain - a daily companion, always there in the back of the mind. How can one live with ALL this, it is like living in a mass grave, like living through one of these periods in history where you wonder how could we have ever lost our minds to commit such insane acts against life itself. Some eastern traditions talk about "living is suffering". Who is the agent that suffers, is it me or is it the suffering of the bumblebees through my act of living this affluent life? How is it to not only kill something but to wipe out every single kind of it? And what part of it is suicidal autoaggression? One can discuss things, rationalize and identify causes and effects, but then, at the end that is the rather easy part of what is about to become abundantly clear...When you say being remembered as the Huns, this is still much too charming.

It was good while it lasted, it enabled me to support a wife and young child, then it was a lifeline through a painful divorce and a struggle to prevent my ex-wife from poisoning our daughter's mind against me - though I don't often see my daughter now, when I do it's clear I still have a place in her heart. <br><br>But it is a job with no future - in a food warehouse shuttling products which are in many cases unnecessary or even harmful (tobacco, strong drink) up and down the land - we literally truck food forty miles up a motorway to a smaller warehouse so that it can be loaded into a smaller lorry and brought back down the motorway again to deliver to local stores (our lorries are too big for that...)<br><br>I'm hoping the redundancy money will cushion the transition to a simpler life with shorter work hours and less commuting and so more time to learn practical skills.<br><br>Alan (posting in the past as 'bicosse')<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c5406083774437819786 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 2:41 PM</a><br><br>

I've always wanted to have a small farm and produce most of my own food as well as making a living by selling or bartering with a dozen or so chosen households. Even though the place I live is not one in which I wish to stay a moment longer than necessary, I've begun encouraging my acquaintance who is headed down the wrong path and who is extremely unlikely to find work due to his demographics and that of the small, dying, isolated town we live in - to learn brewing, growing tobacco, and learning to build and operate ham radios. I paraphrased one of your most chilling statements: when the warrior bands come, the possession of "stuff" is a ticket to a slit throat and shallow grave, but if the town knows that J brews good beer, the town's going to keep J alive and in one piece. Those words made a deep impression. <br><br>I made a deal with a neighbor that if he pulled up and removed some fencing I didn't want, he could have the materials. No more obstacles for me, plenty of material for him. <br><br>The local woman who gives me riding lessons brought a dozen fresh eggs when she and her husband came to collect the stall mats I'd offered them at no charge (it's the least I can do as my generation sucked away all the Social Security funds), and when I asked if I could buy eggs from her on a regular basis, she turned flustered and said she preferred to share. I reminded her that if I didn't buy from her, I'd have to buy from a corporation (whose chickens do not see the sun except on their final day when they're taken out to be killed) and I'd rather buy from her. She seemed a little surprised by the notion, so I hope I planted some ideas in her head. <br><br>But I pored over the fascinating posts about the decline and fall of empires, how it happened in the past, and how it's unfolding again along familiar lines. You've also demonstrated how history and politics are joined - a connection I'd made only in the most obvious cases. The sheer quality of the writing, the challenge of reading a writer who DOESN'T phone it in with a clickbait headline, the line "So this happened...." followed by a gaggle of screen shots of other people's quotes which is what passes for mainstream news, and for a long while (sorry to say I see this facet going by the wayside) the lack of personal attacks, abusive language, and flamebaiting in the comments has kept me coming back ever since I heard you on Coast to Coast AM several years ago.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c7339491370590737894 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 3:04 PM</a><br><br>

My favorite posts have been the ones that have reminded your readers of deep time, and this one does as well, in a different way. Thank you for reminding us all to keep our eyes wide open and to pass on the knowledge worth keeping to others around us, like ripples in deep waters. I will keep on, keeping on.<br><br>Violet – I was so disheartened to hear of your recent struggles, as you have been a huge help and inspiration to me. I have visited your Winter’s Trickster website over and over, and have used information from it to treat myself and my family. Thank you for that! I, too, have chemical allergies that relate to pieces of mesh that I had inserted into my abdomen for a hernia repair, and as such cannot be removed. I am now allergic to synthetic materials and petroleum products – no synthetic fabrics, adhesives, elastics, rubber, plastics or foams for me. <br>All this to say, I have found some relief from symptoms by following a series of NAET treatments and cranial sacral therapy, both paid for on a sliding scale without insurance. I still cannot wear “regular” clothing or shoes, but I can now touch things without immediately reacting to them. I hope that being in a chemically-safe place working with Nature will be very beneficial to you, and that you will find joy in every day.<br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c8726715931584392406 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 3:25 PM</a><br><br>

So, they were looking for/attempting to do CO2 to fuel.<br>They seem to be surprised that things worked better than expected - indeed, in the real world, that is surprising.<br>But it wasn't an "accident".<br><br>Hint #2 for generalist, non-scientific readers: look for actual numbers of efficiency.<br>One finds 63% max efficiency. Now, is that good? They start from electricity, so how does that compare with batteries?<br>Nickel-Iron batteries are that efficient, and most batteries are more efficient, lithium ion batteries into 90+% efficient.<br><br>Hint #3: do some (sub-)systems thinking, what are the "goes intos" and "comes out ofs" and how would this be used?<br>How does it compare with alternative ways of doing the same things?<br>((re-)read part 1 of JMG's Green Wizardry).<br><br>They take CO2 and electricity and convert to ethanol, a fuel and chemical feedstock.<br>Where can the CO2 come from?<br>Natural gas wells (byproduct), Natural gas reformers (hydrogen production), fossil fuel burning power plants, fossil fuel burning vehicles.<br>Cement production, glass production, biogas combustion, fermentation, volcanos, open geothermal wells, the air.<br>Do you get peak FF (fossil fuels) is basically now? So the first line of sources is a dead end.<br>Without cheap FF (or cheap renewables), cement and glass production decline.<br>Without cheap FF based fertilizer/farming/transport, concentrated animal feed operations (large-scale biogas) goes away.<br>The EROEI of corn ethanol is essentially 1, so when the cheap FF subsidy goes away, so goes much large scale fermentation.<br>Volcanos seem too difficult, open geothermal wells intermittent/dirty, the air is expensive to use.<br>Uhhhh - well, gee, kinda hard to get this to work without cheap renewable electricity (solar/wind).<br>But if you have cheap renewable electricity, just use batteries for transport.<br>And if you don't have cheap renewable electricity, "it sucks to lose".<br><br>For feedstock, bacteria ferment many things into lactic acid, and/or yeast make ethanol well enough from many sources.<br>(without a large economy, chemical feedstock demand will be much reduced).<br><br>Hint #4: look for lifetime and reliability issues.<br>They ran a cell for 6 hours. Don't get your hopes up.<br><br>My take: interesting electro-catalytic and materials science, but most probably no practical impact.<br>But they may get to fly to a conference and give a paper on it. ;^)<br>(so maybe a net negative impact).<br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c405301111821757788 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 4:57 PM</a><br><br>

It’s like we’ve just been kidding ourselves - the loss of easy access to liquid fuels is still going to hurt like hell, and that sure seems a corollary of what you’ve written this week..."<br><br>There is a Buddhist proverb: "Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water." It speaks volumes, and if you like to contemplate things, this phrase packs a big punch. In our case it could just as easily mean "Before industrialization, chop wood, carry water. After industrialization, chop wood, carry water." A fossil-fuel free world is a world with a lot of human labor requirements. Remember, if you are making a living growing food, then in the future you will have food to trade for some of that labor. Ultimately, though, we will all be working a lot harder without the fossil fuels to leverage our efforts. However, don't let this discourage you from the successes you have already had. You are doing so well!! And you realize where the fossil fuel inputs are. Please don't get discouraged, because you have already done so much!! Take a step back and look at how far you've already come, you're well past half way, it's like being past the point of no return, on the dark side of the moon. Though the way forward seems scary and uncertain, look to your past successes and appreciate what you've accomplished, and slowly ways forward will emerge from the future darkness.

Yes, you have to use fossil fuels now; that's inevitable given the current state of society. At the same time, you've learned skills that will allow you to adapt, step by step, as the fossil fuels dry up, and you and everyone else have to work around intermittent shortages and price spikes that eventually become permanent.

The thing is, it's at least possible that Trump's core constituencies will benefit enough from the reapportionment of national wealth that's in process that they'll be happy -- though that just means that the people who've benefited most from neoliberal economics over the last thirty years will pay the price of those improvements. In the longer run, we're all headed for hard times, but very few people think about the longer run these days.<br><br>TerminalOne, that's a hard choice. It's one that some people are going to have to make, though. <br><br>Fred, there are any number of ways that the flurry of immediate action coming out of the White House can be interpreted, and Scott Adams' way is certainly one of them. Me, I prefer to use metaphors from military and political strategy. A skilled general or politician seizes the initiative and never lets the other side take it back, so they're so busy responding to his moves that they never have time to try anything of their own. Trump seems to get that, and if he keeps it up -- and he may well do so -- I'm not sure his opponents in either party will be able to sustain any kind of coherent resistance to him. <br><br>Matt, that makes sense. One of the downsides of the fact that I've spent my entire adult life being aware of the impending decline and fall of our civilization is that there are ways I really don't grasp the state of mind of those people who have convinced themselves that history owes our species a glorious future out there among the stars, or what have you. (You might be interested to know that I've thought through how I would react if something were to happen to prevent the Long Descent and give our civilization the kind of "long tail" that, say, ancient Egypt or traditional China had, some thousands of years of relative stability; I think I'd deal with it pretty well.) <br><br>Izzy, better a lobster than a mock turtle! <br><br>Mh505, but the point I made, to which you were originally responding, is that the US currently pays billions of dollars a year into that obsolete institution, and that's not going to be happening for much longer. I expect to see the US and Britain retain their historic military ties, but the rest of Europe is on its own. Will that be to its advantage, as you suggest? We'll see.<br><br>Compound F, I understand not having people to talk about these things with. Why do you think I founded this blog? <br><br>Jo, excellent! It's not something anyone can do in a hurry, but making the effort is a great way to get working on the learning curve. You might find the recommended reading in my book "Green Wizardry" helpful. <br><br>Phil, I'd use the phrase "America's Enver Hoxha" regularly, except that so few people would get it. Another way of saying the same thing is to suggest that the grand old word "Caudillo" may deserve renewed use. I've been saying for years that the United States is a third world country, so why are people surprised that we now have third world politics? <br><br>Sub, I'd suggest a middle course.

I recently started a new job, surrounded by engineer types that talk unironically about the Kurtzweilian future. I have to think that my internal narrative as collapse-accepting "reactionary" must be suppressed to some extent by the fact that I have to interact in a civil and cooperative manner with people who believe that we will one day upload ourselves into computers and play the 400th World of Warcraft expansion pack forever.<br><br>I think back to the early days of YouTube, in 2005 or so, as a teenager in a solidly upper-middle class part of town with my own computer. I watched a lot of conspiracy documentaries... 9/11 truth type stuff especially and although I never fully accepted any one narrative about what exactly happened on the fateful Tuesday, I came to believe that the official story (which if we're strict, was a theory about a conspiracy... a conspiracy theory if you will) contained serious lies.<br><br>Even though I became a 'peak oil person' in 2008 or so, I credit that to the early days of Youtube and the fundamental, but painful realization that society might be operating on false premises. Of course, I haven't really done much about peak oil other than staying in shape (a strong back will always be worth something), and half-heartedly pursued an engineering career in order to make enough money to buy property before the game ends, which is going "ok".<br><br>So I guess what I am trying to say is that I've gotten comfortable shifting between multiple models of the world. It's kind of strange to seriously discuss the implications of consciousness uploading into machines and the issue of duplicates, etc, and genuinely enjoy the experience, but at the same time not believing those machines are going to be around in 30 years. Of course, like many teenagers from decades before mine feared nuclear war, I feared the technocratic managerial state. So like I said before there are aspects of decline and fall that I can only ever see as positive.<br><br>I think this is why I like Evola so much, the idea that everyone would have the same mental model of the world, and the same basic idea of what's going on is profoundly appealing to me considering my experiences.<br><br>I'll add a note about insulin: Check out Jason Fung's website - it's about the medical effects of fasting, which can reverse Type II diabetes. For any readers with Type II diabetes, it might be good to experiment this stuff while the medical industry is still largely functioning.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c6742276393999897918 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 6:49 PM</a><br><br>

Doom! Gloom! We’re all gonna die! I love it. :))<br><br>JMG - While I liked your comment that we’re all going down and there ain’t nothin’ we can do about it, I liked your response in the comments section better. We all live limited amount of time. Yes, we’re all going to die. But it’s not so much the limited quantity of time, but rather the quality with which we live it. Beautiful concept.<br><br>Really, this post covered a couple things - the end of the American Empire and the end of the industrial age. The two may be concurrent, but they are not necessarily the same. I would posit that the end of the American Empire would arrive sooner or later regardless of fossil fuel production. It’s more a matter of economics and changing political fortunes. The decline in fossil fuel production is icing on the cake.<br><br>Similarly, the decline in the American standard of living is also somewhat dissociated with the impending end of the industrial age. The US has been living about 20% above what it can actually afford. Again, you rightly point out that this has been allowed without Zimbabwe-like consequences because of the dollar’s reserve currency status. I don’t think the end results will be as sanguine as the Russian debt default, however. Pension plans, insurance companies and other wealth preservation vehicles are heavily tied to US Treasury debt, bringing in many people who otherwise think they have no skin in the game. Likewise, a large amount of debt in non-US countries is denominated in US dollars. A US default would have significant, if not catastrophic, affect on their economies. If the US defaults, effectively the global economy defaults.<br><br>The end game on this is not how you put it - “extravagant lifestyles available to affluent Americans in recent decades will be going away” - but rather the extravagant lifestyles available to _all_ Americans (except the truly destitute) will be going away. No bones about it, we all live like royalty in this country compare to the majority of the global population.<br><br>As for the rumored demise of NPR, etc., I’ll believe it when I see it. Congress has the power of the purse, and the President cannot cancel a program they have seen fit to fund. Many other presidents have tried and failed. If it does come to pass, I wouldn’t immediately attribute it to the twilight years of civilization, but rather the inevitable march of time. Does anyone remember RKO? Major player in the radio era who quickly faded as television took over.<br><br>Two nits in an otherwise well composed post.<br><br>(1) “The fraction of US adults of working age who are permanently outside the work force is at an all-time high.” The US Bureau of Labor and Statistics puts the current labor participation rate at a bit over 62%. This translates into 38% outside the workforce. Compare that to the 58% participation rate in 1954 (42% outside the workforce). If you take it as the _number_ of US adults outside the workforce, then, yes, it is at an all time high.<br><br>(2) “The only way to stop anthropogenic climate change in its tracks is to stop putting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.” From what I understand, greenhouse gases are a leading indicator. We could zero all fossil fuel combustion and package all the cow flatulence in the world and we would still get increasing temperatures for the next century or so until the carbon cycle caught up. You’ve mentioned this before, so I’m surprised this one slipped by.<br><br>Thanks for the excellent work and always thought provoking posts.<br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c4414407983576942138 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 8:53 PM</a><br><br>

I let through a post advocating vegetarianism, and posted a relatively mild dissent of my own, and all of a sudden the inbox is full of pro-vegetarian rants, some of them quite remarkably vicious in tone, as well as some more reasonable responses. Fair enough; the subject is closed, and I will plan on enjoying a cheeseburger shortly. If my vegetarian readers want to be able to discuss their diets on this forum, they might want to work on basic courtesy. <br><br>Lawfish, it might also be wise to start sharing your production with friends and neighbors, so that lots of people know that you're a good person to befriend.<br><br>Kara, I get that -- the dread of the coming changes is at least partly balanced by the end of the uncertainty. Here they are, and now we can buckle down and deal.<br><br>Jeffrey, yes, I've noticed that too. It's quite impressively clear just how deeply rooted all those ideals of tolerance and nonviolence actually were...<br><br>Earthworm, I certainly didn't mean to suggest that the US was being altruistic in paying most of the costs of NATO. For all practical purposes, altruism does not exist in international politics; it's always about national interests and advantage. The fact remains that the US, for its own purposes, has supported a state of affairs in which it pays the lion's share of NATO expenses, and a great deal more in the way of military preparations solely relevant to the defense of Europe -- and that's going away. How Europe will deal with the resulting changes is ultimately up to Europeans.<br><br>Philip, thank you! Yes, I feel rather as though we've climbed aboard the roller coaster and sat there while the cars were hauled all the way up to the top of the thing, and now we're over the crest and starting to zoom down, down, down! It promises to be a wild ride.<br><br>Vedant, last I checked, chaos is already here, in various places and various forms. Remember that we're not facing a sudden collapse but a Long Descent. As for turning CO2 into ethanol, sure -- but because of the laws of thermodynamics, you have to pur more energy into that process than you'll get by burning the ethanol. Where's the energy going to come from? <br><br>Allie, yep. The sense of invulnerability on the part of some people these days is, in a certain bleak sense, impressive. <br><br>Whitecloak, fair enough. I sometimes think that what the current political landscape needs is a party or movement that deliberately embraces points of view officially assigned to a range of different points on the spectrum, just to mess with people's heads. <br><br>Indus56, those are valid questions. First, yes, I still consider the Long Descent hypothesis better justified than the fast-collapse theory, in that it has already succeeded in predicting events accurately for some years now, where fast-collapse theories have failed to do so. I'd point out that a difference of scale is not a difference of kind, and the mere fact that the political and economic networks that are crumbling at this point are global rather than, say, continental, doesn't require any particular difference in the process of unraveling. As for your second question, that's a very complex issue, and will probably need to be dealt with in a future post.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c4070665989809585497 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 8:57 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you! <br><br>Clay, oh, I know. My stepmother is Hawaiian Japanese, and I'd agree that Zuckerberg won't survive long enough to be shot by his bodyguards, the way so many of the elite will be once the rule of law collapses completely and the guys who actually tote the guns decide that they'd rather have all the nice stuff themselves, thank you. A pololu would be elegant and traditional, and much less messy than the spray of full-auto gunfire that'll take care of the others. <br><br>Rita, watching the current crop of politicians occasionally makes me wistful for medieval warlords. They might slaughter every inhabitant of your village but at least they wouldn't spout moralizing cant while they're doing it. <br><br>Sgage, hah! Nicely phrased. <br><br>Wolfbay, only if someone other than the current leadership takes it over. Mind you, that's fairly likely at this point, and if Donald Trump inspires Democrats to take their party back from the neoconservatives who've hijacked it, he'll have done at least one genuinely good thing for this country. <br><br>Ploughboy, true enough. Back when I was a good deal younger, I belonged to a Grange in Seattle that had some members who lived through the Great Depression as kids, and they remember musicians traveling from one Grange hall to another in farm country, playing dance music and getting some cash and plenty to eat and drink in payment. It wasn't a bad gig, at a time when a lot of people were suffering. <br><br>DoubtingThomas, you might be interested to know that the insistence that there must be some way out of the cycle reliably pops up at certain points in the cycle. Yes, we're in one of those just now. More generally, lots of people these days like to insist that the laws of nature can't possibly apply to them if that means they don't get what they want -- a lot of the recent talk about a paradigm shift in physics being "overdue" (as though those are delivered on schedule) amounts to that. I chalk it up to an overdeveloped sense of entitlement. <br><br>Asr and Weedananda, you're most welcome! <br><br>Shark, that's what Spengler says -- the Second Religiosity emerges when the previous era of rationalism fails to live up to its promises, and people have to deal with the awkward fact that the world will not turn into Utopia no matter how many intellectuals believe it will do so. <br><br>Doug, of course it's not altruism. Still, the extent to which European leaders have been insisting at the top of their lungs that the new administration has to keep supporting NATO suggests that they, at least, may not be particularly sanguine about the end of that arrangement. As for "making America great again," from my perspective, America came closest to greatness when it stayed out of other nations' business and focused, however clumsily and half-heartedly, on solving its own problems -- and I think a prompt withdrawal of US troops from Europe and US funds from NATO would be a fine step in that direction.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c2356309929769513181 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 9:21 PM</a><br><br>

I'd point out that a gift for patience and serenity is a very definite kind of giftedness, and one that used to be highly respected. <br><br>LL Pete, you know, I wish people could say "I hate him" without dragging in the faux medical diagnoses. <br><br>DoubtingThomas, it's normally a very good test of the sincerity of someone's beliefs to see if they walk their talk. A person who claims to believe in racial equality, for example, but displays obvious bigotry toward people of this or that race is fairly likely to be a hypocrite. In exactly the same way, if climate scientists believe what they're saying about the cataclysmic impact of anthropogenic climate change and the need to cut carbon emissions at once, then why aren't they themselves willing to do so where they can make a difference first, in their own lives? (I say this, by the way, as someone who's entirely convinced that anthropogenic climate change is real and a massive crisis -- but then I don't own a car and use much less than half as much energy as the average American, and am still working on further cuts.) <br><br>BFM, the post I wrote on the subject is <a href=../../2012/11/deterrence-in-age-of-decline.html rel=nofollow>here</a>, and I still think it's accurate. As I noted there, it's quite possible that some nukes are going to fly as things wind down; it's by no means impossible, for example, that the rising tensions right now between India and Pakistan could end in a flurry of mushroom clouds and the deaths of tens of millions of people on the subcontinent, plus fallout deaths elsewhere. My argument is that the logic of deterrence among the major nuclear powers will be strengthened by decline to such an extent that a global nuclear war is spectacularly unlikely. <br><br>RPC, <a href="http://us.karnacbooks.com/product/twilights-last-gleaming/34386/?MATCH=1" rel=nofollow>I suppose I could</a>. ;-)<br><br>Dfr2010, delighted to hear it. Thank you. <br><br>Dltrammel, exactly. I've been saying for years now that the moment the rule of law goes away, the rich people in their doomsteads are going to suffer sudden fatal weapons-related accidents, because their bodyguards have absolutely nothing to gain by continuing to protect their charges, and everything to gain by gunning them down and taking over all the stored wealth themselves. The green wizard who can hand the bodyguards a beer each and say, "I can make as much more of this as you want, as long as I can get the barley and hops," is going to make a lot of new friends. <br><br>Carolyn, those last two sentences of yours should be written in letters of flame, you know. It's when people say that, and then do it, that great things happen. Go ye forth and do that thing. <br><br>Nathan, thanks for this! Musk is a smart guy, no question.

Dissensus and diversity of ideas is just plain more fun than the kind of mental monoculture so common in today's society!<br><br>Pygmycory, delighted to hear it. That makes four. <br><br>Cherokee, where Greenland's concerned, it's worse than that. The weight of the ice has turned Greenland into a huge shallow bowl which is filling up with water, and ice floats. When there's enough meltwater built up, some very large portion of the Greenland ice cap will very likely surge all at once into the north Atlantic, filling it with thousands of square miles of melting icebergs, shutting down navigation, and doing a number on the Gulf Stream. As for Europe, sure -- I'm hoping that they can restrict their wars to their own continent from here on. <br><br>Wendy, you're welcome and thank you as well. I appreciate hearing this. <br><br>Eric, the one way around that kind of isolation I know of is to see if a broader movement of the center, based on a principled rejection of extremism, can be put together. My musings about an alt-center have that as a central theme. If it's not just you -- if the mobs from both sides have to contend with an organized opposition willing to push back hard against mob rule in the name of civility and the rule of law -- much can be done. I'm going to keep exploring this, and see where it goes. <br><br>Mike, I hadn't heard that before! It's playing on the background now.

At this point, the demographic groups that were most likely to have started such a war -- the well-armed rural working class, with their very large proportion of veterans -- are by and large cheering Trump on, and seem to feel once again that they have something to hope for from the American system. Thus we're in very unpredictable territory, and I'm going to wait until I have a better idea of how things shake out under the Trump administration before I try to second-guess this country's future. <br><br>Bob, thanks for this. <br><br>Shane, or the Ghost of America Yet To Come murmuring weird ideas in both our ears as we sleep... ;-)<br><br>Justin, interesting. I find the thought of that kind of consensus profoundly unappealing -- rather like eating Velveeta sandwiches on Wonder Bread for the rest of eternity. The diversity of opinion and worldview in today's society appeals to me, and helps make up for the less welcome features of modernity -- though I know it's on its way out in due time.

Definitely related to this week’s post. Watching this video I was struck by how often he seemed to end up inside dualism traps. <br>It was especially interesting to have read Epictetus’s Handbook (thanks @Daniel Najib) just before watching Dr. Peterson, whose impassioned New Year’s letter to the World seemed full of the kind of suffering that people such as Epictetus, Gautama Buddha, and Byron Katie have pointed out is caused by attaching to our own story, belief or interpretation of events. Comparing the peaceful, joyful and often compassionate humor of people who practice awareness of their thinking with the intense suffering Dr. Peterson is demonstrating about the current world situation, I myself prefer practices that lead to some measure of peaceful acceptance of reality as it is, with some acknowledgment of the range of our own human behavior and an reflection on our place in this universe. <br>From Dr. Peterson: Sex is either the impulsive short term gratification of a domineering biological instinct or the union of two conscious spirits taking responsibility for what they are doing.<br>What happened to the FUN part? Heck, even the Stoics had more humor. I was delighted with this great image below about sheep from Epictetus: <br>46. . . . So that if ever any talk should happen among the unlearned concerning philosophic theorems, be you, for the most part, silent. For there is great danger in immediately throwing out what you have not digested. And, if anyone tells you that you know nothing, and you are not nettled at it, then you may be sure that you have begun your business. For sheep don't throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten; but, inwardly digesting their food, they outwardly produce wool and milk. Thus, therefore, do you likewise not show theorems to the unlearned, but the actions produced by them after they have been digested.<br>Granted, I this was the first time I have read Epictetus, so I am probably doing exactly what he cautions against, throwing up something I haven’t properly digested. ;) <br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c2063430321796294303 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 10:41 PM</a><br><br>

Not much room for all the other possible historical twists we have been discussing in this blog.<br>Thanks to reading this blog, and having created an impossible and magnificent reading list, I have come to be aware of many of the things our host has pointed out. If I recall, he posited that a chambermaid living during the French Terrors would have probably not been aware of the historical relevance or even many of the events of the time. Even during the 14th century, which had such notable events as the Black Death, nobility marching everywhere, trashing the countryside and either asking their peasants to destroy crops to prevent other armies from profiting, or taxing their peasants heavily to pay for endless wars (and even more luxurious silks for their horses and banners, and special commemorative dishes for their Crusades), even then families were raised, crops were harvested, and guilds and universities continued. For an interesting read about chaotic and calamitous times and relevant parallels to issues our host discusses, I recommend A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous Century by Barbara Tuchman. I definitely got a feel for how ‘elites’ had no concern about the peasant class, how much turmoil mercenary armies cause, and how different factions constantly maneuver for their own interests.<br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c628795580217635563 title="comment permalink">1/26/17, 10:43 PM</a><br><br>

She can, however respond intelligently to the degree that she can (she knows when something's funny and when she's being talked or written about). However, with her being alive everything is held up in Limbo, and while your idea of giving away half of everything (although the saints you talk about gave everything and lived on donated crumbs...not a bad idea, and had I been born Catholic I would probably have taken on such a calling) is great, I can't give away what I don't have.

But today we're so comfortable it's literally killing us, and although the fortunate may avoid acute injury, violence is truly everywhere, and from molecular to global scales.

Sure, people may well have senses of entitlement which causes them to come a cropper. Also, maybe "lots of people " do " like to insist that the laws of nature can't possibly apply to them if that means they don't get what they want". I would find that odd &amp; childish behaviour.<br><br>I have done and seen things that the "laws of nature" as documented, generally known &amp; understood might struggle to explain or accept but I don't believe I advocated anything anti-laws of nature - however incomplete/changeable our knowledge of such things can be - so I'm not sure where that comment fits in to this dialogue.<br><br>Physics being due a paradigm shift, well my read is that it probably is. The History of Science is populated with such things. If other people are commenting similarly then nice, I guess, good to know other people are seeing the possibilities. Just as some people saw clues that other's rejected of the 2008 financial collapse and positioned themselves accordingly.<br><br>I don't have the time to follow everything but there are interesting movements in gravity, quantum theory and the materials sciences. Recently, the Parallel Interacting Universes Theory (Phys. Rev. X 4, 041013 ) caught my eye, published a couple of years ago which might be a good candidate for being tested and may open up the possibility of our universe being open in some way although I wouldn't presume to state the implications of that if the theory is validated I'll leave that to my more interested acquaintances. <br><br>You asked me for examples of enlightened collectives. I gave them. You haven't responded to those points so I'll presume they were acceptable.<br><br>I'm sure there are people who insist there are ways out of cycles within the cycle. Some may have been reacting from fear. Others unable to see a way. Yet others maybe saw a way and took it. I agree with Adorno's criticism about Spengler missing the role of initiative. I'm not saying Spengler isn't useful but I think it would be a mistake for me to ignore his critics particularly given my own experience and understanding of systemic cycles at all sorts of levels and scales. I'm not saying everyone is able to or will break from a specific cycle they are caught up in but cycles are at some point broken and something new happens and that likely involves inspirational initiative. As you know, the worse prison is the one in our head and leads to self fulfilling prophecies.<br><br>Projections from Historical Simulations are an unreliable indicator of the future particularly as the time horizon increases. If that actually worked then investment banks would never lose money. It's funny one of your commenters on the previous post were trying to convince me that people don't change.

Due to no fault of my own, for the last thirty-five years, I have suffered permanent ill health having been poisoned by a prescribed drug. (I don't speak of my trials.) In my studies preparing to become an Episcopalian/Anglican (Christianity, for those not knowing), I am trying to decide which saint to emulate. I am reading Julian of Norwich (1342-1416). Julian died in her 70s, likely relying on the Benedictine tradition.<br><br>When it came to loss, Julian saw half of the people of her town of Norwich die from The Plague.

It is not something I would have chosen to spend my time doing. Dying is old hat. While putting on my underpants every morning, I ask in a Zen way: "Are these the underpants I will die in?" As what happened to Julian, I try to imagine one of every two people I ever knew die. Oh, I already have. It's called Old Age, and every one of the relatives I cared for has died, the last one in 2013. Not half, but ALL. I am the eldest standing.<br><br>I will die in turn, whether civilization crumbles simultaneously, or not. I am too old to respond to a declining civilization. There is no way to prepare for the Black Death before it happens. The point is to, no matter what life dishes out, when one falls, do one of two things: (1) get up—and smile; or (2) help someone else get up—and help them smile. I don't mean literally getting up. Merely holding a hand can be "a getting up." Sometimes it means "smiling while crying."<br><br>JMG, by writing your blog, you help me get me on my feet every week, and smile. Nobody can depress me because I already survived "half of a town dropping dead." I get up, put on my face, and smile.

Since marriage ages were young, we can expect most adults were thus in two-person, single-income households -- and thus slash our workforce participation rate in half vs modern levels to reflect the stay-at-homes.<br><br>Today, the vast majority are in either in dual-income/two-person, or single-person/single-income households-- everybody wants to work-- we would need to (very)* roughly double the workforce participation rate vs 1950s levels to equal 1950s levels of employment relative to the actual labour pool.<br><br>*(Yes, I know I'm simplifying; an actual doubling would obviously be impossible since the 1950s rate was over 50% -- because the reactionary ideal and feminist bugbear 1950s are a myth, and some women were in the workforce even then. Still, even if you assume half of women were in the workforce, 2016 does not come off seeming the better time to look for work, or for labour's bargaining power.)<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c6319565241330995711 title="comment permalink">1/27/17, 5:05 AM</a><br><br>

In particular, he actually has a similar view on the subject as Noam Chomsky; how it grew out of post-modernism and the marxists who finally figured out that the soviet union was not a great model in the 70s. However, he sounds like he thinks marxist ideas inevitably lead to gulags which seems a bit reactionary. I don't consider myself a marxist, but I think did a good job of diagnosing some of the major problems of capitalism even if it does not offer great solutions for these problems. I strongly agree with JMGs critique of marxists in last week's post. Most of the marxists I know are people you would not want to share an apartment with let alone work on commune with. As David Sedaris said, most of them thought when the revolution came they would be the ones holding the clip boards. But Peterson's of dismissal of marxist thought seems a bit antithetical to the open discourse he is calling for and the economics departments (arguably where such a bias matters more in this context) are certainly not hot beds of marxist thinkers. I still enjoy what he has to say, because I understand where he is coming from. College campuses have gotten out of control.<br><br>Anyone who enjoy Peterson should check out dissident feminist Camille Paglia. She has a lot of great criticisms of gender and women's studies programs as well as feminism and PC culture. She will have a new book out in a few months JMG which I hope will turn the conversation about feminism and gender issues in a more positive direction. She also sees history as cyclical and thinks our culture is in a late decadent phase. Here is an interview with her.<br><br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlYR1isM2o8<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c8413030752906021728 title="comment permalink">1/27/17, 5:26 AM</a><br><br>

As others have suggested, I have found that I need to continually reassess my direction in life to see whether or not it aligns with where we should be heading in the years ahead. Like another commenter mentioned, I've had to take time away from TAR for months at a time for mental health reasons. Sometimes I wind up healing and becoming too optomistic and end up making plans that don't align with green wizard values. Then I come back and reassess. Unfortunately with a family, there's more people in the decision-making process and you can wind up in gridlock as well. We'll see. Also: I would be interested to see what you have to say about personal finance, as you mentioned savings vanishing or dropping drastically in value. If you have a book recommendation on the topic I'd love to hear it.<br><br>Jess<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c5577531144466031659 title="comment permalink">1/27/17, 5:26 AM</a><br><br>

It's been a year and a half since I've been in the US, and it looks like someone's taken the brakes off the roller coaster and loosened all the wheels. <br>After seeing pictures of the posters "A woman's place is in the resistance" from the woman's march, and now all the fawning over the rogue NASA and rogue National Parks Twitter accounts (which I am seeing via Facebook, which is enough brain damage for me, Twitter is over the edge of stupid) - I can't help but think that framing collapse and voluntary poverty as a way to fight the Evil Empire and stick it to the man would inspire more people. Personally I have a hard time with the green wizard thing. Being from 1978, it's entirely likely that I have seen Star Wars a few too many times, but I would much rather fight the retreat under the banner of a Resilience Underground or some such. <br>I too have no one to speak of these things with, my husband swings between tech/political fixes and "we're all gonna die; where should we go on vacation this summer?" Makes me nuts. He was outraged by my lack of surprise at Trump's election. I just wish I'd bet on it. Nonetheless we've moved out of the metropolis and to a merchant town founded in the 9th century, bought a house from the 30s with a big backyard and established fruit trees (and a root cellar!), and I've dropped hospital and intensive care nursing for district nursing. I'm honing my skills at caring for diabetic foot ulcers and amputations, among other things - things are gonna get ugly if kids don't start taking care of their elders here in Scandinavian welfare-land. I have a side job doing translations, I knit and I sew for myself and my kids - next up is upping my game in the garden, and I want to learn more about herbal medicine, it seems like a natural next step in terms of my established career.

Paths are narrowing, the narrow bridge we walk in life has missing planks and no safety rails.

The situation is all sorts of bad and will only get worse.<br><br>This puts issues meaning and choice into a stark relief. Questions like "why should I bother?" or "what can I do?" become more haunting. Are ethics more important than survival? Are there any safe choices? Is there any way out of this predicament? <br><br>The sense of personal responsibility is great with these sorts of questions, the outlook grim. There can be paralyzing indecision with the knowledge that one's very survival will entirely depend on unforeseen causality.

For those of you left of center who live in ostensibly blue states, the most productive cause you can immerse yourself if and lend all your efforts is secession. Take a look at the red/blue map. Look very carefully at the blue islands in a sea of red. Look at what parts of the country are predominately blue: the West Coast and New England. Both have active secession movements--all the West Coast states, and Second Vermont Republic is seeing a renaissance. Take another close look at the map and politics and realize how futile it is to change minds in red America, and you're not really even trying at this point, either. Now, I know there are anomalies, like NM and Colo--that can't be helped. Yes, I know that all the talking heads pooh pooh the idea, but they also pooh poohed Trump as well. This is the one place where you can have as big an impact as the Trump presidency on the nation. Think how dramatic it would be if the secession prop passes in Calif, not to mention other states. Yes, I know it may not be recognized as legitimate this go around, but this is how ideas go from fringe to mainstream to inevitable. Secession is a way you can be on the right side of history, instead of fighting it. Also, as Whitecloak mentioned, this is something we can totally support you on. Most of us strongly believe in federalism and local control. For those of us in what was the Confederacy, we still have painful memories of being forced back into the Union during Reconstruction and being turned into an internal colony by the Feds. That's all the reminder we need to put us in a good mood about secession. Forget all the financial concerns, "giving" vs. "taking" states, population &amp; sustainability--we won't really know until we divide just how the economic cookie crumbles, and any federal program, law, or constitutional provision can be recreated and any treaty can acknowledge trade, etc. Now is time for the liberal blues to give up on red America and withdraw and secede into their strongholds, and for the "big sort" to kick into overdrive. Dispense with the pussyhats and the aerobic exercise and work for something productive for a change: secession.<br>@Raymond Duckling,<br>I assume that there is still an active opposition to NAFTA in Mexico? Surely all the damage NAFTA did and the exodus is provoked hasn't been forgotten? How is the opposition to NAFTA in Mexico reacting to the changes in trade policy north of the border. Surely there must be some in Mexico who see an end to free trade as an opportunity to rebuild domestic industries and sectors...<br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c3452584665138508123 title="comment permalink">1/27/17, 5:42 PM</a><br><br>

The US in the 1950s was a much different economic prospect. Your point about one vs two wage earners is reinforced by the data. It shows a participation rate lower than today until about 1976, where it started climbing steadily until a peak around 2006. 1976 was about the time inflation (stagflation?) and foreign competition (Japanese cars, anyone?) took a real bite out of the blue-collar earning capability. Then again, if I asked my mother if she “worked” back in the 1960s she’d either roll her eyes and laugh, or smack me upside the head, depending on how annoying I was being that day.<br><br>A couple more interesting points to consider when looking at the data. <br><br>First, the current decline in the participation rate is matched by a concurrent increase in social welfare rates (SSDI, SNAP, etc.). In essence, a chunk of the population has found out that they can make as much from government transfer payments as they could from working the available part-time jobs. The various companies specializing in helping people apply for benefits also started popping up at this time. To me, this still means that families need two incomes to make ends meet, but some people have elected to navigate the bureaucracy to get transfer payments rather than slogging at some min-wage part-time job.<br><br>Second, the data sets I could find only went back to 1950, which I consider to be near the peak of the US manufacturing industry. I’d love to see data from the 1930s, an economic era arguably not too different than today. Go back even further to the era where a majority of Americans lived on family-owned farms, and I bet the true participation rate would be much higher than today. Everyone on the farm worked, not necessarily for a wage, but to survive. I doubt the government bean counters would say more than just the head of the household “worked,” but they all put in the hours. <br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c6253565568538564705 title="comment permalink">1/27/17, 5:53 PM</a><br><br>

His election seems to have galvanized them, and many have shot back that they've already begun volunteering at some community group or have organized a group of their own or taken a leadership position in a local organization.<br><br>Whereas before, suggestions that member- and citizen-funded organizations might be less beholden to the powers that be and less easily destabilized were usually sneered at as regressive, immoral (!), or unworkable, they now seem to be taking deep thought about more distributed funding possibilities and the merits of simply proceeding with positive change regardless of the current administration's stance. They seem to have been shaken out of the feeling that the changes they want to see are part of a moral progression to which they are entitled, and are grudgingly recognizing that those changes might be something they need to shell out time and/or money to accomplish.<br><br>This is not to say that there's not still a lot of overwrought moaning and wasting of energy on the more pointless forms of political action such as the recent protests and marches, but my liberal friends at least do seem to be buckling down.

Which scenario happens will depend, I think, largely on where you are; I could easily see Europe settling into a relatively stable condition for some centuries, provided that it manages to cope with the end of the fossil fuel economy and can stave off the kind of mass immigration that, historically speaking, sweeps nations off the map. Here in North America, that might eventually happen in the northeast US and southeastern Canada, but elsewhere, the descent into barbarism is far more likely, for reasons I've discussed at length already. <br><br>Ray, many thanks. <br><br>Vedant, what I expect to happen is a slow unraveling, in which signs of failure won't be visible unless you stop and think back to conditions ten or twenty years back. Here in the US, for example, a growing number of rural counties no longer have the funds to keep their roads paved, but you have to go looking to find that out. That's the way the signs of failure will be -- hidden from obvious view, papered over by official statistics, easily dismissed as random fluctuations. So, yes, there are some signs of failure showing up now, and there will be more with each passing year, over the century or two that it'll take for industrial civilization to finish its decline and fall. <br><br>Scotlyn, it was when that got said that I asked the alt-right contingent to drop the overt Nazism, Holocaust revisionism, and so on, and I proceeded to enforce that by deleting several attempted posts. I leave my readers a great deal of latitude for discussion, and yes, some of them leave from time to time. <br><br>Stuart, you're most welcome. I agree, for what it's worth -- I could see flying if there was some valid reason for doing so, but "I need a mini-break in Mazatlan" does not cut it. And of course when climate scientists are insisting that everybody needs to cut their carbon footprint, the fact that they aren't willing to do so themselves raises valid questions about whether they themselves believe what they're saying. <br><br>Vesta, that's certainly a valid way to look at it. Are you taking steps in your own life to move in that direction right now, while there's time to get past the learning curve? <br><br>DoubtingThomas, ah, but from the perspective of history, you're just one member of a crowd -- one of the many voices insisting that there has to be some way out of the cycle of history, as people invariably do at this point in the cycle. I know it's awkward to come to terms with the fact that every one of us gets our ideas from our own cultural and historical setting, and that those ideas are therefore predictable to a great extent, but there it is. <br><br>As for paradigm shifts in physics, it interests me to notice how many people don't seem to realize that most paradigm shifts in physics end up proving that there's something else we can't do. The immense paradigm shift that gave rise to thermodynamics explained why you can't get more energy out of a process than you put into it; the paradigm shift that gave us relativity theory explained why you can't accelerate a material object to the speed of light, much less past it, and so on. Most of the laws of science amount to "you can't do that" -- and yet talk about paradigm shifts in physics these days almost always fixates on the notion of getting more energy, more resources, more goodies than the current version of physics permits. Myself, I suspect that the next big paradigm shift in physics will tell us why fusion power isn't a viable option and why we're not going to the stars, but we'll see...<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c9054884997893120599 title="comment permalink">1/27/17, 6:58 PM</a><br><br>

That sort of reframing might be worth trying. <br><br>Latefall, thanks for the numbers. With regard to the Senate hearings, remember that that's pure political theater at this point; the Senate has not quite been reduced to the rubberstamping function of its Roman equivalent, but it's getting there. The thing to watch is what happens over the next six months or so. <br><br>Nancy, it's about time they started worrying about the pitchforks. With any luck, those worries will start taking more useful forms -- say, a nervous backing away from the culture of executive kleptocracy that's become so entrenched in the upper end of the US economy. <br><br>Violet, very good. I'd also add that getting off the sofa and doing something constructive is the most effective way I know of to deal with feelings of helplessness and despair. <br><br>Whitecloak, I'd be delighted if California were to secede. So would most of the people who've spent any time living in nearby states, for that matter. May I make a suggestion? The simplest legal way to make secession happen is a constitutional convention, which can be called by state legislatures, and can then draft a constitutional amendment giving states the legal right to secede and setting up a procedure for secession. Once that's ratified by the states, it's the law of the land -- neither Congress nor the president have anything to say about it. Get the word out: the escape hatch is right there in the Constitution. <br><br>Big Rant, fair enough. What do you hope to bring about by doing this? That's not a rhetorical question; I'm genuinely curious. <br><br>Pygmycory, interesting. I wonder what it would take to pry those loose. <br><br>Latefall, interesting. I see a diffuse domestic insurgency of the Iraq variety as more likely than an all-out civil war, for what it's worth -- and both of them have become a good deal less likely because of the outcome of the election. <br><br>Onething, a valid point. I'll want to look into that. <br><br>Tidlösa, maybe they'll get even more of a clue, and stop the self-defeating behaviors that are putting them at risk. <br><br>Jerome, that's another album I used to listen to by the hour.

Believe it or not, I first became well acquainted with your musings while living in the basement of a Goldman Sachs executive whose wife was on the board of a ballet company I danced with. I was familiar with concepts of peak oil and other environmental issues by then, already believing that Obama had made a huge mistake in not pursuing Van Jones' "Green New Deal" but instead going ahead with what turned out to be a very flawed health care program. Your framing of the myth of progress was not a part of any previous argument I had encountered, and, having been brought up in that faith, it shook me to confront its failings. <br>On a rational level, I followed your arguments. On a non-rational level, I really didn't want them to be true, especially since the career path I chose for myself depended on the relative stability of the status quo. When Hillary lost the election, my irrational brain was finally forced to relinquish its faith in progress. I had no great support for Hillary- like most of my generation I was a huge fan of Bernie Sanders, and was appalled and greatly disillusioned by the way the media treated him during the course of the campaign. <br>That said, it did feel inevitable that the first black president should be followed by the first female president, and things should just keep steadily muddling forward- some improvements to the health law, eventually universal healthcare, continuing progress on social issues- my subconscious liberal psyche, fueled by the religion of progress, held onto that belief.<br>That is over with now. I admit my vote for Hillary was largely selfish (And horribly gut wrenching- I left the booth praying I had not just voted for WWIII). That said, I did personally benefit from Obamacare, and from the economic status quo. That's going away now, and I will almost certainly have to choose a new life path. Could be a hell of a lot worse, though. I am from the privileged classes, and have a lot to fall back on.<br>Thank you for giving me a paradigm with which to make greater sense of the issues of the day. All though it is not perfect, it hangs together much better than most of our societies’ narratives. The despair you see in people about Hillary is, in my opinion, in large part because their narrative of progress cannot accept that a Trump could happen in their lifetime. That someone portrayed as so "backwards" could win the presidency has caused a crisis of faith in many.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c6664005036835084336 title="comment permalink">1/27/17, 7:52 PM</a><br><br>

Pauline Hanson (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson) is sort of like our Donald Trump and is also notable for her hair (Fun fact: she actually scored an invite to Trump's inaugeration). She came out of nowhere in the mid-nineties to eventually score about a million votes at one stage but, through our electoral system, did not get to translate it into many seats.<br><br> Her main claim to fame is being anti-immigrant, anti-multiculturalism, etc. which struck a chord as governments at the time were tone-deaf to people's concerns. People threw votes her way as they were not being allowed to express their concerns without being shouted down as racist, etc (sound familiar?). What surprised me at the time was that protesters felt themselves entitled to physically attack people going to attend her meetings and our press was totally OK with this (also sound familiar?) nor did the cops really intervene much. I am against her ideas but you have to listen to the other side, right?<br><br> Note that this was all about 20 years ago. Yeah they did throw her in the slammer in 2003 with a harsh sentence but a review quickly tossed the convictions a few months later. Here is where it gets interesting. It came out that Tony Abbott (future Prime Minister) and protege of the sitting Prime Minister of the John Howard, bankrolled the court cases against her. So it was a deliberate take-down. Why am I bothering with this quick run-down of a minor political figure? Because of what I believe the effect of her was.<br><br> In spite of having nearly 1-in-3 people here in Australia born overseas, we have a harsh, if not vile, illegal emigrant regime that counters international law and all this goes back to after Hanson came on the scene. I firmly believe the government at the time adopted much of her policies (after filing off the serial numbers) to bring back voters to themselves and these policies have become entrenched with us ever since. And now I can't shake this feeling that your conservatives in the US saw all this play out and said yeah, we could do the same.

Even with the best preparations in the world there is a very, very limited amount of control that one person, family, or community can exert on the wild movements of contingency and exigency that are flowing into our lives."<br><br>Just wanted to note, I think this is why, in traditional networks of reciprocity, willingness to help is usually conditional upon being an upstanding member and practicing/having practiced (if one is now incapable) "personal responsibility" (a loaded phrase, I know) and having invested in the community. <br><br>Self-sufficiency/"rugged individualism" is a prerequisite for mutual aid, not in opposition to it. That way you have a network of useful individuals with pertinent skills, at least somewhat diversified, and of proven reliability, who are available to assist when circumstances strike beyond one's ability to foresee or prepare for--something that can happen to any community member--but the materially and morally parasitic tend to be sanctioned or excluded. This makes the community as a whole more efficient and adaptable than it would be as a collective of isolated individuals, without draining its initiative and encouraging dependence or rewarding gaming of the system.<br><br>So I think there is certainly value in a spiritual approach to chaos and contingency in troubled times, but there are valuable pragmatic responses as well that go beyond prepping into the realms of social organization and moral norms.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c7655804772728030637 title="comment permalink">1/27/17, 9:01 PM</a><br><br>

"Gee, thanks guys, love you too"?<br><br>I admit, I've found it easier for most of my life to identify as Californian (because of the visceral evocation of what it means to be from a land of oak savannah and salt-scrub coast, to understand seasons by proximity to rainfall rather than canned-images of mayflowers/maples/snow, because of coyotes yipyipping on a late summer's night, and the satisfaction of seeing waves of wind-tossed grasses on rolling hills as they ripen from winter's vibrant green toward spring's unspeakably beautiful green-to-gold ombre) than I have as "American." <br><br>Red white and blue are supposed to make me feel the same? Not even close.<br><br>And yet, I grew cross with Shane two weeks ago for the repetitive and dismissive insistence that you'd all be better off without us, that somehow the people here, myself included, are anathema to the American project you all are in charge of.<br><br>But maybe my attitude reveals the vestiges of an old way of thinking - that we're part of something (the once-United States), that (oh the irony) dissensus is okay and yeah we do things differently, but it's ok to be known as the kooky aunt. I didn't think, though, that it worked in this direction - with people outside a state deciding it best if that state seceded. If I said, "I think Alabama oughta secede, just 'cuz I dislike their attitude and way of doing things. They're not fit to be in my association," I'd probably hear accusations of classism/cultural-elitism or be accused of snobbery.<br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c8774136599420262686 title="comment permalink">1/27/17, 10:13 PM</a><br><br>

Evilly evil as we are. Silly me, a long time coming around to my American-ness, I was looking forward to digging into my region's contribution to "An alt-center [that] could very easily unite around traditional American ideals -- with an acknowledgment that those ideals haven't always been lived up to, but a celebration of the many times and ways they have been -- and such a unifying force, given its historical depth, could have great power." Instead it seems you'd rather show us the door.<br><br>I'm not saying secession isn't a possible thing, isn't maybe even a decent thing. I just... well, feel put out, I guess. Rapidly-declining, collapsing-first-world problems and all that.<br><br>But let me put a few things into perspective and air my grievances:<br><br>The attitude is that California is something monolithic to be trotted out as an example of how not to do things, a useless waste of space, a pimple on the American backside. An irrelevance. Yet it's diverse. Its distance, north to south, is just slightly less (at ~770 miles) than the distance between Copenhagen, Denmark and Zagreb, Croatia (a route, which, by the way, could pass through approximately five European nations). It encompasses 10 degrees of latitude, hosts innumerable ecosystems (and varieties of flora/fauna that accompany them) and, due to terrain changes was home to the continent's most diverse mix of human linguistic groups prior to north America's colonization - undoubtedly that kind of variety would be fostered again in a non-standardized environment post your-dreamed-of-secession.<br><br>Keep in mind that California is made up of a majority of immigrants - not from Mexico, but from other parts of the US - many of whom left their places of origin not merely for the weather but because they felt stifled and pigeonholed or in need of a different canvas onto which to project their personal desires (for good and bad). And so now, having exported such a vast number of people, I will (only ironically, to make my point) suggest that you start your California secession campaign by recalling everyone back to where they started if they weren't born here. You can have them back, since some of those who are doing the Californicating are your region's castoffs. Note that they're giving others of us a bad name such that we have to accept it every time you spout off about what a blustered-fluckaroo this place is instead of calling you out on your gross overgeneralization and smug superiority. <br><br>Meanwhile, if you'd be so kind as to not hasten our tumble into failed-state/warband-incubator terrain, I would urge you to take a good, long, hard look at <b>every</b> bite of food you eat. A pox on BAU economic theories that promote the positive effects of California produce being shipped out of state to prop up our "GDP," and instead, how about you and the rest of (your) nation boycott us so that we can keep our lettuce, strawberries, almonds, oranges (good luck with Florida oranges and huanglongbing disease... ~80% infected?), milk, grapes (raisins, wine!), walnuts, tomatoes (canned ones too - they're probably from my county), beef and the hay that feeds your beef and milk cows. <br><br>Please do California a favor and let us feed our own people. We would have less of a water problem too, if we didn't have to provide two thirds of the the rest of (your) nation's fruits, nuts and some portion of your vegetables. And maybe, actually, asking you take your people back isn't such a bad idea...<br><br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c2930761473926046616 title="comment permalink">1/27/17, 10:13 PM</a><br><br>

Do you happen to know if the people who were protesting Australia Day do anything else to help your indigenous peoples? Knowing that would make an interesting comparison with the people who protest Columbus Day and the various patriotic holidays up here. <br><br>Cherokee, fascinating. It interests me that so many people elsewhere are so fixated on our politics. I promise you the vast majority of Americans have no idea who the prime minister of Australia is, much less what end of the political spectrum that dignitary inhabits! <br><br>Bob, funny. Neither do human nations -- like lemmings, they take off running in a direction that they think might lead to better things, and go splashing into the sea convinced that it's just another river they can swim across. <br><br>Barrabas, I've been saying for years now that the pseudoconservative habit of using "Communist!" and "Socialist!" as labels for any program that might actually help people is probably going to convince a lot of voters to give Marx a second chance. I wonder if this is another manifestation of that effect. <br><br>Sylvia, so noted, but you've noticed that it's a problem to believe that food sprouts on grocery store shelves, so you're already a big step ahead. <br><br>Jen, that's very promising to hear. Thank you. <br><br>David, "votist"? I assume that means a prejudice in favor of people who bother to vote. I'm fine with such a prejudice, as it happens! <br><br>Karl, thanks for this. Since I stopped believing in progress about the time I stopped believing in Santa Claus, I freely admit that I don't really understand what goes on in the minds of faithful believers, and this sort of window on the progressivist imagination helps. <br><br>Les, you're most welcome. <br><br>Wendy, I quite understand you're upset by the pro-secession comments, but please try to see how things look from the perspective of the other 49 states. I've lived in two places (Seattle and Ashland, OR) that got large numbers of immigrants from California, and in both places the Californians by and large made themselves hated by insisting that their way of doing things was the only right way and everyone who wasn't from California was by definition an ignorant boor. The Seattle Neopagan scene, similarly, used to get missionaries from San Francisco on a regular basis, who assumed as a matter of course that everybody in Seattle was doing things wrong and needed to be shown the right, i.e., Bay Area way. I could go on; there are countless other examples. California has its own culture; it's one in which the glorification of the ego has a very large part; and it's also one that clashes with the cultures of the other regions of this country. Thus it's not surprising that a great many people from elsewhere would respond to the idea of a California independence movement with enthusiastic cries of "Don't let the door hit you on the way out." We'd be perfectly willing to buy your vegetables, by the way, in exchange for the many things you can't grow or manufacture; that doesn't require you to share a nation with us, or vice versa.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c1881965919532472144 title="comment permalink">1/27/17, 11:32 PM</a><br><br>

You do well in my book.<br><br>Yes I am but 1. Da Vinci, Copernicus, Newton, Einstein too were individuals and their theoretical contributions/inventions resulted in significant lasting impacts on their civilisations and others to this day.<br><br>Characterising most paradigm shifts in physics as 'something we cant do' strikes me as bit harsh. I see what you mean but the clarifications/changes in understanding had upsides too. Perhaps the reason people don't usually focus on "can't do that" characterisations is because they are looking at what the new paradigm shift in understanding allowed them to do next. We do choose our characterisations I guess.<br><br>As I recall the laws of thermodynamics carry an assumption of an isolated system. It would be interesting if parallel universes interacted and we ended up having to incorporate parallel universes into our concept of our universe. Heaven knows what the fallout would be if that came to pass.<br><br>"that every one of us gets our ideas from our own cultural and historical setting"<br>- Generally sure. Necessity (so setting) generally drives invention (ideas) but not always. Some people break free of their tribal/social conditioning and develop their own patterns frequently putting them at odds/risk with their tribes/peers. They also innovate just for fun and occasionally happy endings occur. Call them Free Thinkers or Fun-seeking Futurists.<br><br>"from the perspective of history, you're just one member of a crowd"<br>-- I am not history yet though :) and it only takes 1 person to trigger a change in some of a crowd.<br>-- You are 1 and yet you have been involved I believe in different attempts to spread messages that interested you. I don't know how successful your earlier efforts were but you have an audience now who pay attention and judging by the comments you attract a diverse crowd who are taking action in their own ways forming their own collectives.<br><br>"Myself, I suspect that the next big paradigm shift in physics will tell us why fusion power isn't a viable option and why we're not going to the stars, but we'll see..."<br>-- yup I remember reading that in an earlier post. I'd settle for resource focused in-system stuff for now. I'm still waiting for the fallout from China's new/working EM Drive tested in Orbit in December.<br><br>I don't disagree with most of the underlying premises of the developing situation you highlight and I find a lot of your contemporary analysis fascinating &amp; clear. It doesn't scare or elate me. Death, mass deaths etc doesn't frighten me. My interests are only partially about the now - I'm more medium/long term systemic outlook planning outlook project is as close as I can come to discuss my practical interests. <br><br>As someone above else said, stories (can) have power so some of them I choose to keep at arms length. I can only point at innovation/inspiration/intuition as a chance to change outcomes whenever anyone tries to say we are stuck in cycles. Hunter gatherer cycles ended as we learned &amp; innovated although some still exist I guess. Anyway, only time will settle the difference of opinion on whether this cycle will be any different :) - I'll have fun pushing my agenda forwards as I hope you will yours :)<br><br>I agree regarding London public transport. It's quite good. Same with most major EU cities as I recall. Roads are too crowded though in most of them. I'd love to see them ban all private vehicles from them during the day and only allow delivery vehicle early morning. Too much ego tied to vehicles :( <br><br>Understood about assuming.

I grew up in the Philly suburbs and live further out in a rural county now, and I was shocked that Trump made his first visit outside of DC to the Democratic Party stronghold of Philly. And not just a short visit, but a Republican retreat. That guy really doesn't back down from anything, does he?<br><br>The Philly police did a phenomenal job of handling the protestors again. As far as I could tell, they remained in their regular uniforms (again) and kept things calm and civil. That is the third major event they've handled (Dem Covention and Pope visit) and I'm impressed by their professionalism and calmness. This gives me hope for the short term.<br><br>Trump made a comment about the murder rate in Philly and he was echoing the opinion of everyone who knows Philly. It is atrocious and it is horrible. I remember as a teenager in the 1980's when it jumped to over 300 homicides a year and the nightly news covered it. They reported each night as it got closer to 300 and went over. It was like a rampage of death. The awful part is its never really gone down much from there. Its one of those things no Democratic administration in Philly has ever been able to fix. https://www.phillypolice.com/crime-maps-stats/ The poverty rate in Philly has also remained around 30% for the past three decades despite a complete revitalization and rebuilding of the entire core of the city, and repopulation of young professionals in center city. <br><br>The other thing people who grew up around Philly will always talk about is how crooked the voting is. Trump has called this out too, though certainly not just talking about Philly. It is a well-accepted truth that the dead voted early and often in Philadelphia precincts and the city could be counted on to reliably deliver Democratic party votes in a state-wide or national election. The Democratic Party has ruled the city since the 1950's. The crooked voting was one of those things talked about but never in polite company and never in public. You wouldn't want to anger the powers that controlled everything in the city! If Trump could prove that this type of voting fraud has been occurring in even one city, that would be amazing. And it would shut up his critics. Who is going to criticize someone who wants fair elections? <br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c7238584314171916555 title="comment permalink">1/28/17, 2:44 AM</a><br><br>

They expect taxpayers to make up the difference. This is going to get ugly. <br><br>PA is home to the largest mutual fund company in the world at this point, The Vanguard Group with $4.5 trillion under management. Their fund management style is index investing and anyone who has any retirement money probably has heard of this. Their theory has been that over the long-term an investor would do as well as the market and not pay high management fees to a portfolio manager or investment advisor if they invested in all the companies listed on an index, such as the S&amp;P 500.<br><br>Does the PA state government follow this advice and use the resources of one of their largest employers? Nope. They hired investment professionals to manage the state and teacher pensions paying the PSERS (teacher pension) financial managers $450million a year. I didn't look up the what they paid the state pension managers because I am sick to my stomach. http://www.psers.state.pa.us/content/publications/financial/SAFR/SAFR%20FINAL.pdf<br><br>Rate of return from these financial geniuses over 10 years? 10%<br>S&amp;P 500 increase past 10 years (this includes the crash) 61%<br><br>So if the state has just invested the pension money in an index fund and paid a 1% management fee for it, vs the 6% they paid god knows who, then pensions would be more than funded and taxpayers in PA wouldn't be having to see another tax increase. <br><br>Our property taxes have doubled in the last ten years to cover the costs of teacher pensions. Full pensions after 25 years of working, btw.<br><br>So in a time of huge stock market returns, our state screwed everything up.

Capitalism is certainly no exception, it's just more resilient than Marxism. Trust me, if you do anything to seriously threaten capitalism, you'll find yourself in a gulag. And of course, pure capitalism places no value on human life unless those humans happen to be useful. You can scream and shout all you want about Marxism, and capitalism doesn't care, because you've still got to buy food and shelter and that means you're going to find a way to be useful to capitalism. I agree that Marx's criticism of capitalism is mostly valid, but I find his ideas about the organization of society to be, um, ridiculous. And I've written before about my ideas about how because Pareto inequalities appear to be a natural consequence (rooted in mathematics) of any competitive field, I do not think there is a way to make life fair, only less unfair.<br><br>Second of all, I found it interesting that you said Peterson is "a bit reactionary" for criticizing Marxism. Think about that for a second. If you don't know, within Marxist discourse, "reactionary" means "thought-criminal", and of course within Marxist versions of history, the Nazis were of course reactionary (this is true, it's entirely possible there could have been a communist coup in 1920 or so in Germany, and there was also a small civil war fought that doesn't get talked about much for some reason), so "reactionary" can also mean "Nazi". The choice of the word "reactionary" is an interesting linguistic choice because it logically makes the Marxist/Marxism the primary actor. <br><br>I think the fundamental Marxist idea is not a theory about how labor and material goods should be distributed, but the idea that humans are perfectly rational and can therefore impose our reason on the world to improve the world.<br><br>I don't think it's entirely a surprise that Marxism was thought up during the industrial revolution. Of course, another point is that the labor unions, welfare systems, health and safety regulations, child labor laws, workman's compensation, limited working hours etc did not really exist in Marx's time. So naturally, a lot of people were unhappy with capitalism. And in some ways those conditions are coming back to bite in the developed world, so I'm not surprised that people are picking up on Marxism. Marxists don't like these reforms, because they see them as preserving capitalism and preventing the revolution (and the eternal worker's paradise which will of course follow). And yes I like Camille Paglia.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c6926106293436826459 title="comment permalink">1/28/17, 4:38 AM</a><br><br>

A few hundred millions firearms spreading around the population do not help to the stability of the country<br><br>I think there are two factors that aggravates this situation:<br><br>a) The "cult" to the violence so ingrained in the mythology of the US (I would say there ia a "fascination" with the violence &amp; arms). The majority of the hollywood films' plots turn around the way the violence of the "good guys" solve all the problems, normally killing the "bad guys" (indians, nazis, russians, iraqis, etc...or other invented villains). In fact it was thanks to the violence (wars) the US became the current hegemon and take a good portion of the global wealth, on the cheap. It surprise me how in this and other blogs people know and discuss a lot of weapons, f.e. soviet ZSU, or chinese jets ? or some others own and foreign weapons, that are outside the conversation of knowledge of people from other countries, sound quite "strange" in fact for us<br>This make an more unstable country<br><br>b) I think in the US to be poor have psychological aggravating factors compare to others countries and cultures. This notion of "winners" and "losers" that build the aspiration of the people, destroy the mental health of a lot of people. If you compare the evolution of the life expectancy of the poor middle aged whites with other ethnics goups (hispanics or blacks) in the US, the life expectation of the white people is decreasing and the others ethnic groups is increasing, and the reasons, I think, are related to the "expectations" (who "should" you be, and the distance to who "really" you think you are, measured in abstract-market oriented terms, which is the real problem...). The "poors" in the US are rich compared to other countries´ poors, but what destroy people are not "objetives" situation (if that even exist) but the social built "own" feeling<br><br>You are making a good job lowering the expectations of the people, this is the way to try to better live with the combined crises we are suffering (and in any situation)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c8780644126280897040 title="comment permalink">1/28/17, 5:13 AM</a><br><br>

Of course, that's not to say that dualism traps don't exist in terms of decisions about how we interact with the material world or organize the distribution of goods and labor. I'd also argue that a lot of the time when JMG talks about a third path, a Daoist response would be to say "no, you're just in balance between order and chaos, there is no third path" - of course it's a semantic difference because the material results of a balance of order and chaos is in fact third option. Regarding sex, er, I think our culture could do with a bit more order there. There's never been a functional culture that didn't have some rules. The current state of things is completely dependent on the pharmaceutical industry, effective antibiotics and of course condoms.<br><br>And regarding the "all hell breaks loose" - it has broken loose, repeatedly, multiple times in the 20th century. Relative wealth and isolation did keep things relatively sane in North America but you know, we still manufactured a bunch of killing machines which we sent to the Communists in Russia and nuked Japan twice. Then we built enough nuclear weapons to kill every species that doesn't live underwater or weighs more than 25 kg as an adult. We operate public schools where 1/6 of the kids have to be on drugs to function.<br><br>It's also worth pointing out that the murder rate in most Indigenous societies was astronomical - there were cultures in places like Papua New Guinea where people believed that men could live forever, because it was an extreme rarity for men to survive long enough to start to wither with age. Rousseau's ideas about the noble savage are wrong, without the sort of culture that comes with agriculture, we are unbelievably cruel featherless bipeds, especially when we are in conditions where nature doesn't kill us very often to regulate our population. And yes, women in those cultures did cruel things too. I think that for some reason Western people link indigenous societies mentally with the Garden of Eden - it isn't so. There's plenty of human behavior patterns that map very well onto chimpanzee behavior - we're not so different from them in the final analysis. We're monkeys who are smart enough to build nuclear weapons and vicious enough to torture each other for fun - there is a reason why, for instance, Mary and (baby) Jesus is such an important and powerful symbol - it reminds us of one of the few places in our psyche where empathy is absolutely hardwired into us (male and female). Empathy creates more empathy and vice versa.<br><br>We ALL are vicious, tribal monsters with a storytelling function on top. I think we're wired to separate ourselves when 'group size' becomes too large - but of course, the planet is full, we can't just split up and wander off in a different direction. And so we invent ideologies about why we're right and fight each other using our words for a time, but the two camps become separate and essentially start to develop completely separate ontological frameworks, at which point they can no longer talk, and then they fight. So yeah, I see why Peterson is horrified.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c4844821245027215600 title="comment permalink">1/28/17, 6:03 AM</a><br><br>

That makes sense since hormones aren’t made in large amounts in animals, though it means extraction from pigs won’t work on a small scale. As pygmycory points out, insulin is made by genetically modified bacteria and baker’s yeast in what seems to be useful amounts . The yeast can be grow in a flask so growing the special yeast shouldn’t be hard, making ~1mg / Liter hour or 28.8 insulin units per liter an hour. I’m not sure how much post-processing is needed for proinsulin made by yeast as opposed to bacteria or how difficulty it’ll be to process it. The biggest difficulty would be acquiring the yeast and learning the skills of insulin yeast refining before you truly need it. https://microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12934-014-0141-0 has some information.<br><br>Justin, I also move in transhumanist / rationalist / scientism circles keeping a place in that group just as I do with this one. It makes me neither fish nor fowl, but it suits my eccentricities and prevents ideological rigidity. If you need discussion points that your coworkers might accept or at least acknowledge, I might be able to help craft some. At the very least, tell you where they’re coming from. <br><br>Taking some of your earlier comments as well, I’m reminded of the ascended economy, one of the many darker bits of futurology out there. Basically it’s a future where human control and decision making is handled over to AIs that out-compete the humans along with any trait humans value for improved efficiency. In its most extreme form, it leads to a world of marvels of beings who individually think more than all of humanity ever did single mindedly pursuing ever larger numbers. There’s a few shades of it in much of the criticism of modern financial markets and Big Data.<br><br>It wouldn’t surprise me that even in a declining world, we get a stronger taste of it. Algorithmic decision makers replacing human decision makers is already a stated goal in many technophilic circles. Even not among explicit supporters, there’s a common feeling that Science as embodied Reason must save us from ourselves which will only become stronger as things deteriorate. I don’t know how long such creations will be able to keep themselves going before starving, but they could have quite the impact before joining Diocletian’s edicts in history’s dustbin. <br><br>All of this does remind me that I would very much like to see JMG’s reaction to Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom. Both come from such radically different places that I’m not sure what would stand out. It’s a powerful work on those who share Bostrom’s basic worldview showing up in many a rationalist’s canons, and has prompted people like Elon Musk and others to donate millions against existential AI risk.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c1859257697163037424 title="comment permalink">1/28/17, 8:41 AM</a><br><br>

Yesterday I traded a whole mess of tinctures for a goodly amount of venison and mutton. My friend and trading partner and are both "rugged individualist" types who have overlapping, though divergent skills that allow for excellent trades, not to mention great conversations. Another friend has gifted me so much food throughout our relationship and I've gifted them a small apothecary and help whenever they needed it. These relationships are some of the most rewarding I participate in. <br><br>This culture which I see as organically emerging does much to give me some guarded optimism. There are two issues that I see, which you touch on as well, are 1) lack of skills, 2) a culture or parasitism.<br><br>Many of my friends have good trade skills but many don't, and simply don't have the inner resources to sustain a gift economy. Most are open to learning.<br><br>the pervasive parasitism is a deeper problem. I believe that this is the spiritual backwash of our glut of energy slaves, perhaps a true "first world problem." people believe that they are entitled to free energy and that includes the labors of other people. Many of my friends, appearantly, don't think much of gaming me, and I often feel taken advantage of. There is, not yet at least, a cultural mechanism that has evolved for dealing with parasitic behavior, or at least not one known to me in the context of the communities I participate in. probably also an issue is that I've been living in a college town and I have unresolved issues with boundraries.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c8436287302919295099 title="comment permalink">1/28/17, 9:01 AM</a><br><br>

A little analysis about other people in public life reveals that he is not actually unusual, and he is certainly not particularly conservative in his views.

This is a request for advice from both you and your readership.<br><br>Years ago, I made the foolish decision of entering a grad program, got up to my proverbial eyeballs in debt, and upon graduation after years of below-minimum-wage toil, I landed a job in the Persian Gulf region making enough money to pay back my debts in full and accumulate substantial savings. 1.8 years to go, as of this writing. The only reason I'm out here is because I'm paying down federal student loans for a foolish hero's quest.<br><br>I could go back to the US this summer, but I worry that having that debt will be a liability on more than just paper: I keep having visions of the DoE sending Vinnie the Knee-Capper to extract his pound of flesh from my hide at some point in the future. Out here in Qatar, I have a plush VIP seat of the shit-storm that's unfolding in the Middle East, and am feeling increasingly uneasy about things (both out here and on the home front).<br><br>So, finally, my question: if you were in my shoes, would you chance a default on federal debts for an onrushing future where it likely won't matter? If you (collective "you", honored Archdruid and readership) were me, would you cease payments on student debts, stack as much cash as possible, and use it while it's still worth a tinker's damn? I could be debt-free, or I could buy a small plot of land. I can't have both with my income.<br><br>(Huh. Writing it all out, the decision seems blatantly obvious...)<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c1357887933252150559 title="comment permalink">1/28/17, 11:24 AM</a><br><br>

We don't hate you, I don't. I quite like the Californians I have known, I just don't think we want to share the same government with the same laws and norms. A decentralized federalism would work, but we have dismissed that in our modern age and if we must rule the whole of the country under uniform law? I would rather balkanize and let smaller chunks of the dis-United States experiment with their own laws that reflect their own cultures and values.<br><br>For instance- many Californians are quite keen on certain sexual mores that people from my neck of the woods find an imposition of foreign, hostile values. You would find the imposition of our values onto you and yours to be quite unwelcome as well, I wager. Or immigration- you and yours might be for open borders but us rust belters want an inward, protectionist focus.<br><br>Would it not be better for us to go our separate ways in this regard?

Originally the territory of West Virginia was part of the state of Virginia. It was carved out in 1861 after Virginia seceded, but the northwestern counties wanted to remain in the Union. A state convention was held, status as a state applied for, and President Lincoln proclaimed the new state in 1863. Interestingly enough, Virginia and West Virginia fought over apportionment of the pre-split Virginia debt until a US Supreme Court ruling in 1915. They had a border dispute along a couple counties that ran until at least 1991.<br><br>All that said, if California succeeds in secession, I see a balkanized area, not a monolithic nation-state. West Virginia provides the precedence. <br><br>Northern California has tried to split off ever since the state was created, either to the state of Shasta or Jefferson. Other movements have proposed anywhere from three to six states from the California territory. The 2016 presidential election map reveals deep divides between the coastal cities and the more rural north and mountains.<br><br>I could definitely see the northern area, the Sierra mountains and everything east wanting to stay in the Union, leaving the secessionist state of California much reduced. The whole “we grow all of your vegetables” meme only works if the state remains intact.<br><br>Having lived and worked in LA for many years, I can say that I love the climate and beaches.

Maybe here in the States it's safer - for now. Certainly many places are more dangerous - some by several orders of magnitude. Many places are much safer - for instance, I recall a recent conversation with an American living &amp; working in a Germany city - he says children frequently travel alone by bus there - not something you see in most places in the U.S. I also recall reading a story some years ago about a woman and her young son killed in a car crash by a drunk driver (in a small, rural community); her husband was released early from serving in Iraq to come home and bury his family. There are no guarantees. I'm also thinking if you buy that plot of land and still have student debt you will probably have a lien put on it and whatever wages you earn will be garnished. But who knows what is looming on the horizon either in the States or in Qatar where you are. What do you know or need to know that will help you to decide, rather than simply worrying 'what if'? What does your 'gut' tell you? Is there a third (fourth, fifth...) option? Maybe, somehow, fate will intervene and the decision will be made for you. I wish you the best of luck whatever you decide; my prayers are with you.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c4293700612870781925 title="comment permalink">1/28/17, 4:41 PM</a><br><br>

It may be plainly obvious to you or me that knowing where human society is headed is a pretty important subject, but it is clear we are in absolutely tiny minority. I've met precisely one person who was prepared to give my concerns a bit of thought and discussion, everyone else just looks uncomfortable and changes the topic. Then there are others (like my brother), who logically can't fault my argument and concede I'm very likely right, but would prefer to do an ostrich act and bury their head in the sand (he readily admits this).<br><br>For me the answer is quite simple, ever since I was a child (now 42) I have felt there is something deeply wrong with the world. One of my favourite things was to collect stickers for my animal sticker books and I would spend hours paging through and reading the descriptions of the weird and wonderful creatures inhabiting our amazing world. Then came the realisation of how disconnected we are with nature and deep trauma upon discovering the destruction people were/are doing to the plant and animal kingdom.<br><br>This generated a kind of hatred toward humankind in general and in some regards a desire to see revenge visited upon it. I've struggled with depression my whole life and I think in some regards this hatred for humankind extends to myself as well, after all how many trees or animals that were living in harmony have I indirectly killed just by being part of the system? I've also felt deeply dissatisfied with what it means to go about day to day existence in this modern world - to express it in the way i feel it would be 'It fucking sucks!'. I've had some deeply joyous moments communing with nature, normally on my surfboard but sadly those days are getting much fewer and further between owing to responsibilities that creep into ones life.<br><br>Whenever someone would ask me if I get reincarnated and it has to be a human, who would it be, the answer is always clear as day to me - an Amazonian Indian living as they always have for millennia that has never encountered civilisation. I can't begin to imagine the contentment that goes with community living like that, hunting for your food, living on the edge. Yes I know there would be hardships that I wouldn't be able to handle right now but that's because I've become accustomed to this luxurious yet utterly meaningless society. In your latest book, your term of society hitting 'peak meaningless' really struck a chord for me.<br><br>So for me, the answer to the question posed in the beginning is simple: 'I would like to the world wiped clean of this scourge not necessarily of humanity, but of civilisation. I am well aware this means I will likely not survive, but if it means that humanity gets shoved back down into living within an eco-system in a sustainable manner then I accept it.' <br><br>Sorry for what has ended up a bit of an essay, but it feels good to write down how I actually feel, which I've never done before. <br><br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c2259114484473588560 title="comment permalink">1/28/17, 5:24 PM</a><br><br>

My neighbors care about whether or not you pull your weight in the community, not what color your skin happens to be. Even the blondest of us (looking in the mirror) are probably not pure any-darn-thing-at-all, and bunches of us have Spanish surnames and everybody brags about their Native ancestors if they can make half a valid claim. Could be LDS influenced--the idea that some Israeli tribes became Native Americans--could be some other reason that's cool.

JMG says: “… what are they going to do the day their pay checks suddenly turn out to be worth…” less. A progressing state we observe in Venezuela in the full, where we may end all in the not too long future.<br><br>How do I see and feel the creeping deterioration myself.<br><br>Truly mostly through the news from others it gets more vivid. <br>o When in Greece retirees were cut off from their health insurance benefit, couldn’t afford in the pharmacies medicine to suppress their actual disease, or get no place on the operation table. <br>o Now in Britain no beds in hospital. Therefore no surgery.<br>o With me myself I grasp it in tiny little bits here and there. Like twenty years of no substantial salary rise, while cost creeping up here and there, adding up bit by bit. Schedules for doctors getting prolonged year by year. Consumer products being advertised with more desperate promises of happiness and well-being, while the contents get suspicious to me more and more. Yet these are all rather small incidents. I see that I am split between my expectancy of catastrophe in Hollywood-style and the creeping deterioration I often only observe individually, without even being able to share them with others. <br><br>JMG says: “… meaning that your salary will probably go away, your savings almost certainly won’t keep its value…” I see it happens with me.<br><br>JMG says: “…up to the screaming point about the comparatively mild events we’ve seen so far may want to save some of their breath for the times ahead when it’s going to get much, much worse.”<br>Still we stick in an imaginary world of wealth or supposed riches within our reach. Until we are so totally engulfed in disaster. Like people in Detroit. Our emotions are aroused naturally only from outside disaster. Being entertained by explosions and fires, seeing shit blowing up und bodies flying around is in TV news. Hollywood knows how to use that quite to its advantage.<br><br>In reality we are engulfed by the collapse completely already. Only we do not observe what happens commonly already. Life is so mediocre, that it doesn’t catch the attention of our heated fantasy. Our daily life is too ordinary and the plain facts. presented to us by statistics. are too boring, for us to recognise the general pattern. Few of us are such pathetic guys, who are jazzed up by going trough the very essence of fact collection; Charts, number columns, etc..<br>We people cannot concentrate on these facts. Boring! We forget them easily. And if it is really brought on TV, we try with utter panic to change the channel to some “real stuff”, like a disaster-movie. Well, there we are. Reality needs to be sustained – by entertainment. Otherwise reality is unbearable boring.<br><br>In addition mainstream entertainment is drawing our attention away from the disturbing reality, either to mere illusions, or to the blaming habit. So many distracters are on work today. Cognitive dissonance is a mighty power trying to spare us the horror of the reality that we have reached the limits of growth, from where we just gradually engulfed in the down-sliding collapse and the a compulsory simplification of life. <br><br>We are headed to the non-fossil future. Most of us try to ignore the collapse yet, even it is already having an overwhelming effect on us commoners.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c2068692775488624676 title="comment permalink">1/29/17, 1:07 AM</a><br><br>

He is going to let those 20 somethings, who are the majority of the protestors on the streets, suffer. Trump will do something for his faithful base with manufacturing jobs or construction before he would ever save ungrateful college graduates.<br><br>I'm very interested to see what Trump does with education. The federal government historically provides about 1% of the funding for public schools and uses it like the carrot and stick. They pushed through Title 9 and disability education this way in the 70's and 80's. No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top were used to push the use of standardized tests in the 2000's. Common Core came from the states, not the Feds.<br><br>The states collect and control all the education spending. The powers that be - honestly I think corporations who supply schools with textbooks and tests - managed to get Common Core passed through most of the state legislatures. Charter schools, even corporate ones, have never taken off like Common Core did and are still fighting to exist school district by district. <br><br>You'll notice the conversation around public schools is "how do we help disadvantaged students succeed?" or some variation of that. Its all the media talks about - inequality between poor and rich schools, low-income students, racial disparity. The focus is all on how we take those below average and make them average. How do we normalize kids? How do we make them equal each other? How do we make sure every school is the same?<br><br>Same-ifying schools and students has never worked for the history of public schools. People don't want to be the same, to be average, to be made into someone else. Especially when there are no jobs or opportunities for people who are the same as other people. This is why homeschooling is now 3% of school age kids and growing. This is why parents wait in line for days to sign their child up for a charter school with openings. This is why rich kids go to private schools which talk about their distinctiveness from other schools and how when you graduate you are a leader.<br><br>Schools are the great employment project this country has and we can't eliminate them without destroying local economies. Its teachers and staff make good salaries and benefits compared to most in their communities, and there are the school lunch food suppliers, desk makers, paper, etc. We need to keep those jobs so they can't just eliminate public schools and let people do it on their own because it would done cheaper with less supplies. Homeschoolers don't eat chicken nuggets and use Common Core textbooks.<br><br>Trumps education pick is a fan of charter schools and unleashing all that tax money to corporations running charter schools would be one thing he could influence. The stock market would love that. Trump keeps pointing at African American communities and how they have suffered under Democrats. To help them though he has to untangle the money and structure the state's provide. The education bureaucracy is as skilled at failing at its core mission as the military bureaucracy.

Seems that all the West Coast states have secession initiatives, and there's been a resurgence in interest in the Second Vermont Republic. So my comments were directed at the blue strongholds of the Northeast and West Coast in general, not just California. I don't know about you, but I'm tired of the fighting, and no-one is even making an effort to bridge the divide, and secession/dissolution is the only way to stop the fighting. Soon as blue America comes to us with secession, then we can stop fighting and sit down at the negotiating table and work out all the hoary details (including trade and water rights) As Whitecloak has mention, many of us in red America are decentralists and sympathetic to secession, considering our history. Besides, if you don't secede from us, we will secede from you--JMG has already mentioned that the election of Hillary Clinton and continuation of BAU would have triggered an insurgency in red America. You're more peaceful and less gun loving, so it makes sense for you to go to the ballot box w/secession. As for me, I unequivocally do not support secession unless the border and trade is as open and the relationship as close as the current one with Canada. If I recall correctly, once the USSR was dissolved, the economies of the individual Republics were still very integrated, and are still very integrated to this day. It will be a long while, if ever, before the balkanized US new countries gain any semblance of economic independence, as it should be. Anything less would be a catastrophe for all sides.<br>As I mentioned, a successful secession initiative, in any of the states, not just California, would have the talking heads apoplectic and foaming at the mouth, which I much enjoy. I laughed until I cried this past election season at the talking heads reaction to Donald Trump. I don't see why the so-called right should have all the fun--it's about time that the so-called left does their part in upsetting the conventional wisdom. What better message than through a successful secession prop?<br>I'm not sure why people hear "secession" as "I hate you". I'm just tired of fighting, and after this most recent election, no one is trying to bridge the divide, and honestly, I just don't see how blue America will be able to force its way on red America since its ability to control the levers of the federal government has been sharply curtailed and shows no hope of being regained. I think the only possible justification for blue America in staying in is protecting the blue minority in red states from some horrible fate via the federal courts, but even that doesn't seem likely, at this point (protecting the blue minority, not the horrible fate).<br>As for diversity, we're a lot more diverse out here than you think. African-Americans have been coming home to the South from the North and West is numbers rivaling the Great Migration when they left. The South is arguably now the epicenter of black culture in America. Before the last wave of migration crested and Mexicans started going home, the South was home to the fastest growing migrant communities.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c5132357137251147395 title="comment permalink">1/29/17, 5:52 AM</a><br><br>

Couldn't afford to stay.<br>Speaking of California, I kinda get Dammerung now. As detestable as the Neo Nazi thing is personally to me, if he does live in Southern California, he does have a bleak future ahead with a lot of fighting for scarce resources. California, and Southern California in particular, is mostly likely to see the kind of Mad Max/Hunger Games kind of Hobbesian future due to population pressures on scarce resources.

I know it's a struggle to respond to so many earnest questioners, but you make two points. First that the slow-collapse approach better accounts for the historical record. Second that differences of scale are not differences in kind. <br><br>Regarding the first point, insofar as we are dealing with discontinuous / disruptive changes, the past may be a less reliable guide to the future than it would otherwise have been. I would at least want to see it argued that what is or appears to be novel (unlike past events) is nonetheless likely to revert to the historical pattern. Further, even stipulating to your methodology of using history as a guide to the future, I think if we looked to population collapses in nature, we would see a history of bottlenecks, mass die-backs and extinctions. On this view, we seem to be claiming that human history is a departure from this broader ecological history. Which is a claim we could plausibly defend, though not so plausibly from the principle that history is our predictor. Instead we end up arguing for our exceptionalism, which is a position you frequently and sardonically argue against. <br><br>As to the second point, arguably there are differences of scale that themselves become differences in kind, notably in complex, networked systems. You yourself have acknowledged (if implicitly) such a distinction in reference to suites of technology. That it takes a network of interlocking technologies to sustain a technological order. Networked supply chains would be another example. Local failures (crops, droughts, power outages, etc.) can be offset by wider trading networks. On a global scale, the help no longer arrives from elsewhere; moreover, certain local failures can disrupt entire global networks. A disruption of rare-earth extraction in China or Africa paralyzes global production of certain electronic components, etc. Furthermore, scale might not just be geographical extent but ecological "depth"--that is, when societies collapsed in the past, some survivors could move, some could live off viable soils, some could fish or hunt. Options relatively less available to the vast mass of humans after a rolling collapse of finance/credit, supply chains, energy production, industrial production... <br><br>For us, much of this depth, serving as a floor beneath our decline, is eaten away. In any event, it seems we may see such questions illuminated within the lifespans of those alive today.<br><br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c1065665714461093444 title="comment permalink">1/29/17, 7:49 AM</a><br><br>

A friend and I were talking recently about how we feel the household economy, if revived, could prove to be a haven for disabled folks. There are so many different ways of creating value, and if someone can pull their weight with household chores, that could provide value, dignity, meaning and participation to all involved. My friend also perceptively said that "also, sometimes people die." which is to say in the agrarian retro economy we imagined there would be less amenities and more mortality in all likelihood.<br><br>This dovetails nicely with the conversation that Jen and I are having about community and skills. As a New Englander I find the idea of small family farms emotional appealing, and know from personal experience that farms create a lot of opportunities for value to be added. Also there are auxiliary skills like cooking, cleaning, food preservation, herbalism, massage, hunting and bee keeping &amp;c that allow for a variety of energy exchanges.<br><br>Your term "industrial waifs and strays" is endearing. As a squatter punk I feel that I've met many of these folks and believe that the waifs and strays that have found themselves on farms are living in the most context with others in community and fellowship. Also, there is a certain touching quality in returning to one's parent's house and being in energy exchange between their privlidged placement in society and our skills. I know several others who have done so and it speaks to me symbolically of the emergence of a new, photosynthetic based economy in its early ascendance. This is my two cents in the dissensus process you've outlined as an emergent conversation. I hope to see how this evolves in the future.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c606636556657108261 title="comment permalink">1/29/17, 8:17 AM</a><br><br>

Conversely outlying areas would sink, as the rock at depth is flowing back into the previously overburdened area.<br><br>I am not sure how long this would take. I have a copy of <a href=https://ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/global.html rel=nofollow>ETOPO1 bedrock topography</a> downloaded which tells me that at present sea levels, the centre of Greenland is below sea level, but that it would not be connected to the ocean at sea level.<br><br>With a few tens of metres of sea level rise, the connection is made - it looks like to me from the northwest first. Of course, the central basin may be occupied by a lake that has a level above global sea level. The connection could be broken again in the longer term (probably thousands of years) as perhaps without fossil-fuel derived forcing of CO2 emissions, there is a partial recovery of ice sheets in Antarctica and sea level drops back a certain amount, or post-glacial rebound raises the elevation of central Greenland.<br><br>The best available comparison is what happened when the Fennoscandian ice sheet melted out at the end of the last glacial epoch.

There are always unskilled tasks to be performed (although, in working with people of different backgrounds than my own, I have become humblingly aware of the degree to which "unskilled" is a matter of perception--ask me about the man who could only dig crooked post holes, or the job opportunities I have lost due to inability to drive in city traffic). And many people are willing to learn new skills--in the last year, I have been pleased to teach canning, meat processing, and sausage-making to a group of friends, neighbors, and relatives, who contributed their hunting and gardening efforts to provide the raw materials. Also, I am increasingly trying to recognize and bring non-subsistence-focused skills into our networks and my own skill set, for "finer living" without much money or energy--things like clothing alterations, haircutting, mechanics, home remodeling, tax and legal expertise, etc. I am also reading your blog posts on herbalism now (thank you for sharing!) to begin to add to my hard-won experience in the way of diet and physical therapy for rehabilitation and prevention of disfunction and disease.<br><br>Parasitism is another story. I do tend to think your location is working against you there. I am in a rural area where my family has lived since the 1800s, so everyone pretty well knows everyone else and their character and reputation--it is hard to get away with much for long, and social exclusion is a real threat--a person can't easily just avoid the people he's played and go find another group who knows nothing about him as he could in the city. Moreover, these sorts of networks are common and long-established, and the community norms are in place to enforce honorable participation, whereas in a college town people are more transient and probably younger than average (I think many people take a while to grow out of our sense of entitlement). But I do think with decent boundaries and preferably sustained participation of a core group who get along well and can cooperatively enforce some norms, it will be workable for you! I am interested to hear how it goes.<br><br>Best wishes for your recovery.<br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c1078329463170415676 title="comment permalink">1/29/17, 8:29 AM</a><br><br>

Besides, at this point, the "United States" is an oxymoron, we're probably well into the Holy Roman Empire stage of things. "Yes, California" has a website where anyone can donate, or at least anyone living in the US, and considering that it costs a fortune to pass a prop in California, they'll need all the support they can get. (I haven't yet checked to see if the other West Coast states have sites where one can donate. Even though the costs are less, it will still be a minor fortune to pass those initiatives, as well.)<br>Empire destruction begins at home. I'm thinking of the example of Ireland and the Irish Free State in relation to the British Empire. Next door Ireland, which had been under the British thumb for centuries, was the first to break free of the British Empire, long before India or the British colonies in Africa. New England or West Coast secession could have the same effect here, in that it could show the weakness of the empire and redirect our energies inward, rather than outward. It would be a nice complement to Trump's inward focused foreign policy.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c3083501692939338450 title="comment permalink">1/29/17, 9:09 AM</a><br><br>

Sure, I took the basic assumptions and beliefs of the modern world for granted, but they never seemed to form an essential part of my identity. Thus, to find out that there is nothing self evidently true about Progress or Humanity’s Destiny was not jarring for me. It was far more disturbing to learn that whether or not I feel connected on a visceral level to the universe, I have not been granted a free pass from consequences of mine (and others’) actions, or non-actions.<br>Nevertheless, people interested in societal collapse are not that tiny a minority. Believers of the Abrahamic faiths, for instance, have diverse traditions of ‘End of Days’ theologies which deal with complete annihilation of this or that irredeemable aspect of humanity and/or the universe.

So I do what I can, but only so far as it doesn't jeopardize my marriage and family. <br><br>If I could start again I might choose a different path. I admire and sometimes envy folks who've done so (hat tip to e.g. Cherokee Chris and other commenters here), but that's not how it worked out for me. In practical terms, my efforts come to this: <br><br>I voluntarily quit the academy, while a post-doc in the late 90's, as I was one of those flying environmental scientists. The hypocrisy was obvious and unbearable, even before I really understood it. <br><br>I started a small business in a trade I believe will survive decline and serve my family and customers well, and that better aligns with my values: physical labor, conserving resources measurably, for people who pay me and thank me face-to-face. I do OK, but my take home is probably less than half what it would have been, and no benefits. I consider myself very fortunate to be able to do this at all, since without my wife's income it wouldn't have been possible.<br><br>I mostly don't fly, except for in-family marriages that I can't otherwise travel to, e.g. in Hawaii. I discourage the rest of my family from flying, with success mostly with the kids, as my partner flies several times a year for work. I still drive as part of my work, but mostly forgo driving otherwise: weekend trips to the mountains are no longer a regular part of my life. We bike and walk where we can, and choose to live where that is mostly practical. This translates into one 25 gallon tank of gasoline in the truck every 2- 3 weeks.<br><br>Our house is built mostly from salvaged material, almost entirely with my hands (and yes power tools). It is very efficient, very nice, moderate size, and has taken almost 20 years of late evenings and long weekends. Next year we'll begin the masonry heater, and when that's done we'll be able to heat it without petroleum or electricity.<br><br>Although we live in the city, I have made provisions so we can provide ourselves with decent ground water indefinitely, and I've made a large underground bunker/root cellar for refrigerator-free semi-perishable food storage.<br><br>But producing enough food on our own, no way. Our little garden is growing, and we have chickens and sometimes rabbits, but we will never, ever, cover even a fraction of our nutritional needs. That's alarming to me, and I don't see a practical way to change that in the time I've got left.

Yes, small scale insulin production from animal pancreas is doable, under very hostile conditions, as proved by Eva and Victor Saxl who produced enough to keep Eva and a few hundred diabetic Chinese alive during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai using a basement lab in the Jewish ghetto. The latest 'recipe' I've been able to find is from 1965 which should make much better quality insulin than what the Saxl's could make from much less pancreas (it looked like 10kg of pancreas would be enough for a couple hundred people).<br><br>Key is to minimise the need for insulin and reduce risk of mistakes in amount taken by minimising carbohydrate consumption and relying on energy from fat instead (rather than standard current medical practice which teaches people to eat what they want and then 'cover' it with insulin, which leads to insulin resistance and wild swings in blood sugars for many people). Insulin doesn't keep for long but each diabetic only needs a few drops daily so ideally you'd be located in a larger city or town with access to a slaughterhouse and you'd make a new batch twice a week or so, supplying lots of others to pay for the inputs. <br><br>The current real time blood tests would be very difficult to imitate but old style urine testing is possible, which tells you how well you are matching your insulin needs over the longer term. Rotating which animal species pancreas are used will reduce risk of allergic reactions. Obviously, nowhere near a perfect solution but many people survived decades using these types of insulin and urine testing so it seems like a worthwhile technology to pursue.<br><br>New diabetics should also look into the research into low carb diets, exercise and vitamin D as ways to induce remission (ie substantially extend the honeymoon period)<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c4481636258623546001 title="comment permalink">1/29/17, 9:38 AM</a><br><br>

I share your discomfort with the modern world, both socially and economically. I would like to point out that it is not necessary to be reincarnated to know the peace of living in an ecosystem. You are still young enough at 42 to become familiar with your local plants and animals. Unless you live deep within a metropolis there is probably a wild area nearby where you can practice stealth camping, making camouflaged shelters, foraging, and maybe some discreet hunting with a 22. All it takes is time and attention, and almost no money. I have never felt any attraction to farming but the movement and searching and intimately knowing a landscape that hunting and gathering requires is very satisfying to me. In addition to many excellent books and your own experience you will meet some others who are passionate about this life. But you have to get out there to meet them because they are unlikely to talk about living in the woods in a coffeeshop. Most of my friends are people I've met in the woods over the years. They are different because they say what they really think and tend to do whatever they want to do. Maybe we'll never be as native as an Amazonian but we can take this life as far as we choose. I think a good starting point is to become very familiar with a wild area near you, to know everything that lives there during the four seasons, and then practice camping there, with a small footprint, invisible to all but the most observant humans. <br>Somebody recently asked me whether I missed talking to people during long sojourns in the woods. I said no, I don't miss what passes for conversation in the modern world, with several video monitors and 20 other distractions going on, and the tendency people have to always have to rush off somewhere just as a real conversation gets started.<br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c6107208626299016607 title="comment permalink">1/29/17, 9:47 AM</a><br><br>

My guess is that a lot of the primary and secondary wealth lies in the "taking" red hinterlands of flyover country. We won't really know until we dissolve the union and each new nation has to balance the books and provide for the commonwealth on their own. I must say that KY (and states like it) are popular destinations for preppers due to low population density, lack of nukes, access to water, etc. Before the Civil War, the South was the nation's wealthiest region, which leads me to believe that the South has a lot of primary and secondary wealth, once it gets out from under the blue tertiary wealth regions' thumb.<br>As for imported food, you should know that we have a thriving and growing locavore/farming scene here in KY, and lots of people around here are committed to eating locally.

The US and each of the 50 states are representative democracies with the power of electoral choice. The last Civil War was neither inevitable nor necessary, as was recognized at the time. Responding to secession with war this time around will be a choice, as well. If both sides commit to a peaceful resolution around the negotiating table, then war will be avoided.

In fact I adore Californians, and precisely to the degree that they remain Californians. And I bear no more ill will to Californians that might move to Colorado, than to any of the forty-eight other foreign States. To continue, this ill will is nothing more than a good will for the Culture that came to form here in the last Century... and I do temper in knowledge that it was born in blood. <br><br>In fact my closest allies in my communities are refugees from California, Texas, Maryland, and Connecticut, but they all have the good sense to imitate the culture that they have moved to, and to carry their own cultural quirks modestly. In rural areas it must be so, because the landscape has been shaped by the Pioneer culture such that it now shapes what culture might grow there. In urban areas things are more difficult, as with much money and expensive property value the place can be, and is, rebuilt to the standards of the Sea People (to use an Egyptism). Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, and the I-70 region has fallen to these urban cultures. Even in the boonies of the South West corner Durango is mutating into such an impossible creature. <br><br>Should California withdraw the water treaties entitling them to Western Water would not come to an end. It would merely become a point of contention between different political powers, and I would be worried that violence would quickly boil to the surface. It is likely that such a dispute would destroy the irrigation infrastructure of Western Colorado. And together with Climate change accelerate its depopulation. <br><br>Colorado became a 'cool' state recently, and now has filled in with rapidly expanding cities which are built around the values of the Coastal Infrastructure. Our climate and means of sustenance in this area are especially brittle, and I think that moving to this area is foolish. Even staying here, as I intend to, is very dangerous and should only be attempted by those willing to incorporate into both the current hill billy culture, and open to the needed transformations to come. If I am very lucky I will be part of a culture that can adapt to living more harmoniously on this brittle land, but if that fails, if we are not up to the challenge of adaptation, this area will be all but unlivable.<br><br>I am grateful for the good people who have brought vigor here, but resentful of the ideologies that have come with.<br><br>Wendy, if you want to come here you are welcome, despite all said above, but know that if the politics of California were to follow that would make things a lot rougher.

From the comments I read, it sounds like brewers and distillers are going to be a bit thick on the ground during the decline.

Given the cloud of smoke, gunfire and small explosions. You send your young men, who may be impressed into service and young women into the woods. You wait, on your knees with your forehead to the ground, at your gate. A few well wrapped small packages are in front of you.<br><br>Up rides the warrior band. You are probably NOT dealing with the warlord, but with one of his lieutenants. There are many lieutenants, all vying for favor in their liege's eyes. <br><br>(Lieutenant) "What's this?"<br><br>(You) "Simple farmers, Sir. We have small offerings for you and your Liege."<br><br>"Like what? What would YOU have that we could possibly be interested in? On your feet man, and look me in the eye!"<br><br>"This Sir, is turmeric. Adds zest to meat and helps with some joint pain. This is honey candied ginger. Sweetens the breath to please your lady, cures all kinds of nausea and delights children. This is tea. You've probably heard of it. Invigorating drink. Helps a person stay alert. And, a bit of tobacco."<br><br>"Our Lord has banned the evil weed! (Leans over saddle) "But I haven't had a good smoke in three years." <br><br>You notice a couple of the riders are wounded. So, you say ...<br><br>"I notice a couple of your men have bad wounds. Granny up there on the porch has pretty good luck with healing bad wounds. Don't know how, she just does.

Or gross amounts of pressure get Congress to cancel the debts--do not hold your breath for this. However, depending on your income there are ways to lower your payments or even get the loan forgiven after a certain number of years. On one program, working ten years for certain types of non-profits (basically 501(3)c) will get loans cancelled. Beware of tax consequences however. There are a number of formulae based on your income, family size, etc. to determine a maximum payment that may be lower than what you are paying. This can be a disadvantage if you are getting good wages now as it stretched the loan out and you pay more interest. If you are paying through Edfinancial check their web site. Also, NOLO Press (the how to do your own divorce, bankruptcy, etc.people), have a book about managing student loan debt. I recommend it. In any financial emergency be sure to stay on top of the situation by requesting a forbearance. The people who end up in trouble are those who bury their heads in the sand and ignore the bills. <br><br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c1092626420361947282 title="comment permalink">1/29/17, 5:47 PM</a><br><br>

For years N. Californians have been hostile to the demands of S. CA for more water. Some of us will cheerfully donate everything south of the Tehachapis to Mexico. But while the coastal cities, and Sacramento as capital, are fairly prosperous, the Central Valley has been depressed for some time. Cities such as Stockton and Modesto are staggering along and most rural counties, and the congressional districts gerrymandered to include large chunks of them, are red. A lot of the mountain areas are also poor or dependent on tourism. And much of the tourism is dependent on weather: no snow, no skiing, no money. Not a problem this year, but we know that it will be long term. There are miles and miles of "country" in the foothills that are really thinly spread suburbs. Houses on 5,10 or 15 acres, too small for profitable agriculture, even if the water is there. The residents commute to nearest or sometimes farther city for work. There is little actual agriculture because of soil, weather, etc. and much of this will be abandoned when it is no longer practical to get propane for heating and cooking and fuel to commute is too expensive. Not to mention that fighting the increasing forest fires is getting to be very expensive. There has already been talk of just containing fires rather than all out efforts to save isolated home.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c8231744973650147811 title="comment permalink">1/29/17, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

I've fielded a lot of pushback in response to my challenge to the conventional wisdom -- which is what you're defending, you know -- but I think you're the first to base the pushback on the idea of the individual as historical free agent. That's interesting enough that it deserves a post of its own in response. One thing, though -- no, the laws of thermodynamics don't specify an isolated system. Systems that have energy flowing through them from an outside source to an outside sink -- dissipative systems, in the relevant jargon -- are very much part of the theory. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Cherokee, the traditional wages for an apprentice were room and board, but I'm not sure whether that would work in your situation -- or whether anyone would take you up on such an offer! <br><br>Fred, I'd certainly celebrate if voting fraud were to be proved, but no, that won't shut up Trump's critics. One of the things we've seen over the last two decades or so is that the tribal hostilities that divide the US are so deeply entrenched that mere facts can't sway them. <br><br>Ursachi, Trump's a transitional figure at best, and I don't expect him to preside over more than the first steps toward disengagement. Still, I prefer that to Hillary Clinton's all-out neoconservatism. <br><br>Scotlyn, this touches on a family memory. One of my great-great-grandmothers had Down syndrome. These days she'd probably be institutionalized, but they didn't do that in rural Washington Territory when she was born. Instead, she grew up alongside all the other children, and took part in the ordinary life of what was then a frontier community. She never learned to read or write her own name, but she was an incredibly good cook and adored children, and my great-great-grandfather Greer, who married her, considered himself the luckiest man alive to have so sweet and capable a wife. My late grandfather knew her, and she taught him how to cook -- and in his firefighting days he was widely considered the best firehouse chef in Grays Harbor County. So making room for waifs and strays is much more productive than our current cultural prejudices make it look...<br><br>Barrabas, I've seen exactly the same thing with white activists here regarding our native peoples, so it wasn't hard to extrapolate! <br><br>Fred, have you noticed that across the board, those people who are supposed to understand money in this society really, truly don't have a clue? <br><br>Rita, oh, there's definitely something to be said for warlords! <br><br>111DFC, those are valid points. The US is unusually vulnerable to the downside of its own history, for the reasons you've mentioned among others.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c5954723130129852072 title="comment permalink">1/29/17, 10:43 PM</a><br><br>

I'd wondered why the Great Naropa Poetry Wars et al. seemed to have cooled off so suddenly; an invasion from California that had to be driven off by both sides in alliance would certainly have done it. <br><br>Wendy, it's not about who does or doesn't suck. It's simply a matter of major cultural differences. (For example, I can't think of another part of the US where the immediate reaction to a situation like this would be a reference to your own emotional state, e.g., "I feel tremendously sad.") Given those cultural differences, and the political, economic, and social differences that result, it would work better for everyone if California went its own way, did its own thing, and no longer tried to impose its model on other parts of this very culturally diverse country.<br><br>Sven, pay off your debts. You can't be sure of anything until that's out of the way, because anything you own is fair game to debt collectors -- and you can't be sure that (a) there'll be any sort of amnesty and (b) that your student debt will be included in it. Until and unless that happens, make getting out debt your top priority, and you'll be better off. <br><br>Matt, glad to see there's more than three of them. I'd be happier if there were more than three thousand of them, but apparently that's past hoping.<br><br>Canon Fodder, that's why I had California descend into civil war and failed-state status in my <i>Retrotopia</i> stories. Living 14 miles north of the CA border, and traveling extensively in the formerly Golden State, gave me a fair sense of the bitter rivalries within its borders. <br><br>Brent, that's a valid question, and not one a lot of people ask or answer! For me, it's actually fairly simple. I find history fascinating; I find the fact that I'm part of history, situated at a recognizable point along the normal cycle of rise and fall, even more fascinating; and since I know that what follows my time is the fall of civilization and the coming of a new dark age, with all the problems and possibilities that opens up, it's a bit like looking out the window on a day in late autumn and wondering what the winter is going to be like. I find some aspects of modern industrial society loathsome, and other aspects pleasant; I'd doubtless have the same reaction to any age I happened to be born in; but the unfolding of the story is the thing that holds my interest.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c4680080159420945256 title="comment permalink">1/29/17, 10:58 PM</a><br><br>

It'll be interesting to see if the Berniecrats manage their hostile takeover on the second try; I certainly hope they do. <br><br>Big Rant, fair enough. Thank you. <br><br>Hubertus, ding! We have a winner. Exactly; collapse is already happening all around us, but it's happening at history's pace, rather than Hollywood's. <br><br>Indus56, I addressed that sort of argument <a href=../../2013/06/what-actually-happens.html rel=nofollow>in an earlier post</a>. It's easy to come up with hypothetical reasons why it might just possibly be different this time, and of course quite a few of my readers have done that. Over and over again, though, during the years this blog has been appearing, predictions made on the basis of such arguments have failed, and predictions made on the assumption that it's no different this time have turned out to be correct. Year after weary year, I've fielded claims that the collapse of industrial society will be sudden, irrevocable, and imminent; year after year, the predicted crash never comes -- and year after year, the Long Descent unfolds on schedule. Did you know that Donald Trump was predicted in the pages of Oswald Spengler's <i>The Decline of the West</i>? Stay tuned; we'll be talking about that this week. <br><br>Shane, I've been floundering to keep up with comments, while getting some writing projects out of the way and dealing with other things. I gather some things slipped through that shouldn't. Hmm; clearly I need to find a more boring subject to talk about for a while. ;-)<br><br>Jbarber, hmm! Thank you; I hadn't seen those.

I'm going to have to contemplate on your reply because you are no doubts correct, and also I will consult with others to get a different perspective. My original opinions on the matter were described as feudal and I appreciated that feedback because it is hard to see yourself as other people do - and I would be a benevolent dictator - but also consultive - if given the opportunity. I really appreciate being able to conduct a dialogue with you on such matters. I didn't mention that my copy of Retrotopia turned up in the mail at the Post Office on Saturday morning. Yay! Your links to the publishers website for ordering on this blog site is a great idea.<br><br>The news from your country today made me spit my chamomile tea out all over the keyboard, no less, with a massive belly laugh. So you now have a President who follows through on campaign promises. Well done, well done. A politician made a joke down here once about core and non core promises made during a campaign. Basically a non core promise during a campaign is by any other definition: a lie. What surprises me about the news from your country is that there is a level of outrage that you have a politician who does what he says he will do. That in and of itself is very telling about your culture and the sort of news that your country is fed. My wife and I were joking to each other this evening that your country may well get that wall. Honestly, your country needs the pressure relieved from the building tensions and your President looks like he understands how to get dissident groups wasting their time.<br><br>And incidentally, I would really like to understand why so many professional activist groups had joined together to protest the current ban on people from certain countries at airports in the US, do they not realise how easily they were dismissed as irrelevant because they were diluting their core message by taking that action? The whole protest mechanism thing seems weird to me. Perosnally I would group together and advise the airlines that we - as a group - will no longer fly using your service unless that carrier lobbied the politicians, and then actually do it.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c3761866638485448275 title="comment permalink">1/30/17, 1:34 AM</a><br><br>

I think about it a lot, as the public system here is very extensive. Everyone in Denmark has a right to home nursing, and the public sector also provides home help (personal hygiene, food prep and basic cleaning) free of charge. (One must be evaluated and be found in need of the services either temporarily or permanently.) What happens when the wheels go off the system... Those without a network nearby, or who refuse to move closer to their network may very well starve and freeze to death in filthy surroundings. There have been rumors that the poorer municipalities might need to cut back on the cleaning services they provide - in that case the person in question would need to rely on their family or hire a cleaner, if their pension can bear it. <br><br>@Violet I too wish you a thorough recovery. I've just printed your herbal guides from your blog, so thank you for that. <br><br>Re: Calexit <br>As someone raised in the Sierra Nevada foothills (I have lived abroad the past 15 years, I guess that makes me a calexpat), the idea of California seceding in its present form makes me scoff. Even after 15 years my visceral reaction to the idea of Southern California is "clueless, useless water thieves". When I went to university in the Bay Area it was like moving to a foreign country (I say this as someone who has in fact moved to a foreign country - twice!).

I suppose an overabundance of brewers would have to depend on degree of awareness of collapse in the community where you happen to reside. We've got a German fellow not far from us brewing beer and wine. I practice fermenting as one of the healthiest, most effective preservation techniques, but usually run my icky apple ciders through to vinegar, which is much more useful. It may be that our farm will help supply him raw materials in the future.<br><br>We're due to put in a couple rows of popcorn this year, otherwise we might run short. But it occurred to me that among the investments I've made during the past ten years, the only one I can think of that's grown in value are all the little fruit and nut trees that are sitting around in pots all over the place while I wait for my husband to find some land he feels okay about buying. To judge from the prices for similar trees at gardening centers, they've grown about ten times in value in five years. About twice a year you run over and give them a bit of sh*t (try doing that with your stock broker) and they show signs of joy. Show up a few days later and they're trying to impress you with their Popeye impersonation. Gosh they're fun.<br><br>Like any other investment, if you don't know what you're doing, you lose it. But with a little effort you can develop your skills and create nice gifts in the short term, an orchard in the medium term, and maybe an occupation with some demand in the long term.<br><br>@Violet, please keep us informed on how it goes for you. Lots of sympathetic people here. I take it you're new to hypersensitivity, but not new to alternative health care. We want to know what works for you. My own hypersensitivity impelled me to collapse early. I have no regrets. Like you, I limit my Internet time and usually only engage with people here at TADR. I log on once every two or three days, and don't manage to converse at that rate, but the comments section here is really valuable, and a big credit to JMG. I have to spend a lot of time on the computer because of my job, but all equipment is wired. If I am ill, I have to limit my time strictly, but I am mostly doing okay.<br><br>@Everyone, I keep hearing that you find most people don't want to think about collapse. I don't know about smartphone addicts--they seem to be in a world unto themselves--but my impression from my social contacts is they say they don't want to talk about it, but subconsciously they are fixated on it. You show up and the conversation springs to life again, with them ferociously questioning whatever hint you've thrown their way about "reality." They're feeling it in their bones. Look at how the comments here have swollen.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c8364417667090382635 title="comment permalink">1/30/17, 2:41 AM</a><br><br>

There are plenty of organizations already existing which are community and help that can help teach how to community works.

Indeed the narrative other than the one peddled of 'Everything is awesome' is truly fascinating.<br><br>I feel I should add that on an emotional level I have this 'hatred' towards humankind, but on a logical level (when taking the view of an alien observing our planet) I don't blame humanity at all.

In particular, if the energy entering the system is supplied as heat and energy leaves the system as work, the heat is accounted as positive and the work is accounted as negative.<br><br>2nd Law: Many ways of being expressed, here is one [ "<i>Processes in which the entropy of an isolated system would decrease do not occur, or, in every process taking place in an isolated system, the entropy of the system either increases or remains constant</i>" from the textbook 'An Introduction to Thermodynamics, the Kinetic Theory of Gases, and Statistical Mechanics (2nd edition)', by Francis Weston Sears, Addison-Wesley, 1950, 1953, page 111 (Chapter 7, "the Second Law of Thermodynamics"). The phrase <i>isolated system</i> means that neither energy nor matter may enter or leave the system; it is an embodiment of the word "unaided" as used by Maxwell &amp; Clausius. If the system is not isolated, then energy can get in, and so can "aid". Hence, isolation is required to uphold the restriction "unaided". ]<br><br>or ".. applies only to isolated systems in thermodynamic equilibrium" taken from a discussion with using it in open systems." (r2)<br><br>or "total entropy of an isolated system always increases over time, or remains constant in ideal cases where the system is in a steady state or undergoing a reversible process." -- wikipedia<br><br>or a mathematical expression of the second law one ( of many ) allegedly widely accepted is: <br><br>Entropy increase principle for isolated (or adiabatic) macroscopic systems:<br>(dS) ≥0<br> iso<br>where dS = entropy change of a system, subscript “iso” means is applicable to isolated/adiabatic systems.<br><br>So, [ "with all the stress on ... isolated, how does one use the 2nd law in systems that don't measure up? .. Fake it. .. the "fake" is to take your non-equilibrium system, and carve it up ... into smaller subdomains." "real trick if your system is not isolated, have to keep track of all the entropy and energy that goes in or out, along with the strictly internal sources &amp; sinks, for both entropy and energy." "If the outer boundary is impassable, and the system isolated, then you know that the aggregate change in entropy must be 0. If not, just replace 0 with the net entropy change across the system outer boundary, and you know that system as a whole can't go beyond those limits." "In this way, you can apply the essential spirit of the 2nd law, even in the case of a system that is neither in equilibrium, nor isolated." ] (r2)<br><br>The analysis I read regarding that new theory referenced in a prior comment about interacting parallel universes suggested that IF further testing of it was positive then it might mean having to redefine our concept of the Universe. I'll leave it to the theoretical physicists to argue the toss about the validity and implications of that. Still, I found it interesting.<br><br>(r1) wikipedia<br>(r2) http://www.tim-thompson.com/entropy3.html<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c3629087025628239315 title="comment permalink">1/30/17, 1:33 PM</a><br><br>

It's possible to share community with people who have wildly differing political / philosophical views to you.<br>3.

Lots of people overestimate their contribution to the common good, and underestimate the burden that their presence places on it.<br>5.

Learn to tell the difference: reassure the first group and tune out the second. <br>6. There will always be complaints. <br>7.

I find that such things vary enormously depending on the situation specific to an individual. I understand what you mean when you refer to the idea of a conventional wisdom but I am uncertain of its validity and don't subscribe to it's existence per se.<br><br>"Conventional wisdom" is defined as "the body of ideas or explanations generally accepted as true by the public and/or by experts in a field" but problem is the public encompasses billions of people each of whom have their own belief systems, perception filters and needs through which they choose to interpret knowledge and have their own resulting wisdom. Experts in a field tend to form cliques or camps that try to negate each other and attract believers but is one group more deserving of the conventional wisdom label ? I don't think so. The scientific method is itself built-upon the notion of falsifiability and peer review. There is no absolute 'truth' in it just changeable probabilities, it is a mistake made is to assume otherwise.<br><br>I have encountered many people who say things like "people never change" and that statement might possibly be put under a conventional wisdom umbrella. It is also verifiably false in individual cases and yet it is frequently trotted out in discussions and the disproving cases conveniently ignored.<br><br>I try to work from first principals relying on my direct experiences over and above: dogma, standard accepted norms, conventional wisdoms, others accepted wisdoms / opinions etc. According to medical wisdom I should be dead or suffering enormously given my behaviour and life choices but I'm not. People who know my circumstances for the last 5 years expect me to be depressed, sad, lonely, full of hatred or anger etc. I'm not. Quite the reverse actually.<br><br>What I have noticed quite a lot of is a pattern in my peers who get told they should be X because of Y [ and then they live up to X ] and others that seem to seek to avoid 'trying something new' and will look to their local "skepticsRus depository of reasons to think Z is wrong because the possibility makes them feel uncomfortable" rather than do their own research and if applicable experimentation. <br><br>You obviously do your own research and experimentation ;) and you form your own personal belief system as a result. So do others. Me too ;) <br><br>You may believe that civilisation history cycles are everlasting and IIRC you used birth/death as another example but wouldn't death eventually happen to those cycles themselves ?<br>I have my own experiences to guide me on the question without reference to others wisdom on it.<br><br>While I find it interesting to have discussions on such topics like this I'm not interested in attracting people to my beliefs. For me, beliefs only need to work for the believer and where they don't then they look to change them.<br><br>History is fascinating to study &amp; learn from but it is arguably, with significant verifiability, a poor &amp; unreliable indicator of the future. Yes, sometimes trends can be predicated but always ? no. And as time-windows widen the drop-off is significant. Examples of invalidated predictions abound. You or Spengler etc may well have highlighted patterns but I think it is a stretch to take those observations as perpetual absolutes. To me that 'wrongness' was clear before I researched others criticisms of Spengler.<br><br>You could be absolutely right, about the cycle completing in the way you expect it to for some percentage of those affected but to assume it for all? or in perpetuity?<br><br>That is a step to far for me because it is disproven by my personal experience.

Unless I've been banned; having not continued reading the comments from previous posts I wouldn't know. <br><br>I only have one note on the main text -- I think the Great Cheetoh is a RESULT of the general increase of heat over light in public discourse, not so much a cause of this. This trend is long-term and pervasive, and has many causes (not the least of which is the internet itself, of course). <br><br>The comment thread is huge and interwoven, so I won't try to include names of individual commentors. Just thoughts about some of the ongoing threads...<br><br>The whole succession thing... in a time of declining resources and increasing scarcity, IS this the best approach, even for the resource rich regions? It takes interstate squabbles over resources, migration, etc., and makes them international. It does allow more control over what crosses the border, in theory... but maybe it just turns what was once legal commerce into smuggling and black market commerce?<br><br>The Federal Government will lose power over time, inevitably. It sits atop a heap of energy and structure. That means it is unsustainable. Its ability to tell States what to do will shrink and shrink. Which means States will be negotiating more within and amongst themselves anyway. But some Federal services, like common defense, might actually be better handled by the remaining Feds rather than by States individually...? The notion of succession to create a more homogeneous cultural and political climate within a State... that's a non-starter. The rifts within the States will just loom larger. Which will happen regardless of seccession, as Federal power wanes. <br><br>About the idea that a State can feed itself... not without massive fossil fuel subsidies. I think a good rule of thumb is that long term sustainable you can expect about a tenth the yield of food calories in a purely sunlight based system. Local agriculture is a boutique thing, still. It focuses on specialties and/or high end markets. Reason for this: it takes more labor, therefore is more expensive. And local agriculture does not even begin to replace the huge production of grains and legumes from fossil-fuel agriculture; rarely does it even try to be fossil-fuel-free. Only a few very small communities attempt to really do without the fossil fuels, and they are supporting families, not cities. <br><br>It is a long way down, and will take a very long time to get there. And most of the steps down will not be planned in advance. They will be forced upon us and we will improvise them one by one as they come.<br><br>Finally as for collapsing now... yay all in favor of investing the resources you have now in ways to be more resilient to the coming (ongoing) unpredictable winds of change. This is one of the major principles structuring our life here. But... ya know...<br><br>The collapse is happening, and there is no sign that any large-scale coordinated efforts to slow or ameliorate it will ever happen. Macroeconomics dictate energy and resource use on the macro scale, not policy. Right now the jets are flying, the gasoline is flowing, money is still useful. So... as you pre-collapse, think about doing some other stuff now, while you still can...<br><br>Go to DisneyLand. Take an international vacation. Splurge on a bit of entertainment and other useless wasteful luxuries. And forget entirely about neo-puritanical notions of this being planet-destroying sin. The masses won't stop doing these things until they can no longer afford them. Why shouldn't you indulge a little bit too? Live today, for tomorrow you die.

I elaborated on this here: http://culturalspeciation.blogspot.com/2016/03/god-socialism-evolution-and-invisible.html. Of course if democracy is not assumed and we allow for top-down hierarchies, then other cultures such as the ones in Asia should be able to plan on a local warlord scale.<br><br>But if planning is not going to happen in local groups in the US, there is still the possibility of just trading surplus, or planning among two families at a time. I find that so far that is working here in rural Missouri, though we are far from having a locally based livelihood. Most people eventually give up on making money from the local economy (unless they have been here for generations) and join the global economy.

What does a green wizard's hat connote in Chinese culture? <br><br>Cherokee, the ongoing political circus here really is quite the spectacle. On the one hand, yeah, we've got a president who's doing what he said he would do, and that's a sufficiently unusual spectacle that everyone's in shock; on the other hand, I'm quite convinced that he's pursuing the strategy of being deliberately outrageous that won him the election, because it plays well to his base, and because it keeps the other side flailing around in reactive mode rather than pursuing their own agenda. One way or another, popcorn is definitely called for. <br><br>Prizm, and a hearty gong hay fat choy to you and yours as well! Of course it's worth preserving such vestiges of community as we've got; that's one of the reasons I stay active in the Freemasons, for example. It's just not something you can rely on yet. <br><br>Brent, true enough. The thing is, there's a pushback; it's just taking its time, as so often happens when a species expands into a previously unreached ecosystem or finds a new and successful subsistence mode. We're just now beginning to feel the building pressure...<br><br>Jay, thanks for the correction on the water compact. Are you remembering, though, that if California secedes and its citizens are no longer paying Federal taxes, that the California government can then take up the slack, raise taxes to a comparable level, and have its own military bases, agriculture subsidies, etc.? Since California citizens currently pay out in federal taxes more than the state takes in from federal spending, there's quite a bit of room for maneuver there. <br><br>Anthony, that's an appealing image. In some Japanese spiritual traditions, pouring buckets of ice cold water over your head is a means of developing inner power, so maybe if I keep it up, some of my readers will attain enlightenment! <br><br>Bryant, many thanks for this! It's more welcome than you may realize, as it offers solid, quantitative real world confirmation of the theory of catabolic collapse <a href=ecoshock.org/transcripts/greer_on_collapse.pdf rel=nofollow>(PDF downloadable here)</a> that underlies my entire project. <br><br>Inohuri, I ain't arguing. <br><br>Wendy, did you think I was criticizing you? Nope -- again, I was simply pointing out a cultural difference between Californians and people in other parts of the country. (You'll notice I didn't use words such as "whining", as you did.) Again, from within your state's culture, your reaction makes sense; from an outside perspective, well, we don't need to get into that. Of course that's just it; there are aspects of California culture that rub a lot of other Americans very much the wrong way. That doesn't mean they're wrong, or bad, or what have you; it simply means that things would probably work better if there was a national border between us.

The short form is that the conventional wisdom of our society concerning its own future is the claim that our civilization cannot, must not, and will not follow the same trajectory as every other civilization in the known history of the planet. It's got to have a unique destiny -- and the thing that fascinates me is that many people don't seem to care whether it's uniquely wonderful or uniquely horrible, so long as it's unique. As for the predictive value of history and historical cycles, you might want to look into that before jumping to conclusions; I've been making predictions here based on history and cyclic theory, Spengler's in particular, and scoring far more hits than misses, while those who insist "it's different this time" reliably flop.

Roman gossip called him "every man's wife and every woman's husband," among other scurrilous things, and he spent a lot of time deep in debt; he also had a high squeaky voice, though I don't think he had short fingers. It's in retrospect, and largely because his famous nephew used his deification as a political tool, that he became the towering figure of later legend and literature.

I mentioned previously that I have 20yrs experience from the financial realm, more specifically in Risk Management, where they use a variety of statistical methodologies ( HistSim, MonteCarlo ) to perform risk analysis &amp; management. Such methodologies involve looking back over time at day to day changes of specific risk factors or to specific prior events in order to asses likely trends. The goals tend to be about answering questions like how risky would this new trade be; what type of countering hedging trade should I make or how would I be impacted if XYZ happens next week, next month, next year etc. Even with the ocean of financial history available now they still get it massively wrong. The level of detail available to them is arguably more accurate / complete than accounts of events long ago. The efficacy of both technical and fundamental analysis in any case is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis. Even the weather prediction models that have ~100 years of data to work from get it wrong and struggle with forecasting too far ahead.<br><br>As I don't follow what other people are saying about it I will take your word on that for now. I'm not aware of claims of our civilisation "having to have" a unique trajectory. I'm certainly not claiming things will be different this time so it doesn't apply to me. I'm saying that whatever our civilisation's trajectory may end up being .. "<i>no prediction based on historical analysis is going to nail that trajectory for every member of that civilisation.</i>."<br><br>There is <b>always</b> the chance of something unexpected / unpredictable. That does not mean chance will present it self to all or anyone ;) Denying that simple fact would be is tantamount to selection bias. <br><br>Maybe Graham Hancock's Theory of a recurring danger from a swarm of meteors due to arrive in the next 20 years will pan out with some chance of an full/partial ELE. His piecing together of geological evidence, mythical stories, alleged historical fact is reasonably well constructed and evidence has appeared to validate some aspects of his overarching theory since it was first touted 20 years ago regardless of mainstreams ad hominem attacks and attempts to shutdown hard science research. He, like you, has built a following. Are his ideas wrong or right? No idea. Only time will tell. He's trying to convince governments to at least allocate funds to watching space better.<br><br>Also, I don't see how you can claim that those who insist it is going to be different this time "have reliably flopped" .. civilisation hasn't ended as yet (has it?) [ and there is arguably more than one civilisation on the planet right now .. those amazonian tribes spring to mind, getting on and doing their own thing. Then of course we have parts of the 3rd world which are less reliant on the things that may cause the USA to go under ]. I appreciate you have your own ideas about how things are going to pan out .. you have said endings take decades/centuries so we won't know the accuracy/veracity of those ideas for some time yet.<br><br>I'm aware you score your ideas highly with some measure of validation. I've read prior posts stating similar. I look forward to reviewing them again 50+ years from now and seeing how well they did but I will not a priori take them as definitive fact. Given my beliefs, that is asking for trouble for me personally ;)<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c2837012469750988644 title="comment permalink">1/30/17, 7:58 PM</a><br><br>

The whole point of this blog is to talk about what happens if we have a normal future instead -- "normal" here in the same sense as "normal curve," that is, the statistically likely future, the future that will happen barring a really big rabbit gets pulled out of a hat somewhere. <br><br>The cyclic theory of history includes a lot more than the concept that civilizations have life cycles, which is why I can say that cyclic theories have been far more successful than the linear theories our culture prefers. The major theorists -- Spengler above all -- describe specific stages through which civilizations pass in the course of their lives. Spengler himself, writing just short of a century ago, made successful predictions covering many of the changes that have happened since his time. By contrast, historical analysts who base their predictions on linear extrapolation consistently get things completely wrong -- do you remember when we were going to have cities on the Moon, a cure for cancer, and electricity too cheap to meter by 2000? I certainly do. <br><br>As for economic predictions, when an economist makes a prediction, he's wrong, but that's less a matter of the complexity of the situation than it is of lethal flaws in the fundamental presuppositions of economics as a (pseudo)science. In the runup to the 2008 housing crash, for example, tens of thousands of people correctly identified what was going on as a classic speculative bubble, and discussed it at length; economists, on the other hand, were by and large blindsided. (I recall an essay by Nassim Taleb, one of the few exceptions, in which he described his attempt to point out the obvious to a room full of economists, and all of them looked at him as though he was crazy.) I did a post a while back specifically on that latter theme, which you can find <a href=../../2013/04/an-aside-to-my-readers.html rel=nofollow>here</a>. <br><br>Patricia, heh.

It's precisely your point about how having community gets people working together and accomplishing things despite how different they may feel or lean politically. Our current lack of ability to communicate is directly related to how little people care about community, and instead continue on in their narcissism, as JMG mentioned earlier. I think this is further evident in our lack of continuity with our historical community. People constantly thinking and saying "it's different this time" and "we (I) am so unique." They've failed to have any dialog with the past. <br><br>My wife pointed out something I found relevant to this idea. As we were listening to some classical music my wife noticed the song was from one of the older Disney films, either Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty (it doesn't matter which but we're going to find out which one later). She then made the comment how interesting it was that even in the 1960s culturally people were appreciating classical music, which had been around for 100, 200, and some even 300 years. Fast forward to today, and a song that has been around for six months is too old. The same can be said of most films, books, fashion, and a good many arts. <br><br>In our determination to be unique, modern society has attempted to cut ourselves off from all the splendor which was previously created and is solely interested in only what is new. That has ultimately got us to this point, alone, and running away from our past, in effect forgetting to feel with our legs and feet, not grounded. Everyone who has tried walking when they cannot feel their feet knows how this ends. Face first in the ground. (I really enjoyed that Jack London story "To Build A Fire"). This isn't uniquely America's problem, but it is more predominate in the USA. Maybe we will be one of the first countries to fail and then the societies which spring forth from our decomposing body can begin sprouting. Those who are rooted in community now may reap some benefits later by being leaders. But hopefully one doesn't forget that in order to lead, one must set the example.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c607657186231996210 title="comment permalink">1/31/17, 12:02 AM</a><br><br>

I've made no statements about futures being preferred. So not sure why you roll your eyes.<br><br>You might be interested to know that Financial Risk Calculations rely heavily on normal distributions and standard deviations (rather than linear extrapolations) from them to indicate the statistical likelihood of events occurring to different risk factors that have been calculated using historical inputs. <i>They still get it wrong</i>. I have written and maintained risk engines for years in my career and did statistics at university so I'm reasonably familiar with the concepts. What tends to be forgotten is the existence of outliers and the tendency to massage them out of existence or simply override their implications. I'm sure I said all this in prior comments though.<br><br>I never rated economics eitehr, always considered it a bit of a pseudo-science too. Economic theory has little to do with the calculation of financial risk though - Risk calculation is more a technical analysis / management tool. Financial risk calculations - in the Monte Carlo methodology especially relative to Historic Simulation - is all about chance. You may be interested to know the monte Carlo methodology is considered to be technically better than HistSim. <br><br>I'm aware of what Spengler describes and I repeat I am aware he has critics other than myself. As I recall they went further in their criticisms than my focus on Spengler's ignoring the impact of innovation, inspiration and intuition.<br><br>Anyway Mr Greer, I've taken up enough of your time on this topic - we are clearly not going to agree and we have already looped quite possibly boring the audience. I have evidence sufficient for myself that automatically invalidates any attempt to dismiss the ability of innovation, inspiration and intuition to affect any ( and I would dare to say every ) cycle imaginable. I've written about it as directly as I can but if its not coming across then I don't really have anything else I can add to it.

Because Hancock's primary hypothesis posits about a 20,000 year periodicity, and the science he claims supports it actually is about a 26 million year periodicity. I don't think the odds of an ELE in the next 20 years are much different than they were in the last 20 years, or the last 2000 years, likely the last million years. Indeed the astronomers have concluced that we are already in a high bombardment time, and have been for a million years or so. Certainly no significant change in this risk factor in the coming decades.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c6108571158900028296 title="comment permalink">1/31/17, 7:01 AM</a><br><br>

I will add, parenthetically, that the main complaint many of us have had against conservativism, understood in a large sense, is not its policies, many of which are quite sensible, but its' relentless demanding of cultural conformity from all, in defiance of the tastes, talents, inclinations, personal and family histories, and even financial resources of others. <br><br><br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c284943263046276604 title="comment permalink">1/31/17, 7:54 AM</a><br><br>

There is so much state sovereignty to repossess by constitutional means before resorting to secession. Given the power of foresight, I'm sure the veterans of our last experiment in this direction would have gladly reconsidered their choices. Are we to ignore their warning? For the downsides of confederacy versus a republic, you can do no better than to brush up on The Federalist. For an appeal to your heart, no better than Lincoln:<br><br>"I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c4671805237173936428 title="comment permalink">1/31/17, 9:48 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks for bringing up climate change again. I look forward to reading more about the cyclical view of history + future projections, as in variation not duplication because the cycle is perhaps more like a helix or gyroscopic figure than repetitive circles (which makes me think of W.B. Yeats, of course). It also makes me think of Native American views of time and occurrence and the necessity for ceremonialism to keep cycles on track and the earth (universe) functioning as it should. <br><br>Every civilization gets its own unique form of collapse. Aren't we special. :) "Me-focused" marketing writ large.<br><br>Just before a hard freeze this fall, we harvested a bunch of green cherry tomatoes and put them on the kitchen table by a window.

We quickly realized given a certain future of supply disruption, a new roof is top priority. Its 30 years old and we could probably wait a few more years, but we can't count on having more money then or even the roofing materials being available. And what if the cost is double due to inflation or lack of materials or shipping costs or tariffs? <br><br>My grandparents were born in 1920 and grew up during the Depression.

As has been the case for the whole election and inauguration, it is some really bright people doing the tantrum.

They can''t be doing anything else other than this social media stuff. <br><br>There is such a huge effort going on to call everything Trump does "wrong". And the man has hardly done anything.

Transition Engineering is a paradigm shift and it's not "sustainability engineering". It is very hard, but we work with exactly what is really happening, exactly what can really be done, and exactly what the constraints on the whole system are. Transition Engineering is the interdisciplinary job of changing existing systems to eliminate fossil fuel use. We do this work for companies, organizations and communities. <br><br>It is fun to point out to the small number of people who listen what deep shit we are in. But if we are extremely lucky, the field of Transition Engineering will emerge and take off in much the same way Safety Engineering did 100 years ago.

Most people in the U.S. now, everywhere I've been are for more connected to their jobs and economic opportunities than to a town or state. There are exceptions of course, but the bulk of the population is willing to move out of state for a job or retire in Florida. A suburb in Massachusetts is just as good as a suburb in Oregon. My friends in eastern Connecticut are a little different in that we are all from here and nobody wants to leave. I know there are areas of such people in each state but we are the minority. Perhaps, as Bill and others pointed out this will change as the economy scales down and we are forced to be more local. Right now, though, the ones with a strong local or regional identify are usually those with families going back many generations and/or a strong attachment to local geography and culture.<br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c5161234607537114081 title="comment permalink">1/31/17, 12:35 PM</a><br><br>

But for instance, if you had to show government ID to buy alcohol no matter what, there could easily also be a way to blacklist yourself from buying alcohol if you have a problem - very easy to implement while we still have the Internet.<br><br>I forgot all about that shooter, and yeah, I remember that foul mixture of patriotism and creeping authoritarianism. I might not like Mr. Dressup, but I'm still glad he beat Harper. And you're right, a religious building is an especially awful place to shoot up.<br><br>On the other hand, even though Canada is in the very early stages of the process compared to Europe, Islamization appears to be a one-way street in most cases. This absurd bill m103 is an example of the kind of politics that will become more and more common as more ridings become Islamic ridings. So I can understand the rage if not the actions. Islam, at least the forms of it which spread rapidly, is really something like the Borg. I do hope that once the more successful (highest growth rate) strains achieve decadence they become a bit more respectful of the individual.<br><br>FYI if bill M103 passes, this post will have been a hate crime for which I could be sent to prison. Recently, a man - a total jackass - in Britain was sent for prison for smearing a mosque's doors with bacon. He was denied separation from Muslim inmates and was brutally murdered in prison.

Shoulda posted sooner but didn't get to. Responding to emails and Facecrack are consuming my time even though I have few online friends but one very self-centered sister.<br><br>On the coming collapse (Dave Z is right: why is it different this time?), I find my self almost totally unprepared! Right now I'm depending on government support for food and rent and handouts from my three siblings indefinitely b/c my share of my mum's estate was setaside for my retirement, if Congress doesn't move the minimum retirement age for my age bracket [I'm 56] repeatedly). Need I say more on this particular point? No. But if you *want* more....<br><br>So going to dealing with the ongoing collapse, I'm going to have to go back into the ratrace, which the rats have won, in order to be able to: first, pay off un-charge-off-able debts and second, collapse now with the rush with some semblance of dignity left -- my best option would be to buy an inexpensive house in a nearby small town here at New Orleans, like Bogalusa. The thing is, I don't see reentering the ratrace as something that is going to happen, no matter how much I pursue it. Barbara Ehrenreich wrote more about this kind of futile hunt for reemployment in her book, <i>Bait and Switch</i>. <br><br>Now slightly OT, on the Union of Concerned Scientists having advanced the doomsday clock by 30 seconds: betcha dollars to doughnuts (mmmmmhhh... doughnuts!) that they never would have done that had Hillary won the Election. But they should have anyway, because of the No-Fly-Zone she would have declared in a foolish idealistic fit of compassion over that one particular boy in that one particular ambulance, whose photograph was sent all over the Mainstream Media, probably by CNN where I saw it. What about the other boys -- and girls -- who were collateral-damaged or even butchered by our "allies," the terrorists?<br><br>Now on your plans on leaving Cumberland, where are you planning to go? May I suggest Cuba or Belize? Cuba already went through a collapse with flying colours and you'll be able to get along if you know Spanish. Belize is not that far up on the industrian civilisation ladder, has recently been decolonised from the Brits and hasn't attracted much attention from Uncle Sam.<br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c6879890671223631633 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 9:40 AM</a><br><br>

The mid-2000s was when the War on Iraq was turning out to be obvious to all as the complete disaster that it was. Since the Neocons couldn't get at Iraqi oil anymore due to the enormous clusterfrack they created, they decided to go after Russia: for her oil of course, so I state at the risk of being labelled Captain Obvious!<br><br>@ Carlos M. 1/25/17 5:31 PM,<br><br>On the <i>NYer</i> article, it was in the runup to the dark ages after the Roman Empire collapsed, that monasteries were virtually and basically the unintentional doomsday prep for the Christian church. Now what does that say about us, collectively, when the only ones doing "serious" and/or "sufficient" prep for the dark future before us are the exceedingly rich rich people, who are following the advice that Doomer Pornographers handed out from about 2004 through 2011?<br><br>@ John the Peregrine 1/12/17 5:44 PM:<br><br>Which is another reason why, to the civilised peoples who were against these things and with whom the Mongolians (to put it lightly) came into contact, they were Evilly Evil Evildoers of Evil.<br><br><br><a href=how-great-fall-can-be.html#c7647794384966298964 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 9:43 AM</a><br><br>

The "zones" could be space or time: special neighborhoods in a town, rooms in one's house, days of the week, or even an hour of the day in which we turn off the main breaker, light a candle, and exist without fossil fuel. Some precendents are the designated Wilderness zones in which even Park personnel can't use power tools, and traditional Sabbath day? Like an immersion language class, this would give people a 100% taste, an alternative space that is parallel to BAU.
