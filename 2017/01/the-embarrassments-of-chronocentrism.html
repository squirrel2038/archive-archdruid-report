It's a curious thing, this attempt of mine to make sense of the future by understanding what’s happened in the past. One of the most curious things about it, at least to me, is the passion with which so many people insist that this isn’t an option at all. In any other context, “Well, what happened the last time someone tried that?” is one of the first and most obviously necessary questions to ask and answer—but heaven help you if you try to raise so straightforward a question about the political, economic, and social phenomena of the present day. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In previous posts here we’ve talked about thoughtstoppers of the “But it’s different this time!” variety, and some of the other means people these days use to protect themselves against the risk of learning anything useful from the hard-earned lessons of the past. This week I want to explore another, subtler method of doing the same thing. As far as I’ve been able to tell, it’s mostly an issue here in the United States, but here it’s played a remarkably pervasive role in convincing people that the only way to open a door marked PULL is to push on it long and hard enough. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s going to take a bit of a roundabout journey to make sense of the phenomenon I have in mind, so I’ll have to ask my readers’ forbearance for what will seem at first like several sudden changes of subject.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the questions I field tolerably often, when I discuss the societies that will rise after modern industrial civilization finishes its trajectory into history’s compost heap, is whether I think that consciousness evolves. I admit that until fairly recently, I was pretty much at a loss to know how to respond. It rarely took long to find out that the questioner wasn’t thinking about the intriguing theory Julian Jaynes raised in <i>The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</i>, the Jungian conception Erich Neumann proposed in <i>The Origins and History of Consciousness</i>, or anything of the same kind. Nor, it turned out, was the question usually based on the really rather weird reinterpretations of evolution common in today’s pop-spirituality scene. Rather, it was political. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It took me a certain amount of research, and some puzzled emails to friends more familiar with current left-wing political jargon than I am, to figure out what was behind these questions. Among a good-sized fraction of American leftist circles these days, it turns out it’s become a standard credo that what drives the kind of social changes supported by the left—the abolition of slavery and segregation, the extension of equal (or more than equal) rights to an assortment of disadvantaged groups, and so on—is an ongoing evolution of consciousness, in which people wake up to the fact that things they’ve considered normal and harmless are actually intolerable injustices, and so decide to stop. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who followed the late US presidential election may remember Hillary Clinton’s furious response to a heckler at one of her few speaking gigs:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“We aren’t going back. We’re going forward.” Underlying that outburst is the belief system I’ve just sketched out: the claim that history has a direction, that it moves in a linear fashion from worse to better, and that any given political choice—for example, which of the two most detested people in American public life is going to become the nominal head of a nation in freefall ten days from now—not only can but must be flattened out into a rigidly binary decision between “forward” and “back.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s no shortage of hard questions that could be brought to bear on that way of thinking about history, and we’ll get to a few of them a little later on, but let’s start with the simplest one: does history actually show any such linear movement in terms of social change? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It so happens that I’ve recently finished a round of research bearing on exactly that question, though I wasn’t thinking of politics or the evolution of consciousness when I launched into it. Over the last few years I’ve been working on a sprawling fiction project, a seven-volume epic fantasy titled <i>The Weird of Hali</i>, which takes the horror fantasy of H.P. Lovecraft and stands it on its head, embracing the point of view of the tentacled horrors and multiracial cultists Lovecraft liked to use as images of dread. (The first volume, <i>Innsmouth</i>, is <a href=http://www.miskatonicbooks.com/THE-WEIRD-OF-HALI-INNSMOUTH-by-John-Michael-Greer-Signed-Limited-Edition-Hardcover.html>in print in a fine edition</a> and will be out in trade paper this spring, and the second, <i>Kingsport</i>, <a href=http://www.miskatonicbooks.com/THE-WEIRD-OF-HALI-KINGSPORT-by-John-Michael-Greer-Limited-Edition-Hardcover-ADVANCE-ORDER.html>is available for preorder</a> and will be published later this year.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of Lovecraft’s few memorable human characters, the intrepid dream-explorer Randolph Carter, has an important role in the fourth book of my series. According to Lovecraft, Carter was a Boston writer and esthete of the1920s from a well-to-do family, who had no interest in women but a whole series of intimate (and sometimes live-in) friendships with other men, and decidedly outré tastes in interior decoration—well, I could go on. The short version is that he’s very nearly the perfect archetype of an upper-class gay man of his generation. (Whether Lovecraft intended this is a very interesting question that his biographers don’t really answer.) With an eye toward getting a good working sense of Carter’s background, I talked to a couple of gay friends, who pointed me to some friends of theirs, and that was how I ended up reading George Chauncey’s magisterial<span style='font-family: "times new roman" , "serif"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'> <i>Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Makings of the Gay Male World, 1890-1940</i>. </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What Chauncey documents, in great detail and with a wealth of citations from contemporary sources, is that gay men in America had substantially more freedom during the first three decades of the twentieth century than they did for a very long time thereafter. While homosexuality was illegal, the laws against it had more or less the same impact on people’s behavior that the laws against smoking marijuana had in the last few decades of the twentieth century—lots of people did it, that is, and now and then a few of them got busted. Between the beginning of the century and the coming of the Great Depression, in fact, most large American cities had a substantial gay community with its own bars, restaurants, periodicals, entertainment venues, and social events, right out there in public.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor did the gay male culture of early twentieth century America conform to current ideas about sexual identity, or the relationship between gay culture and social class, or—well, pretty much anything else, really. A very large number of men who had sex with other men didn’t see that as central to their identity—there were indeed men who embraced what we’d now call a gay identity, but that wasn’t the only game in town by a long shot. What’s more, sex between men was by and large more widely accepted in the working classes than it was further up the social ladder. In turn-of-the-century New York, it was the working class gay men who flaunted the camp mannerisms and the gaudy clothing; upper- and middle-class gay men such as Randolph Carter had to be much more discreet.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So what happened? Did some kind of vast right-wing conspiracy shove the ebullient gay male culture of the early twentieth century into the closet? No, and that’s one of the more elegant ironies of this entire chapter of American cultural history. The crusade against the “lavender menace” (I’m not making that phrase up, by the way) was one of the pet causes of the same Progressive movement responsible for winning women the right to vote and breaking up the fabulously corrupt machine politics of late nineteenth century America. Unpalatable as that fact is in today’s political terms, gay men and lesbians weren’t forced into the closet in the 1930s by the right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They were driven there by the left. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the same Progressive movement, remember, that made Prohibition a central goal of its political agenda, and responded to the total failure of the Prohibition project by refusing to learn the lessons of failure and redirecting its attentions toward banning less popular drugs such as marijuana. That movement was also, by the way, heavily intertwined with what we now call Christian fundamentalism. Some of my readers may have heard of William Jennings Bryan, the supreme orator of the radical left in late nineteenth century America, the man whose “Cross of Gold” speech became the great rallying cry of opposition to the Republican corporate elite in the decades before the First World War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was also the prosecuting attorney in the equally famous Scopes Monkey Trial, responsible for pressing charges against a schoolteacher who had dared to affirm in public Darwin’s theory of evolution. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The usual response of people on today’s left to such historical details—well, other than denying or erasing them, which is of course quite common—is to insist that this proves that Bryan et al. were really right-wingers. Not so; again, we’re talking about people who put their political careers on the line to give women the vote and weaken (however temporarily) the grip of corporate money on the US political system. The politics of the Progressive era didn’t assign the same issues to the categories “left” and “right” that today’s politics do, and so all sides in the sprawling political free-for-all of that time embraced some issues that currently belong to the left, others that belong to the right, and still others that have dropped entirely out of the political conversation since then. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I could go on, but let’s veer off in another direction instead. Here’s a question for those of my readers who think they’re well acquainted with American history. The Fifteenth Amendment, which granted the right to vote to all adult men in the United States irrespective of race, was ratified in 1870. Before then, did black men have the right to vote anywhere in the US? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most people assume as a matter of course that the answer must be no—and they’re wrong. Until the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, the question of who did and didn’t have voting rights was a matter for each state to decide for itself. Fourteen states either allowed free African-American men to vote in Colonial times or granted them that right when first organized. Later on, ten of them—Delaware in 1792, Kentucky in 1799, Maryland in 1801, New Jersey in 1807, Connecticut in 1814, New York in 1821, Rhode Island in 1822, Tennessee in 1834, North Carolina in 1835, and Pennsylvania in 1838—either denied free black men the vote or raised legal barriers that effectively kept them from voting. Four other states—Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine—gave free black men the right to vote in Colonial times and maintained that right until the Fifteenth Amendment made the whole issue moot. Those readers interested in the details can find them in <i>The African American Electorate: A Statistical History</i> by Hanes Walton Jr. et al., which devotes chapter 7 to the subject. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So what happened? Was there a vast right-wing conspiracy to deprive black men of the right to vote? No, and once again we’re deep in irony. The political movements that stripped free American men of African descent of their right to vote were the two great pushes for popular democracy in the early United States, the Democratic-Republican party under Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic party under Andrew Jackson. Read any detailed history of the nineteenth century United States and you’ll learn that before these two movements went to work, each state set a certain minimum level of personal wealth that citizens had to have in order to vote. Both movements forced through reforms in the voting laws, one state at a time, to remove these property requirements and give the right to vote to every adult white man in the state. What you won’t learn, unless you do some serious research, is that in many states these same reforms also stripped adult black men of their right to vote. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Try to explain this to most people on the leftward end of today’s American political spectrum, and you’ll likely end up with a world-class meltdown, because the Jeffersonian Democratic-Republicans and the Jacksonian Democrats, like the Progressive movement, embraced some causes that today’s leftists consider progressive, and others that they consider regressive. The notion that social change is driven by some sort of linear evolution of consciousness, in which people necessarily become “more conscious” (that is to say, conform more closely to the ideology of the contemporary American left) over time, has no room for gay-bashing Progressives and Jacksonian Democrats whose concept of democracy included a strict color bar. The difficulty, of course, is that history is full of Progressives, Jacksonian Democrats, and countless other political movements that can’t be shoehorned into the Procrustean bed of today’s political ideologies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I could add other examples—how many people remember, for example, that environmental protection was a cause of the far right until the 1960s?—but I think the point has been made. People in the past didn’t divide up the political causes of their time into the same categories left-wing activists like to use today. It’s practically de rigueur for left-wing activists these days to insist that people in the past ought to have seen things in today’s terms rather than the terms of their own time, but that insistence just displays a bad case of chronocentrism. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Chronocentrism? Why, yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Most people nowadays are familiar with ethnocentrism, the insistence by members of one ethnic group that the social customs, esthetic notions, moral standards, and so on of that ethnic group are universally applicable, and that anybody who departs from those things is just plain wrong. Chronocentrism is the parallel insistence, on the part of people living in one historical period, that the social customs, esthetic notions, moral standards, and so on of that period are universally applicable, and that people in any other historical period who had different social customs, esthetic notions, moral standards, and so on should have known better. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Chronocentrism is pandemic in our time. Historians have a concept called “Whig history;” it got that moniker from a long line of English historians who belonged to the Whig, i.e., Liberal Party, and who wrote as though all of human history was to be judged according to how well it measured up to the current Liberal Party platform. Such exercises aren’t limited to politics, though; my first exposure to the concept of Whig history came via university courses in the history of science. When I took those courses—this was twenty-five years ago, mind you—historians of science were sharply divided between a majority that judged every scientific activity in every past society on the basis of how well it conformed to our ideas of science, and a minority that tried to point out just how difficult this habit made the already challenging task of understanding the ideas of past thinkers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To my mind, the minority view in those debates was correct, but at least some of its defenders missed a crucial point. Whig history doesn’t exist to foster understanding of the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It exists to justify and support an ideological stance of the present. If the entire history of science is rewritten so that it’s all about how the currently accepted set of scientific theories about the universe rose to their present privileged status, that act of revision makes currently accepted theories look like the inevitable outcome of centuries of progress, rather than jerry-rigged temporary compromises kluged together to cover a mass of recalcitrant data—which, science being what it is, is normally a more accurate description. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In exactly the same sense, the claim that a certain set of social changes in the United States and other industrial countries in recent years result from the “evolution of consciousness,” unfolding on a one-way street from the ignorance of the past to a supposedly enlightened future, doesn’t help make sense of the complicated history of social change. It was never supposed to do that. Rather, it’s an attempt to backstop the legitimacy of a specific set of political agendas here and now by making them look like the inevitable outcome of the march of history. The erasure of the bits of inconvenient history I cited earlier in this essay is part and parcel of that attempt; like all linear schemes of historical change, it falsifies the past and glorifies the future in order to prop up an agenda in the present. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It needs to be remembered in this context that the word “evolution” does not mean “progress.” Evolution is adaptation to changing circumstances, <b><i>and that’s all it is</i></b>. When people throw around the phrases “more evolved” and “less evolved,” they’re talking nonsense, or at best engaging in a pseudoscientific way of saying “I like this” and “I don’t like that.” In biology, every organism—you, me, koalas, humpback whales, giant sequoias, pond scum, and all the rest—is equally the product of a few billion years of adaptation to the wildly changing conditions of an unstable planet, with genetic variation shoveling in diversity from one side and natural selection picking and choosing on the other. The habit of using the word “evolution” to mean “progress” is pervasive, and it’s pushed hard by the faith in progress that serves as an ersatz religion in our time, but it’s still wrong. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s entirely possible, in fact, to talk about the evolution of political opinion (which is of course what “consciousness” amounts to here) in strictly Darwinian terms. In every society, at every point in its history, groups of people are striving to improve the conditions of their lives by some combination of competition and cooperation with other groups. The causes, issues, and rallying cries that each group uses will vary from time to time as conditions change, and so will the relationships between groups—thus it was to the advantage of affluent liberals of the Progressive era to destroy the thriving gay culture of urban America, just as it was to the advantage of affluent liberals of the late twentieth century to turn around and support the struggle of gay people for civil rights. That’s the way evolution works in the real world, after all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
This sort of thinking doesn’t offer the kind of ideological support that activists of various kinds are used to extracting from various linear schemes of history. On the other hand, that difficulty is more than balanced by a significant benefit, which is that linear predictions inevitably fail, and so by and large do movements based on them. The people who agreed enthusiastically with Hillary Clinton’s insistence that “we aren’t going back, we’re going forward” are still trying to cope with the hard fact that their political agenda will be wandering in the wilderness for at least the next four years. Those who convince themselves that their cause is the wave of the future are constantly being surprised by the embarrassing discovery that waves inevitably break and roll back out to sea. It’s those who remember that history plays no favorites who have a chance of accomplishing their goals. </div>

I predict based on my linear model of history that this post will break 300 comments. ;)<br><br>It never ceases to amaze me how little most people, whether on the left, right, or center, know about even very basic facts of history. I have used the term "Whig history" before with friends in casual conversation, e.g. Troy, why don't you like "The Man Without a Country"!?, to which I answer, it's sappy Whig history. But 99% of the time I then have to explain what a Whig was, and what Whig history is, and why Whig history is bad. (And yes, I do realize that the term "Whig history" does not directly relate to the U.S. Whig party). Few people have even heard of Whigs it seems. I suppose I could say "teleological paradigm of history", but that just doesn't roll off the tongue quite so beautifully.<br><br>It's a pity the term is not more widespread. There is a delicious irony in the Whigs' view that they were the culmination of history, yet today Whigs are not a thing. Francis Fukuyama was not a Whig, but his infamous End of History book was Whig history of the highest order.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c5596410215103686132 title="comment permalink">1/11/17, 1:50 PM</a><br><br>

I would probably call it as complementary annex for his visionary work "Der Untergang des Abendlandes". It describes Spengler's visions about prehistory and predicts, in 1931, disappearance of industrial work from Europe and US, into the Third World. Speaking about precise predictions, there is one!<br><br>Spengler's vision about civilizations as flowers in meadow, each living their life only for themselves before withering and dissapearing, and each of them almost totally uncapable to learn from other civilizations, is so much closer to what we actually witness happening in history than this linear idea of progress.<br><br>There is excellent, may I say seminal, analysis of Spengler by Finnish historian and philosopher Georg Henrik von Wright. He brings into equation his idea of "bundle of codirectional motives", taking Spenglerian analysis a bit away from it's almost biological form. He uses as one example of this kind "fasces" how church architecture, music meant to be played in those churches and scientific sound wave theory were originally seen as sides of same phenomenon. And it was truly so. Scientific idea of sound waves was originally introduced by Descartes in his "Compendium musicae", and he sees scientific theory of sound as inalienable part of same spiritual quest for "holiness in empty space" as church architecture and church music, which it was meant to serve. Anyone who has truly seen baroque churches knows this is true, intuitively. They are spaces meant to rise into infinity of space, and theory of music and sound born from that theory are just spiritual techniques to serve communal experience of that mystery. <br><br>So in summertime of Faustian culture, motivations for spirituality, practical applications of science and science itself were not separate, but one. Faustian longing "to harness the Nature" was very much spiritual quest back then. Examples abound. Only after this strong "fasces" of codirectional motives scattered into separate, and partly mutually exclusive, strands starts the fossilization and decay of Faustian soul. The culture changes into civilization. Von Wright has also read his Nikolai Danilevski, who wrote "Rusija i Evropa", first book intoducing historical cycle theory into Western (?) thinking, in 1869. Spengler has obviously read Danilevski also, many oh his ideas about future Russian civilization are derived from Danilevski, who was hard core panslavist. His book, this "Rusija i Evropa", is oddly Spenglerian long before Oswald himself put pen on paper. I recommend Danilevski warmly for you. He thinks that form of world history is circular. He also represents this group of naturist, almost poetic, historians from Russia that flourished there before Revolution, and who really don't buy idea of linear progress. Orthodox mysticism blends seamlessly into precise scientific methodology, phenomenon not often repeated in Anglosphere history writing. Meyer, one of the great historians, mentions also him in "Zur Theorie und Methodik der Geschicthe", and indicates interest at his ideas at early date (1902). So this cycle theory has long roots, and strong support base, in Europe, but not in Anglosphere. Impact of India and very weirder forms of Buddhism in southern flank of Russian Empire are evident, and German connection to that sub-continent has been long and cast many shadows. <br><br><br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c2134336698135736823 title="comment permalink">1/11/17, 1:59 PM</a><br><br>

So a repeat.<br><br>For technical aspects, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy's primer on how to sail the Barque EAGLE, "A Manual for Square-Rigger Sailing" by Edwin H. Daniels, 4th edition, Naval Institute Press is quite good.<br><br>The Australian, Alan Villiers, who documented the last days of the square riggers by sailing on them while writing and filming, wrote over 40 books. "Falmouth for Orders" and "By Way of Cape Horn" might be the most useful for you. My favourite line though, is in "Sons of Sinbad" when he expresses doubts about crossing the ocean in an ancient Dhow with an even more ancient uncorrected dry-card compass as the sole navigational aid. The Master assures him "It is only to Zanzibar, and I have been there before and know the way"<br><br>"Cruise of the Cachalot" by Frank T. Bullen, while about a whaling cruise, is an excellent source for ship board life in the second half of the 19th century. Bullen is also an excellent story teller. The chapter involving "Paddy and the Chance" versus the U.S. Whalers in New Zealand is great. I'd sail with Paddy and his Maori in-laws in a heartbeat.<br><br>And of course, Joseph Conrad. I'd suggest any of his short stories involving sailing. "Youth" would be good. Incidentally, the movie "The Duellists" is based on a short story of his. One of the few times I've found the movie to be superior to the original; Ridley Scott fleshed out the story nicely without excessive padding.<br><br>For general boat information, "Skiffs and Schooners" by Pete Culler, while concentrating on boat building and small boats, is invaluable. I can critique his designs all day, but his philosophy is hard to beat.

Prokaryotic cells are not "primitive" - they are exactly evolved and will change rapidly to meet any changes in the chemical environment that they live in. In comparison, eukaryotic life is complex with many sub-structures and it stores several orders of magnitude more protein synthesis information in it's DNA. It was a huge shock for me recently to realize that a lot of this extra DNA is literally baggage from the past that eukaryotic life keeps just in case it needs it again.

We study the various currents in Christianity, trying to deal with its decline into in irrelevance over the past century. The class is lead by a member of the Westar Institute (The Jesus Seminar). We're currently discussing The God Problem by Nigel Leaves, a survey of a number of Christian thinkers on how to debate about the existence of God, in contrast to the fundamentalist insistence on defending God at all costs. <br><br>I was struck by one line: “ The necessity of evangelism is replaced by “post-theistic universalism”, whereby the tribalism of the past fades into oblivion” ( p. 30, The God Problem, Polebridge Press, © 2006). I protested that I could see little evidence of the decline of tribalism, and we had several hot minutes where most of the room were definitely on the side of the religion of progress, while I tried to refer to history and the cycles written about by Toynbee. After discussion, some began to accept my contention that we are all a part of many tribes, and that those tribes can have differing, even contradictory, ideologies or theologies.<br><br>Seeing that the class is in a Unitarian Church, there is a great density of believers in the Religion of Progress in the community. There's been a lot of gnashing of teeth, rending of garments and loud wailing about the events of the recent election. However, one of my fellow classmates was just evicted from her longtime position as coordinator of the local Amnesty International chapter. She was told: "Amnesty member leaders are not free to dissent from Amnesty's policies and positions while identifying themselves as Amnesty volunteer leaders."

On the one hand you had an economic system that was driving production away from the home - cutting women out of their traditional domestic productive domains - brewing, food production, weaving, textiles, etc. All of these productive enterprises were being squeezed out of the domestic sphere and the skilled control of women and co-opted into the public, economic sphere from which women were then barred. <br><br>A woman still had a family to feed and a household to run, but less and less access to the means to do so without relying heavily on the wage a husband could bring home...

And alas my favorite quip from that era probably does not quite fit the content guidelines of this blog, essentially stating that "If God had intended men to have sex with each other he would have..." well, lets just say he would have equipped them anatomically in exactly the way men are indeed equipped. <br><br>These shiftings and reversals of attitudes and progress and what not should hardly be a mystery to anyone who, like me, was born in the South in the mid 20th Century. When I was a child the white supremacists were Democrats, and had been for as long as anyone could remember. In the late 1960s and especially into the 1970s as the racism was rejected by and faded within the Democrats, I optimistically believed that this meant it was fading from society as a whole. But it turns out it was just migrating to the Republicans. Note that I am not saying that all Republicans in the South are recists, just as not all Democrats in the earlier decades were racists. But if you find an Old School racist in the South today, he votes Republican unless he is over 80 (or more likely, over 90). And many of these Old School racists are relatively recent arrivals from other regions of the country, interestingly. <br><br>My question is, is this new? Is this a feature of the 20th and 21st Centuries, or is it actually much older? I suspect it is older, perhaps dating back to the Renaissance?<br><br>It also seems to me that a belief in the progression of society towards a more godly space is also widespread among American Christians now, Evangelicals and Mainlines. I know this certainly has not always been the belief among Christians, many of whom in earlier times believed the world was irredemably fallen. Some still do believe this, but it seems a pretty minority view among American Christians now, "left" or "right."<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c464462875260666235 title="comment permalink">1/11/17, 4:09 PM</a><br><br>

It is quite ironic how progressives reflexively label their opponents as "reactionaries", when it is easily demonstrable from distant and recent history that they are just as reactive to the circumstances. You know how "evolved" American progressives have become when big businesses jumped on boutique identity politics issues such as transgenderism. Progressives, naturally, they took this as a sign that history is on their side. Having thrown their traditional working-class constituencies under the bus, dismissing them as backward rubes, they've become blind to the way they've sold out to the elite how they're being co-opted in turn.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c4990017769646355055 title="comment permalink">1/11/17, 5:21 PM</a><br><br>

Chauncey didn't draw the specific connections with the Progressive movement I noted -- I suspect he realized he was already going to stir up a firestorm with the material he pretty much had to include, and decided not to add buckets of kerosene to the flames by pointing out the political alignment of the anti-gay forces. <br><br>Lawfish, exactly.

Hinds, I like "survival of the least inadequate"!

I'd also point out that the phrase "people are less racist and sexist now" is true only in a nuanced sense, and given very specific definitions of racism and sexism. There are also other bigotries -- for example, class prejudice -- that have become far more pervasive among the same classes that pride themselves on how they've supposedly outgrown racism and sexism.<br><br>Hubertus, all in all, it's about what you can expect from a bunch of social primates who've learned a few clever tricks! <br><br>Zaphod, and of course there's that!

The answer by and large is "it varies." To the extent that it's possible to generalize, people are nicer to one another when they perceive abundance by the standards of their time -- so that, for example, people in the Middle Ages could feel overwhelmed with prosperity and very eager to share their good fortune when their wealth was objectively way below what we consider destitution today.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c8125690331173520453 title="comment permalink">1/11/17, 5:40 PM</a><br><br>

Furthermore, he, for whatever else one may take issue with in his writing, wisely pointed out that history owed us no favors-- and certainly did not observe any obligation to make human lives or sensibilities more tolerable or just. Indeed, to him, all actions and subjects were contingent, categorically, upon their vector in space time, their physical environment, and their culture-- in that order.

He determined those cycles by scoring historical events as either liberal or conservative, using the criterion of a liberal event as benefiting the average person, while a conservative event protects and supports the already rich and powerful. I was shocked to find that Alexander had scored the removal of Native Americans from the eastern United States as a liberal action. Today, that would be considered racist and definitely not a liberal thing to do. Michael defended his reasoning by saying it was a land redistribution scheme to take land from non-citizens (or a foreign nation, which Native American tribes technically are) and give it to citizens. That benefited the time's conception of "the average person." According to his criteria, it was a liberal event, even if it wouldn't be seen as one today. As his editor, I accepted his reasoning, even if I wasn't happy about it.<br><br>On a related note, the annual fund-raising social events of state and local Democratic parties are commonly called Jefferson-Jackson Dinners. Because of the conflict between the acceptance of racial diversity and equality by the current Democratic and the racism of both of the party's founders, there is a movement to change the name of these dinners to something more reflective of the modern party. One suggestion has been to call them FDR-Kennedy dinners.

What I am thinking of is that the sort of progress one makes in completing a hike, or fixing a car, or optimizing a business or government to current and anticipated near-future circumstances is different from the linear progress towards Heaven/Outer Space/Utopia that the Church of Progress promotes. Until the last few months, I would have sworn most people in the progressive left camp were with me in adhering to the former, pragmatic, definition.

I recently realized this while doing idle research about the metaphor of Israel as it was used in early New England. The Separatists (Puritans) referred to Plymouth as the New Israel, and when they allied with some Indians and went to war with others, the Native enemies became "Canaanites" and "Amalekites" in the eyes of Puritan preachers. <br><br>This was a metaphor, but it was a pretty severe one-- in Deuteronomy, God orders the complete massacre of the Amalekites down to their babies and their livestock. Christians today try to portray this as a destruction of the Devil's forces because of the <a href=http://taylormarshall.com/2012/01/why-did-god-order-death-of-gentile.html rel=nofollow>creepy and gruesome practices of the Canaan religion</a>. <br><br>And yet, even in this early period there were some people who refused to play the Puritan game. One guy in particular, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Morton_(colonist) rel=nofollow>Thomas Morton</a>, was thrown in the stocks and then banished from Plymouth for his disagreements with Puritan religion, and got back at them by writing a book called <i>The New English Canaan</i>, in which he dared to insinuate that New England's native wildlife and landscape looked a lot more like Canaan than Israel, so wouldn't it be nice if we all tolerated different ethnicities and beliefs like the Canaanites did?<br><br>It is probably America's first work of ecological literature, but I am guessing the Puritans did not like his conclusions too much... I get the feeling that although portraying the tension of scientific rationalism in the New England landscape is Lovecraft's brilliant innovation, the landscape had been nurturing these kinds of arguments for centuries before he was born. <br><br>(This isn't immediately relevant to chronocentrism, but again, everyone who is stuck between scientific ideals and human realities today is living out Lovecraft's modern revision of the original Puritan quest for perfection; Canaan is a lot easier to imagine than it is to live out. Will your consciousness be able to evolve in time? :))<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c9134166831694425013 title="comment permalink">1/11/17, 7:40 PM</a><br><br>

If you increase the time scale further though this could always change which I would say is a theme of your blog.

It was predicted by Emmanuel Wallerstein as early as 1990 I believe, and here it is, right on schedule. One of the major precepts of liberal thought, as I believe you have expressed already, more or less, is that ideals and ideology trump the material reality of the world around us, and I see that much of your readership has already rejected that proposition. I know how you feel about Marxism, but it was through discussions with other Marxists that I myself first became acquainted with the idea that ideologies are the product of the material interests of the classes that produce them, and not vice versa, a concept that cuts to the heart of much of what is discussed in this week's essay. This realization gave me important insight into what is needed to pursue pragmatic goals in the political sphere and elsewhere.

The linear view of history comes originally from Hegelian/Marxist thought, does it not?

I would guess that any model of history is probably going to be susceptible to someone not being careful about making sure they aren't bending facts to fit the model. Of course, that doesn't invalidate the model, but it would interesting to see whether this happens in books like Spengler that draw on this cyclical history model.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c3317593737561453742 title="comment permalink">1/11/17, 9:50 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you. <br><br>Jay, trust me, I get that kind of thing here all the time. You're right, of course, that I could have multiplied the number of examples endlessly. <br><br>Matt, I think it's probably going to be necessary to drop the word "progress" entirely for a while, because it's been so heavily frosted with unquestioned assumptions, unacknowledged emotions, and sheer thoughtstopping babble that it stops clear thinking in its tracks. There are plenty of synonyms, fortunately. <br><br>Barrabas, no, there you do Nietzsche a disservice. It's admittedly a very common disservice, and plenty of people who think they understand Nietzsche do it, but there it is. As for Heidegger -- oh bright gods. I'd much rather a Nietzschean universe than the verbal slurry of Heidegger! But I should probably discuss this in detail in a future post. <br><br>Lewis, yes, I've seen that. I think they're a little premature in their dating; I expect oil prices to begin creeping steadily up this or next year, and spike to economy-wrecking levels again around 2020 or 2021 -- though admittedly that's just a guess. <br><br>WB, no, not at all. The clueless ye have with ye always... ;-)<br><br>Keith, oh, of course. Jackson's white and male, and thus in the current climate of inverse racism he's personally responsible for everything evil that ever happened to anyone anywhere, just because of his race and gender. I wasn't thinking of the pseudoradical privilege bunnies, though. <br><br>Repent, if you want to discuss enlightenment and the attainment of nondual consciousness, I have no trouble with that. The favor I'd like to ask, though, is that people stop using the word "evolution" to describe something <i><b>that has nothing to do with evolution</b></i>. Evolution is adaptation to circumstances, and that's all it is. It isn't improvement, or attainment, or going to a higher level, or any of those things, and using the word "evolution" for improvement, or attainment, or what have you helps feed the delusion that history is a straight line leading somewhere we like. <br><br>With regard to nondual consciousness, btw, my experiences of it make me question the idea that it can be described as "bliss." If it's bliss as distinct from non-bliss, it's not nondual, because that duality still exists in it. Neither bliss nor non-bliss? That's more like it. <br><br>Avery, yes, in fact, I did -- and some of the backstory to the third book deals with refugees from a (fictional) attempt to set up a Canaan apart from the Puritan New Jerusalem, which came to an ugly end. (Fans of obscure early Robert Bloch stories may want to know that the imaginary town in question was called Roodsford, and it was in what's now the state of Maine.) Of course I brought in tentacles and the Black Goat of the Woods, but the basic theme came from history.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c7297969741434217579 title="comment permalink">1/12/17, 12:01 AM</a><br><br>

More generally, though, greater inclusiveness is something that happens during one part of the normal life cycle of civilizations, and then gives way to declining inclusiveness and social fragmentation in the following part. Faith in social progress pretends that the second half of the equation doesn't exist, and fixates on examples of the first. <br><br>Taraxacum, even a blind mouse can find a broken clock, or whatever the saying is. ;-) Marxism has huge failings, but the most important of them have to do with Marx's utopian prophecies. The basic idea of using class interests as a tool to understand intellectual currents, though it can be overdone, does very often reveal things the Whig histories of our time like to hide. <br><br>Wendy, yes, it's a weird saying.

I heard stories when contemplating growing one as a teenager of beards being shouted at in the streets In England before First World War with cries of “beaver!” And my mother when /I was a child would not leave the house for a bus ride without her hat and gloves. These days we are more likely to get conversations (‘controversy’) about the hijab, and a Muslim singer says in the Guardian: “So to me, the world is catching up.” Imagine!<br><br>Other changes: for example, public social spitting is uncommon in my country these days. And, generally, public toilets (bathrooms) are much better kept, which I guess is adaptive change, but perhaps only as long as there are resources to facilitate conveniences (priorities). Awareness could change. Sadly some useful behaviour might never come back. I noticed in the southern Balkans that the ability to rest squatting on heels was restricted to the occasional elderly person – young modern persons would not be seen doing such a thing!<br><br>Seriously though there are good customs and public spirit that is hard to do without at any scale, especially when the going gets tough.

It has taken Christianity almost 2000 years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth.' All that is said here grows out of a tragic misconception of time. It is the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral. It can be used either destructively or constructively. I am coming to feel that the people of ill-will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the vitriolic words and actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence of the good people.

The larger the *relative* inequality the more strain on mutual solidarity and interdependence, and the less generosity (or niceness) will manifest. The same evidence suggests that people on both the high and the low end of very stratified societies are less happy and healthy than people who perceive themselves to be among relative equals, even in circumstances that are very materially deprived.<br><br>I have mentioned my own theory about this recently, which is that too much inequality permits too great a rift between action and consequence, as the more powerful can too easily "externalise" detriments and appropriate benefits, and this sets off chains of actors lower down the hierarchy trying to do the same. (ie - grab benefits, while passing detriments to those less powerful). Stressful, and not very "nice", and ultimately self-defeating in ways JMG has outlined, because it gets difficult for anyone to recognise a consequence of an action even when it hits them in the face.

It's not exactly shocking to me that the pre-sixties left was very anti-homosexuality. Crusades against perceived moral degeneracy were a big part of old-time leftist thought, and communist countries vigorously suppressed any form of homosexual activity or expression on account of those things being forms of capitalist decadence to them. Indeed, the only reason Fidel Castro stopped imprisoning gay men in internment camps was precisely because radicals and liberals in wealthy Western countries (whom Castro would probably rely on to stage massive protests in case the USA ever invaded Cuba) had experienced such a dramatic change of heart about gay rights.<br><br>To further contribute to your elucidation on gay history, many cultural historians contend that it was the bonds formed by so many gay men who served in the US military during the Second World War that formed the seed of what would become the resurgent gay community of the sixties and the seventies. The final result has been a very mixed blessing to my way of thinking. The good side is that so many gay, lesbian, bisexual, and now transgender people have "come out of the closet" to people they know that homophobes who aren't completely stupid now have to blunt the vehemence of their public rhetoric lest they seem like hateful jerks to most people. The bad side is that the current "official" gay male community is largely an outgrowth of what I think is a pretty nasty and seedy pick-up bar culture.

That, in turn, might not be completely ridiculous as the human brain and its nervous system are a very complex interface between body and soul/consciousness. Who is to say how the physical configuration of matter in the brain might influence even things like empathy? After all, sociopaths are known to have different brain functions and may actually have defects that do not permit normal processing of emotional content. But if people want to talk of evolution of consciousness involving social attitudes, then just let them ask themselves: If this newly evolved human newborn were placed in another time and place, would they be immune to that culture's belief system and doggedly persist in having new age responses? If not, then why talk of evolution?<br><br>So the real question is, can we reach a stable condition of good society? How would such a thing work? And now we are right back in the arena with which much of this blog already deals.<br><br>Meanwhile I am asking myself if perhaps we need new categories of understanding human behavior that are not political labels as such. If the same ideals can be progressive in one era and conservative in another, then maybe what is really going on is that some people are more authoritarian and more willing to impose their sense of rightness upon others. <br><br>But I am having difficulty here because while I have a life philosophy that one should never interfere in the free will of another except in direst necessity (which sadly includes children), I can see that this dire necessity will be influenced by my determination that this or that thing is an outrage and must be stopped.<br>Perhaps a partial answer lies in methods used. I don't believe in force, violence and intimidation. So let us say there were something I find unacceptable, such as female circumcision. That does not mean I think we should invade some country and make it illegal or arrest people. But there are many possible persuasive tactics that could be used to get cooperation.<br><br>The only way we can begin to hope for societal evolution is to always, always learn from history. And by the way, being able to know and keep in mind the history of one's species is one of the main characteristics that demarcate the human from other animals in my opinion. Very important.

We do not have a functioning e-mail or telephone link, although we are live in the same upper-tier municipality of York Region, and so are almost within walking distance of each other. I will therefore use this TADR blog to remark that over at <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a> I have now done the best I could with your remarks on Ukraine (your TADR posting last week, timestamped "1/8/17, 12:31 AM"). My Ukraine-relevant remarks are in the 2017-01-09 or 2017-01-10 <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a> posting headed "Peacework and Propaganda", and beginning with the words <i>Does any world-news journalist, in a time of conflict, ever quite avoid breaching the "whole truth" rule? A commenter named "Esn" has suggested /.../</i>. <br><br>I remark there on what little I know about Ukraine from my limited experiences of the Ukrainian diaspora, concluding that I just do not know whether any current journalism on Ukraine avoids breaching the "whole truth" rule. This is not very good, I realize, but I lack the background in travel and personal contacts which you fortunately possess. <br><br><br>(2) Dear JMG, <br><br>Thanks for discussing maritime matters with sea-knowledgeable Glenn, of Cascadia. Glenn posted to TADR last week, over timestamp "1/11/17, 11:06 AM". <br><br>Although I have little to add here, I do want to remark - in case you have missed it - that C.S.Forester (1899-1966) has compelling fiction on windjammers, in his twelve-book "Horatio Hornblower" series. I read one or two of these with profit a couple of decades ago. Forester brings the sea alive in the same magic-of-storytelling way that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle manages to bring the seemingly arid subject of London crime alive.<br><br>I know that you are rather averse to YouTube. It is, however, true that a picture can be worth a thousand words, and in particular that a snip of cinematography can convey the atmosphere of a thing with a startling comprehensiveness. I am finding these days YouTube material on the Royal Navy - perhaps not on your own favoured topic of windjammers, but nevertheless conveying something of the flavour of maritime work to us landlubbers. Some idea of how things get done can, for instance, be gleaned from Episode 1 of the YouTube-uploaded British TV series "Devonport".<br><br>It is perhaps not always sufficiently remarked how strongly a community or nation benefits from an engagement with the sea. The ancient Greeks and the modern British engaged, to their benefit. One might perhaps argue that the ancient Romans were weakened, in a spiritual way, by their not significantly engaging. <br><br>In my own struggles with astronomy and maths, I keep thinking of the sea as emblematic - it is seemingly infinite, and it seemingly transcends human concerns even while facilitating them, in the way maths does. Wordsworth wrote well of mathematical physicist Newton: "Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone". <br><br>(Well, as I remarked on my blog last year, these days those "strange seas" are in fact rather crowded, like the harbour I recall from my 1984-1985 Singapore stay - endless ships all docking and embarking, in other words with endless mathematics lecturers and books all vying for attention. But tidewater remains tidewater.) <br><br><br>Hastily, now having to get back to Istvan Lenart plastic-sphere kit for spherical geometry, <br><br><br>Tom (in Estonian diaspora, approx 20 km north of downtown Toronto)<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c7786658184714683145 title="comment permalink">1/12/17, 10:55 AM</a><br><br>

When people discuss the evolution of consciousness using the incorrect definition of evolution they're actually talking about about Social Darwism, that is a political ideology that specifically promotes superior-inferior relationships in society. They're literally speaking about their own political superiority, and following the logic of “evolution" they are speaking about the inferiority of the “un-evolved” person. Catton pointed out in Overshoot that people use several ways to declare one group or another superfluous during periods of overshoot. So, continuing the long tradition of the contradictory ideologies of progressives, we’re seeing that unfold before our eyes. If one does not have an “evolved” political consciousness then one is superfluous and if one has “evolved” then one is essential. <br><br>Chronocentrism isn’t just a declaration of the superiority of the present condition over the past, it’s also a statement that those individuals who do not wholly embrace the present condition, which is apparently decided by the elite, have no future. <br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c6046530047719264926 title="comment permalink">1/12/17, 2:17 PM</a><br><br>

Not sure why.<br><br>With regards to fish and plants, I do use some heat because my basement suite goes down to the low 60sF overnight, sometimes a bit below. I also use a large piece of felt to wrap the tank in every night. This helps keep the tank from experiencing huge day-night temperature differences and unhealthily low temperatures without need for an overpowered heater. My ember tetras, scarlet baddis, and cryptocorne plants seem pretty happy with this arrangement. The anubias is slowly falling to pieces, but it was doing that when I bought it so I'm not sure it has anything to do with my tank.<br><br>They've recently outlawed white cloud mountain minnows in BC, despite them being unable to survive anywhere in BC outdoors except hot springs. It's a shame for responsible fishkeepers who kept them in unheated tanks. Some irresponsible fool who dumped his fish into the wild, somewhere in the world, wrecked it for everyone else.<br><br>My 2 cents on reduced-impact fishkeeping:<br><br>LED lighting is really low energy use, small tanks use less energy than large ones, subtropical fishes and freshwater shrimp like Neocaridina need little or no extra heat, air-driven sponge filters don't need the sponge replacing very often and the air filters use very little electricity and last for decades, old-fashioned thermometers are WAY better and longer-lasting than liquid crystal stick-on ones.

Do you see the "evolution of consciousness" that's in this week's essay, to mean the same thing as "becoming more ethical" by the people who use the term?<br><br>I have a litle theory about ethics. It isn't entirely absolute, nor is it entirely relative. When we use ethical reasing, ie engage with a moral philosophy, I reckon most of the time it is really an after-the-fact rationalisation for what we feel is the right thing to do. The fact that that feeling isn't rationally based, is why ethical reasoning is difficult and is often inconsistent. So being ethical amounts to doing what you feel is the right thing to do, *after you have considered the interests of all affected*.<br><br>That ethical feeling, in my view, comes partly from biology (we evolved as social creatures) and partly from culture. If you like, a hardware part that comes with being a human and tells us things that are pretty universal like it is wrong to be dishonest, to kill others for fun, etc. And a software part that depends on your cultural programming, including religion or whatever is or isn't part of your politics. (A valid alternative view of course is that the whole thing comes from god).<br><br>I'd be interested to hear what anyone thinks about this.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Graeme<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c5449501808405282452 title="comment permalink">1/12/17, 4:20 PM</a><br><br>

It presupposes that "a particular political, economic, or social system may develop that would constitute the end-point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the final form of human government". The most recent iteration of this concept was by Francis Fukuyama in his book 'The End of History and the Last Man' back in the 90s.<br> I guess the idea is that if you can say that it is the end of history, that there is now real point arguing about changing anymore or trying something different as you have reached your final destination. Game over, man! We all know how well that idea has been working out lately so what, liberal democracy allied with global neo-capitalism was not the end of history after all? In any case it was the economist Hyman Minsky that pointed out that 'stability is destabilising' (http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26680993) which would suggest that an end of history would be by nature brittle. What is certainly true is that the end of the day, the dogs refused to eat the new dog food.<br> I think that the elites are now realizing that it is not, in fact, the end of history and that they are in for a fight now though their ideas will continue to bring them grief. One such idea at the World Economic Forum is at https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/populism-is-poison-plural-cities-are-the-antidote and seems to say that progress is only to be found in cosmopolitan cities. Perhaps this idea was partially inspired by the county election map of the US 2016 elections which showed America to be an ocean of red with only blue islands indicting city population centres to be seen.<br> I think that this idea is starting to get a lot traction lately. Recently, a San Francisco CEO, made a hate filled tweet which illustrates this divide (http://heatst.com/culture-wars/liberal-ceo-slams-middle-america-no-educated-person-wants-to-live-in-a-shthole-with-stupid-people/) so maybe identity politics is not dead yet but has reformulated itself into new guises.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c5610725075163279018 title="comment permalink">1/12/17, 5:04 PM</a><br><br>

Women feared not just the economic costs of drinking but also the violence of drunken husband, which, sort of murder the law failed to shield them from. Although Prohibition was a disaster in terms of law enforcement and the rise of gang violence, statistics collected by the Salvation Army did show a decrease in the social harm of drinking during Prohibition. In England the government controlled alcohol through high taxes on distilled liquor to price it out of the reach of the poor, and restrictive hours for the public houses where the working class did most of their drinking. Such laws were not applied to the private clubs where gentlemen could enjoy themselves without fear. Similarly, the consumption of alcohol was not forbidden by US Prohibition, just its production and sale. Individuals and organizations could continue to enjoy the contents of their cellars.<br><br>Another cause that would appall those who wish to identify with the Progressives is eugenics. A number of progressives, including some feminists, worried that uncontrolled breeding of inferior types was creating a drag on the nation and possibly threatening the survival of the white race. The recent book _White Trash_ expands on this. Laws allowing sterilization of the unfit were passed in many states. I suspect that such concerns might have contributed to the attacks on gay culture as well. If good physical and moral types have a duty to reproduce any lifestyle that leads them away from marriage and family is a threat. <br><br><br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c5009850508407938583 title="comment permalink">1/12/17, 6:10 PM</a><br><br>

You have mentioned before about the broad general tendency toward increasing cephalization over time, especially in the more capstone creatures in our world. I’m sure others who have noticed this take it as a fundamental proof of progress in evolution. Yet it might just be ... adaption to circumstances. Since as it ages the sun is slowly increasing its output, the Earth’s biosphere slowly has more energy available to it. More energy throughput means more possible complexity. Thus the same underlying phenomenon that makes it possible that an ice age doesn’t freeze all water on earth is also making the increasing cephalization possible.<br><br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c175748019543204237 title="comment permalink">1/12/17, 6:10 PM</a><br><br>

Right now is a particularly difficult time to try to predict the near future of American politics because so much depends on what Trump ends up actually doing and how quickly the American empire unravels, but observing the behavior of the left over this election cycle has made me really understand the concerns you've expressed about totalitarianism coming from the "progressive" left in the America of the near future. It could come from left or right, but I see at this particular time in history it being more likely to come from the left because of how central their attachment to the myth of progress is. Plenty on the right believe in some form of the myth of progress as well, but it doesn't tend to be as central to their outlook as it is for the left.<br><br>For a while, I was thinking that the myth of progress was losing adherents quickly, but I hadn't realized a crucial distinction until recently, that the loss of belief that progress is happening in the present is very different from the loss of belief in the myth of progress entirely. Right now, there's a lot of people who fervently believe in the myth of progress as an ideal but don't think progress is happening as it should at the present. I see that as a volatile situation. Believers who think progress is inevitable tend to be more complacent, but the present situation where progress is faltering, it seems ripe for political movements that attempt to force progress down all of our throats. At its worst, it could be Fred Halliot, it could also be a situation more like what Venezuela has gone through, a socialist movement that promises too much at a time when we can't afford it and ends up bankrupting the county. The way that many progressives speak of things like the internet, college, and the more extreme forms of medical intervention under the category of entitlements makes me think a Venezuela-type scenario is very possible here if they get into power in our era of decline. A difference I see with Venezuele is that I'd think the Union would dissolve before things got to the point they are now in Venezuela, whether by civil war or a more peaceful means.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c3321255365723654331 title="comment permalink">1/12/17, 7:04 PM</a><br><br>

But, imagining it as having a destination is madness. Tragic so much consciousness if smothered but such a simple mistake. I think there is even worth while speculation about the history of consciousnesses evolution, and even the prospects of variations taking form in the future.<br><br>So, sad to say that I don't have the nerve to make an annual prediction, I will speculate on deeper future of the evolution of consciousness, protected from falsification by human life expectancy. Since evolution has to do with adaptation to conditions these predictions will be in the forms of conditionals.<br><br>Radio and audio recording will be the most significant technologies from this civilization to affect consciousness if they survive. They change what kinds of experience are available to individuals and groups as much or more than literacy did. <br><br>Some of the wider swings of civilization cycles in our history are side effects of writing. Writing causes larger accumulations of stories and administration that our evolutionary history prepares humans for. Cultural adaptations to the extremes of bureaucrats and priests are ad hoc, and prone to reversals. Cyclic cultural consciousness, like a fir forest burning of every few centuries, and stabilizing climax adaptations are both good contenders for finding niches. Consider the relative cycles of Chinese and Western historic civilizations, which I think suggest that a wide variation of cycle lengths and amplitudes are possible.<br><br>Radio and voice recording changes the distance in space and time that the power of voice reaches. Cultures with radio will have wide geographic distribution, but quite likely have to share that extent with radically different cultures. Imagine pious Orthodox Punks questioning their child about playing with those Amish boys from across the street. I think that the niche of being intentionally separate with in a larged system will widen, having been pioneered by Jews and several other cultures<br><br>Niches for anti-radio, anti-record, and anti-literature societies are likely to be numerous. Even with such technologies covering great distances they need not breed homogeneity. Remember we are experiencing a time of mass consciousness extinction, consider the vast reduction in language diversity recently. There is usually a much larger diversity of cultural forms and therefore variety of consciousness. I expect a return to the mean, the reach of radio will be overcome by the genius of the human soul to form tight nit and mentally distinct cultures despite the radio.<br><br>There are so many different ways that these technologies can change culture and consciousness that many paths will be tried, and it is unlikely for a steady of universal pattern to emerge for a long time, even if other conscious pressuring technologies don't emerge.<br><br>Just guesses, and deviant trends can insert, but I think it is a good exercise to try thinking of consciousness evolutionally. I start with technology modification. Also consciousness might evolve toward colony species intelligence as egregores continue to adapt to evolutionarilly recent changes in the noosphere. Might climate effect consciousness if globally altered? Could non linguistic hominids make a comeback? Might other species move in on the niche currently filled by human librarians?<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c6257863169300166954 title="comment permalink">1/12/17, 7:28 PM</a><br><br>

I think that on any large scale it evolves at a slow rate, consider the life span of a civilization, and how long it takes to accumulate an appreciable number of generations to happen. Also, it seems that there are mutual approaches to ethics that are viable enough to stay in the game and mutually incompatible in a particular instant. The Earth and the Future are big place both, and Evolution does seem to like diversity, so I would guess that many languages of good an evil will continue to thrive, and fight, and even depend on each other. Consider that the individual can at times be selected for selfishness, and at times for maintaining distance, and also for cooperation, depending. In game theory there are many viable tactics, and for any given 'game' what the ideal tactic is cannot be foreseen. <br><br>Perhaps this is true of ethical systems too. I mean, some ethical systems might find success by opposing and warring with all other systems they encounter. Some ethical systems might benefit from paraciting other ethical systems. Some by symbiosis. And so on in this fashion.<br><br>Do we not already see this in the world?<br><br>Each people speaks its own tongue of good and evil, and knows not the tongue of it's neighbor...

My interest is in how mores are tied into energy supplies. I don't see that it was some mysterious workings within consciousness that ushered in the modern era; I believe technology and a certain fuel source brought it on, and with the fuel/ tech came wealth and abundance for a significant portion of an exploding population. This wealth and abundance created the conditions whereby many more people were able to garner privileges which were only available to the aristocratic classes--these privileges included but were not limited to gender and sexual freedom ( issues which were already normalized in ruling classes, at least to a certain degree).. For some time i've held a negative view on this issue in that I speculate the diminishing of these privileges as and if we traverse back into various types of neo-feudalism. I suspect, though, that you've theorized scenerios where these occurrence's are not inevitable, and we can hope for that; but I see, and sadly so; the former being more likely.

That's one of the reasons we can count on getting a future that isn't like the one we imagine!<br><br>Bill, I'm delighted to hear that. However, I've heard -- and if you'll glance through the comments, you'll find that many of my readers have also heard -- a vast number of "progressives" (that word "progress" again!) who do in fact speak and act as though they believe devoutly that history is on their side. If you can convince more people on your end of the political spectrum to ditch the sense of historical entitlement and embrace your far more sensible viewpoint, that would strike me as a very good thing. <br><br>As for the Clinton mourners, I figure that it's precisely the fact that so many of them assumed her election was inevitable that's caused the spectacular collective nervous breakdown among them. Cognitive dissonance is a very challenging thing! <br><br>Greg, by all means start taxing them with their chronocentrism! You'll want to have a handkerchief nearby to wipe off the spittle, though, because my guess is that you'll get a Donald Duck frenzy of no small scale. <br><br>Bill, a very edgy metaphor! Thank you. <br><br>Pinku-Sensei, nope, just noting that Dean has been turned posthumously into a focus for passions far more widespread than he aroused in his life...<br><br>Fudoshin, good. My guess, though, is that most intelligent species have exactly the same problem.

It takes a huge amount of old-fashioned grassroots organizing to actually build a movement that can accomplish anything, and doing that with any degree of effectiveness requires letting the membership decide exactly what causes they want to push forward. The top-down model that's been fashionable for the last thirty-plus years, in which an inner circle of professional activists tell everyone else what they will be upset about, doesn't work -- that's a core reason why activism has become so toothless during that period -- but I have yet to see that fact have any impact on the leftward end of the activist scene. <br><br>Unless that changes, the Million Woman March will accomplish zilch, zero, nada.

Unfortunately except in a direct or semi-direct democracy there’s no chance to vote on an issue by issue basis—there’s activism of course. <br><br>I think that the overall “good” that is targeted by politicians worldwide today is summarized by the notion of economic growth, and everything that’s good for economic growth is good full stop. <br><br>Issue/political tendency variable (JMG quote): “how many people remember, for example, that environmental protection was a cause of the far right until the 1960s?”<br><br>I wonder where along the political spectrum this issue stands today. Rich people invest their money and work in corporations that don’t have any consideration for the environment or nature, so would be anti-nature even though they’d enjoy a safari in Africa to relax from the stresses of their corporate or otherwise high-income jobs. <br><br>Poor people (with the exception of indigenous people) give priority to getting jobs, keeping prices low which economic growth promises to provide, so have little time for environmental concerns. I do remember though a lady from Latvia who was complaining that the forests in her country were being cut down and exported to Scandinavia for production of furniture (Ikea?) and therefore losing the cost-free pleasure of a walk in the woods.<br><br>JMG quote: “When people throw around the phrases “more evolved” and “less evolved,” they’re talking nonsense, or at best engaging in a pseudoscientific way of saying “I like this” and “I don’t like that.” Exactly. It all depends on the criteria used to decide what’s better and what’s worse. Many things are good from one point of view and bad from another. Darwin proposed that evolution was comparable to the growth of a coral or a bush: it grew simultaneously in many directions. <br><br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c7074984331621401140 title="comment permalink">1/12/17, 11:19 PM</a><br><br>

Small, local, organic livestock operations are actually quite common already; a good many people I know get half a pig or a quarter cow once a year; and as the commercial food supply becomes too expensive and too unsafe -- the rate of bacterial contamination is already ghastly, and rising -- there are plenty of other options waiting to step in. <br><br>That said, granted the possibility of your hypothesis, the rest does follow, yes. <br><br>Varun, good! Yes, that does follow -- and we'll be talking about it next week. <br><br>Sylvia, I've had conversations like that as well.

Let's see -- no doubt Putin would make Trump stop sending American servicepeople off to the Middle East to get killed in endless, pointless wars; he would make Trump stop bankrupting the US in order to cover the costs of defending European nations that won't pay for their own defense; he might even get Trump to ditch the endless series of drone strikes, regime-change operations, and so on that Obama's spent eight years pursuing with unquestioning enthusiasm, and which have plunged whole regions into chaos and misery.

One of your best! I was aware of most of the issues you mentioned (they used to confuse me when I was more dogmatic), except the gay thing. However, the gay stuff you mentioned do explain some curious “anomalies” I noticed when reading about the early 1900´s. Such as: where did all the emancipated gays come from? Or: why were pro-gay leftists considered strange? <br><br>Here in Sweden, prohibition was a huge issue about a century ago. In 1922, Sweden even organized a referendum on prohibition. 50.8% voted “no”, but 48.8% actually voted “yes”. While the referendum was non-partisan, it was a public secret that many Social Democrats and Communists supported prohibition. The Social Democrats even had their own temperance organization, the National Order of Verdandi (it still exists). While Sweden never got prohibition, Swedish alcohol and drug policy has always been very restrictive. I used to hang out in Swedish leftist circles about 30 years ago, and what I noticed was that pro-drug positions were considered controversial. Many leftists supported anti-drug organizations, including groups so restrictive that they would probably be considered “conservative” or even slightly fascistic had they existed in, say, California. One of the most restrictive anti-drug groups, the RNS, was actually formed by leftists, something probably unknown to its present members! The same with Hassela-Solidaritet, another restrictive group. Interestingly, Denmark – a neighboring nation to Sweden – has exactly the opposite attitude to drugs and booze, so there the leftists are probably closer to the Left Coast variety. This can lead to interesting cultural clashes (I´m almost tempted to call it ethno-centrism) between left-wing radicals from different nations… <br><br>Prohibition was an issue in many other nations, too. In Russia, the Bolsheviks kept the prohibition of vodka originally imposed by the Czar during World War I! In Germany and (I think) Austria, the Social Democrats had their own temperance lodges, like in Sweden. However, the German Social Democrats and Communists were also pro-gay and “pro-sex”, something highly unusual at the time. Lenin criticized the sexually liberal attitudes of the German Communists in a famous conversation with Clara Zetkin. <br><br>(To be continued) <br><br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c4083712151291059395 title="comment permalink">1/13/17, 5:08 AM</a><br><br>

The liberals have found an intriguing substitute in Alexander Hamilton. Since Hamilton and the Federalists represented the “moderate”, “conservative” or “right wing” faction of the American Revolution, this is richly ironic. But then, I suppose the elitist banker connections and filibustering interventionism of Hamilton may subconsciously appeal to liberals, I mean, think Hillary Clinton, LOL. Interestingly, I wondered about 20 years ago why no leftist or liberal supported Hamilton, since he was against slavery, supported industrialization and wanted a “dirigiste” economy, in contrast to Jefferson who was a slave-owner, agrarian romantic and called for a free market. At the time, I suppose most leftists and left-liberals were still too much into Thomas Paine to bother about the Founding Fathers, but it seems I almost called it! <br><br>Incidentally, the right-wingers have their own version of Whig history and strange anachronisms. World history has inexorably moved forward until its zenith in the Eisenhower presidency, but it´s been pretty much downhill from there (with Reagan as a temporary stop gap). Also, right-wingers have a tendency to think that everything looked like during the 1950´s throughout most of history (or at least American history). They seem to have apotheosized a very small segment of history, about a decade or so of specifically US history. <br><br>Note also the following weirdness: conservatives love Teddy Roosevelt (whose political program sounded like FDR´s!), libertarians like Andrew Jackson (an authoritarian machine politician who trampled the constitution underfoot), and militia groups adulate George Washington (who would have suppressed them á la Janet Reno if given have the chance). Since I´m an equal opportunity offender, I also wonder why so many leftists seem to hate the Roosevelts, both of them?<br><br>OK, enough irreverence for today… ;-) <br><br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c6683174276007849421 title="comment permalink">1/13/17, 5:09 AM</a><br><br>

However, I suppose part of the solution is what you said in a previous response to another poster: yes, people become tolerant when society is more stable, secure and affluent *but the definition of stability, security and affluence is in itself culturally constructed*. <br><br>This explains why the Lakeland Republic is so tolerant, despite having gone through a civil war, a refugee crisis and some kind of brutal revolution… Unrealistic, perhaps, but not entirely impossible! <br><br>The opposite is also true: insecurity, instability and want are – above a certain limit – also subjective questions.

From Wikipedia (sorry for quoting them): <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;On December 10, 1869, territorial Governor John Allen Campbell extended the right to vote to women, making Wyoming the first territory and then United States state to grant suffrage to women. In addition, Wyoming was also a pioneer in welcoming women into politics. Women first served on juries in Wyoming (Laramie in 1870); Wyoming had the first female court bailiff (Mary Atkinson, Laramie, in 1870); and the first female justice of the peace in the country (Esther Hobart Morris, South Pass City, in 1870). Also, in 1924, Wyoming became the first state to elect a female governor, Nellie Tayloe Ross, who took office in January 1925.Due to its civil-rights history, one of Wyoming's state nicknames is "The Equality State", and the official state motto is "Equal Rights".<br><br>The second territory to give women the right to vote was Utah in 1870, but in that case, foul play was involved, since the Mormon "People´s Party" simply wanted to extend the conservative Mormon block vote. Wyoming´s decision seems to have been genuinely "feminist", though.<br><br>Note that Wyoming is in, ahem, fly over country...<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c1461448888026951788 title="comment permalink">1/13/17, 5:28 AM</a><br><br>

He is a subtle thinker who has devoted 40 years to studying the problem of evil and how to arrange society in such a way as to avoid it. His thoughts on this are as broad as they are long (many of them gained by wandering through territory familiar to yourself - ie myth and fairy tale, and Jungian archetypes)... <br><br>I am not yet certain how much of his thought I agree or disagree with, but I find his thought extremely interesting to grapple with, and would like to give it a fair accounting. <br><br>What I do understand him to say is that "male dominance hierarchy" is a social game of extreme antiquity (300 million years at least), well understood throughout the animal kingdom, and that male animal bodies walking around today carry the "equipment" (brain chemicals, etc) required, both to be good at playing it, and to find it endlessly satisfying and engaging to play. He believes that there is a satisfying and enriching way to play it, and that preventing boys and men from playing it in that way can lead to *worse* consequences - ie warband formation, violence, nihilism, cruelty, and all the truly destructive orgies of mass violence unleashed in the 20th century.<br><br>I sense he is (slightly) less interested/invested in the kinds of games women and girls play, mainly because his primary project is rescuing the male psyche from its entrapment in postmodernist culture. However, when he does comment it is to acknowledge that girls and women are:<br>1) obviously engaged in their own dominance hierarchy game, though it has different stakes and different rules of engagement from that played by men (this part of his thought remains too thinly addressed, though), and<br>2) women remain outside of, and are a perennial challenge to, the game of "male dominance hierarchy" - especially since the real stakes in *that* game (as he sees it) is the attention of women. (this part of his thought is more developed).<br><br>I hope not to have done him an injustice in the above brief sketch of his thinking.<br><br>As I said, I am interested, but not yet wholly on board with it.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c6188436768056610709 title="comment permalink">1/13/17, 5:38 AM</a><br><br>

The trend has certainly not been monotonic, but is has been pretty strong overall in the long term. And it is easy to see how many people would mistake this for an inevitability and a sign that we are becoming our higher selves, more advanced and purer than our predecessors. Especially since most people consider a hundred years a long time, and 300 years like almost the entire span of human history. <br><br>Of course what (to my mind) has really been happening in this time is technological innovation and the rise of the energy slave. It is far easier to free your slaves and stop forcing women to devote their entire lives to child rearing and household work when you have energy slaves to do this work for you. There's no need to work your workers to death when you have machines that were never alive doing the jobs instead. But we like to think we are more than just a bunch of economic expediencies, so we embrace grander visions of our higher selves evolving towards a state of perfected grace.<br><br>Longer term history has shown of course that these trends are not in any way irreversible. Those genies can be put back in their bottles pretty fast when times get hard. <br><br>I have never quite understood where the oppression of homosexuality fits in to this, and why it seems to focus especially strongly on the male-male version. I don't actually see how having a percentage of unmarried childless adults in society is harmful; indeed it has proven to be quite useful, providing a population to be caretakers, clergy, educators, artists, scholars, explorers (ever notice how the 19th Century "Mountain Men" in the American West often traveled in twos?) and the like. Other than strange and arbitrary Abhrahamic taboos against it, what is the harm? We throw aside all the other Abrahamic tabboos willy-nilly when they are inconvenient, why is this one such a big deal?<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c8689413883275508760 title="comment permalink">1/13/17, 5:54 AM</a><br><br>

It seems to me that you are confusing the "evolution" mechanism (randomness in change and selection) with the "evolution" interpretation. <br><br>Starting from bare molten rocks some 4 billions year ago, I assume that something on Earth has "evolved" a bit with time. <br><br>Yes, there was back and foths, inversions and reprisals, no linearity at all. But there is undeniably something in the "universal laws" that pushes towards complexification.<br><br>On the issue of Consiousness, and What it is, I suppose that we cannot infer it from phisics, neither evoke it from "complexification" (because "complexity" in itself does not support the origin of consiousness in any way).<br><br>Consoiusness consstitues an "hard problem" as you probabily know. DOes it evolve? WHat it means "evolve"? That it changes? Yes it changes, indivisually and collectively,for sure, but there should exist a general direction to embrace the idea of evolution, or we are simply talking of randomness. <br><br>We have to study history to answer, but limiting the study to a few hundred years is doing a poor job. <br><br>At least, we should embrace 50.000 years of human history to define a trajectory, if one exists, to our collective consciousness. <br><br>From my point of view, a direction exists. We indeed learned from past history.

A prevailing belief there is that the Democratic Party has betrayed its core principles, that it used to be much more left: an antiwar party with firmly "progressive" (another word with multiple meanings) values that once put the interests of "the people" first. The posters in that political forum tend to believe that if the Democratic Party would only "return to its roots," then it would attract back people like them, people who were once evidently enthusiastic about the party, and the party would become once again the vigorous defender of policies that are antiwar, pro-worker, pro-equality, and anti-corporate excess.<br><br>When I point out that it was Democrat Lyndon Johnson who drastically escalated the Vietnam War, let alone that the segregationist South was within some of the posters' lifetimes a one-party state run by Democrats, I get met with silence. (I don't go back any further than that, as it would be too easy to do so.) When I point out the Democratic Party has <i>always</i> been, by necessity in a center-right country, a catch-all grab bag of politicians with a gamut of belief systems, I'm usually ignored.<br><br>These posters are remembering, of course, a specific set of circumstances that existed in the 1970s and 1980s, in an interim without a viable, nationally competing third party, during which some national Democratic figures (Jesse Jackson, for example) advocated for what today we'd call "progressive" causes, and even a presidential candidate (Mondale) stated outright that taxes would need to be raised. At a state and local level, the Democrats, particularly in cities with high percentages of well-educated people, ran candidates with very liberal (to use the word in vogue then) platforms. Tom Hayden was a Democrat. What else would or could he be? <br><br>Many of the posters in this online forum were in their twenties and thirties during the 1970s and 1980s, and thus have that period fixed in their minds as "how it always used to be." (The fact during that period, the catch-all Democratic party had establishment figures like Robert Byrd and Sam Nunn representing them in Congress, and that the only Democratic president elected during those two decades was a centrist, doesn't get a mention.) Instead of acknowledging or recognizing that the period they remember so fondly was just twist in the never-ending historical sweep of political realignment, they remember it (selectively) or cling to it as "what always was and should be again." Unfortunately, as you describe more fully in your post, this rigid thinking appears to be the norm in human behavior.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c6319235017180513348 title="comment permalink">1/13/17, 7:50 AM</a><br><br>

Great question! At a fundamental level, I think the answer is, "It can, but it doesn't have to." This is true in both a personal and cultural sense.<br><br>A person's consciousness can evolve, and indeed most people's does, as we move through Piaget's Sensorimotor, Preoperational, etc. stages. But it doesn't have to. Intellectual evolution can stop, as in "special needs" children. Other aspects of consciousness can also stop evolving in otherwise "normal" adults who just can't seem to reach the advanced stages of moral development (Social Contract, Ethical Principles) that Kohlberg identified. <br><br>The same is true for cultural consciousness. It can evolve, but often doesn't. <br><br>In his book Spiral Dynamics, Don Beck described several stages of cultural evolution: Tribal, Warrior, Traditional, Modern, Postmodern, Integral. Cultures (and one's cultural awareness) can progress from one to the next. Progressing from one stage to the next, however, isn't easy. New stages of culture arise not to satisfy one's wish to see the world as benignly "going forward," but to solve intolerable, previously intractable problems presented by the previous stage. <br><br>For example, living by The Book, whether it be the Bible or the Koran, is a big improvement upon living by the whim of some exploitative emperor. Living in a society where Science has replaced The Book as the final authority on things has advantages, too, as many people who didn't get polio and who did get life-saving antibiotics would observe. <br><br>But progress, as Mr. Greer notes, doesn't always qualify as evolution. The thing about evolution is, it builds upon what came before, and this is just as true for consciousness and culture as it is for biology. If you don't include what came before, you can't really transcend it, and you have to go back until you do. <br><br>That's where our culture is now. The United States has progressed to a cultural center of gravity in Beck's Modern stage, but it hasn't incorporated the positive aspects of the stages that came before. Tribal societies may inhibit individual initiative, but they're also remarkably cohesive and in tune with their environment. Traditional societies can become hidebound, but they also inculcate the positive values of duty and honor. <br><br>In laying waste to Tribal life on this continent (something that continues today, as US corporations work to shove an oil pipeline through Lakota territory), our culture lost something vital to a healthy society: earth-consciousness. In discounting the Traditional worldview as obsolete, our culture came to lack the sensibilities that come with it, such as order, restraint, and fairness.<br><br>In order to truly evolve, to take power and deserve it, political liberals must get right with that guy who has the God &amp; Country bumper sticker on his pickup. And in order to evolve as a nation and a society, we must incorporate the positive aspects of the societies that came before us in history--ALL of history. Until we do, we'll just keep bonking our heads against the barrier presented by the evolutionary principle of Include and Transcend, repeating our mistakes until we finally learn from them.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c5353765673986118135 title="comment permalink">1/13/17, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

However, we may be crossing wires with terminology a bit; I am talking about voters, and I believe you are talking about politicians. <br>To keep it short, ALL politicians do in practice "coddle" the wealthy. The difference is that the left politician states they want to have regulations (ie put government in charge) whereas the right says that they want to get rid of regulations (ie let big business be in charge). I think that is a fairly accurate portrayal of what most of our major party politicians state as their goals. <br><br>Examples:<br>environmental issues-left wants more regulations to protect the environment<br>-right wants the free market to be allowed to self correct<br>employment-left wants safety and higher wages<br>-right wants to create jobs and corporate profits/higher stock prices<br>health care-left universal access, more restrictions on profits for insurance and drug companies<br>-right wants to let business decide who and what they will insure<br>Possible counter-example:<br>abortion and recreational drug issues-right tends to wants government controls<br>left tends to be more hands off. Since this is mostly handled by the judicial branch, I don't give these much thought as neither party makes much progress either way.<br>foreign trade &amp; immigration-neither party seems to be wholly on one side or another<br><br>In practice, their policies may very well likely have similar outcomes of hurting and impairing individuals while supporting big businesses, but their stated intention is what most voters have to go by. Deciding what policies will actually do requires access to current and historical information, an deep understanding of law &amp; economics, statistical analysis, foreign affairs etc. Due to a lack of access, ability, or education, for most voters, this is either impossible or at least very difficult. Therefore we vote based on the stated motivations of our representatives and hope they are competent. <br><br>To be fair, the right would say I am framing this incorrectly. Instead of choosing between government and big business, they would say it's government vs the individual. I would reject this notion however as most of the business regulations primarily affect businesses.<br><br>Also, I would reiterate that I believe this comes down to what the voter fear the MOST. This does not mean that the typical left voter loves all government and thinks it can do no wrong or that the right thinks their employer has the right to do whatever they want as long as the paycheck is in the mail. I'm sure there are people that are like that, but most people I know are usually complain about who's controlling their lives about 60/40 or even 55/45 one way or another. <br>I would also say this is more fluid than say one of your barometers of religion. Changing religious views drastically is usually only happens once or twice in a lifetime. Changing employment happens all the time. Say you're a waiter and you lose your job because the health inspector closed down the restaurant you work at? Grr... stupid government should get their noses out of our business. Say you ate at that restaurant and got food poisoning causing you ruin your day (job interview/date/concert/whatever). Grr... stupid business, someone ought to keep them in line. These could all be the same person within a month or two, much more likely to change than say, "a fetus is a person" to "women have a right to control their own body" and back again.<br><br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c2399612247734079330 title="comment permalink">1/13/17, 9:26 AM</a><br><br>

Even that sentence would have looked odd to most of them in 1928; it would be a bit like saying, "Jews are woven deeply into the fabric of the USA in 2016," a statement so self-evident and obvious as to be potentially offensive (so, not only because it's a strained metaphor!).<br> <br>Since we have seen -- within the lifetimes of some people whose hearts are still beating -- what a society can do to a scapegoated part of its population: going from treating them as fully equal under the law to considering them "subhuman" in a short period of time, I don't understand why anyone would continue to believe in straight-line "progress" towards some nirvana-like future. I use the Nazi example because it is likely the one most known to your readers, but it is actually far from being the only possible such example.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c7480260031389670261 title="comment permalink">1/13/17, 12:31 PM</a><br><br>

There were reversals in German gay men's struggle for freedom both in the 19th Century before just German unification because of a disgusting sex murder in a well-trafficked park which to me was an unacknowledged homophobic hate crime followed by a similar attack on a child who survived, and again in the Great Depression when the German Reichstag could no longer deal with social issues because of the economic situation and because of political fighting both in the parliament and outside in the streets.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c6430716918956815674 title="comment permalink">1/13/17, 2:34 PM</a><br><br>

That is, right up until people forget that it is a symbolic narrative and is one way (of many) to make sense of the world. Once we cast that narrative as a fact, as in the "myth of progress", it begins its transformation into a thought-stopper.<br><br>MLK's speech about the arc of history was intended as politics, and it <i>was</i> brilliant and inspiring politics, even if it falls apart in the long view of human history and deep time.<br><br>On a side note, much has been made of the rise of the alt-right communities in the MSM (even leaking into the commentary here a bit), but little has been said about the emergence of the "dirtbag left".<br><br>The campaign of Bernie Sanders and the failure of Clinton have really opened opportunities for left-leaning folks to re-evaluate their politics and ideologies. It is one of the silver linings I'm seeing in Trump's victory. If Hillary had won, the "progressive liberals" would have marched on and the outsider voices from the left would be stuck in the wilderness again.<br><br>The so-called "dirtbag left" is one of those voices that has gained a bit of traction and recent coverage in news outlets. The most visible voice in the dirtbag left is the Chapo Trap House podcast which savaged the neo-liberal politics of the Democrats and Clinton throughout the campaign. Rather than linking to a glowing review...here are two hit-pieces about Chapo (and the dirtbag left). One from the right and another from the "progressive liberal" crowd. <br><br>http://www.nationalreview.com/article/443804/new-left-dirtbag-left-chapo-trap-house-jacobin-magazine-liberals-democratic-party<br><br>http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/11/blaming-clintons-base-for-her-loss-is-the-ultimate-insult.html<br><br>Second side note.

And the gap we’re seeing, as I mentioned, between wages of those with a college education and high school or less have just continued to increase. I mean you can look at some measures that suggest that real wages of high school educated workers have essentially been stagnant for several decades and there’s some recent research that shows that a far smaller share of young people – if you think about the American Dream, that people expect their children to do better than they did, for generations to progress – a far smaller share of young people today are doing as well or better than their parents than was true for most of the post war period.”<br><br>Yellen looked particularly troubled when she cited the following research study, stating:<br><br>“Labor participation rates for prime age men have continued to move south, which is a disturbing trend. A very shocking finding, this was a finding of the individuals Angus Deaton and Anne Case – Angus Deaton won the Nobel Prize last year [he actually won the award in 2015] is that the mortality rates of high school educated whites in the 45 to 54 year age bracket are actually rising, which is an extraordinary difference from what we’ve seen in other countries and in the post war period and it seems to be related to suicide and health issues that maybe relate to substance abuse. The hypothesis is that this is a consequence in reflection of greater economic insecurity. So, obviously, those are very disturbing trends.”<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c3001775090735513928 title="comment permalink">1/13/17, 5:34 PM</a><br><br>

I was born in 1948 and spent many hours with my grandmother, who was old enough to recall WWI. She regarded the Democrats as the party who kept getting us into wars. Wilson, Democrat, WWI; Roosevelt, Democrat, WWII; Truman, Democrat, Korean Conflict; Kennedy and LBJ, Democrats, Vietnam. The ultimate unpopularity of Vietnam converted the Democratic Party to a less warlike stance, and the Republicans became the warmongers under Reagan, and the two Bushes. Weirdly, this seems reflected in the reversal of color identification. Red is usually seen as a warlike color. The Communists were the evil 'reds' and loyal conservatives were blue, like the Tories in England. Now Red is conservative Republican and supposedly liberal Democrats are blue. Very odd.<br><br>On Progressives vs. gays, I have another connection. During the time in question the acts labeled as homosexual were illegal (for both sexes BTW, m/f couples have been prosecuted under statues against 'sodomy', or in that wonderfully comprehensive language of the law, 'the detestable and abominable crime against nature'). Therefore any business that openly catered to those labeled as sexual deviants would have had to bribe police and other public officials to stay in business. The Progressive drive to clean up public corruption would have had the side effect of driving businesses that relied on that corruption underground or out of business. Later, after Prohibition strengthened organized crime many gay bars were run by or paid protection to the Mafia. <br><br>I notice that those who believe in the evolution of consciousness tend to take it for granted that theirs is evolved. <br><br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c5507586220111930816 title="comment permalink">1/13/17, 6:42 PM</a><br><br>

The reality is that interwar Berlin was host to a lot of things which, unlike open homosexuality, are pretty objectionable. One consequence of the economic depression was a lot of prostitution, including child prostitution - which included homosexual child prostitution. Given that we know that sexual traumas can cause big psychological problems later in life, it would not shock me in the least to learn that some Nazis were victims of this sort of thing, or had siblings who were.<br><br>Scotlyn, I'm the one who's shilling for Jordan Peterson. Jordan Peterson thinks that Nazism and Hitler was all about ORDER AND PURITY. Go watch some footage of the Nuremberg rally - Nazi Woodstock. It's electrifying. (This is Jordan Peterson's explanation): The searchlights forming a cathedral of light, the organized marching, etc, were all powerful expressions of ORDER AND PURITY in a chaotic, disgusting era. People loved it, just as the odds are (in my case I know it's a certainty) which you would have.<br><br>So, JMG, I will offer an explanation for the question you asked Dammerung (why do people with so little concern for human rights care about animal rights)? It's because animals are without sin. To circle back to the bicameral consciousness hypothesis, and the idea about the story of Genesis possibly being about the transition from bicameralism to modern consciousness (Peterson, again, offers an alternative explanation which explains why Genesis is about the origins of consciousness), eating the fruit of knowledge and gaining the knowledge of good and evil is something that only humans got up to. So, animals, which of course any good Nazi would have said are better or worse dependent on their genes, are presumably always perfectly moral expressions of their genotype in the circumstances they exist in. But of course, one has control over animals. If you subscribe to racist theories about race and behavior, humans of other races become especially dangerous animals who can be exterminated in the same manner as rats or insects who spread disease. The Nazi idea of Jews, for instance, is of a people who are racially predisposed to commit evil, whereas members of the Aryan race are people who are racially predisposed to do good things. This isn't a uniquely Nazi philosophy, if you read the Old Testament critically, there's no shortage of hypocritical tribal conflict and genocide there.

Huxley demonstrates very vividly how much morals and ethics are the product of a time period. One example that stands out is that readers in the 1930s struggled to wrap their minds around the fact that in the future promiscuity could be considered to be morally superior to monogamy. Reading about characters condemning their peers for not having enough partners seems absurd to us, but Huxley is thinking outside the limitations of chronocentrism and realizing that the people of the future will *inevitably* condemn us as ignorant, we just don't know the specifics. We assume that we can use the mindset of progress to end up on the so-called "right side of history," but too often the right side of history is simply the mightiest side of history. It is hard to say how future generations will view things like the current progressive mindset, especially in light of resource depletion.<br><br>One trend that I find upsetting is the idea that all buildings named after people who were not morally perfect (according to current standards) in the past should have their names changed to honor more contemporary moral people. This contributes to an even more limited chronocentric mindset and discourages us from learning anything about the history of thought and ethics. It tells the public that the only ideas that matter are the ideas of NOW -- a frightening embrace of ignorance and thought orthodoxy, in my opinion. If we have no room for flawed humans in our history, we will not have a history.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c4673412578699947836 title="comment permalink">1/14/17, 7:14 AM</a><br><br>

His hypothesis, which he calls Flatland, states in a nutshell that there is a fundamental integration problem with consciousness and the unconscious mind, that humans in general have no idea what they are doing or why they do it (what he calls whistling in the dark), and they are primarily ruled by unconscious drives. Humans supposedly filter reality, all the time, for to sole purpose of protecting their conception of themselves, their group, or their standing within the group, and that confirmation bias is a feature, not a bug. Humans are completely unaware that they do this. They also have the inability to grasp long term existential threats, and thus are incapable of changing their behavior in any meaningful way to mitigate these threats (such as climate change, etc.) He is also not a fan of the term cognitive dissonance, as this does not properly describe adequately the fundamental disconnect between consciousness and the subconscious, which is absolute.<br><br>He also postulates that humanity's sole relationship with nature is in terms of how it relates to human's and to economic advantage, that we are incapable in the general sense of seeing any intrinsic value in the natural world, but are only capable of exploiting it, even if that exploitation is focused on creating such things as natural spaces, which still ends up serving the purposes of humanity.<br><br>This is an extremely simplified explanation, his three Flatland essays and his regular blog postings are essential if you want to get an idea of his thinking. As I said, I find his ideas unconvincing, though I think his writing on group dynamics and information filtering is interesting. I get the sense that most of his thinking is influenced by his extreme misanthropy. He is completely disgusted with humanity. I think he likens himself to Arthur Schopenhauer. I say that because he wrote an essay comparing himself to him. He also ridicules doomers, though much of his writing reflects the same doomerish thinking that he criticizes (he is convinced that humanity will be extinct is the next 200 years or so.) He definitely does not think highly of most other people writing on the blogosphere, and has openly criticized you, Gail Tverberg, James Howard Kunstler, and Dmitri Orlov (who he despises) as not knowing what you are talking about. Not too long ago he criticized your book Dark Ages America as yet another ploy to make money off of book sales. I don't think he read it. He also complains constantly about people not commenting on his blog. When people do comment, he generally ridicules them. Gee, I wonder why no one comments.<br><br>Sorry if this went off topic but I saw that some people were commenting about consciousness and wanted to bring this to your attention and the attention of your readers, if they are at all interested in visiting his website that is. I still find your blog, besides the excellent essays, the only blog that has a comments section that actually has intelligent discussion and thoughtful responses from both you and the readers.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c870839036957660753 title="comment permalink">1/14/17, 7:39 AM</a><br><br>

To suggest that it is based on utopian thinking misses the point, as it has always been about avoiding the utopian thinking pervasive in the Yankee norm. Sigh, talking past each other again, Bill. Oh well, don't need a weatherman to see which way the wind is blowing. Faith in the US is at all time lows amongst the younger generations. Generational replacement should be enough to do the trick. It's all over but the shouting. It's very odd that Trump of all people is set to follow in the footsteps of Lincoln and FDR and be a crisis president that holds the Union together by any means necessary. Of course, if he fails in that endeavor, I'd be just as satisfied w/dissolution so long as it was peaceful. What is so strange to me is to see so many people on the left draping themselves in the flag and embracing a dying Americanism with so much fervor when it wasn't too long ago that they were so fervently anti-US, like during the late 60s-early 70s. Of course, there are leftist secessionistas working on campaigns as well. Interesting times.<br>One of our local gay bars is a relic of that time period, and has been queer space for as long as anyone remembers. Rumor has it that it was a gay speakeasy in the 20s. The only thing that has changed since I was sneaking in there underage over 20 years ago is that the ashtrays are gone. Everything else is exactly the same.<br>Mid-20th century opposition to homosexuality was very modern, progressive, and scientific, based on Freudian psychoanalytic theories widely accepted that pathologized homosexuality. Then came the 1973 declassification of homosexuality as disease by the APA, and the old norm began its descent to where it is today as a fringe, discredited theory embraced by an ever shrinking evangelical base (even evangelical fundamentalists are abandoning antigay attitudes) Still, NARTH (antigay psychology group) still exists, much like the WCTU (Womens Christian Temperance Union), and I'm sure that there are members of this readership that still subscribe to the notion that homosexuality is pathological and that the 1973 decision by the APA was wrong and politically motivated.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c1601462936086511658 title="comment permalink">1/14/17, 8:04 AM</a><br><br>

I've watched a section of a Noam Chomsky interview <a href=http://vebup.com/requiem-american-dream rel=nofollow>Requiem for the American Dream</a> (which as Ekkar smartly suggested, can just be listened to) and he points out wording in the Constitution and among the framers' other writings that show how it was intended to benefit privileges of property owners and further concentrate wealth and power... and that leads me to the heretical thought that perhaps the Constitution isn't the holy writ Americans claim it to be especially due to the trajectory of its adherents to NOT systemically remediate inequality (viz. interests rather than values).

Not that he'd put the latter in such hifalutin' terms. <br><br>Also, for panic about the transgendered, "If you can't tell the boys from the girls, how do you know how to treat them?" With a heaping side dish of "They deceived me! I do not like to be deceived!" <br><br>And the uncanny valley for the effeminate male, with another huge side dish of "Oops! Urk!

We live in the present, and what we remember is filtered by what helped us survive until today. We hopefully learn from history, either personal or societal, to preclude cutting our time here short. Knowing the sexual proclivities of ancient Greeks may be titillating, but hardly germane to surviving in the gender fluid urban jungle<br><br>Taking this a bit further, I would propose that our personal recollection of history is based on an exponential moving average. That is, we remember most what just happened, and on an exponential decaying line, events in the recent and no so recent past. <br><br>We commonly talk about what happened yesterday, or even last month. Get beyond a year or so, and significant editing takes place. Frankly, I don’t really care what I had for dinner in January of last year, so it’s long forgotten. It doesn’t relate to surviving today. However, if it gave me food poisoning, I probably remember exactly what I had, and endeavor to avoid a repeat occurrence. So as the years accumulate, we remember the big events (kids birth, kids leaving the house, kids coming back...) and things that affect our ability to survive and thrive, and let the rest fade away. We also remember the theme song to Gilligan’s Island, but that’s a whole different discussion.<br><br>It works the same way at a societal level. We lump history into weeks, then months, then years, then decades, then centuries. On the TV home shows, it’s common for people to say, rather despairingly, that something is “so 90s.” The whole decade gets lumped into a single decor style. Get gets even worse as you go back. The whole notion of ‘antebellum” can mean a style that was around 30-40 years before the civil war. The “dark ages” lumps together anywhere from 200 to 800 years of history. <br><br>As you point out, modern day liberal thought leaves out many tidbits from the past. This selective view of history is reflective of what is necessary for the liberal left’s group to survive. If the liberal left admitted that the problems facing the gay community in the 1980s that they wanted to solve was largely caused by the same liberal left back in the 1920s, the gay community would probably told them to shove off. Thus, the exponential moving average of history allows people and groups to function day to day, blithely unaware that previously they advocated an entirely opposite position. Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily. The social stances we took as young adults could be radically different from what we have today. It does, however, smack of hypocrisy if we stand up and proclaim that such and such opinion is the natural evolution of social norms, when we advocated the opposite in our youth.<br><br>Chronocentrism serves us well if we use it to filter the past, not judge it. The social etiquette relevant to Elizabethan England would be hopelessly anachronistic today. On the other hand, the agricultural knowledge from Elizabethan England could be very relevant tomorrow. History can be very useful. Let’s just hope someone remembers the right part when we need it.<br><br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c8608769241242184854 title="comment permalink">1/14/17, 5:40 PM</a><br><br>

I agree with JMG, women do it too, but in their own way, and perhaps that's the critical problem that has to be solved in mixed-gender places. If the women are there playing by their rules and the men playing by theirs, both sides will perceive the others as cheaters.<br><br>I've long had the strongly held intuition that something that would do a lot to patch things over in our society would be for there to be spheres of activity which were exclusively male or female. I still don't have a rational explanation for this theory, but the idea that dominance hierarchies could be settled among people who are all playing the same game is a compelling one. It's worth noting that just about every human society, patriarchy, matriarchy or something in between, probably had this feature whether they knew it or not.<br><br>I can't find it now, but Peterson has a wonderful exploration of the adage "It's not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game" - taking the meaning of game as 'group social activity with rules' - this makes sense because you want to be invited back again, and losing fairly 30% of the time is better than winning 70% of the time for a short while before being disinvited. If the game is Monopoly, being disinvited from future Monopoly games is a blessing, but if the game is going hunting or engaging in courtship or managing rice paddies, you probably want to follow the rules.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c6275490398625548095 title="comment permalink">1/14/17, 7:36 PM</a><br><br>

Is it a sailing voyage you are going to do or just general interest? As a lifelong sailor with about 100,000 miles at sea in private yachts including 3 of my own, my advice if you are interested in going sailing is to start with a small dinghy. Learning to sail on a small dinghy (less than 16 feet long) gives you a “seat of the pants” experience of wind and water and how a boat interacts with these two elements. Mistakes mostly just end up with you getting wet. Skipping this stage is sort of like learning to fly by starting out on a 747 or twin engine plane instead of a Piper Cub. I’ve met thousands of sailors in my 73 years and the best ones, cruisers or racers, started in dinghies.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c3858845661548895369 title="comment permalink">1/14/17, 10:38 PM</a><br><br>

At the time I read it, I found it electrifying, as it explained much I had been through and seen in many years of being a "part" of something I later had to rescue my "self" from - the list includes evangelical Christianity, a certain expression of feminism, atheism, certain dietary practices, and other group pursuits where, despite my initial sympathy, a sort of groupthink ultimately made me feel stifled and in need of distance. Each time I recognised the feeling that belonged to the early experience that (I believe) innoculated me against "unity" (and probably "purity" forever). That experience was a revival preacher I heard when I was 13. I was already a Christian believer from childhood, but this preacher did something deeply disturbing. For a short time he succeeded in making me see myself as utterly depraved and worthless and evil, my body as corrupt and filthy and disgusting. Of course I raced to the altar to be "saved"... And for about 12 to 24 hours the spell he had worked on me persisted. And then, anger, deep and visceral. I knew I had been turned against myself. I knew (once again) I was 13, an ordinary, well-intentioned, neglectful of duty, bookish, generous to friends, run of the mill, human girl and that I had been played in a way that was in no way friendly or respectful to me. I have ever been wary of the word "unity" (though I'll take "alongsidership") and as for purity, well, my favourite life form is compost... Purity is, when you come down to it, biophobic. Life is messy and so am I and I will never "fit" any Procrustean mass movement.

One thing I forgot to say is that buying some equipment, like tanks, lighting and airpumps, is vastly cheaper second-hand, and buying that rather than new reduces the embodied energy used in your fishkeeping. There's a lot of people who try fishkeeping for a few months, then give up and get rid of their tank and all accoutrements. <br><br>Just be careful to test tanks for leaks (can be easily fixed with aquarium sealant when empty)and check that heaters heat to the right temperatures - a malfunctioning heater has the potential to fry your fish.<br><br>On the subject of heaters, I much prefer adjustable ones that you can set to the temperature your fish prefer. If you have a cold house and want to keep the temperature at 70F for barbs, you can do that.

Every time it has something new to teach me. <br><br>Unknown Eagle, I have to admit a certain amount of skepticism about the claim, popular these days in some circles, that politicians are any more psychopathic than the rest of us. Projecting the shadow is a very popular sport! <br><br>Tidlösa, I'd want to see some evidence that there's any kind of statistically significant correlation between tolerance and social stability. As I glance back over history, I see tolerant and intolerant times more or less evenly distributed across periods of greater and lesser social stability. I made the Lakeland Republic relatively tolerant of ethnic, religious, and sexual differences because I wanted to challenge the mindless equation of tolerance with the latest technological gimmicks, aka "progress."<br><br>Scotlyn, thanks for clarifying. I'd point out that just as men compete with one another for the attention of women, women compete with one another for the attention of men -- and people in both genders also compete with one another for the attention of members of their own gender who are higher up the pecking order. Have a look sometime at a good book on social primate behavior, and you'll find that we don't actually differ that much from our furrier relatives! <br><br>David, yep. It really does read like the lists of accusations read aloud to accused witches, who were then tortured until they agreed to every one. <br><br>Bill, I really think it's the Abrahamic influence, and in America in particular, the way that historic Christianity bought into the late classical terror and loathing of sexual pleasure. What made gay people unacceptable to the Abrahamic mainstream is that they have sex for fun, without pretending that it's all about babies. When you have a chance, read up on the shrieking hysteria that rose when the first generation or so of birth-control advocates tried to make their case in nineteenth-century America -- it's another manifestation of the same terror. (I forget who it was who defined "puritanism" as "the constant, nagging, terrible fear that someone, somewhere, is having a good time.")<br><br>Phitio, you're conflating increasing complexity with improvement. That doesn't follow -- as Joseph Tainter, among others, has pointed out. Evolution has increased the potential range of complexity among living things. <i><b>That still doesn't mean that evolution is the same thing as progress</b></i>. <br><br>Nancy, have you by any chance read the ancient Greek poet Hesiod? He did the Hindus one better -- his historical model starts from the Golden Age and descends to the Iron Age, and doesn't reset back to the Golden Age...it just sinks down into darkness and silence forever. Which is to say, you're quite correct that there are many ways to think of history, and progress is only one of them. <br><br>BFM, good. Exactly; the people you're talking to are trying to turn history into a mythology that justifies their present positions, rather than using it as a basis to understand how they ended up in the mess they're in. Ironically, one of the things that history teaches is that it's a bad idea to try to turn history into a mythology to justify present positions...<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c7042046702935447013 title="comment permalink">1/15/17, 11:35 PM</a><br><br>

The one difficulty I see there is that the association between a passionate support of animal rights and a serene disinterest in human rights was already well in place in Europe in the 1930s, when the global population was a lot smaller than it is today. I'm going to want to research this...<br><br>Ekkar, why, yes. ;-) I prefer print to audio because people talk so slowly. That said, I'll see what I can find. <br><br>Chris, here again, you're misusing the word "evolution." Piaget's theory is a model of maturation, not evolution, <i><b>and these are not the same thing</b></i>. Please do stop and think about the words you're using!<br><br>Popps, I'm not at all sure that this follows. I find it hard to characterize the last half century as a period of cooperation! <br><br>Ekkar, I read Sheldrake's <i>A New Science of Life</i> as soon as it came out -- once <i>Nature</i> dismissed it as "a book fit only for burning" (I think that was the phrase) I knew I'd find it useful! <br><br>Christopher, that it's a typically one-sided argument. If that was in fact the case, human societies that always cooperated and never competed would have absorbed or squeezed out human societies that competed a long time ago. The evidence of history, rather, suggests very strongly that competition and cooperation are both useful strategies, and those societies that can do both tend to outcompete those societies that can only do one. <br><br>None, yes, I saw that. Notice the way the author uses the abstraction of anger to evade talking about the concrete impacts of neoliberal policies on the non-affluent majority. <br><br>Russell, good! And of course that's another example of the way that things have shifted over the last century. <br><br>Donald, that's doubtless one way to discuss the subject. <br><br>Joe, believing in linear schemes of history pretty much requires believing in six impossible things every day before breakfast. Our species is pretty good at that, though. <br><br>Ed-M, thank you! I'll put Beachy's book on the get-to list. Randolph Carter never went to Berlin, which is why I didn't include it in my research. ;-)<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c7132869022660745358 title="comment permalink">1/16/17, 12:12 AM</a><br><br>

While I have my disagreements with the dirtbag left, I suspect we'd have a lot more to talk about than either of us would have with, say, a diehard Clintonista. <br><br>Cortes, I suspect that if Trump hadn't been elected Yellen would not have noticed those things. <br><br>Justin, I don't buy it either, but Jaynes makes some extraordinarly useful points, and I think of his book as required reading for anybody who wants to wrestle with the nitty gritty of how human consciousness emerged. <br><br>Pipermichael, that's why I start by casting hand grenades before swine.

With regard to renaming buildings to erase the past, may I suggest another book? George Orwell's <i>1984</i> talks at quite some length about why the erasure of history is a central strategy of despotism...<br><br>Dan, yes, I've encountered that. It seems fantastically oversimplified to me. <br><br>Shane, I know. It's as though Obama's eight years of Democratic neoconservatism has convinced all the other Democrats that they ought to become Republicans in all but name. Giddy stuff! <br><br>David, it's fascinating to watch. As I see it, there are at least two possibilities. On the one hand, this kind of extreme language shows up when a political group is trying to nerve itself up to embrace violence; on the other, it shows up with equal facility when a political group has reached the end of the line and is about to implode messily. We'll see which way this turns out. <br><br>Patricia, and a thumping sense of entitlement to boot! Definitely time to break out the popcorn. <br><br>Wendy, the point I wanted to make about automation is that people have been overestimating the speed and reach of automation since my childhood. Right now a lot of third world countries do manufacturing because it's cheaper to hire a human being there than it is to put in a machine. As the global economy continues to contract in real terms, that's going to become even more common; I expect to see deautomation as a significant trend in my lifetime, for economic reasons. Still, that's a subject for a future post.<br><br>Dagnarus, good. Exactly; every ideology is a radical oversimplification of a complex reality, and ends up running face first into limits of one kind or another. <br><br>Canon Fodder, hmm. I think you've misread what I was saying. I'm defining chronocentrism specifically as the habit of judging the past by the standards of the present; what you're talking about is something different and, as you note, a good deal less problematic.<br><br>Justin, that's one of the reasons I appreciate gender-specific organizations such as the Freemasons. It's good to have guy time now and then -- and many women I know feel the same way about their girl time. <br><br>Nuku, nah, it's research for a book. In the sixth book of <i>The Weird of Hali</i>, the viewpoint character (a hopeless landlubber) ends up on a three-masted barque, the <i>Miskatonic</i>, sailing north from Kingsport, MA on a last-chance mission to the east coast of a partly deglaciated Greenland; Lovecraft fans will want to know that the Terrible Old Man is the captain and his crew -- well, the less said about them the better. Cameo parts by Nyarlathotep the Crawling Chaos, Tsathoggua, an assortment of voormis and shoggoths, and a kraken are also on the agenda.

I’m male, and I used to go to a week-long annual “Men‘s and Women‘s Gathering” held on a rural commune here in NZ. There was always a session when the women, numbering around 20, would sit on a circle of hay bales and have a 1-2 hr sharing time with a talking stick during which time each woman had the opportunity to get up and speak about what was going on in her life. During these sessions, the men would sit on the ground in a larger circle outside the women‘s circle and just listen (fly on the wall style). The next day the positions would be reversed, men on the inside, women out. <br>There definitely were differences in the way each group spoke, their concerns, the ways they interacted, even how any conflicts in the group were dealt with. <br>My own relationships with members of both genders benefited.<br>There were also men only gatherings and women only gatherings each of which had a distinctive flavor.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c7977766786773212020 title="comment permalink">1/16/17, 2:14 AM</a><br><br>

IMHO, a lot of the intergenerational rage between Silents/Boomers and Millennial and younger (to a lesser extent, Gen X) is from the older generations not acknowledging their privilege and blaming younger generations for not achieving (lazy, etc.) Of course, all this makes sense when you look at it through the prism of progress and its handmaiden, Americanism and the American dream. Most Americans simply cannot acknowledge that the American dream shriveled up and blew away for most in the 1970s in the aftermath of the US hitting peak oil and limits to growth. Hence, the education/student loan bubble to prop up the delusion of the American dream. Heck, I even work with 20 somethings who still believe in the American dream and think that someday, with enough education, they will become wealthy. Sad, but true. So, we have Boomers and Silents blaming younger generations for their predicament, and increasingly enraged younger generations, all as a form of cognitive dissonance b/c we collectively can't admit that progress and the American dream shriveled up and blew away 40 years ago.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c1436875388871583561 title="comment permalink">1/16/17, 6:45 AM</a><br><br>

My wife works in the dental industry, so that's one that comes to mind for us. Considering how much it limits your social status and income potential (not to mention your actual health), we think it's odd that our society has decided that it should not be covered by health insurance. However, you could use other beauty ideals and I would say that we are much more judgmental as a society today than we were 30-50 years ago. Roseanne Barr and John Candy were able to be legitimate movie stars while being overweight without having to have all their comedy revolve around their weight. Harrison Ford and Sylvester Stallone have facial scars but were allowed to play leading men without having to make excuses for their looks. Almost the entire cast of cheers looks like what I could find in an actual bar. I can't think of anything similar these days. Even in professional sports, Jim Abbott played in the MLB with one arm, whereas it's hard to find a player with acne these days. I know I'm throwing out a lot of pop culture references, which I was trying to avoid originally, but my point is that in general, it's much harder to get ahead or even get by if you don't "look right" in America. When I grew up, I would regularly see people with missing teeth and fingers that were still part of the community (mechanics, farmers, war vets etc). Body hair could be another issue, women not shaving their pits or legs would have management interference at my place of work even though it's a totally natural (we only started using safety razors in WWI). We may be slightly more accepting of racial differences, but we expect everyone to fit into the mold of acceptable looks.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c4677735264515722848 title="comment permalink">1/16/17, 8:49 AM</a><br><br>

Occasionally the sheer amount of alcohol consumed would kill or blind them. When England made gin illegal, criminals became rich making it, and the legitimacy of government was threatened. After 100 years of gyrations, they legalized it, regulated production, and taxed it so it was more expensive than beer, and society has been able to live with gin under these conditions. I think this process should sound familiar to everyone by now-- Legalize-Regulate-Tax. That's what seems to keep a social drug in its place, and NIDA said as much in the late 70's/early 80's.

I had a BA in Accounting, but everybody and her sister had done the same thing I did, and 90% of the hobs called for doing the books in between answering the phones and doing the usual admin stuff - for which I had not qualified! <br><br>And do make the distinction between Silents in the bubble - heavens, my older daughter is an Xer in the bubble par excellence - and Silents who want to help if given a clue (the magic words here are "contracting economy" and "Yes, it's like the 1930s for the young; I have a friend half my age doing the same sort of job I did and she's getting a rotten deal from the very same institution! Everybody in those departments is." And Silents who have been poor and are sympathetic,m but privilege is not transferable.<br><br>BTW, one other thing Strauss &amp; Howe said: "The Silents will sneak by and feel guilty about it, which will change nothing." Because the very nature of privilege is that it is NOT transferable <br><br>I can't put my younger friend on my health insurance. Her own parents can't put her on their health insurance. <br><br>And of course being an identity-based scapegoat is not transferable either.

Think the drumbeat of terrorist attacks around the world or the explosion in mass shootings (which were almost unheard of 25 years ago, and are depressingly common today). Or the way political rhetoric in this country tends to grow more and more heated and extreme with each passing year (ten years ago, I for one would have found it hard to imagine something like the more violent BLM protests, or the more despicable portions of the alt-right).<br><br>Or, to depart politics for a while, think of how movies and video games seem to become steadily more violent. I mean, "Hunger Games"? The "Saw" franchise? When I watch older action movies, even the violent ones, what impresses me most is the campy cartoonishness of it all-something today's deadly serious gore-flicks utterly lack.<br><br>Perhaps this might be a thought for the other blog, but I've begun to see a marked level of background violence in our collective conciousness (if that makes any sense). It doesn't seem to be going away-quite the opposite-and it worries me sometimes. I wonder if anyone else has thought along the same lines.<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c5776578830236073331 title="comment permalink">1/16/17, 5:29 PM</a><br><br>

From the Wikipedia article on the Roman Warm Period; "A high resolution pollen analysis of a core from Galicia concluded in 2003 that the Roman Warm Period lasted from 250 BC–AD 450 in northwestern Iberia." The Medieval Warm Period ranged from 950 to 1250 (also see Wikipedia). In between the two warm periods was a cold period during, and possibly contributing to the Dark Age. <br><br>There is another interesting article from Wikipedia; Extreme_weather_events_of_535–536. <br><br>And there is this little gem from http://www.atmo.arizona.edu/students/courselinks/fall12/atmo336/lectures/sec5/holocene.html<br><br>"From 600-900 AD (The "Dark Ages"), global average temperatures were significantly colder than today.

And yes, it does seem to be confined to the US, since I spent summer and fall '15 in Eastern Ontario (Can.), where people are much more gracious and warm. I hated the thought of returning to the States. As a Spanish speaker, my experience with migrants is the same as my experience in Canada, if not more so. Yes, there is an underlying dark energy, as bad as 1930s Europe, if not worse, and yes, it is dying for an outlet as bad as anything Europe experienced mid-20th century. The cognitive dissonance between the illusions we cling to as Americans and our day-to-day reality is every bit as bad as the difference between the rhetoric about the "1000 year Reich" and reality in Europe.

I’ve heard Trump voters repeatedly called uneducated, stupid, ignorant, and etc…by people should share common cause with their wage class peers. The solidarity between the wagers on the left and the salary class can only be explained if there is some amount of aspiration on the left to graduate into the salary class, which would make virtue signaling necessary. However, I don’t think that wholly explains the vitriol here. <br><br>Last week you talked about Chronocentrism and how the reaction to Trump’s victory is partially a reaction to the realization that progress isn’t unidirectional. I pointed out that the elite seem to have determined what counts as progress, and declared all those who didn’t agree to be superfluous. This week you talk about class bias, or the idea that the class that benefits most from the cult of progress tried to control or destroy the class that was most negatively affected by the cult. The salary classes effectively offered the wage class on the left a chance to be declared essential if they broke with their wage class peers on the right. A deal which a fair portion of the wage class on the left took. Now suddenly, their patrons are out of power and their promises of being included in their circles are rendered meaningless. The wage class left having declared their opposite number on the right superfluous by adopting the mannerisms of the salary class, are now afraid that their opposite number will do the same to them. <br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br><a href=the-embarrassments-of-chronocentrism.html#c6150365421365481630 title="comment permalink">1/20/17, 3:37 PM</a><br><br>
