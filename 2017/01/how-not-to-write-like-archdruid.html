<div class=MsoNormal>
Among the occasional amusements I get from writing these weekly essays are earnest comments from people who want to correct my writing style. I field one of them every month or so, and the latest example came in over the electronic transom in response to last week’s post. Like most of its predecessors, it insisted that there’s only one correct way to write for the internet, trotted out a set of canned rules that supposedly encapsulate this one correct way, and assumed as a matter of course that the only reason I didn’t follow those rules is that I’d somehow managed not to hear about them yet. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The latter point is the one I find most amusing, and also most curious. Maybe I’m naive, but it’s always seemed to me that if I ran across someone who was writing in a style I found unusual, the first thing I’d want to do would be to ask the author why he or she had chosen that stylistic option—because, you know, any writer who knows the first thing about his or her craft chooses the style he or she finds appropriate for any given writing project. I field such questions once in a blue moon, and I’m happy to answer them, because I do indeed have reasons for writing these essays in the style I’ve chosen for them. Yet it’s much more common to get the sort of style policing I’ve referenced above—and when that happens, you can bet your bottom dollar that what’s being pushed is the kind of stilted, choppy, dumbed-down journalistic prose that I’ve deliberately chosen not to write. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m going to devote a post to all this, partly because I write what I want to write about, the way I want to write about it, for the benefit of those who enjoy reading it, and those who don’t are encouraged to remember that there are thousands of other blogs out there that they’re welcome to read instead. Partly, though, the occasional thudding of what Giordano Bruno called “the battering rams of infants, the catapults of error, the bombards of the inept, and the lightning flashes, thunder, and great tempests of the ignorant”—now there was a man who could write!—raises issues that are central to the occasional series of essays on education I’ve been posting here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Accepting other people’s advice on writing is a risky business—and yes, that applies to this blog post as well as any other source of such advice. It’s by no means always true that “those who can, do; those who can’t, teach,” but when we’re talking about unsolicited writing advice on the internet, that’s the way to bet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus it’s not enough for some wannabe instructor to tell you “I’ve taught lots of people” (taught them what?) or “I’ve helped lots of people” (to do what?)—the question you need to ask is what the instructor himself or herself has written and where it’s been published. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second of those matters as much as the first. It so happens, for example, that a great many of the professors who offer writing courses at American universities publish almost exclusively in the sort of little literary quarterlies that have a circulation in three figures and pay contributors in spare copies. (It’s not coincidental that these days, most of the little literary quarterlies in question are published by university English departments.) There’s nothing at all wrong with that, if you dream of writing the sort of stories, essays, and poetry that populate little literary quarterlies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you want to write something else, though, it’s worth knowing that these little quarterlies have their own idiosyncratic literary culture. There was a time when the little magazines were one of the standard stepping stones to a successful writing career, but that time went whistling down the wind decades ago. Nowadays, the little magazines have gone one way, the rest of the publishing world has gone another, and many of the habits the little magazines encourage (or even require) in their writers will guarantee prompt and emphatic rejection slips from most other writing venues. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Different kinds of writing, in other words, have their own literary cultures and stylistic customs. In some cases, those can be roughly systematized in the form of rules. That being the case, is there actually some set of rules that are followed by everything good on the internet? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Er, that would be no. I’m by no means a fan of the internet, all things considered—I publish my essays here because most of the older venues I’d prefer no longer exist—but it does have its virtues, and one of them is the remarkable diversity of style to be found there. If you like stilted, choppy, dumbed-down journalistic prose of the sort my commenter wanted to push on me, why, yes, you can find plenty of it online. You can also find lengthy, well-argued essays written in complex and ornate prose, stream-of-consciousness pieces that out-beat the Beat generation, experimental writing of any number of kinds, and more. Sturgeon’s Law (“95% of everything is crap”) applies here as it does to every other human creation, but there are gems to be found online that range across the spectrum of literary forms and styles. No one set of rules applies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus we can dismiss the antics of the style police out of hand. Let’s go deeper, though. If there’s no one set of rules that internet writing ought to follow, are there different rules for each kind of writing? Or are rules themselves the problem? This is where things get interesting. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the consistent mental hiccups of American popular culture is the notion that every spectrum consists solely of its two extremes, with no middle ground permitted, and that bit of paralogic gets applied to writing at least as often as to anything else. Thus you have, on the one hand, the claim that the only way to write well is to figure out what the rules are and follow them with maniacal rigidity; on the other, the claim that the only way to write well is to throw all rules into the trash can and let your inner genius, should you happen to have one of those on hand, spew forth the contents of your consciousness all anyhow onto the page. Partisans of those two viewpoints snipe at one another from behind rhetorical sandbags, and neither one of them ever manages more than a partial victory, because neither approach is particularly useful when it comes to the actual practice of writing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By and large, when people write according to a rigidly applied set of rules—<i>any</i> rigidly applied set of rules—the result is predictable, formulaic, and trite, and therefore boring. By and large, when people write without paying any attention to rules at all, the result is vague, shapeless, and maundering, and therefore boring. Is there a third option? You bet, and it starts by taking the abandoned middle ground: in this case, learning an appropriate set of rules, and using them as a starting point, but departing from them wherever doing so will improve the piece you’re writing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The set of rules I recommend, by the way, isn’t meant to produce the sort of flat PowerPoint verbiage my commenter insists on. It’s meant to produce good readable English prose, and the source of guidance I recommend to those who are interested in such things is Strunk and White’s deservedly famous <i>The Elements of Style</i>. Those of my readers who haven’t worked with it, who want to improve their writing, and who’ve glanced over what I’ve published and decided that they might be able to learn something useful from me, could do worse than to read it and apply it to their prose. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A note of some importance belongs here, though. There’s a thing called writer’s block, and it happens when you try to edit while you’re writing. I’ve read, though I’ve misplaced the reference, that neurologists have found that the part of the brain that edits and the part of the brain that creates are not only different, they conflict with one another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you try to use both of them at once, your brain freezes up in a fairly close neurological equivalent of the Blue Screen of Death, and you stop being able to write at all. That’s writer’s block. To avoid it, <b><i>NEVER EDIT WHILE YOU’RE WRITING</i></b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I mean that quite literally. Don’t even look at the screen if you can’t resist the temptation to second-guess the writing process. If you have to, turn the screen off, so you can’t even see what you’re writing. Eventually, with practice, you’ll learn to move smoothly back and forth between creative mode and editing mode, but if you don’t have a lot of experience writing, leave that for later. For now, just blurt it all out without a second thought, with all its misspellings and garbled grammar intact. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then, after at least a few hours—or better yet, after a day or so—go back over the mess, cutting, pasting, adding, and deleting as needed, until you’ve turned it into nice clean text that says what you want it to say. Yes, we used to do that back before computers; the process is called “cut and paste” because it was done back then with a pair of scissors and a pot of paste, the kind with a little spatula mounted on the inside of the lid to help you spread the stuff; you’d cut out the good slices of raw prose and stick them onto a convenient sheet of paper, interspersed with handwritten or freshly typed additions. Then you sat down and typed your clean copy from the pasted-up mess thus produced. Now you know how to do it when the internet finally dries up and blows away. (You’re welcome.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the same way, you don’t try to write while looking up rules in Strunk &amp; White. Write your piece, set it aside for a while, and then go over it with your well-worn copy of Strunk &amp; White in hand, noting every place you broke one of the rules of style the book suggests you should follow. The first few times, as a learning exercise, you might consider rewriting the whole thing in accordance with those rules—but only the first few times. After that, make your own judgment call: is this a place where you should follow the rules, or is this a place where they need to be bent, broken, or trampled into the dust? Only you, dear reader-turned-writer, can decide. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A second important note deserves to be inserted at this point, though. The contemporary US public school system can be described without too much inaccuracy as a vast mechanism for convincing children that they can’t write. Rigid rules imposed for the convenience of educators rather than the good of the students, part of the industrial mass-production ethos that pervades public schools in this country, leave a great many graduates so bullied, beaten, and bewildered by bad pedagogy that the thought of writing something for anybody else to read makes them turn gray with fear. It’s almost as bad as the terror of public speaking the public schools also go out of their way to inflict, and it plays a comparable role in crippling people’s capacity to communicate outside their narrow circles of friends. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you suffer from that sort of educational hangover, dear reader, draw a deep breath and relax. The bad grades and nasty little comments in red ink you got from Mrs. Melba McNitpick, your high school English teacher, are no reflection of your actual capacities as a writer. If you can talk, you can write—it’s the same language, after all. For that matter, even if you can’t talk, you may be able to write—there’s a fair number of people out there who are nonverbal for one reason or another, and can still make a keyboard dance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The reason I mention this here is that the thought of making an independent judgment about when to follow the rules and when to break them fills a great many survivors of American public schools with dread. In far too many cases, students are either expected to follow the rules with mindless obedience and given bad grades if they fail to do so, or given no rules at all and then expected to conform to unstated expectations they have no way to figure out, and either of these forms of bad pedagogy leaves scars. Again, readers who are in this situation should draw a deep breath and relax; having left Mrs. McNitpick’s class, you’re not subject to her opinions any longer, and should ignore them utterly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So how do you decide where to follow the rules and where to fold, spindle, and mutilate them? That’s where we walk through the walls and into the fire, because what guides you in your decisions regarding the rules of English prose is the factor of literary taste. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Rules can be taught, but taste can only be learned. Does that sound like a paradox? Au contraire, it simply makes the point that only you can learn, refine, and ripen your literary taste—nobody else can do it for you, or even help you to any significant extent—and your sense of taste is therefore going to be irreducibly personal. When it comes to taste, you aren’t answerable to Mrs. McNitpick, to me, to random prose trolls on the internet, or to anyone else. What’s more, you develop your taste for prose the same way you develop your taste for food: by trying lots of different things, figuring out what you like, and paying close attention to what you like, why you like it, and what differentiates it from the things you don’t like as much. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is applicable, by the way, to every kind of writing, including those kinds at which the snobs among us turn up their well-sharpened noses. I don’t happen to be a fan of the kind of satirical gay pornography that Chuck Tingle has made famous, for example, but friends of mine who are tell me that in that genre, as in all others, there are books that are well written, books that are tolerable, and books that trip over certain overelongated portions of their anatomy and land face first in—well, let’s not go there, shall we? In the same way, if your idea of a good read is nineteenth-century French comedies of manners, you can find a similar spectrum extending from brilliance to bathos. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Every inveterate reader takes in a certain amount of what I call popcorn reading—the sort of thing that’s read once, mildly enjoyed, and then returned to the library, the paperback exchange, or whatever electronic Elysium e-books enter when you hit the delete button. That’s as inevitable as it is harmless. The texts that matter in developing your personal taste, though, are the ones you read more than once, and especially the ones you read over and over again. As you read these for the third or the thirty-third time, step back now and then from the flow of the story or the development of the argument, and notice how the writer uses language. Learn to notice the really well-turned phrases, the figures of speech that are so apt and unexpected that they seize your attention, the moments of humor, the plays on words, the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>passages that match tone and pacing to the subject perfectly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you’ve got a particular genre in mind—no, let’s stop for a moment and talk about genre, shall we? Those of my readers who endured a normal public school education here in the US probably don’t know that this is pronounced ZHON-ruh (it’s a French word) and it simply means a category of writing. Satirical gay pornography is a genre. The comedy of manners is a genre. The serious contemporary literary novel is a genre.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So are mysteries, romance, science fiction, fantasy, and the list goes on. There are also nonfiction genres—for example, future-oriented social criticism, the genre in which nine of my books from <i>The Long Descent</i> to <i>Dark Age America</i> have their place. Each genre is an answer to the question, “I just read this and I liked it—where can I find something else more or less like it?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Every genre has its own habits and taboos, and if you want to write for publication, you need to know what those are. That doesn’t mean you have to follow those habits and taboos with the kind of rigid obedience critiqued above—quite the contrary—but you need to know about them, so that when you break the rules you do it deliberately and skillfully, to get the results you want, rather than clumsily, because you didn’t know any better. It also helps to read the classics of the genre—the books that established those habits and taboos—and then go back and read books in the genre written before the classics, to get a sense of what possibilities got misplaced when the classics established the frame through which all later works in that genre would be read. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you want to write epic fantasy, for example, don’t you dare stop with Tolkien—it’s because so many people stopped with Tolkien that we’ve got so many dreary rehashes of something that was brilliantly innovative in 1949, complete with carbon-copy Dark Lords cackling in chorus and the inevitable and unendearing quest to do something with the Magic McGuffin that alone can save blah blah blah. Read the stuff that influenced Tolkien—William Morris, E.R. Eddison, the Norse sagas, the <i>Kalevala</i>, <i>Beowulf</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then read something in the way of heroic epic that he probably didn’t get around to reading—the <i>Ramayana</i>, the <i>Heike Monogatari</i>, the <i>Popol Vuh</i>, or what have you<i>—</i>and think through what those have to say about the broader genre of heroic wonder tale in which epic fantasy has its place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The point of this, by the way, isn’t to copy any of these things. It’s to develop your own sense of taste so that you can shape your own prose accordingly. Your goal, if you’re at all serious about writing, isn’t to write like Mrs. McNitpick, like your favorite author of satirical gay pornography or nineteenth-century French comedies of manners, or like me, but to write like yourself.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And that, to extend the same point more broadly, is the goal of any education worth the name. The word “education” itself comes from the Latin word <i>educatio</i>, from <i>ex-ducere</i>, “to lead out or bring out;” it’s about leading or bringing out the undeveloped potentials that exist inside the student, not shoving some indigestible bolus of canned information or technique down the student’s throat. In writing as in all other things that can be learned, that process of bringing out those undeveloped potentials requires the support of rules and examples, but those are means to an end, not ends in themselves—and it’s in the space between the rules and their inevitable exceptions, between the extremes of rigid formalism and shapeless vagueness, that the work of creation takes place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s also true of politics, by the way—and the conventional wisdom of our time fills the same role there that the rules for bad internet prose do for writing. Before we can explore that, though, it’s going to be necessary to take on one of the more pervasive bad habits of contemporary thinking about the relationship between the present and the past. We’ll tackle that next week. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

In a stroke of coincidence I've had cause to ponder this very topic today. My 13-year-old daughter has been worried all week about writing an essay at school and was seeking some guidance from me. I went through the subject matter of the essay and offered encouragements and ideas but it wasn't what she was after. She kept asking me odd questions such as "How many connectives are you allowed to use in a paragraph?" and "If three paragraphs have three sentences is the fourth paragraph allowed to have four?." <br><br>It was then that I realised they are being trained —ordered — to produce some kind of technically formulated drivel that is easy to mark (perhaps even by computers?) but is devoid of creativity, insight and flair. In fact, if she was to write with creativity, insight and flair she'd likely lose marks!<br><br>So, increasingly, I find myself explaining to her that "This is what the teachers want" while at the same time encouraging her to just relax and develop her own style. I shall be printing out this week's Archdruid Report and giving it to her for advice (and just hope she doesn't ask too much about the satirical gay pornography bit).<br><br>Congratulations on the release of the Merigan Tales book. I read your essay on science fiction and fantasy in Mythic just this morning - I hope soon to submit a story or two to it. I hope you don't mind me reminding your readers about my own newly-released semi-scifi book "Seat of Mars" - which puts into fictional form many of the subjects that have been discussed here on this blog over the years.

Your output is thought provoking, entertaining and quite relevant.<br><br>I took a writing class this past fall to pick up some pointers about the creative side of the craft, and of course to motivate me to actually put something down on paper. What I found, to my amazement, was the the wide range of "voices" by each of us in the class, and the unique talents those voices have. Regardless of the "quality" of the final product, the key to getting words on paper was to NOT fight the inner voice and allow it to be constrained by the "rules of popularity". The key was to let the ideas flow and worry about edits later. Sometimes a single sentence or phrase is the cornerstone of an idea which can be developed or unpacked into a paragraph, essay or novel.<br><br><a href=#c4073709194163486249 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 1:47 PM</a><br><br>

I don't even know where to start. <br><br>I won't bore you with the gory details of my education. Suffice it to say that I've been exposed to a lot of writing teachers and a lot of writing advice. Everything you say is dead on.<br><br>Nowadays, with the abundance of how-to books and writing blogs, it seems like some people believe that a shortcut to success exists, and if you consume enough advice from the right people, a publisher will show up at your door with a briefcase full of doubloons. Not so much. <br><br>My first three novels were garbage. Success, right now, is that each is less garbage-y than the last. I'm failing forward. If it's a labor of love, grinding like this really isn't a grind at all. Instead, every blank page is a new chance to impress yourself. <br><br>My daughters (10 and 9) are in Ms. Nitpicky's class at the moment. They're both word-nerds, but I've been seeing some distress lately as their teachers tear their writing apart. To combat that, I've been giving them writing assignments and explaining that the point of the exercise is to be okay with failing. If they aren't happy with the end-product, we just try it again. Last week they read Basho and wrote their own Haiku; this week they're making a map and writing a story to accompany it.<br><br>The more I experience the school system through my kids, the more I realize that it's a constant struggle to not let subjects like this, or learning in general, turn into a miserable chore.<br><br>As a final note: thank goodness you aren't taking these advice trolls to heart. Your style is amazing. I've been reading this blog for years and Well of Galabes since its inception. I wasn't even interested in Magic, really, but you drew me into the subject with your writing (I just bought a copy of Learning Ritual Magic, too). I make time each week to kick back and read your essays, as I would with a novel. Not many websites can make me do that.

The causes and consequences are a bit complex, so bear with me.<br><br>Even if we are an oil producing country, our infrastructure is heavily geared towards extraction and we do not have enough transformation capacity to satisfy internal demand; which forces us to export crude oil - mostly to US - and import it back in the form of gasoline and other products. The first cause is that victory of D.Trump has both increased the price of US dollar and, more importantly, produced an expectation of economic recession. Our Federal Government is trying to balance its budget by cutting all the usual social expenses, - health, education, infrastructure, etc, - but that proved to be not enough. Therefore, when forced to triage they have gambled that the least damaging thing to go is combustible subsidies.<br><br>Energy prices in Mexico are fixed by Federal Government, and heavily subsidized. To be fair, they have been trying to come out of this trap for more than a decade, but the instability of international prices have prevented it. They merely settled for slow but steady increases that would eat up on the increased oil revenues on the upwards side of the equation and happily reap the fruits when the prices goes down again. The schedule to eliminate subsidies and establish a parity with international crude prices was 2018.<br><br>The gamble of the current administration has been to rush ahead one year, because 2018 is election year in Mexico. This is the other cause of this decision. President Pena-Nieto's party would have got the backslash of this plan in the voting polls, had it been carried out as scheduled. Unfortunatelly, they seem to have underestimated the consequences of pooling together 18 months of price hikes in a single, big, highly noticeable event.<br><br>The consequences are universal reject of this measure, with both violent and non violent events taking place in all the country: At least one gas station has been looted and burned down in southern state of Chiapas. Several tolls in highways have been taken under control of organized groups of civilians that simply let everybody pass without paying for hours. In my very home town, more or less within walking distance from where I went to highschool, a pacific manifestation has been disipated by police with tear gas, arguably because they were blocking the BRT lane.<br><br>More intereting things are happening in my town. Even when record numbers of commuters are trying to use public transportation again, after their ill fated love afair with the car, the contractors running the bus lines are grounding units in protest because they would be forced to operate on red numbers if ticket prices (which are also fixed and set by the (State) government) were to remain the same as last year. The city major was already talking about grounding ambulances and police cars, since municipal budgets are set at the State level too.<br><br>Not that any of this is surprising at the least, but I cannot imagine how frightening and disconcerting this facts would be without a mental framework to make sense of all this. with a little forewarning and a whole lots of Faith and optimism, 2017 promises to be quite an interesting time to be around.

He called the President a "Executioner of the People", and accussed of hypocrisy to all the senators that are now decrying the price hike but that backed up the reform a couple of years ago. And now he has publicly declared that we need to take down the corrupt institutions of this country by any pacific means available.

Bing had the ground floor covered. Bruno was keeping a lid on things in the courtyard. The net was in place, all they had to do was pull the strings. <br><br>Maestro left Jack’s apartment. He walked to the elevators, slowing his step at each door and listening for tell-tale moans.<br><br>“Who knows? Might have had a girlfriend in the building.”<br><br>Maestro was not worried about finding Jack. He knew they’d catch him, there was knowing left but patience. <br><br>“still omw… bad traffic”, Bing’s message caught Maestro by surprise.<br><br>“What? He should already be back.”<br><br>Maestro sent Bing a single note, “k”. He’d have to cover the ground-floor until Bing got in gear. He pushed the down elevator button, and tapped his foot while waiting.<br><br>“This dog better stop being bad. I am near the end of my rope.”<br><br>Maestro rapped his cane sharply on the rubber floor. It was never the zombie you were looking for that caused trouble, but the one you didn’t see coming. <br><br>DING!<br><br>The elevator doors slid open. A mass of shambling limbs and dripping core tumbled through the doors with a groan, falling face first into Maestro.<br><br>“Blurgle-raargh!”<br><br><br><a href=#c4937300855288884125 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 2:45 PM</a><br><br>

Regarding the latter, it seems to be the "house style" of the very popular comedy/social commentary website Cracked.com, and one of its more interesting "tricks" is that it can sometimes introduce complicated or thoughtful ideas through the back door of writing that seems like easy-to-digest popcorn on the outside (in other cases, of course, it's exactly as vapid as it appears). At it's best, it's a bit like... introducing philosophy in cartoon form: http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2292<br>For example, one of their really good articles recently was this one, which through typical easily-digestible popcorn-like language introduces some really important problems in contemporary society: http://www.cracked.com/article_24392_7-times-companies-destroyed-world-and-got-away-with-it.html<br><br>One of the most interesting "tricks" I notice in your writing, on the other hand, is that you tend to disarm a reader's potential rejection and criticism of any particular ideas by adding in a phrase like "but this is only one part of a broader issue" or "but there's more to this than what was just said" - immediately the reader imagines "well, that's good, maybe he acknowledges whatever concern I just had about the thing he wrote". And by the same method, you encourage a reader to keep reading to find out what the "big picture" is, including by promising that the big picture is to come in next week's post. I think this is a big part of why your more verbose style also works so well at keeping me interested in reading it -- because it puts me into a philosophical mindset in which I'm more open to that more encompassing style, whereas with the more bite-sized, list-based Cracked.com pieces, I tend to read them more by scanning the articles quickly, jumping over any stupid jokes or list items that I'm not interested in (their bite-sized and easy-to-scan format allows me to safely jump ahead to the next section), sometimes stopping for a long time on certain things that are incongruous to the popcorny surface style.<br><br><a href=#c3076868845002679708 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 3:14 PM</a><br><br>

There are times I didn't understand die to lack of familiarity with the subject matter, but then I read up on the subjects. <br><br>The dumbing down goes clear back at least to the year I was born. There is a small incident in To Kill A Mockingbird in which Scout's new teacher tells her to tell her father (or did she write a note?) not to teach her to read, because she was supposed to be reading at her grade level, not above it. <br><br>There is a third flaw that crops up in the teaching of English, though not, as I understand it, one young math savants are subject to. That is, letting a verbally gifted child get away with murder because the way s/he writes, in comparison to the rest of the classmates past and present, blows the teacher away. I have to stop and give most humble and hearty thanks to the one high school English teacher who called me on that with the first D in English I ever had in my life. Yes, complete with red marks for grammar and punctuation and fuzzy logic. After I got over the shock, I went up to her and asked her, and her first words were that I could do better than that, here's how and why, go back and rewrite it. I wrote to her standards ever since. I have had A's from college teachers in 200-level courses, but my elderly and distinguished professor in Old English Poetry and Prose did precisely the same thing. I am grateful. <br><br>As for writing the garbage the teacher wants - the first thing you learn from experienced published writers, who tend to dominate our local annual science-fiction convention, is that you find out what the editors want and give it to them, but don't let it stop you from writing what you want. And that some criticism is crud. I remember one would-be agent I dropped like a hot rock because, among other things, she said she could not believe in any culture that had tribal societies living next door to spaceports. Noo Yawker, never set foot in New Mexico in her life. She'd have rejected Walter Jon Williams' Day of Atonement on the same grounds, lucky for him he had far better agents than her. So --- if the Business English course (true story - marked down to a B on the testing out for exactly that reason) insists that you write in High Academic Regalian, when I've never seen a businessperson yet who did, roll your eyes and hand it to them. Oh, yes.

I especially appreciate the advice on not editing while writing. I myself have tried <br><br>giving writing a crack a few times - I have a few pieces of non-fiction writing that are online in various places dating back <br><br>to 2001. Although I have written on-and-off, it has never become a regular thing for me, mainly because of my frustration at <br><br>my own writer's block. I waste large amounts of time compulsively editing what I just wrote, which often results in me <br><br>forgetting the main thought in the first place. In fact, I'm struggling just to keep myself from editing this comment while <br><br>writing it.<br><br>As a result, I have a lot of scattered random thoughts for possible essay topics in my Google Keep notes. And I have a <br><br>backlog of about a year of those but I've never gotten around to actually writing about them. I'm not a huge fan of new-<br><br>year's resolutions (every day is a good day to resolve to improve), but this year I will try to get at least one essay up <br><br>every month. I will definitely take your advice to read up The Elements of Style.<br><br>Esn here mentioned Cracked.com - ADR and Cracked are two of the websites where I waste a lot of time at work... I mean, where <br><br>I spend leisure reading time. A lot of the Cracked stuff are mediocre, but a surprising number of them are real gems. And the <br><br>signal:noise ratio is even better than mainstream news-and-opinion sites (which reflects more on the latter than on Cracked). <br><br>It just goes to show that there isn't a one-size-fits-all style that's good for everything!<br><br>Speaking of bad habits of contemporary thinking, one thing I noticed about modern "education" is the tendency to (attempt to) <br><br>reduce everything into mechanistic, bullet-point prescriptions. It's more than just writing and politics:<br><br>* Personal finance: "What percentage of my income to I have to save in order to retire at (absurdly young age) with (absurd <br><br>amounts of money)? Which stocks should I invest in?"<br>* Career: "What should I put on my resume and cover letter, and what answers do I need to give in the interview, so I can get <br><br>the job? What projects should I take on so that I will get the big raise and get promoted to VP?"<br>* Fitness and nutrition: Which [trendy superfoods] do I need to eat? Which [ingredients of dietary elements] do I need to <br><br>avoid? Which 'targeted exercises' do I need to perform and for how long, so that I will get those six-pack abs?"<br><br>And it goes on and on. Being a new dad, my current pet peeve has got to be "parenting" advice. I tell my wife (even before we <br><br>got married), that 90% of parenting advice is crap. Not because they're bad advice <i>per se</i>, but mostly because it's <br><br>inapplicable to the situation. Parents and kids are people (whoa, imagine that!) with their own quirks and what works for one <br><br>family may not work for another. Even within families, with each parent applying their own "style", each individual child is <br><br>treated in a different manner according to their own needs and temperament.<br><br>Entire industries have sprung up to cater to the huge modern appetite for this canned, package-deal advice. Consultants charge huge money to give people such powerpoint-presentation advice. Books are published to expound each bullet point into their own chapter (mostly repetitive fluff). You can create your own product and have it "reviewed" by the field's "authorities", so that they can mark it Certified (tm). You can even go through their remarkably expensive training programs so that you can be a Certified(tm) Consultant yourself, and be able to sign your emails with your "credentials". It's very telling that the comment from the Random Prose Troll (RPT (tm)), which triggered this very post, offered credentials that are "verifiable on request".<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Carlos M., RPT, LOL, IMO, BBQ, WTF<br><br><a href=#c8268218618644811947 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 5:29 PM</a><br><br>

I've lost count of how many tens of millions of people the non-profit that I founded helped. With trivial government or corporate funding, for just over a decade." What was the nature of the valuable help delivered? Tens of millions? The last sentence isn't even a sentence! Mrs. McNitpick would be appalled!

They've enlarged my thinking.<br><br>Have you ever written an essay touching on "the secret space program," or more generally, the hoarding of "advanced technology" in a few hands? As someone who also had a lot of youthful hope for space exploration in the 60's, it's intriguing to think that it may still be going on. Some researchers, including Joseph Farrell, Richard Dolan, Catherine Austin-Fitts, make a good case that it is. Gibson said, "The future is here, but it's unequally distributed." Maybe it's more unequal than we think.<br><br>But, a more interesting question might be this: Suppose we did have zero-point energy, the ability to nano-engineer a common material like silicon into any number of materials that can mimic the properties of rare metals, etc. etc. Would it in fact deliver a utopia of peace and prosperity or instead a banquet of unintended consequences? Are the real breakthroughs to be had in a greater understanding of the nature of consciousness?<br><br>I've read any number of authors who make a case that the cornucopians are wrong as a matter of fact, but haven't yet come across anyone explicitly arguing that they are wrong as a matter of principle.<br><br>But whatever topic strikes your fancy, look forward to reading your take on it every Wednesday evening.<br><br>Happy 2017,<br><br>Greg<br><br><a href=#c3217868154594186303 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 5:56 PM</a><br><br>

My Freshman year in engineering school I was required to take a number of arts school classes in english, philosophy etc, and was handed a copy of Strunk and White during orientation. I even took english in the same classroom where William Strunk had taught EB White many years earlier, guided by the stern busts of the two great writers looking down upon me. And during that year I became a passable writer (for an engineer). But then I spent the next two years taking nothing but engineering and science classes and reading the horrible prose that is contained is such books to the exclusion of almost everything else due to the work load. But then I once again had to write real english senior year and my writing had deteriorated to the same dreck found in engineering texts. My writing slowly improved as I regularly read real books and wrote real paragraphs.

And thanks, in an odd way, to Madmagic last week for prompting the good advice giving.<br><br>I was a visual arts focused student and more-or-less actively forgot everything from English class (other than the books we were given to read solely in order to write book reports for the purpose of grading our writing from yet another direction - the similarity of the process to how one might train an office drone to produce and digest memoranda, minutes, and reports was never mentioned, but I digress) as quickly and thoroughly as I could. But having successfully escaped the Academy, I became an insatiable reader and thinker and discourser of and about a fair range of genres, both fiction and nonfiction. And so from time to time I have had thoughts and ideas that I had a bit of a wish to actually write down.<br><br>This blog, in fact, has been one stimulus for this desire - especially, of course, the many writing contests.<br><br>But, I have never actually gotten anything down, not even a full first draft of short stories that I had pretty much in full in my mind. I've always had plenty of the usual excuses of time, inclination, and worthwhileness, but it was not until I just now read your admonition against editing while writing- even to the point of not looking at what one is writing! - that I understood what exactly what "writer's block" is meant be, and that I suffer from it. So thank you very much indeed! <br><br>I believe that I shall be picking up a copy of the style book you recommended and trying my hand (at last) sometime soon. Perhaps I'll start a blog. ;-)<br><br>Off Topic: I was quite amused to see an automobile right smack in the focul center of the cover art for <i>Retrotopia</i>, which struck me as the most automobile-less tale of a possible future I have ever read. Is there any kind of story behind this? Does the final version involve more auto transport? Or is it just that the artist was thinking of Cuba? <br><br>Just curious.<br><br><a href=#c1855140032695079497 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

Not soon after, upper-crust yuppie online tabloid Rappler published a story that Andanar's phrase is "not too original", as it was used by in an Atlantic article a few months back. It stops short of accusing Mr. Andanar of plagiarism, though it implies that we're not supposed to take anything he says seriously because he copied a phrase from The Atlantic. I remember reading that Atlantic article a few months back and Andanar's press release did remind me of it. I thought nothing of it, honestly. Mr. Duterte and Mr. Trump are extremely colorful characters that have often been compared to each other. And "seriously, not literally" is a useful way of approaching both men's words. How many ways can you express that thought in such a condensed manner? Mr. Duterte's government has not been without its problems. His opponents nitpicking his boys on trivial stuff like this just makes people think that the opposition are a bunch of petty whiners, and takes away discussion from the real, substantial issues.<br><br>This also reminds me of the recent Oracle vs. Google lawsuit, where Oracle accused Google of copying several thousand lines of code. Coding, as per JavaScript guru Doug Crockford, is just writing in computer language. One particular example is downright ridiculous: nine lines of an extremely simple boundary check that any first-year com-sci student can write. Oracle demanded $9 billion for the alleged copyright infringement, and lost (rightly, in my mind).<br><br>As implied in this post, writers are heavily influenced and nothing that gets written is completely original. This leads us to the contradiction: we have to condense everything to the simplest, twittable length. However, it reduces all of our complex thoughts into lengths where it's very hard - if not impossible - to communicate any nuance whatsoever. What happens is that everyone sounds exactly the same. As a result, the Internet consists of millions of paragraphs of exactly the same things said over and over. What a waste.<br><br>Just like essay scoring, plagiarism checking can be done online automatically now.

A magician never reveals the secrets of their trade, but maybe mages do.<br><br>One outcry from the nerd gallery: the Latin noun <i>educatio</i> is derived from the verb <i>educare,</i> to raise (as in children or crops), not from <i>educere,</i> to lead out. The English word that means 'to lead out' is eduction, which we derive from <i>educere.</i> My copy of Wheelock tells me in no uncertain terms not to confuse the two verbs.<br><br>This became important for Ivan Illich when he started to question modern assumptions about what education is and why all people everywhere apparently need it. According to him, Cicero uses the verbs <i>instruere</i> and <i>docere</i> to designate activities performed by learned teachers. <i>Educare</i> was associated with wet-nurses and <i>educere</i> with midwives.<br><br>Apparently Tertullian was the first person to use <i>educare</i> in connection with a male subject, and he did so by saying metaphorically that Christians drink the milk of faith from the breasts of learned bishops, all of whom were of course men. The metaphor of the Catholic Church as the universal nurturer seems to be the origin of the (previously laughable) idea that institutionalized learning, aka education, aka breastfeeding, is a universal necessity.<br><br>A fun corollary of this metaphor is that although the Latin word <i>alumnus</i> has come to mean in English 'a product of any educational institute', its literal meaning is 'nurseling', or just 'sucker'.<br><br><a href=#c8245870928606258520 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 7:29 PM</a><br><br>

Her lecture turned out to be a quick and competent, yet shallow, summary of her book. So I looked forward eagerly to the long discussion that was scheduled to follow. <br><br>Yet the discussion period was, if possible, even more disappointing than her lecture. She treated each question asked, each point raised, as an opponent's serve in some fast-moving weird game of scholarly tennis, to be returned as quickly and efficiently as possible. It soon became apparent that she had no interest whatever in either discussing or elaborating on her lecture, on her book, or indeed on any question of scholarly interest. All she felt like doing, it seemed, was scoring "points" off each next member of her audience.<br><br>Madmagic, your writing advice brought the memory of that wasted afternoon back to mind sharply.

I became a bookworm as soon as I was taught to read. I picked up writing style by osmosis. My formal education happened in the mainframe era. My teachers mostly graded on length, spelling, grammar and punctuation. Apart from how to outline, I don't remember receiving much instruction about how to organize a piece of writing and nothing on style. I suppose more of that is required now because children read very little for pleasure these days, nor do they read daily newspapers.<br><br>I can see that learning the rule-bound kind of exposition Jason Heppenstall's daughter was taught might be a useful literary exercise like imitating the prose style of Cicero or Emerson, but it's not where I would start. I worked out my own methods for composing and editing prose.<br><br>I like writing in essay or article length. Past three hundred words, I usually find out what I think about a topic in the course of writing the first couple of drafts. When the second draft is finished, many of the paragraphs I wrote first will turn out to be digressions. After they are cut, everything else will have to be put in a different order to make the argument easier to follow. <br><br>I tend to write in a highly subordinated style. Most sentences in this comment have multiple verbs or gerunds in them. I talk like that too. Since this is not the nineteenth century, most of my readers are not going to have the patience to follow the thread of a sentence that looks like it was translated from Latin or Greek, so I divide it if I can do so without losing the sense. I count eight verbs in the previous sentence, but I like it so it is staying in.<br><br>I hunt for unnecessary passive voice and any kind of pompous phrase (e.g. "I have a tendency to write") and try to say the same thing in plain English. I weed out dead metaphors; often these are embedded in single words and an interest in etymology helps to spot them. I'll use a long or unusual word if it's the word I need, but not to show off. Posting comments on lively blogs has taught me to look for overstatements and arguing beyond the evidence, since I'll get called on that.<br><br><a href=#c232682890002279562 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 8:14 PM</a><br><br>

Your daughters are lucky to have you as their father, I'd say. <br><br>Aron, congrats! I hope your book finds its audience and does well. <br><br>Peter, nah, Bruno went out of his way to get tied to that stake. I admire his style, and I'm just finishing up a translation of his main book on the art of memory, <i>On the Shadows of the Ideas</i>, but I try to be a little less <i>domgeorn</i> than he was -- that's usually translated "eager for glory," but Tolkien points out that its literal meaning is "doom-eager," rushing enthusiastically on to the messy fate the Norns have lined up for you. <br><br>Bruno, that's a bit challenging. It's basically a political-military thriller, but I took the unspoken rule of political-military thrillers -- the status quo always wins -- and stood it on its head. I don't know if anyone else is doing that sort of thing. <br><br>Avery, research-based journals are a whole different kettle of fish. The publishers know that professors are so desperate to rack up publications in the hope of getting tenure that they can exploit the professoriat mercilessly. The kind of journal I have in mind is usually photocopied and staplebound, and has some kind of vaguely evocative name -- the local example, put out by the writing program at Frostburg State University up the hill from where I live, is <i>Backbone Mountain Review</i>. (To be fair, it's better than many.) You don't get much boost to your CV from having a story or a poem there, so they aren't as ruthless as Routledge! <br><br>Raymond, you're welcome and thank you. I appreciate the data points from someone who's on the scene -- up here in Gringostan we tend to get a very distorted idea of what's going on on your side of the big river. <br><br>Dltrammel, agreed! The fact that we get five whole percent of non-crap seems pretty decent to me, all things considered. <br><br>Unknown, nope. If you want a critique, go to a critic. I've already offered my advice, which you're free to accept or reject as you choose. <br><br>Ray, glad to hear it. Writing online has its annoyances (like style trolls) but it also has some serious advantages; I hope your new blog works well for you. <br><br>Bob, so noted. I didn't really find a career, either -- it more or less found me. <br><br>Esn, I have no argument with that at all. I can enjoy things written in popcorn style, too -- I just don't choose to write this blog that way. <br><br>Mustard, agreed. The discipline of cutting out extra words is a very good exercise, though it can be taken to unhelpful extremes, and I also use proofreaders when I can.<br><br><a href=#c4153948326332126923 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 11:37 PM</a><br><br>

I like it.<br><br>PatriciaT, delighted to hear it. I encourage everyone who lives within range of an independent bookstore to buy your books there -- it keeps income in your community, and bookstores that get requests routinely order an extra copy for the shelf, so that your favorite authors get a shot at more sales. <br><br>RepubAnon, there are scores of stories like that. I wonder how often the teachers succeed in crushing an aspiring talent; based on what I've seen and heard, it's a fairly common thing. <br><br>Val, you're most welcome. <br><br>Lisa, a lot depends on who you have to cope with. As a professional writer, I do have to pay attention to where punctuation goes, keep passive voice under strict control, and the like, but that's because I'm going to have a copy editor going over my manuscript and messing with things. If you don't have to worry about that -- why, it's only been a couple of hundred years since spelling and punctuation first started being standardized at all, and I suspect we're on our way back out of that...<br><br>Pantagruel, nah, they're the ones who end up suffering from the occasional scorch mark!<br><br>Patricia, oh, I get that. I have to get past editors' fixations and hangups all the time -- though fortunately I've never had to put up with an agent; there are a lot of genres where they are neither necessary nor useful. Still, it's amazing what you can slide past editors so long as they think they're getting what they want! <br><br>Mike, oh, I know. I like ornate prose, and yes, that's going to sound forced to some people. As for your friends, I wonder if it's ever occurred to them that I write at this kind of length partly to keep the shallow-minded from reading my stuff and flattening out my ideas into twitter bait...<br><br>Michelle, yep. You escaped a dire fate. I bet you can still write, too!<br><br>M Smith, not to worry. I don't influence easily. ;-)<br><br>Carlos, I'd seriously recommend that you try writing with the screen turned off. Don't let yourself see what you're writing, and keep at it for 15 minutes a day. That's how I broke myself out of incipient writer's block some 25 years ago, and I've never looked back. <br><br>Foodnstuff, in that case, don't worry about writing courses. Just keep writing, try to make each post as good as it can be, and pay attention to how writing you enjoy handles the language, and you'll do well.<br><br><a href=#c2773696159873767257 title="comment permalink">1/4/17, 11:53 PM</a><br><br>

It's a manual of clear readable expository English prose, not a guide to creative literature; you learn its rules, and then you head out into the unknown region. <br><br>Weedananda, yes, I noted the same thing. Despite the loud self-praise, the commentwasn't exactly a sterling recommendation for its author's services.<br><br>Greg, what I've read of the so-called "secret space program" et al. seems very unconvincing to me. Still, you've raised a very interesting point: even if we had all these wonder technologies, would they produce Utopia, or would they yield an even bigger mess than the one we've got already? Thanks for posing that; I'll consider a post on the subject. <br><br>Clay, oh, granted. Another reason to read stuff written before you were born! <br><br>MawKernewek, one of the things I've found most interesting is that I've built a career and an audience by systematically breaking every rule that you're supposed to follow to market yourself on the internet. I don't post daily; I don't write short snappy posts; I don't obsessively get involved in every case of contagious mental hiccups to come lurching through the internet; I don't include cute kitten photos; I write long, involved, ornate posts on abstruse and unpopular subjects and publish books that are even more esoteric -- and yet I'm doing rather better than okay, while a lot of people who are following the rules are spinning their wheels. In the immortal words of Harriet the Hamster Princess, "Who made these rules anyway?"<br><br>Heather, you'll never hear either claim from me. Teaching is fiendishly difficult work, harder even than writing. <br><br>Cortes, you're welcome and thank you. I don't think I've encountered Lynch -- but then I more or less abandoned current fantasy fiction a while ago, after one too many canned Dark Lords et al. <br><br>Matt, I hope it helps! As for the <i>Retrotopia</i> cover, there were cars in Toledo in the episodes posted here, just not many of them; I like the juxtaposition of the car, the electric trolley, the horsedrawn cab, and the pedestrians. <br><br>Dennis, it takes a good ear for prose to detect windbaggery. I predict that if you ever decide to give it a try, you'll write good clear prose that zooms straight down into the nitty gritty and leaves the reader knowing something real. <br><br>Izzy, I routinely got told that I wasn't working to my potential, too, and I smiled and thought, "Like I'm going to waste my potential following orders from you?" But then I used to write fiction in dull classes, and the teachers thought I was taking really detailed notes and gave me better grades than I deserved.<br><br><a href=#c7641982649923380033 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 12:10 AM</a><br><br>

If you write like everybody else, yes, you write like everybody else, and that has exactly the consequence you've sketched out. I doubt anybody else in the world writes like me, which helps avoid such confusions. <br><br>Dylan, one of the basic job skills mages learn is that of telling your secrets right out there in public, knowing full well that the only people who will pay attention are the ones who are ready to learn. Speaking of which, thank you for the Latin note! <br><br>North Coast, thank you. <br><br>Robert, I love ts; dr! I feel that way about a lot of writing -- and yes, I've also experienced lectures like the one you describe. I took to using the phrase "Grok the shallowness" on such occasions...<br><br>Deborah, and what on earth is wrong with cascades of verbs and gerunds? ;-)<br><br>Notes, please pass on my thanks to your father. That's a high compliment. <br><br>Robo, different writers thrive on different technologies. I know people who are at their best when they do the first draft in ink on notebook paper. I'm embarrassed to say that word processors are actually good for me; I like to revise dozens of times, trying out different phrasings and vocabulary, and the word processor makes that so much less trying that my prose comes out better. If you find that a typewriter is your best friend, though, go ye forth and do that thing. <br><br>Toomas, you're welcome and thank you. Then, of course, once you've learned to trim out the fancy words, it's time to try putting some of them back in, and play deliberately with the effect! <br><br>PatOrmsby, glad to be of service. I'll be interested to hear about your dream. <br><br>LordyBurd, gosh, I'm sure I don't know. ;-)<br><br>Berserker, some people can do that, especially after lots of practice.

There are tons of rules for visual art. Teachers teach the rules slavishly but they don't punish you for breaking them skillfully, because the history of art is the history of rules being systematically established and then broken. When you study art, you learn that you can't break a rule until you understand what it's for. Once you understand the rule, you can break it freely because you will naturally break it in a skillful way, by addressing the problem the rule solves in a completely different way, or by using the broken rule as its own element. You can't just run around breaking rules willy nilly! I would argue you don't really understand the rule until you've found a way to break it with skill. Ultimately, it comes down to the question "What is the purpose of this rule? What is it accomplishing?" It's unfortunate that writing has become so rigidly enforced while the visual arts have gone off on quite the opposite sort of tangent. <br><br>Thanks again for a fascinating read!<br>Sincerely,<br><br>Jessi Thompson<br>anotheramethyst<br><br><a href=#c3154783062901925572 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 12:35 AM</a><br><br>

A mate of mine recommended your blog to me many long years ago now (last decade actually – can you believe it is 2017? Far out!) when I was in the very early days of my adventure, and I have enjoyed your writing ever since. I like the way that you cover complex ground by attacking the edges of ideas, circling around and looking for the weaknesses or the inconsistencies, or to be really honest, the total absurdities. And there have been a few of those over the years that you've highlighted, hasn't there? :-)! Did you know that nature works that way too? Perhaps this is why the rats are now enjoying all of my fresh strawberries! Woe is me, I knew the strawberry enclosure required a complete rebuild over the next year. Of course, you gifted us with that tool too by carrying us all along for the ride, and it is a very useful tool indeed! I don’t believe that any other method available on the interweb would have achieved the same result?<br><br>My English teacher in the final year of High School thought that I was too arrogant and perhaps he was correct. But I'll tell ya this, I used to get quite narky about creative essays because he'd ask for one. I'd write one – oh yeah, it was creative alright - and then he'd say to me that is worth a D which is a mark just above fail. Not quite a fail, but you can smell failure from there. And then, me being me, I'd ask him, alright how did you mark this creative essay, because it was creative – that is what you asked for. And then inevitably after a grumpy session, I'd end up in detention for being a smarty pants and questioning the authorita! English was my worst subject in High School, everything else I got A's for... Go figure that one out.<br><br>I was considering the limits of the internet last week in the comments section. I can work with people either individually or in groups when it is face to face and the people have dysfunctional behaviours or chronic misconceptions, but this internet thing where all there is are words is a very limited medium. I was toying with that concept last week. I haven’t given up trying but it does seem to be rather a waste of time.<br><br>Hey, how good is a skill mage? Did you just make that up? Oooo, I really like it. I don't have any secrets as I tell everyone everything and that saves me a whole lot of problems! ;-)!<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1160081382012133345 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 1:27 AM</a><br><br>

I now start out by laying out all the discrete thoughts, facts and theories that I want to convey, as well as references, in bullet-point form in a .txt file, not worrying at all about style, but only about conciseness - with a new line for each new thought. As I do more research, I gradually edit the file to add new things (so I don't forget them), fix any old ones that need fixing, and rearrange bits as I get a clearer idea for how everything fits together architecturally - what should come first, what is a logical subcategory of what, etc.<br><br>Only once I see that the skeleton is all there and is coherent do I begin to place the points into actual sentences and paragraphs and make everything pleasant to read. If I wrote them well, they usually don't need much editing, only some "glue". The hard work feels like it has already been completed and I can go more-or-less on autopilot. Once I started doing this, I noticed that writer's block became a thing of the past.<br><br>It is possible that the technique has other negative effects that will become clearer to me with time, though. It's also possible that it's applicable more to research papers than to other sorts of writing.<br><br>So, is this a way to avoid writer's block by using completely the opposite advice to the one you gave? Well, not exactly, I think. Both of them separate the editing process from the rough idea-forming process. I used to try writing pretty sentences before I had completely figured out where I wanted to go, and THAT was a real recipe for constant writer's block.<br><br>This method is also used by some good music composers. For example, here's a quote from John Corigliano: "For the past three decades I have started the compositional process by building a shape, an architecture, before coming up with any musical material".<br><br><a href=#c2525506689360080436 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 1:58 AM</a><br><br>

In the course of business, stuff goes wrong and in order to get things fixed, I perfected the ICBE, or Inter-Continental Ballistic E-mail. Days to prepare, nuanced to the finest degree leaving the recipients with one inescapable conclusion: YOU ARE WRONG AND YOU WILL FIX IT.<br><br>Worked every time – problem solved in record time and my customers happy. Even the suppliers happy because they knew we cared enough to tell them.<br><br>Then we sold our company and I got a job with a multinational, with the regional office based in Singapore and I got projects all over the Asia-Pacific. I still used the ICBE extensively, but to no effect. Nothing happened. <br><br>Finally one of my Singaporean colleagues told me that, no, he never read more than the first paragraph of my missives, because the language was “too flowery”.<br><br>I eventually figured out that the language in use across the company was not English at all, but a simplified, dumbed down version that I used to refer to as “Tradelish”.

It was just this week that I decided, frustrated with my current jobhunting attempts, that I would return to my writing, a) because I've received good reception in the past and b) because if I manage to get paid for it then I'll have a far more enjoyable career than anything that needs me to work for someone else for 40+ hours a week.<br>The main thing I'm trying to write, though not the only thing, is a novel that I had the idea for several years ago. The last time I looked at it, it was during the height of my belief in Tumblr and the constant admonitions there for more diversity, and I got so bogged down in trying to include a diverse cast that I ended up barely writing anything for fear of portraying the minority characters I'd included incorrectly. This time, I've started afresh, and I'm just writing it, and I'll sort out the errors after I've finished- exactly the remedy you've suggested. If and when I eventually finish it, it'll be of the "hidden magical society in a modern day Earth setting" genre, though admittedly it is definitely fictional magic and not real magic. It's the best idea I've got at the moment for a longer piece, so hopefully this time I'll be able to finish it before I get bogged down with editing in some way.<br>The other thing I was considering writing was a Star Wars fanfic set post-RotJ that centred on Luke Skywalker and fit with Lucas' canon but not the EU or the new Disney films, but I think I've got myself some writer's block on that one right now...<br>I'd like to try finding opportunities to write shorter pieces that people might pay me for, too, but only if it won't take my ability to write eloquently in longer and more original prose from me.<br>Thank you for a very useful and timely post,<br>L.<br><br><a href=#c9182610611354450130 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 3:12 AM</a><br><br>

Your critic would choke, turn purple, and die if he were to read Faulkner's soliloquy in "The Sound And The Fury", I predict.<br><br>As for my own writing, I write everything in longhand, and get it all out before I edit it for grammar errors, spelling, and the like. Back in law school, for my research and writing project, I was assigned 50 pages on the meaning of the word "blight" by my Property professor. I let it hang fire for a couple of months, then took three hours to draft up an outline and then did a week's worth of research (and copying) in the law library. I took the whole mess home and then cranked out 250 pages on five legal pads in two weeks - at one fell swoop - after organizing the case law according to the outline. Luckily, a friend had a secretary who typed it up at no cost to me, and we went through a few cycles of corrections. The completed typescript ended up on the professor's desk - 150 pages long. I didn't redraft it, just handed him the first draft. He gave it a "pass" grade, and sent it to Prof. Dale Whitman, who wrote the standard hornbook in the field of Property Law, and who was editor of the ABA Journal on Real Property, Probate, and Trust. I was somewhat surprised when I got a call from Prof. Whitman asking to publish it - and after about a year or so, it appeared as an 89-page monograph on the subject in that journal. Two years later, SCOTUS handed down the Kelo decision, which totally changed the playing field, and made the monograph irrelevant. Sic transit gloria mundi.<br><br>And that's how I've written everything else I've ever published - all non-fiction, of course. Think about it for a while, maybe a long while, draft up a quick outline, do the research, organize the research, crank out a first draft, and submit it. I've thought of writing fiction and may well do so, I've got a lot of legal pads which could use some use other than collecting dust and serving as food for mice. <br><br>And I never got more than a "C" in high school English classes, or published any articles in any school papers, although I gave them first refusal for pieces which ended up in the underground press - "too controversial, couldn't possibly print that." And the cherry on top was the advice from the high school guidance counselor not to attempt college. After a PhD and JD, I beg to differ...<br><br><a href=#c1082163443436076528 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 3:14 AM</a><br><br>

My family immigrated here in the mid-1990s. The Iraq war (and the MSM drum-beat for conflict leading up to it) made me distrust American mainstream news and right-wing politicians. The Ukraine conflict of two years ago "finished the job", making me distrust the entire American and Canadian political spectrum (with the very tentative exception of the local Green Parties), as well as all Canadian mainstream news for any non-local issues. I have a friend who came from Odessa, who kept in touch with family back home as this was all going on, and I had access to Russian-language news channels which broadcast terrible footage from the cities being bombarded with air strikes and artillery, of elderly women crying as they lost their homes and children, while the CBC talking heads serenely debated on the best way to punish Putin for his aggression, instead of talking about how to bring peace. To say that it left a bad taste is an understatement; it became absolutely clear that the country I live and grew up in will forever oppose the country I was born in, and that this never had anything to do with human rights or with the ideological battle against communism.<br><br>But none of us are going to publicly protest because it has been made quite clear in Canada that it is a taboo subject. If not even Elizabeth May will speak about it, if the local Toronto Russian-language news show carefully avoids showing any footage from Ukraine at all for months and months, while the Ukrainian-language one reports the war from an entirely pro-Maidan viewpoint... it is a taboo subject. With that said, I have been grateful to discover that not all of the locals here buy the official narrative with regard to how evil Russians are. (although there are the others - like the guy who was gleeful when the price of oil collapsed because "that'll show those Russians!", even though it also meant that Canada's economy would collapse as well)<br><br>(continued...)<br><br><a href=#c4370399962417122923 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 3:50 AM</a><br><br>

In your blog, you mentioned some Wikipedia articles; I helped write some of those. I have no doubt that the Russian state indeed pays people to influence social media. The key, though, is that everyone else does this as well. Companies. Toronto mayoral campaigns. Federal parties. Other countries (I'm sure more exist that were better-hidden): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_Internet_propaganda You never know on the internet whether you're dealing with someone genuine. I think the paid trolls are probably more likely to be boring and cookie-cutter (since they're not paid to write well or soulfully), and I see THOSE types on all sides on any given political issue. Pay attention to the newspaper comment sections around election time. <br><br>Some of the paid opinion-pushers are veteran Wikipedia editors whose job is to keep Wikipedia pro-NATO. (I suspect)<br><br>Alternative voices (and, for that matter, mainstream Russian voices) very rarely get invited to mainstream news channels here. The MSM need to justify that. One idea seems to be that even talking to or debating with "those people" risks "legitimizing" them, and we can't have that. But it's even better to label them Russian agents. Almost the only Russians that I've ever seen get invited to CBC (or TVO) are dissidents who have minimal support in Russia itself. Other times, the talking heads interpret "what Putin must be thinking".<br><br>By contrast, Russian state television every night hosts raucous debate shows in which Russian mainstream and slightly-less-mainstream politicians and pundits debate pro-Maidan Ukrainian, American and EU pundits. The Russians aren't afraid to give them air, because they routinely demolish their arguments. Here's a pretty accurate write-up:<br>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gilbert-doctorow/press-freedom-in-russia-t_b_10103054.html<br>I think the reason for the comparative lack of fair debate in Canada is that the local MSM is afraid that they would too often lose. I see the same rationale in the Washington Post's (PropOrNot's) attempt to label a whole swathe of alternative media (some of which, like antiwar.com, have been around since 1995) as "Russian agents": it is a way to avoid debating them.<br><br>We already know according to a bestselling book by former mainstream German journalist Udo Ulfkotte that the CIA heavily influences the MSM there: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-03-28/top-german-journalist-admits-mainstream-media-completely-fake-we-all-lie-cia <br>As you dig for evidence of Russian influence, don't forget that the Russians are not the only ones trying to put ideas into your head, and that perhaps not all of those ideas are bad ones. I think some in the alternative media (including JMG) have recognized that. Russians are people too, and Russia unlike the US has a no-first-strike nuclear policy.<br><br><a href=#c2793239534636489853 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 3:51 AM</a><br><br>

It makes me slow down a bit, taking my time to understand your points. I'm reading a lot in English; your articles are about the only place where I regularly encounter words I have to look up.

Of course that isn't zeitgeisty, but this whole blog is largely about what's wrong with the zeitgeist anyway.<br><br>As for past and present - I guess the conventional wisdom is that the past formed the present in terms of more or less linear causality. But actually, the present also forms the past by attaching meaning and interpretation to what happened, and of course by selection bias. History is constantly being rewritten to accomodate the present perspective.

Why should there be a standard way of writing on the net which did not even exist not that long ago is just plain weird.

I live in England where the days are very short in winter and the sunlight feeble. There are many, many people my colour or paler. If I travel to sunny countries I have to hide in the shade or I get burnt. I know many people who have had lots of cancerous moles and freckles cut out of their previously burned skin. People die. <br>The immigrants arriving here are either brown or black. I've learned that vitamin D does not get absorbed so easily by darker skin. If you look at a map of the world you can match sunlight to skin darkness of the indigenous population. The human race adapted or died -- either be getting scurvy or by getting cancer. I've read too that this happened pretty quickly -- 20K years or so from black African to lily-white Brit. <br>Another thing I've read is that lack of Vitamin D has been linked to psychosis.

I spent an embarrassing amount of my own adulthood to this point seeking advice on how to tackle whatever endeavor I was tackling. Not that seeking advice is a bad habit on its own. It certainly beats stumbling blindly through a dark room without the thought to look for a light switch. But as you have noted, the opposite of a bad thing is often another bad thing. And letting others frame the way in which I attempt something new has been the opposite bad thing I have repeatedly fallen victim to.<br><br>It seems painfully obvious when one thinks about it that no one can give foolproof advice in a world awash with variables. And yet, when I trust a person on a given subject, I have the tendency to use their advice as the solution, without bothering to critically analyze their assumptions and experiences, reworking as necessary to suit my own conditions. I wonder if this isn't a significant part of the reason lots of folks struggle to see how to collapse in place. When we imagine what actions can be taken, we draw from what we have seen others do/say, and often try to replicate them. With practice (read: failure), I have embraced the "ex-ducere" approach to expert advice, but it is an endless and uncertificated training, to be sure.<br><br><a href=#c127913255610156018 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 7:36 AM</a><br><br>

I loved to read and write as a child, but most of the experience that has helped me become a better reader and writer occurred outside of school, with a few exceptions. I find it ironic that in high school, despite being a book-lover and aspiring writer, English was my hardest class. I sometimes would get C's as my semester grades. I had little intrinsic motivation to write those 5-paragraph essays with a thesis more or less decided by the teacher. This resulted in a great deal of stress and lowered my self-image at the time. Yet during those years, I spent significant amounts of free time writing in personal journals, also poetry and fiction and long letters. Reading some of my early writing now, I'm embarrassed by the quality, but unlike a well-written 5-paragraph essay by a teacher's standard, this personal writing did at least have my voice in it....so it was my own... and I was discovering what was on my mind, what I wanted to say, what was meaningful and interesting to me, which I rarely could do in school.<br><br>I also tended to do poorly on reading comprehension multiple choice tests. Even though I had read the assigned novel, I often couldn't remember extraneous details asked -- What meal did such-and-such character eat at a certain time? etc. I found that the way I read in my non-school life was very different than the way I had to read for English class to be tested on my comprehension. When I read out of my own intrinsic motivation, I read for meaning, to reflect on the material and how it resonates (or not) with my own life and worldview, etc. When I had to read for a multiple choice reading comprehension test, I was trying to remember all the details in the story, at the expense of more deeply exploring the story and reflecting on it.<br><br>The best thing I've done as an adult to help revive my love of reading and writing, is to stay out of school since I graduated from college in 2001. Since I actually have time (instead of a weight of assignments I don't want to do), I have read far more books than I was able to when was in school, books that I get to choose, and I can read and reflect on them the way I want. Still, there are moments when I feel I haven't fully recovered from my school experience. I have to thank you, JMG, for the gift of your high-quality writing (both you books and your weekly essays) and also for encouraging my own writing (via the anthologies and in more broader realms).<br><br><a href=#c5683688695001590026 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 8:21 AM</a><br><br>

It appears that this is happening and forcing the government to abandon the subsidization of fuel in the country. This is causing riots and unrest. The mainstream media misses the point that this is what happens when the oil and the revenues from it stop flowing. I am afraid that Mexico will now be on a rapid slide to the same condition as other countries who's oil production peaked and skidded downhill such as Egypt or Syria.

Since there's very little moderation and active subversion committed against us by state-level actors, the way we write on /pol/ is of the utmost importance, in a way that might exceed any other platform. So we enforce our own peculiar style vigorously, some might even say sadistically. We also occasionally get people stopping by trying to change our writing style by fiat. Operational Google is a good example of that. They invariably get told, rather less politely than you have here, to stuff it.<br><br><a href=#c3913279119459601805 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 10:12 AM</a><br><br>

I have a need to search out anything an enquiring eight year old daughter might enjoy and benefit from reading. Ransome was born in 1887, and these novels as well as being fun to read are full of details which I think might be interesting to many students of de-industrial living conditions: children routinely eat offal (such as tongue sandwiches); milk needs to be collected fresh daily from small family farms; family catering with no fridges; professional pre-industrial eel trapping and charcoal production; clothes must be mended when torn; and technical details of sailing boats and their construction as well as traces of the then-passing sail-based international trade economy. <br><br>I have only realized since re-reading that Ransome studied and wrote about story-telling for years before he started on these novels. To my taste they are beautifully written and full of a quiet stoic wisdom as well as appropriate peril, and interesting details of daily life in England in the early part of the last century (and hundreds of sailing terms I'd not come across elsewhere). I am sure they are not to everyone's taste, but I see them as classic children's novels. I am beginning to study the prose in just the way you recommend, working out why I like them so much, and looking forward to the conversations with daughter about what she does and doesn't like about the writing if she get stuck into them.<br><br><a href=#c3545066875033171243 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 10:13 AM</a><br><br>

I worked for 25 years in public broadcasting, published hundreds of music reviews in major magazines, authored and edited books, and studied creative writing from a Pen Faulkner prize winning novelist. Etcetera, etcetera, blah, blah, blah.<br><br>I now toil in the world of internet commerce, and much of the advice you received about writing for the internet would have more accurately been labeled as writing for search engines. Yes, friends, Google now determines the quality of much of what we read online. The idea, of course, is that by “optimizing” your “content” (we used to call that “writing”) the search engines will rank it higher on relevant keyword searches. This brings you more eyeballs and, theoretically, higher profits. The brilliance of your prose is irrelevant. <br><br>The software that we use to optimize our content relies on an insidious scheme called the Flesch Reading Ease Readability Formula, which is widely used to assign grade levels to someone's prose. This employs a mathematical formula that multiplies the average number of words in each sentence by a factor of .39, the average number of syllables per word by 11.8, then adds the two results together and subtracts 15.59 to give you the magic answer. If the formula spits out 5, the writing is at a fifth grade level. My training says that 5 is a pretty good number when you are writing for an e-commerce web site.<br><br>I've been told that the Flesch formula is embedded in Microsoft Word, but that Word will not give a score higher than 12. Given that 12th grade is the new 8th grade, you can see where we're headed.<br><br>Proust and Thomas Mann would get pretty dismal Flesch scores. I am sure the Archdruid Report wouldn't fare much better.<br><br>I have to take issue with your condemnation of the Mrs. McNitpicks out there, however. I have found that the level of writing skill among American high school students is so low that, in my opinion, we need more Mrs. McNitpicks, not fewer. I was fortunate enough to attend public high school in the era before anyone gave a damn about self esteem, and my academic path led through the classroom of a woman who would be anyone's Hollywood central casting example of a Mrs. McNitpick – thin, wan, brutally honest, serious to a fault. She struck fear in every student, and I struggled to earn a B from her. She also turned out thousands of students who could write solid, serviceable American English prose. Strunk &amp; White was our textbook.<br><br>You also mention speaking in your essay, which is also something rarely taught anymore in American schools. The idea that someone should learn to express themselves verbally in a clear, pleasant, well-modulated voice is a thing of the past (check your local TV newscast, or pick any YouTube video at random if you need proof). I am sure telling a young person that they need to work on their diction would crush their self esteem. <br><br>I don't mean to sound like an old fart yelling at the kids to get off his lawn. But I adhere to the notion that people need to learn the rules before creatively smashing and rearranging them. Unless the Flesch formula is involved!<br><br><a href=#c6824516304475610444 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 10:31 AM</a><br><br>

In fact, the style your erstwhile critic was advocating would do your subjects great disservice; you take on complex issues with long histories behind them, and such issues cannot even begin to be unraveled in a half-dozen bullet points. Each week I am impressed by the care with which you construct your arguments and by the breadth of your knowledge. I was expecting Madmagic to finish by posting a link to his “How to Write for the Internet and Earn $$$” subscription website; it certainly smelled like that kind of phishing come-on to me.<br><br>As for your writing advice, many times YES. I got my BA in Creative Writing in the 1990s (I also have half an MFA, obtained before I came to my senses). We were taught to free-write first and edit afterwards, and my professor heavily emphasized the importance of learning the rules/forms, then breaking them as necessary to serve the work. Everything I’ve learned about writing then or since has been about what does or does not serve the work. Oh, and the bit about editing before you’ve finished? From experience I can tell you all, it’s death. Reminds me, I should dig out that story again, if I can reconstruct my original plan…<br><br>I think the most important point is the one on reading broadly. It’s depressingly easy to spot the writers who only read what’s been published within their subgenre in the last decade. It’s just as easy to spot the LitFic writers who have only read the handful of critically-approved genre authors but figure it’s an easy way to make a few bucks while showing the ghetto-dwellers what good writing is (“Tropes? They have tropes? Eh, it's not like they'll notice.”). Neither approach produces interesting ideas, absorbing plots, and memorable characters all at once, which of course is the minimum I require of a story. <br><br>Oh, and as for those 13-year-olds you mentioned in your reply to Jason, yeah, I’ve probably already read some of their slash fanfics...<br><br><a href=#c6223215988387027095 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 11:23 AM</a><br><br>

I'm not saying it's actually similar (which would be, I suspect, impossible for me to judge objectively), but that something about it made it seem that way to me. Which made me very appreciative of your and other commenters' responses to the suggestion that such a style is unsuitable for, or obsolete in, the world of Internet discourse.<br><br>Part of my writing process is that only about a third of what I write, including "simple" things like blog comments and forum posts, ever gets posted (or otherwise distributed). The rest is not so much scrapped as put on a permanent (and necessarily large) back burner, whence it often re-emerges in an evolved form. That is to say, I don't set out to re-write it, but it will likely influence something I write later that's much closer to what I subsequently figured out was what I wanted to say in the first place. In summary, how I write is hardly distinguishable from how I think.<br><br>One drawback is that it can be (though it isn't always) a slow process. For instance, last week's trivial comment about a <i>Bored of the Rings</i> reference was all that made the cut, of several paragraphs about my predictions for the new year. Since then I've worked out what I actually wanted to say about such predictions, but a week late to be timely or on topic.<br><br><a href=#c8509554760075921311 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 11:26 AM</a><br><br>

Hadn't run across that take on it, before. Some one mentioned Stephen King's "On Writing". I reread it, every couple of years. A couple of things that King does, that has been mentioned here is, he usually does a first draft and then throws it in a drawer for six months. The goes back to it. He also recommends hacking out at least 30% of whatever is initially written.<br><br>A writer finding their voice was also mentioned. It's funny. I wrote a series of book reviews for a local newspaper. About 50 in a year. I reread some of them now and ask, "Did I write that?" Thinking back on the act of writing, even my posture and attitude changed when I was working on a piece. I'd sit of straighter, the eyebrow would go up and I had this feeling of ... taking an overview? It was a very odd feeling. Like I had plugged into "something" else.<br><br>The topic of genre was touched on. If you look at a library record, way down at the bottom there's usually a list of what subject or genre the book was classified under. Click it, and it will list all the other books in the system that relate. Trying this with our local system, I discovered that a certain author wrote something called "Long Descent." :-). That's subject was "Regression (Civilization). "Dystopian Fiction" in my system yields 235 entries. Doesn't seem to be much happening in "Dystopian Nonfiction." :-). Cataloging, in general, is pretty much of a mess, right now.<br><br>It used to be if you went into a library, and said something like "I read a book and liked it and would like to read similar books" you could usually expect the librarian to come up with some suggestions. There were also reference books to consult. There may be a few old copies kicking around your library. Most of the youngsters rely on online sources, these days. If you search "Genreflecting" or "Book Recommendation Services" things pop up. Your mileage may vary. <br><br>Amazon, for all it's many faults can be useful in hunting up "like" books. Their people who bought this, also bought that ... and the "you may be interested in..." are occasionally useful.<br><br>About a year ago, I seem to remember we had a bit of a conversation, here, about a newish subject area or genre. Climate change / ecological fiction? There was even a web site, as I remember. Lew<br><br><a href=#c2754916438440986109 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 12:33 PM</a><br><br>

For a non fiction piece like my monthly column about birds published in a local paper (a PAYING GIG!!!! woo hoo!) I select a topic and mull over it in my head a bit. Then I sit outside or in some other comfortable place with a pencil and a piece of paper, and scrawl out an outline consisting of sentence fragments. I let that rest, then a day or so later I sit at the computer and flesh the fragments out. At that point I check the length, and make several more passes through making sure it flows, the vocabulary is right for the target audience, and general readability. Then I sleep on it, make a final pass through, and send it off.<br><br>For more storytelling prose, I sit at the computer and tell it the story. Right through from beginning to end. Then I save,close, and do something else. I then revisit it many times, but whenever I find myself getting in storytelling mode for another section, an expansion, an alternative version, I just let the flow go til it runs out, save, and close again.<br><br><a href=#c363231325846414088 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 12:38 PM</a><br><br>

These things impeded creativity. I asked, "okay, but how does he learn those rules?" "Oh, that comes later," replied his teachers. Only, "later" never came.

As a journalist, I can vouch that no one should aspire to a single ideal template of writing – nor have I ever heard a professional recommend doing so. When you start writing for a newspaper you learn the inverted pyramid style; it gets all the vital information in the first sentence or two and spends the lower paragraphs on quotes and details, so you can trim from the bottom up. No journalist, though, would use that style on a feature article, designed to have a satisfying flow. Nor would anyone use it on a long non-fiction short story like “Myths Over Miami,” which you cited here some months ago, with its twist near the end. <br><br>Few rules about writing are absolute. Good writing tends to follow certain guidelines – active voice, action verbs, punchy sentences – and I’d like to see more people learn them. Thing is, we all break them as well, and we should - you no more often than any good writer. And even when a hundred writers follow them closely, they can each discover their own style and voice. <br><br>Sometimes you ignore them wholesale; William Golding, in his novel The Inheritors, uses many stative verbs and passive voices to create an alien yet haunting narrative voice. Eventually I realised he was writing from the perspective of Neanderthals; later, the point-of-view shifts to Cro-Magnons, and I felt a sudden shock at the shift in style. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c2617535786201507493 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 2:20 PM</a><br><br>

From personal experience, I can say that it's darn difficult not to edit while writing. For me, the temptation comes because I will write something with a fair amount of ease and fluidity but then, returning to it weeks or months later, find that I hate every bit of it. This leads me to toss the whole thing and, upon reflection, feel that--if I'd been more critical and deliberate during composition--I'd have crafted something worth keeping. But, as you've pointed out, attempting to do that leads to blockage. <br><br>And I, for one, enjoy your writing style very much, even if you overuse the phrase "source of wry amusement" a tad :)<br><br><a href=#c235004364726411708 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 4:55 PM</a><br><br>

I must disagree with your generous self-grading however. How about 0/5? Here is the problem: the whole article is based on the idea that “something” has been disclosed: “… list … discloses Kremlin efforts”. But propornot doesn’t disclose anything at all. It provides no evidence about any of the sites. None at all. It even admits that it has no evidence of any actual connections to Russia. They actually TELL YOU THIS, although the original Washington Post article was designed to make it seem there was some evidence of something, by relying on an anonymous sources who provided zero evidence.<br><br>This is what propornot ACTUALLY TELLS YOU:<br><br>“We are happy to remove any outlet whose operators understand how Putin's Russia is a brutal authoritarian kleptocracy that uses "fake news" as online propaganda, and resolves to help do something about it. For example, any outlet that has used a lot of Russia Today and Sputnik News content, but resolves to stop doing so, is going to be removed from this list. “<br><br>For example, they listed CounterPunch as a Kremlin stooge. Did they have any actual basis for this? Well, no, because when CounterPunch spoke to them:<br><br>“CounterPunch’s Joshua Frank spotlighted the amateurish, bush-league nature of PropOrNot, after pointing out to the group’s representative CounterPunch’s history of criticizing Russia, upon which it was promptly removed from PropOrNot’s list of propaganda pushers. Revealingly, PropOrNot indicated to Frank that they would also consider removing other progressive media sources from the list if representatives of those outlets contacted them to complain.  It’s nice to know PropOrNot has such impeccable investigative standards for identifying propaganda.”<br><br>http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/12/06/post-fact-politics-reviewing-the-history-of-fake-news-and-propaganda/<br><br>So, to be clear, their list is based on no actual evidence, merely whether they like you or not or, failing that, whether you agree to stop citing RT. Notice that they don’t care whether any particular RT article is true, which is irrelevant for them. The reason truth is irrelevant for them is simple: to answer their own question, “is it propaganda or not”, well, yes, propornot.com is pure propaganda. <br><br>They even give you a hint for where their motives might lie: the FAQ mentions they include Ukrainian-Americans and propornot were tweeting Ukrainian fascist slogans shortly before they were catapulted into the spotlight by the WashPost:<br><br>https://twitter.com/propornot/status/799314450893438976<br><br>See discussion here by a US journalist Mark Ames who was booted out of Russian by Putin:<br><br>"“One PropOrNot tweet, dated November 17, invokes a 1940s Ukrainian fascist salute “Heroism Slava!”<br><br>http://www.alternet.org/media/anonymous-blacklist-promoted-washington-post-has-shocking-roots-ukrainian-fascism-eugenics-and<br><br><a href=#c5438403980259757337 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 5:05 PM</a><br><br>

If you are uncertain of a passage in your writing, or if it's a relatively short piece, read it aloud. No audience necessary. Just read it aloud, and certain classes of grammatical, stylistic, and structural errors will become screamingly apparent. It's almost magical!<br><br>Many of us will know that there comes a time in editing that you are so close to your work that you simply can't see even relatively simple screw-ups. Reading aloud takes care of that, and many other miscues.<br><br>While I'm here, JMG, let me add my voice to the chorus of those who really, really appreciate your writing style. I mean, the subjects you write about are often things I am thinking about anyway, so I'm already hooked. And it is greatly rewarding to agree and disagree and engage with your writing. I always have to think (hey, it hardly hurts at all!) and learn. But I have to say, the way that you write makes getting there half the fun! And so, many many thanks! I would ask you to please not change your writing style, except I'm not at all worried that you might ;-)<br><br><br><br><a href=#c7532262267700368118 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 5:16 PM</a><br><br>

On the other hand, the accelerating crapification of consumer products is reaching the point at which people are starting to really notice it, so maybe this time around the awareness will stick. <br><br>Jessi, I'm glad the visual arts remember that. There have been times -- the heyday of academic art in the 19th century was one of them -- when art was just as rigidly confined by rules as writing is today, just as there have been times when writing teachers grasped the need for flexibility. <br><br>Cherokee, arrogance is underrated! <br><br>Jason, trust me. She's already giggled at it and gone on to something more interesting. <br><br>Tony, thank you! I appreciate the more flowing and leisurely prose style of the nineteenth century a great deal, as you noted. Delighted to hear about the book -- the sort of thing it discusses will be at least as useful in Taiwan as on this side of the Big Pond. <br><br>MawKernewek, oh my. That's every bit as embarrassing as the contemporary US visions of 2010 or so, which were just as far off. Any of my readers who want to insist that present fantasies of the technofuture will inevitably come true should take a good hard look at this sort of thing...<br><br>Esn, in fact you're following my advice the other way around -- editing first, and then writing. If it works for you, by all means! <br><br>Les, that's a great story. I'm sorry to say that you could send your ICBE to most people in America and it would soundly ignored. I've noticed, though, that you're quite correct in your comment -- I have a lot of readers whose native language isn't English, but who have a much better ear for English than I have for French and Latin (my two "second languages"). It's humbling, to be frank. <br><br>L, go ye forth and write that thing! One trick that I find helpful is to remember that a novel doesn't have to be written in the same order it's going to be read. If you get stuck in one scene, jump to another and write that; usually by the time you're done, you'll be able to figure out what needs fixing in the earlier scene. I'm just under 50,000 words into the current novel (book 5 of <i>The Weird of Hali</i>), and the chapters and chunks of chapters that are finished are scattered nearly at random through the entire length of the novel. It really does make things easier. <br><br>Streamfortyseven, that's a great story. I predict that your first fiction bestseller will be titled <i>Blight</i>. (It really is a good title!) If longhand on legal pads is your preferred method of drafting, by all means -- finding out what habits facilitate writing and what habits hinder it is an important step on the road to a writing career.<br><br><a href=#c5501880926887906994 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 7:00 PM</a><br><br>

I, like many other commenters here, do very much appreciate your writing style. I find it long enough to flesh out a thought coherently, very easy-going to follow, and you have a warm, pleasant authorial 'voice' or tone. I like the humour and colloquialisms. Although, I have not adopted it, I also like the word "tolerably". It is a word that evokes a measurement in keeping with your tone. <br><br>I would not pile on to Madmagic or RobM though - It is hard to get one's tone across as intended, and this is one of the drawbacks of writing such short choppy, stilted essays or articles. I choose to give them the benefit of the doubt that they are genuinely trying to help in their way. As was Sunseekernv in his replies to Cherokee. <br><br>I'm not a writer, but am an avid and eclectic reader. I can appreciate a short, to the point essay - where appropriate. I can even appreciate a good snappy tweet, but for deeper, more meaningful ideas, (which I prefer), well, Well Done You! These are fantastic and there is obviously an audience willing and able to read and digest them. I personally think there are more readers out there who would be receptive to such in depth 'long' analyses on many other subjects as well, if given the chance.<br><br><a href=#c5497332715653020497 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 7:22 PM</a><br><br>

I didn't know that essay was available online; now I can tell everybody who wants tips on writing fantasy to read that first. Poul Anderson is a major favorite of mine; his future ice age novel <i>The Winter of the World</i> had a huge impact on my imagination. <br><br>Twilight, thank you. <br><br>Daelach, a very good point -- and timely, too, because next week's post is going to talk about one way the past gets rewritten to fit the preferred narratives of the present. Stay tuned!<br><br>Kevin, I also thought about the old trick that tennis professionals use to mess over each other's playing: you ask the other person exactly where he puts his thumb on the racket handle. That'll usually screw up his playing long enough to win a match. As for Watson's ejaculations, good! Very good. <br><br>Brian, I probably read too much Beowulf as a child. ;-) As for Strunk and White, not that I know of -- I wasn't a fan of E.B. White's children's novels, for that matter. (Joan North, who seems to have been completely forgotten these days, was far more my style.) <br><br>Izzy, as long as you didn't fail your saving role against death by boredom. ;-) Your teacher's metaphor works -- readers on the distaff side may exchange the skirt for a Scotsman's kilt if they wish. As for <i>Innsmouth</i>, I'm glad you liked it! Yes, the romance went fast, but that does happen, especially among people who are facing serious danger -- if you know anybody who remembers the Second World War, you might ask them how often people met and got engaged practically on the spur of the moment when one of them was about to head overseas into combat. The second volume -- <i>Kingsport</i> rather than <i>Arkham</i>, btw; <i>Arkham</i> is the last of the seven books in the heptalogy -- has no romance in it at all; I'll even trail a clue or two here and mention that Jenny Parrish rather than Owen Merrill is the viewpoint character. <br><br>Brian, okay, I just about snorted tea up my nose. Nicely handled! <br><br>Lucretia, trust me, I was laughing hard by the time I finished reading Madmagic's screed. <br><br>Lizzy, of course skin color has health implications, as do many other things. I tend to think that people need to be allowed to make their own health care decisions, though. <br><br>Ryan, oh, granted. "Human see, human do!" Getting past that takes some work. <br><br>Adrian, I'm really sorry to hear that -- and I'm of the opinion that teachers who do things like that ought to be flogged. May I suggest something, though? Consider taking back your own writing ability. You'll have to push past the bitter emotions from that experience, which isn't easy, but regaining the ability to write, and to enjoy the writing process, really is worth doing.<br><br><a href=#c8678835203312857687 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 7:46 PM</a><br><br>

I grew up in a trilingual household, like most Filipinos do. I'd say Tagalog is my first language, but I grew up speaking 2.5 languages. The first two would be Tagalog and English. The "0.5" would be Chavacano, a Spanish creole and the regional language of my father's hometown, which I can understand perfectly but have minor difficulty speaking.<br><br>I work for a small, multinational software development firm, and I've been asked a few times when I learned to speak English. The honest answer is that I grew up with it, such that I was young enough that I don't remember learning it!<br><br>Regarding "Tradelish", my mom is a manager for a small business. Her hobby has been writing for as long as I can remember, which shows in her tendency to use elaborate prose in business correspondence. The office staff notices this and frequently quizzes her on the meaning of this word and that sentence. This led her to start posting the "Word of the Day" on the bulletin board. It was quite the hit in her office!<br><br>People can be as smart or dumb with language as you expect them. Unfortunately, we frequently expect people to speak and write as dumb as the machines they work on, which leads to "Tradelish". For me, the worst has got to be Corporatese, which manages to be both dumb while also being overly complex. Of course, dumb and unnecessarily complex is exactly how the big corporate world thinks and works, so this is no surprise.<br><br><a href=#c5720309557984496915 title="comment permalink">1/5/17, 7:57 PM</a><br><br>

Your daughter is in for a real treat. <br><br>Dudley, it depends on what I'm writing. Some of my nonfiction projects start with a detailed chapter outline and go from there. Others start with a stack of assorted <i>Archdruid Report</i> posts and not much else. My fiction usually starts with a few vividly imagined scenes; once I have some sense of those, I write them, and the rest of the story unfolds around them. That's the kind of writing I like best, because very often I have no more idea what's going on than my viewpoint characters do, and the writing process is a journey of discovery. <br><br>Dammerung, funny.

The structure and general organization of schooling in North America is definitely not an accident, the purpose of the whole structure is to select for those who like following orders, rather than doing things for their own sake.<br><br>I've recently been mulling over the idea that the perfect world would be one of pure irrationality, where everything which is done is done for its own sake, and it seems like the modern order is the exact opposite of that. It has occurred to me that the first types of pure reason, equations, presented to children are cases where one nullifies things in order to solve problems. Although there is nothing wrong with algebra, it seems to me like the perfect outcome of pure rationality is mass suicide.

I feel shy to use expressions such as “I believe” etc when giving my opinion as an individual on the work of teams of professionals—I have a background in pseudo-neutral scientific and technical writing.<br><br>More specifically, the essay I’m having a hard time with is a commentary on a WWF report which brings up the conflict between the economic growth ideology and the biosphere. <br><br>For my analysis I’m using Herman Daly (an economist) and John Cobb’s “For the Common Good: Redirecting the Economy Toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future”. By the way the book, published in 1989, besides analysing what the authors describe as “the fallacies of misplaced concreteness in economics”, is a how-to “collapse before the rush” guide along the same lines you write about ; it also addresses the plight of the American working class who back then were losing jobs to the Mexican maquiladoras. <br><br>I was lucky at school to have a French teacher (I went to school in a French-speaking region) who was very much interested in our writing because he was himself setting out on a writer’s career; it would eventually lead him to obtain the Goncourt prize. <br><br>On another topic, I would be very grateful if you could give me the link or titles of the posts you wrote on monasteries and other intentional communities several years ago. <br><br><br><a href=#c8823959047292848699 title="comment permalink">1/6/17, 12:08 AM</a><br><br>

Bearing is defined as: "heraldic charge or device". Presumptuous is defined in there as: "Arrogance, assurance; taking for granted, thing taken for granted". Haughty is defined there as: "Proud, arrogant; dignified".<br><br>It is interesting that many of the words in that definition have positive connotations and there are far fewer negative connotations than I had first considered. Fascinating, and I always took it to be an insult. Thanks for the correction, I really appreciate that. ;-)!<br><br>There are times that I feel uncertain about the path that I am on and the sacrifices that I have made whilst my peers party on and tell themselves stories of limitlessness. However, those are very rare moments of doubt and they soon pass. And then there are other times that I read books like Overshoot and I know that I have acknowledged and come to terms with, but at the same time have also completely underestimated the sheer scale of the present situation. <br><br>The armchair solar power theorists of last week would do well to pick up a copy of that 1952 Concise Oxford Dictionary - Fourth Edition, because then they may discover that the word courage is defined as: "nerve oneself to a venture".

When you started on the topic of "rules for writing" in this week's post, I thought to myself "There are rules??". I would have loved to have been taught rules of literary writing in high school, as I always felt that there was a right way to do it but I had to guess. Also, each year's new English teacher seemed to have his/her own set of rules. That is why I loved science and math. In those classes, I was given basic rules that had specific answers, which then were a platform for our creativity in problem solving and coming up with novel ways to find out new information.<br>I'll be getting a copy of Strunk and White's soon, to fill in that void in my education.

That theme resonates well with you underlying thesis of “seedbearers for the future”.<br><br>Now as we celebrate day of Three Kings here in Finland, I would like to share this amazing folk tradition from my home country with you. Tradition which has survived almost unchanged five hundred tears, even when faced with official condemnation.<br><br>Finland was converted into Catholicism during 12th and 13th century, with series of crusades. These crusades subjugated original tribal kingdoms into semi-civilized border area between Eastern and Western Church. As liturgies in Finland were held with Latin, priests attached mystery plays into church ceremonies, to educate Finns about one true faith. So, during Middle Ages, “star boys” held mystery play about Three Kings paying homage to Lord born into stable. These plays were apparently very popular.<br><br>When Reformation came and Finland was converted into Protestantism, these mystery plays were banned. From the point view of Crown, the matter was resolved after that. Yet, tradition persisted. From 16th century onwards, at the countryside, people wandered from farm to farm, playing this familiar mystery play in folk version. After the play, actors/singers were rewarded with food and gifts. The Crown banned this practice many times, at least in years 1655 and 1797 hefty fines were ordered for anyone acting/singing this mystery play. And fines were really hefty, meant to cripple even middle-income family.<br><br>In spite of this, mystery play persisted, in almost unchanged form, for centuries. Official condemnation hindered it not a bit. As it was sung by simple, ordinary people, all place names and such were converted into Finnish forms, and lyrics also bear memories from events in Russian Empire during 18th and 19th centuries (emperor Alexander Third is mentioned, etc.). Main thing is, this mystery play survived almost five hundred years, even when banned and persecuted against.<br><br>Mystery play is called “tiernapojat” (star boys) in Finnish, and today it is sung by heavy metal bands and church choirs alike. It tells the story of three wise man wandering to Bethlehem, and about king Herodes, who orders his troops to campaign of infanticide to prevent birth of one true king. If there are stronger examples how traditions can survive from generation to generation among ordinary people, there are not many. My grandmother's father acted/sung these songs in his youth. I did same as a kid, our group of singers guided by my father. Now my wife has talked me into guiding this same play when our kid is big enough to join the singers. Oral traditions are strong vechiles for survival of ideas.<br><br>Metal version, with traditional acting:<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2TCV3PjE0<br><br>Choir version, without acting:<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xKwl7tWLXQ<br><br><br><a href=#c4514827749637084579 title="comment permalink">1/6/17, 6:16 AM</a><br><br>

Probably the two biggest influences I can see when look back upon my formative years is stumbling upon George Orwell's <i>1984</i> when I was in junior high school (I had the reading level of a college freshman when I was a high-school freshman), and receiving the benefit of advanced English classes in a boarding school for my final two years of high school. <br><br>My blog rarely lives up to my potential as a writer.

One question on that subject though: where do you put researching, (and/or world building when it comes to fiction)? Do you meticulously plan and outline everything ahead of time so you know what it is you'll need to know? Or do you ever find yourself in a situation where an essay suddenly and unexpectedly turns towards something you really ought to know more about before you write, or where a character in a story winds up in a situation that you aren't quite familiar with the mechanics of (either because it's part of our world you hadn't given much thought to before, or part of their world you hadn't developed yet) and have to pause to fill in that gap in your knowledge and continue?

If you can come up with a written score (easy for most classical music, not so easy for other genres), get it and study it, with the idea of figuring out how the composer made it to be so interesting.<br><br>If it is in a genre without much published music, the tried-and-true way is to transcribe solos from recordings. The jazz musicians consider this to be essential, because it makes you put the thing under the magnifying glass until you have every detail of it on paper, and much more importantly, in your head. Then it will influence your own music making, which is the main point of the exercise. Some of the old-timers (e.g., J. S. Bach) would spend countless hours copying other people’s scores by hand, again as a means of internalizing what was there.<br><br>Writer’s block: I like your thought that it is the confusion of writing and editing that brings the writer to a screeching halt. One way out for musicians is to improvise. Take the idea(s) that you are working on to a piano and “play” with them for a while, with no judgments as to good or bad, and no intention of keeping anything from the improvisation; it usually gets things flowing in the right direction again. It may be that your suggestion to write with the computer screen turned off would be the writer’s equivalent.<br><br>@Jessi Thompson, thank you for the ideas from the visual arts, which sound like they are in the same direction, and especially for this: “I would argue you don't really understand the rule until you've found a way to break it with skill. Ultimately, it comes down to the question ‘What is the purpose of this rule? What is it accomplishing?’”<br><br>This is absolutely true for music. As for where to find “the rules,” my favorite sources are Old Books: Gradus ad Parnassum (J. J. Fux, 1725. This book is how Joseph Haydn learned the craft, carefully working through the exercises on his own), and Fundamentals of Musical Composition (Arnold Schoenberg, published posthumously in 1967, with most of the book written by 1948. He was himself the founder of the twelve-tone school of composition, but this book is based strictly on the older models, especially Beethoven, with the idea much like what Jessi said in the comment above about the visual arts - you cannot break the rules until you understand them.) For keyboard musicians (of which I am one), Essay on the True Art of Playing the Keyboard (C. P. E. Bach, 1753. Much of the book is a treatise on harmony, how to move from one chord to the next, based in large part on the work of his only music teacher – J. S. Bach, his father).<br><br>I almost never comment here, but I read these essays every week and have learned much from them.

Popular authors prefer listicals, bullet points, and two sentences interrupted with dozens of infographics, graphs, and images. Since I started reading the report I’m less able to deal with short-form texts, but my ability to sort through the logic of a statement has grown immensely. I often wonder if the short-form format actually prevent people from articulating their ideas to themselves, and thus less able to articulate it to the public. Could the collateral damage from reading something poorly written, over and over, be the inability to communicate clearly even verbally? <br><br>The short-form proposed by your commenter last week may have reached more people, but I doubt whether it would have had the same impact. One criticism that can be fairly leveled at the doomers and collapseniks (the people actually understand the twin dangers of peak oil and climate change) is that they keep trying to present a very complicated issue in the simplest of terms, and that may not actually be possible. We are talking about the real world repercussion of a complex system after all, if you dumb it down too much then you’re going to miss the nuance. <br><br>I’ve read RobM’s criticism of your work from multiple people, that you take too many words to explore one or two ideas, but how else can a writer explain a complex system? When following the movement of a complex system you must notice each strand before picking one to follow, but that doesn’t make the other strands less important. One or two ideas at the end may sum up what you’re trying to say, and may be presentable as bullet points or infographics, but to that doesn’t help understand the process. In this case the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts, it is simply a product of the sum, and the sum NEEDS to be understood before it can be spoken about. <br><br>By the way your troll baiting and general rejection of unpleasant people has a lot of the doomers quite angry at you. The Doomstead Diner ran a series of posts that accused you of being the leader of a fascist cult, with a thorough analysis of your druidic headdress as a clear indication that you are a cult leader. The posts were too poorly written to be worth the time even for a good laugh, which is a pity because a few good jabs keeps a writer on his toes and strengthens his wit. <br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br><a href=#c6519927748042092057 title="comment permalink">1/6/17, 10:46 AM</a><br><br>

I agree with you that attempts to manipulate opinion are everywhere - not only in office blocks like 55 Savushkina, but in NATO cities. As I remarked in my essay on 55 Savushkina this week at <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a> (I write as a Catholic), we additionally find unacceptable stuff in the Catholic blogosphere.<br><br>As far as the NATO cities go, you will have noticed that I refer in my essay to my own discouraging experience with the CBC, in connection with coverage of a 2003 Toronto anti-USA street demo.<br><br>There is a further point which I should now make, and I think did not make with full force in my essay. We cannot condone propaganda from any side, whether ours or some adversary's. <br><br>It will now be asked: how does one define propaganda? Since this topic requires an essay in its own right, it is hard to do it justice here.<br><br>In particular, simply to say "Dishonest writing" is to repeat, in unclear terms, the very thing whose definition is being sought. Everyone will then ask, "What constitutes honesty?" <br><br>As a first attempt (JMG, or you, or others, might be able to weigh in), I would make two points.<br><br>(a) The journalist who lies about facts, in other words who errs against the precept "nothing but the truth", is a propagandist.<br><br>(b) The journalist who errs against the precept "the whole truth" is a propagandist.<br><br>The commercial world often resorts to propaganda of the second type. If companies err against "nothing but the truth" in their advertising, they can be hauled up to Advertising Standards Canada, as I indeed haul up DG Group subsidiary Corsica in my 2016-12-20 action reported at <a href=http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>http://toomaskarmo.blogspot.com</a> under the headline "DDO&amp;P: Open Letter to Advertising Standards Canada, with Municipality and Others". However, watchdogs like Advertising Standards Canada are powerless when companies err against "whole truth" - as when DG Group showcases those of its projects that are environmentally positive, under the banner "Bringing Life to Land", at <a href=http://www.dggroup.ca/ rel=nofollow>http://www.dggroup.ca/</a>.<br><br>If we read enough propaganda, we start to think it acceptable. This is especially the case because the requirement to tell the whole truth cannot, in a correctly liberal society, be enforced at law. So far as correctly liberal ideals allow a legislature to go, all it can say is that the onus to seek out the full truth lies on shoppers. <br><br>Lest people think I am being overzealous, I add that courtroom advocacy (a different thing from journalism) is legitimate, as is the mere expression of opinion in an explicitly flagged "Opinion" piece. In my essay on 55 Savushkina Ulitsa, I cite, as examples of writing which is silly and yet honest, three of the Toronto <i>Globe and Mail</i>'s old opinion pieces.<br><br>Writers who state clearly that they are offering mere opinions are seeking to sway their readers. This is okay, because they are not seeking to manipulate.<br><br>One of my reasons for reading TADR is its general freedom from propagandistic reporting: either JMG reports facts in an adequately balanced way or he signals with adequate clarity that his voice is editorial.<br><br><br>Tom <br><br><br><br><a href=#c2578610824231565895 title="comment permalink">1/6/17, 11:05 AM</a><br><br>

Still, your mileage may vary! <br><br>Mustard, thank you. I still think of that post as the best piece of writing I've yet done on this blog. <br><br>Lewis, the term that's used these days is Cli-Fi, which I find endearingly dorky. It has an extra payoff, too; a lot of science fiction fans pronounce the old acronym "Sci-Fi" as "skiffy," and Cli-Fi would then, vertiginously enough, be...<br><br>Bill, and there you have it -- ask three authors, get five answers. ;-) Congrats on the paying gig!<br><br>BFM, oh, I'm not sure I'd go that far. Some people just don't like my style of prose. That said, a lot of what passes for writing is aimed at people with the attention span of a gnat, and reinforces that limitation...<br><br>Whomever, good! Down the road a bit, I'm going to post something on reading, because the habits of reading that are taught by today's schooling and culture are profoundly destructive of the ability to think clearly. It's apropos that you read these essays with bourbon, by the way -- some of them are written with that beverage's genial assistance!<br><br>Avalterra, yep. That's the equal and opposite kind of bad pedagogy to Mrs. McNitpick's -- don't bother to teach anything. Since teachers aren't held accountable for the impact of their choices on their students' lives, a lot of really bad habits of faux-teaching remain glued in place. <br><br>Joel, I haven't read it; I'll look it up. <br><br>Mrbluesky, thank you. I'll certainly consider a series on systems thinking -- it's a huge issue and, ahem, would make a good book. As for curating comments, it's actually quite simple: again, there's a set of rules, around which I make minor exceptions, mostly to let through borderline examples that make good teaching moments, and of course to whack the occasional troll. If it won't be too self-referential -- and maybe even if it is -- I may just do a post on how to make an internet forum civil and interesting. <br><br>Ed-M, here again, "too many words" suggests that you're paying too much attention to a stripped-down (and potentially dumbed-down) summary of what you think I'm saying, rather than to what I'm actually saying. That's a very common habit these days, and will be addressed in the upcoming post about reading I mentioned to Whomever above. <br><br>Brian, exactly -- and Goldman's a great example; he knew exactly what he was doing by breaking the rules, and the way that shift in prose models the shift in consciousness between the two species is really impressive.<br><br><a href=#c2224818800561386781 title="comment permalink">1/6/17, 11:42 AM</a><br><br>

I have the same reaction to a lot of what's on the internet.<br><br>Marian, thank you!<br><br>Tomuru, Tolkien's definitely one of those love-him-or-hate-him authors; I know quite a few perfectly nice and highly literate people who can't stand his writing. For that matter, so is George R.R. Martin -- I find his recent works dreary, though I liked his earlier fiction. That's why each writer, or for that matter reader, concentrates on what he or she likes.<br><br>Chris, have you tried, when you get the "I hate all of it" reaction, putting the text away for another week and then seeing if you like it better? Some people find that useful. As for wry amusement, I can't help it -- a vast number of things amuse me, in a wry sort of way. ;-)<br><br>Sgage, an excellent point!<br><br>Caryn, so noted. I deal with trolls so often here that it's entirely possible that the occasional sincere but clumsy utterance gets whacked by mistake.<br><br>Carlos, I envy you that. Like most Americans, I didn't encounter any language but English in any depth until relatively late in my schooling -- three years of high school Russian, in my case -- and so the ease with which people raised in a multilingual setting can pick up more languages is something I'll never have. A note to my American readers with young children: get them learning a second language sooner rather than later!<br><br>Izzy, got it. One of the reasons I made the romance happen fast is that the story I want to tell, in one of its many dimensions, has to do mostly with Owen and Laura's marriage, not their initial falling-in-love period (the focus of so much romantic fiction). Lovecraft, almost despite himself, repeatedly makes the point that the worshippers of the tentacled Great Old Ones form communities with strong mutual ties of various kinds binding them together; I'm playing with that, and contrasting it to a disintegrating mainstream society as the series proceeds. Of course Lovecraft also fixates on the idea that the people in those sinister communities are Not Like Him, which just adds to the fun; my characters include all sorts of ethnicities and skin colors, different sexualities ranging from hetero- to homo- to asexual, and so on, not because I have the least interest in political correctness but because (a) that's the way HPL set up the mythos and (b) it gives me a more interesting palette to work with. <br><br>Dammerung, oh, I know. I've lurked on both from time to time. (I also lurk on a range of other controversial sites, including those on the social-justice left; it's quite an education.)<br><br><a href=#c6690676195878284309 title="comment permalink">1/6/17, 12:09 PM</a><br><br>

A good while ago on this blog I mentioned being put off writing stories when about 14 at school. The silly man thought he was protecting literary standards. I was basically told to grow up – just one red ink comment. I thereafter protected my imagination as well as my writing from official scrutiny. Nice though 60 years on to get a couple of stories accepted in the space bat challenge. Thank you for the challenge! Not as bad as for my dad who was taught that he could not draw. My conclusion was that it affected the way that he could actually see things for the rest of his life. <br><br>More generally, acquiring skill-sets – including good conversation – stands a chance of taking the ordinary run of daily life out of the 95% crap into the 5% non-crap zone. Occasionally such diligence might set the scene for one percent events. I am thinking of the guy who at the end of his career could use the synergy of his experience to land the airliner on the Hudson River. Or again we are lucky some studious type thought to get hold of the notes for Aristotle’s brilliant lectures. The past would have been different without these inputs, which is perhaps a thought for next week! The apparently ephemeral, even I guess one-offs like musical or dramatic performance, if prepared for enough can have favourable consequences in ends and purposes.

They could be introduced to classical logic, where the outcome is figuring out whether an argument makes sense or not, but instead, yes, it's "everything = 0." Hmm...<br><br>Jay, excellent! Enjoy. <br><br>Crow Hill, one of the great virtues of writing is that it's basically democratic. You get your say, and can make your case as strongly as you're able. Appeals to other people's authority, except in the form of references that confirm the credentials of a fact, weaken your prose. If you aim for a calm, confident tone, and rely on the logic of your argument rather than someone else's authority, you'll have all the authority you need!<br><br>Cherokee, I get called arrogant all the time. When I press people on that, they usually say something like "You always think you're right!" When I comment that, why, yes, when I say something, I do normally believe that I'm right to say it, and ask if they often say things they think are incorrect, they retire in confusion. I've come to think that the word "arrogant" in modern speech amounts to "willing to disagree with the conventional wisdom of our time" -- and if that's arrogant, so be it. <br><br>Here in the US -- I have no idea if it's available Down Under -- there's an ale with the winsome name "Arrogant B*st*rd Ale."

Thank you for this!<br><br>Mister R., it's easy to get discouraged. It helps me to remember that it only takes a few people to make the kind of change that matters. <br><br>Austin, you should see the garbled messes that come over the transom at most publishers! I used to make extra cash as an outside reader for one press, and the amount of labor it took the copy editors to extract a readable book from some manuscripts would astound you.

For example, much of the action of the sixth book of <i>The Weird of Hali</i> takes place either aboard the barque <i>Miskatonic</i>, an old square-rigged ship, or in the partially deglaciated landscape of a near-future Greenland; I didn't know a vast amount about big square-rigged sailing vessels, less about newly deglaciated landscapes, and even less about Greenland, so I've spent a couple of months now reading up on all those things, and I've got about 6,000 words of detailed scenes for that otherwise unwritten book. Since I don't write sequentially, that's easy to fit in. In the same way, if I suddenly realize that I need to know something and I don't have the facts to hand, I write something else while waiting for the local interlibrary loan system to get me the book I need. <br><br>Castanea_d, thank you! This is most interesting. I know precisely nothing about composing music, and it's fascinating to hear that things are so closely parallel. <br><br>Gavin, the other thing you can do is turn off the spell checker and the grammar checker while you write. You can turn them back on when you edit, if you need them. For my part, the first thing I do when I get a "new" used computer is go into the word processing program and turn off all such things permanently. They really do get in the way of the writing process!<br><br>Varun, ding ding ding! We have a winner. One of the major problems with chopped-up, dumbed-down, bulletized writing is that it fosters chopped-up, dumbed-down, bulletized thinking. In particular, if the points that matter have to do with the subtle connections among disparate phenomena -- and nearly everything in this blog has to do with those in one way or another -- the kind of prose Madmagic wanted to push on me literally makes it impossible to understand such things, by stripping language of the very thing I'm trying to talk about. As for the trolls, that's funny. "He must be a cult leader, he wears a <i>funny hat!</i>" is particularly priceless. <br><br>Phil, exactly.

They remain beautifully legible, and the trees which were cut down have long since been replaced by new growth. I've had the pleasure of viewing a Shakespeare first folio which was published in 1623, probably on a linen based paper. <br>When your friend's Kindle dies in the next few years, all the books therein will be unreadable, and the cobalt and lead in the battery will end up in the environment. Meanwhile, massive <a href=http://datacenterfrontier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/google-iowa-above.jpg rel=nofollow>server farms</a> require equally massive amounts of power to feed that Kindle its books (as well as host ADR, oh well....). The Kindle will end up mostly unrecyclable, with most of the components in the <a href=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b1/a2/60/b1a2609eff69927931dc21dca5650343.jpg rel=nofollow>E-waste</a> piles, and the circuit board will probably be burnt down to retrieve the bits of metals whilst poisoning the burners.<br>So, I say to you, go proudly into that bookstore to order the latest book by JMG (many of which are print to order). If you don't know that you want/need the book, borrow it from your library. And, for many books which our esteemed Druid recommends, the used bookstore is your friend.<br>Read in peace.<br><br><br><a href=#c810926615318193275 title="comment permalink">1/6/17, 3:07 PM</a><br><br>

I'm more on the SJW side of things in politics/nonfiction writing, but in writing, I mostly do what I do because as a writer, it's interesting to write about a bunch of different ethnicities/religions/sexualities and likewise as a reader*, and because I know it's often nice for any given audience member to see characters like them now and again. I'm nice once in a while. :) (And besides, a reader who appreciates seeing characters like them is a reader who might be induced to give me another six dollars in the future.)<br><br>Two other notes now that I'm off work:<br><br>1) I really liked Innsmouth as a starting point, especially because, for me, that has always been one of the HPL stories that was least horrifying--all the terror seems to be discovering that the guy has "tainted blood" or whatever, which, from a modern POV...meh. (I *have* joked that the inevitable-transformation-horror thing might work decently as a metaphor for middle age: "I fall asleep at half past ten! Two drinks give me a hangover, and I can no longer digest circus peanuts! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MEEEEEE?") So I really liked what you did with that.<br><br>2) In my day job, I'm an editor, and a fairly ruthless one at that; furthermore, I spent much of my youth reading bad fantasy (oh, Robert Jordan) of the sort that I can best describe as "thesaurus bukakke", so I am very...attuned, you might say...to people being overly wordy, and I've never seen that in any of your writing. You never seem to use more words than you have actual things to say, which is both good and rare.<br><br>* Although I have my limits: I've no time for fragile women, "alpha men", and right-wing attitudes toward sex, which is one of the many reasons I never bothered with Twilight and similar.<br><br><a href=#c2388644886873383873 title="comment permalink">1/6/17, 3:27 PM</a><br><br>

Did I mention that I'm hard to influence? ;-)<br><br>Librarian, a really over-the-top Dickensian novel about a contemporary US public school would be well worth writing. It's not something I could do well, but oh, man -- yep, you'd have Mrs. McNitpick carrying on a flaming affair with another teacher, whom I'd be more likely to name Choakum D. Childe; you'd have the regular multiple choice tests with absurd questions, the frantic fixation on quantitative measurement, all in a vast sprawling Gormenghast of a modern school that looks like a medium-security prison but with fewer amenities. It could be quite the tale. <br><br>Izzy, well, there you are. I'm a Burkean conservative, but Burke himself was an advocate for religious freedom for Catholics at a time when that was about as popular as supporting the rights of Muslims today, and he lent his own house to a group of traveling Hindus who'd been denied any other place to celebrate one of their festivals. I also grew up in a multiracial household -- my stepmother is Japanese-American, and far and away the nicest person in the family -- and thus I find religious, culture, and ethnic differences enjoyable rather than threatening, and worth including in fiction. As for fragile women and "alpha" men, I'd be more interested in those if they hadn't been done to the point of utter dreariness long before I was born. Let's have something different for a change, please!<br><br>The thing to remember about Lovecraft's "tainted blood" tales is that he returned to the theme obsessively over the course of his career; as I've noted elsewhere, I think a lot of his bigotry was driven by a suspicion, or perhaps actual knowledge, that somebody in his family tree was just passing for white. (That's extremely common among serious bigots.) As for "thesaurus bukkake" -- oh my. I laughed good and hard at that; thank you. I've never read Jordan, but Stephen Donaldson was a name to conjure with in my teen years (though I was one of those people who called his first book "Lord Fane's Bowels"), and he's also a very bad example of the syndrome! <br><br>Kyle, I'd say give it a shot! <br><br>Unknown, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Kate, thank you!

I keep on telling them what matters is if it’s done well. <br><br>When it comes to writing and editing and the relationship between rules and taste, I’m reminded of Clausewitz. He wrote things down first and ended up dying quite early in the editing process with only the first section of the first book finished. Despite this, he’s one of the cornerstones of Western strategic thought. It’s a common refrain of most successful writers I’ve come across which is to “Get it down!” <br><br>Secondly Clausewitz discusses in On War, trying to divide study from doctrine which seems appropriate here. The latter are sets of rules that would make Mrs. McNitpick (or Col. McNitpick as it were) proud while the other is to expose though both experience and history to understand the different forms of war, learn the basics, and to use all of it as a guide rather than a schedule.<br><br>For the charges of arrogance, it’s easy to read many of your statements especially pedagogical ones in a condensing tone.

Our local library is open for a couple of mid-day hours (10-2) on Saturdays. Today, I went and spent about an hour, sitting by the fireplace (very nice this time of year) and reading through a number of small local weekly and semi-weekly papers which cover the surrounding towns, villages, and neighboring counties. I've decided that I will be making a regular practice of this, as it is a good way to stay abreast of local happenings as well as situational awareness (and context) with respect to my own community's issues. We do not have a dedicated paper for our town, though there is a Gannette-owned paper which serves the county and is run out of the larger city (and county seat) just down the road. I wonder if a local weekly would nonetheless be viable. I'll tuck that idea away for future reference.<br><br>In other local political news, the spring ballot has been set. There are four candidates running for three seats on the city council, so my odds are fairly good, and in the random name-drawing for ballot position, I came out in the second spot (not a bad place to be, I think).

For example, in teaching poetry, the students would read poetry of a certain style and then learn the structure; following this we wrote poetry of that particular - then she would grade the poetry, giving clear &amp; helpful corrections/suggestions/encouragement. Drama became alive (as it should be) we read (out loud &amp; to ourselves) then saw a film of the play 'Romeo and Juliet'; following that, students formed groups to write &amp; produce their own, and critique plays of the other student groups. Great class. Sadly, a few years later we moved &amp; Mrs. McNitpick was the English teacher and some great literature became hateful to me. 'MacBeth' was read aloud in class and analyzed to death.

I hope everyone who has to teach them to their children turns around and says, "But that's just for school, because those tests are too stupid to understand anything else. Now let's talk about <i>real</i> writing."<br><br>Robert, thank you! Somewhere in the process of obsessively rereading Lovecraft's stories to get details for <i>The Weird of Hali</i>, I noticed just how many of his plots revolve around a woman, usually a female ancestor, who isn't what she appears to be, on the one hand, and forbidden intermarriages on the other. The latter's a theme I'm picking up, in a wry way, in my novels -- did you know that Charles Dexter Ward had a secret romance and marriage with an African-American woman? Neither did his family, or Lovecraft for that matter... ;-)<br><br>Given the frequency with which light-skinned people of African descent relied on "passing" to advance socially in pre-1960s America -- cue that old jazz classic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5sLxmCYJ7s" rel=nofollow>On the Sunny Side of the Street</a> -- it struck me that the most likely explanation for those paired fixations was something in Lovecraft's genealogy that You. Did. Not. Talk. About. I didn't know, though, that it's particularly appropriate to Providence history! That's worth knowing. <br><br>Cherokee, it's a very solid dark ale. I hope your wife has a taste for stouts, porters, and other real beer!<br><br>Mustard, I don't speak internet, so somebody else will have to pursue that idea. As for penny dreadfuls, though, my youthful fascination with monsters led me to the perfervid pages of <i>Varney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood</i>, which the Burien, WA public library had in a sturdy Dover Publications reprint -- as dreadful a dreadful as was ever sold for a penny an episode. That led to others; so, yes, my youthful imagination was partly corrupted by penny dreadfuls -- though they had a lot of competition, of course. <br><br>Donalfagan, interesting. That makes sense. <br><br>Sylvia, I could see a really fascinating novel coming out of that latter suggestion! <br><br>Kate, thank you! Yes, I see your point. The classical Stoic diatribe might be another comparable genre. <br><br>Scotlyn, thank you. I like to mentally edit the term "destroy," when used in the manner you've indicated, by replacing it with "annoy." That's usually all that takes place, after all. <br><br>Chris, hmm! I hadn't thought of Clausewitz in that context, but you're right. Half the reason the Confederacy survived as long as it did during the Civil War was that nearly all the Union generals early on thought they could fight battles by the rulebook, while the most important Confederate generals knew otherwise. It wasn't until Grant and Sherman rose to command armies that the Union forces weren't being led by Gen. McNitpick, and once that happened the end came pretty quickly. <br><br>David, glad to hear it. The reading will also give you plenty of ammunition for blog posts, letters to editors, and other publicity for your campaign, showing that you're up on the issues that matter to locals and have positive proposals for how to deal with those. <br><br>PatriciaT, I'll have to check out that anthology; my pre-Tolkien fantasy is mostly in old Ballantine Books editions, from the glorious days when Lin Carter was resurrecting the entire genre from oblivion.<br><br><a href=#c3879516208064942468 title="comment permalink">1/7/17, 3:15 PM</a><br><br>

A few notes:<br><br>"I propose to publish all submitted comments without censorship, provided they disclose within their body text the writer's e-mail address, name, and municipality-plus-country of residence (yours did not)"<br><br>Well... then it's okay if you don't publish it... the thing is, when ALL Canadian federal, provincial AND municipal politicians are entirely one-sided on the Russian/Ukraine issue, I don't feel comfortable allowing my name to be publicly linked to comments against it, no matter how mild my comments are. I feel a bit paranoid, and feel that someone would have said something if there weren't consequences for speaking about it.<br><br>Regarding propaganda, I think that your 2nd type (reporting truthfully, but leaving out the full truth) currently predominates, both in corporate and state-funded media. The common technique is to be neutral in tone and not neutral at all in content. This takes the form of <br>a) simply not reporting information that doesn't fit the wanted narrative, and <br>b) giving lots of space and analysis to any story that even mildly supports the wanted narrative (often across multiple channels at once), even if it's based on poor sourcing. <br>In this second case, one likely sign that it really IS intentional propaganda and not simply clumsiness is that there are no follow-up reports on the findings of any journalists that find the information to be false or misinterpreted (this is precisely why I like reading so-called small "Alternative Media" - a lot of them will dig into and find flaws in MSM news stories, which the MSM themselves rarely correct)<br><br>In general, I often prefer reading biased authors that admit their bias/passion upfront (or where it's pretty clear) -- it means that I know what to watch out for, and also on which subjects they will probably be fair writers, as they have no skin in the game.<br><br>For example, there's a free newspaper here in Toronto called "The Epoch Times", funded by an anti-Chinese Communist Party religious group. In every issue, they have an essay about the evils of the CPP. On other topics, though, they tend to write competently and in a refreshingly agenda-free manner (perhaps veering a little on the New Agey side with their science reporting).<br><br>For some topics like the Syrian Civil War, or Ukrainian conflict, nearly everyone is either biased or biased but pretending to be neutral. In those cases, I prefer to read openly-biased and close-to-the-ground accounts from as many sides as I can find, as they actually tend to be more truthful than the more "neutral" stories which tend to have the more egregious propaganda. The more close-to-the-ground sources sometimes discount their own side's propaganda as well as the other side's.<br><br>For example, for the Ukrainian conflict, one could read the interview of Dmytro Yarosh, former Right Sector leader (far right nationalist paramilitary) on Censor, in which he openly tells of how acting Ukrainian president Turchinov secretly ordered him to start the first battle of the war: http://censor.net.ua/resonance/385673/dmitro_yarosh_pershiyi_nastupalniyi_byi_vyini_vdbuvsya_20_kvtnya_2014go_dobrovolts_atakuvali_blokpost<br>(the government had originally denied the incident for over a year, and all the Western MSM I saw almost always reported on only their claims about the conflict -- meeting your second definition of propaganda)<br><br>And on the other hand, if one follows Colonel Cassad (who calls his blog "The Totalitarian Propaganda Mouthpiece" right on the banner), one finds discussion about the "Northern Wind" (secret Russian support for the Donbass rebels) and interviews with Igor Strelkov in which the latter openly discusses how he gathered Crimean volunteers who then led a vanguard and organized battles in places where Donbass locals originally didn't want to fight (and in later interviews, more and more openly criticizes Putin for not supporting decisive war).<br><br><a href=#c5004424800980032617 title="comment permalink">1/8/17, 12:31 AM</a><br><br>

I may have mentioned a long time ago to you that he was the author that taught me the lesson that it is OK to put down a book before completing it, even if you are on the sixth book in a series. Get thee to an opportunity shop, Mr Donaldson's work! ;-)!

You play what you want and let the public pick up on what you doing? even if it does take them fifteen, twenty years.<br><br> However,Monk opined: At this time the fashion is to bring something to jazz that I reject.

There's no beat anymore. You can't keep time with your foot. I believe that what is happening to jazz with people like Omette Coleman, for instance, is bad.

My recollection is that the story did not start to get interesting until the travelers arrive at the Inn at Bree. This is not unusual in novels that begin at the beginning rather than dropping you into the middle of the action and requiring the reader to figure out what's going on through hints or gradual reveals. <br><br>Sometimes this is an intentional stylistic choice because the author wants the reader to be familiar with the characters and the setting before getting very far into the plot. In other instances, it just takes the novelist a while to hit his stride.<br><br>What you consider flowery language is intentional and one of the reasons that I've reread LOTR and not read George Martin's magnum opus even once. The Lord of the Rings contains characters, settings and situations that derive from a pile of<br>European myths, romances, fairy tales and heroic tales that go back before the Christian era, and reworkings of those tales from the Middle Ages up through the nineteenth century. The language Tolkien is using is not a direct imitation of any source, but contains echoes and allusions to them. This makes the trilogy very resonant for people who have read some of the older versions of those tales either as children or as adults. If you have never read any of those old tales and the styles of language they were written in, you are going to miss out on part of what Tolkien is doing. <br><br>Another part of what he's doing is using these ancient tropes and long-ago-and-far-away setting to deal with contemporary concerns. One is the ruining of ecosystems and the beauty of the natural world by unchecked industrialization in the pursuit of power and profit. A second theme is political--why other nations failed to stop the rise of Hitler, and the general difficulty of getting different nations and factions to recognize real evil and unite to take effective action against it. A third theme is how power corrupts the virtuous. A fourth is the importance of having mercy and compassion for your adversaries, even when they are despicable. Tolkien deals with all these moral themes not by sermonizing but by showing characters making various choices and the consequences.<br><br>The story is interesting, the settings are gorgeous and some of the characters are well drawn, but the language and the themes are equally important.<br><br><a href=#c101666211076791200 title="comment permalink">1/8/17, 4:46 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c3698582400436469864></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/09189466855334778278 rel=nofollow>Robert Mathiesen</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I spent some fun time yesterday poking around in a few genealogical sources that I have access to, and I actually found partial confirmation of your shrewd guess about Lovecraft's ancestry. Here it is, for whatever it may be worth.<br><br>HPL's anxiety over "tainted blood" had something to do, of course, with his own father's descent into insanity at a fairly young age. <br><br>It also surely had something to do with the fact that his maternal grandparents (Whipple Van Buren Philips and Rhoby Alzada Place) were first cousins. First-cousin marriages have always been legal in Rhode Island, as they are in many states; but in the later 1800s and early 1900s there was a wide-spread theory that first-cousin marriages produced mental degenerates.<br><br>But there is more. Before going into the specifics, I should mention that "racial" boundaries in Rhode Island were, until recently, drawn in ways that were somewhat out-of-step with the usual American pattern. There were WASPs, of course, and they formed the top crust of society. Below them (in HPL's day), however, there was just an unstratified mass of non-WASPs: Narragansett "Indians" (and other local Native Americans); African-Americans; Hugenots (French Protestants) and other Protestants from non-English-speaking countries; Irish Catholics (and most other Catholics, for example, Italians); and especially Cape-Verdean Portuguese. The Cape Verdeans often had the skin color of African-Americans, but -- in HPL's day and even as late as the 1970s -- they thought of themselves as wholly White, not Black, since they were Portuguese. Within the state, the Cape-Verdeans didn't get much pushback over their insistence on their Whiteness: since they weren't WASPs, it really didn't matter much to anyone else here how they categorized themselves. This is why I spoke of "an unstratified mass" of non-WASPs in the state. <br><br>And -- here is the important point -- in Rhode Island, all these non-WASPs intermarried with one another, amongst themselves, as freely as they cared to, with no social sanctions against their doing so. For example, two close friends of ours, an older couple named Naomi and Horace -- now dead for a decade and more -- appeared Black to the eye, and were highly respected members of the Black community in Providence. However, while Naomi's mother was African-American, her father was wholly Irish. And Horace's ancestry was even more complicated, as his mother was pure Narragansett, while his father's father was African-American and his father's mother was an immigrant from northern Norway, who also had some Saami (Lapp) ancestors among her Norwegian ones.<br><br>Coming back now to HPL: his maternal grandparents were first cousins, since their mothers were sisters: Rhoby Alzada (Rathburn) Philips and Sarah (Rathburn) Place. And the Rathburn sisters, Rhoby amd Sarah, have documented Irish ancestry from a great-great-grandfather of theirs named Thomas Casey, who had immigrated from Ireland in the mid-1600s. This was all worked out in a genealogical article published shortly after HPL was born: "Early Families of Casey in Rhode Island," The Magazine of New England History, 3(1893). Doubtless HPL had found and read this article in the course of his own extensive historical and genealogical research.<br><br>What the article doesn't make entirely clear is the ancestry of the spouses of Thomas Casey's various descendants down to the generation of Rhoby and Sarah Rathburn. It is inherently unlikely, given Rhode Island marriage customs, that all of them were WASPs. Some of them certainly might have been African-American or Native American. And Rhoby Alzada's odd given names sound quite "un-WASP-y": Alzada might have suggested to HPL something Spanish or Portuguese in her ancestry. In any event, his documented Irish ancestry was already enough, in HPL's eyes, for him to think that his own blood was "tainted." <br><br>So your hunch was pretty solidly on target.<br><br><br><a href=#c3698582400436469864 title="comment permalink">1/8/17, 6:41 PM</a><br><br>

We also have been distributing our Wassail Christmas Ale to family and friends…it is a high alcohol (14 %!) dark porter with a “potion” of liquors used as the bottling sugar. Very nice spices, too.<br><br>I love the similarity of writing (reading) prose and writing (reading) music, and hearing them…learning the rules, but breaking them at times to emphasize or awaken the sensibilities of the composition. Very much noticed in J.S. Bach, and most of the baroque composers. I can feel my brain ordering itself when I listen to Chaconne Violin Partita No. 2 in D minor, BWV 1004. We have many versions; violin, of course, guitar (John Williams), piano (Busoni) and all left hand piano by Brahms. There is even a version on the double bas!<br>. <br>Hope all here have a fruitful 2017, filled with good reading, music, home brewed beverages and garden fresh food and flowers.

It's "Under what conditions (for what values of your unknown) are these two quantities (the left and right sides of the equation) in balance?" Then it's all formal logic from there, picking your way one justifiable step at a time, keeping in mind the basic rules of the (mathematical) relationships between the constituents to maintain the balance of the whole around the equals sign. I think there is a lot in common here with the habits of thought needed to produce good clear expository writing. No credentials or special authority needed, just careful thought and the willingness to explain why you get to take each incremental step you propose. (Little kids can learn to do this!) It seems to me that this focus on conditional balance, awareness of the whole and the relationships within it, and careful thought, explanation, and justification are just what our difficult future ordered. <br><br>By the way, the focus on justification is what a lot of folks hate in the approach to math in the current Common Core Standards for American schools. "Why should students have to explain _why_ they are solving the problem the way they are, or _why_ their strategy makes sense? Just memorize the steps and be done with it!" Of course, most teachers weren't taught themselves with this focus on balance and justification, so the aforementioned and much-reviled standards are often very badly executed in the classroom, and most parents weren't taught this way, so they are stymied when it comes to helping their kids with these skills in their homework assignments (which are addressed by the standards, and thus by standards-based textbooks, very early indeed, often in first and second grades). Plus, of course, the mass-produced textbooks often stink at presenting the material. (This is not even to begin to touch on the radioactive politics around the forced implementation of common standards across the nation!) So, yeah, lots of people are unhappy with modern American math instruction in schools. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the actual content, including the algebra, is bad. Clear thinking is of course hard, much harder than memorization, and truly good quality math instruction is just as hard to pull off as good writing instruction, but offers students (and their teachers!) just as much in terms of the crucial skills of learning to think. So no slagging on math, please!<br><br>--Heather in CA<br><br><br><a href=#c2801730218268968041 title="comment permalink">1/10/17, 9:31 AM</a><br><br>

Necessity is not the only thing to keep in mind! <br><br>Patricia, the Confederacy didn't have an entrenched military bureaucracy; it created its military from the ground up, and under the circumstances, incompetents got farmed out promptly, while in the Federal army the routine promotion of the clueless was an ingrained habit. I always figured that was a large part of it. <br><br>Bill, delighted to hear it. <br><br>Damaris, you may certainly do so. Thank you for asking! <br><br>Pygmycory, to what extent anything funded by George Soros is actually "dissent," rather than political manipulation by an ambitious billionaire, is an interesting question...<br><br>Cherokee, I liked Donaldson's first trilogy well enough to read it a couple of times -- but then I was pretty omnivorous in those days. After that, the best said the better. I pity the poor opportunity shops, though -- over here, where they're called thrift shops (or junk shops), they end up with multiple volumes of all the briefly fashionable literary trash (cough, cough, <i>Fifty Grades of F</i>, cough, cough) and end up having to recycle them. <br><br>LatheChuck, thank you for this -- I'll check it out as time permits. <br><br>Goedeck, Monk has long been one of my go-to examples for the way that wild creativity can base itself on an absolute mastery of traditional form. The guy was a world-class stride pianist of the Fats Waller sort, who then took that and ran with it into the far reaches of what jazz can do -- and yeah, I agree with his take on Ornette Coleman et al. <br><br>Robert, thank you! That's absolutely fascinating -- and it's also worth knowing for literary purposes, as the fifth volume of <i>The Weird of Hali</i> will be set in Providence, riffing off "The Call of Cthulhu," "The Haunter of the Dark," and "The Strange Case of Charles Dexter Ward." (It looks as though I'll be visiting in August for NecronomiCon; I'll keep the list posted.) Can you recommend a good book or website with more details on that end of Providence's social history?

Myself, I'd much rather see geometry, taught straight out of Euclid's Elements, as the first step beyond ordinary arithmetic; that teaches the logical method better than any other form of study (which is why the ancient Greeks required it of potential philosophy students), and the experience of building one proof on top of another helps build the kind of thinking that makes constructing and analyzing an argument easy.

Rhody Alzada (Place) Philips was the niece, and also the daughter-in-law, of Rhody (Rathburn) Philips. I'm still not done working on their given names, but there are a number of absolutely weird given names current in one or another rural small town in Rhode Island. These Phillips and Place fmailies lived in the town of Foster, which was very rural back in the day. <br><br>Rural Rhode Island in the earlier 1800s is also the heartland of the well-documented belief that a person who was dead of consumption might return as a spirit from the grave and feed on the lives of his or her living relatives.. This could be prevented, it was thought, by exhuming the recently dead relatives, finding the one (or several) whose corpses seemed to have fresh blood in them, and burning the heart of the corpse, or even the entire corpse itself. Ashes from the fire were then put in water and given to the living to drink, and sometimes the entire family fumigated itself in the smoke from the burning corpse. The last documened case of this happened as late as 1892, in the rural town of Exeter, when HPL was about two years old, and was written up in the local papers. It caused quite a stir at the time. My good friend, the folklorist Michael E. Bell, published a book a while back on these cases, _Food for the Dead_ (2001); and he has a sequeel in the works now , _In the Vampire's Grasp_.<br><br>As to the local attitudes toward "race" and marriage, most of what I wrote is from the personal knowledge that comes with living here for almost fifty years and hanging with close friends far outside of the bubbles of the academic world and the WASP-y upper crust. Both my wife and I were raised blue-collar in California, and the generations before us were sometimes much lower than blue-collar on the social scale (farmers, lumberjacks and postmen on her side, crooks and con-artists on mine). So we never really felt ourselves at home in the up-scale academic circles of Providence's local Ivy-league university and its elite social strata, and we formed most of our closest friendships elsewhere. -- But no doubt soemone has written up these attitudes somewhere, and I will see what I can do to find references.<br><br><a href=#c2749448852956488079 title="comment permalink">1/11/17, 9:12 AM</a><br><br>

So, are you thinking of ocean crossing square riggers, or the sloops, schooners and barkentines of the Great Lakes? And by clear sense, to you mean a knowledge of techniques and handling or what life was like aboard?<br><br>For technical aspects, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy's "Eagle Seamanship; A Manual for Square-Rig Sailing" by Edwin H. Daniels, 4th edition, U.S. Naval Institute is a clear primer for ship-handling. Amazon has it, you may prefer a different vendor.<br><br>Alan Villiers, the Australian who documented the end of the age of sail while serving on the last steel ships wrote many books; "Falmouth for Orders" and "By Way of Cape Horn" may be most useful to you. "Sons of Sinbad" contains one of my favourite lines though. Villiers is expressing doubt about crossing the ocean in a dhow with an uncorrected 18th century dry compass as the only navigational gear; the skipper reassures him, "It is only to Zanzibar and I have been there before and know the way".<br><br>"Cruise of the Cachelot" by Frank T. Bullen, while ostensibly about whaling, is one of the best descriptions of what it's like to crew such a ship that I know of; his critiques of Yankee whaling ship's officers in the New Zealand chapter is priceless. I'd crew for Paddy on The Chance in a heartbeat!<br><br>Off hand, I can't think of anything as cogent for coastal and lake schooners. I'll see if any of my historian friends can help. Pete Culler's "Skiffs and Schooners", while oriented towards boatbuilders and small boats, has a lot of generally useful nautical and boating information in it.
