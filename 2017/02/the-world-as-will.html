<div class=MsoNormal>
It's impressively easy to misunderstand the point made in last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>. To say that the world we experience is made up of representations of reality, constructed in our minds by taking the trickle of data we get from the senses and fitting those into patterns that are there already, doesn’t mean that nothing exists outside of our minds. Quite the contrary, in fact; there are two very good reasons to think that there really is something “out there,” a reality outside our minds that produces the trickle of data we’ve discussed. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first of those reasons seems almost absurdly simple at first glance: the world doesn’t always make sense to us. Consider, as one example out of godzillions, the way that light seems to behave like a particle on some occasions and like a wave on others. That’s been described, inaccurately, as a paradox, but it’s actually a reflection of the limitations of the human mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What, after all, does it mean to call something a particle? Poke around the concept for a while and you’ll find that at root, this concept “particle” is an abstract metaphor, extracted from the common human experience of dealing with little round objects such as pebbles and marbles. What, in turn, is a wave? Another abstract metaphor, extracted from the common human experience of watching water in motion. When a physicist says that light sometimes acts like a particle and sometimes like a wave, what she’s saying is that neither of these two metaphors fits more than a part of the way that light behaves, and we don’t have any better metaphor available. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If the world was nothing but a hallucination projected by our minds, then it would contain nothing that wasn’t already present in our minds—for what other source could there be?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That implies in turn that there would be a perfect match between the contents of the world and the contents of our minds, and we wouldn’t get the kind of mismatch between mind and world that leaves physicists flailing. More generally, the fact that the world so often baffles us offers good evidence that behind the world we experience, the world as representation, there’s some “thing in itself” that’s the source of the sense data we assemble into representations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The other reason to think that there’s a reality distinct from our representations is that, in a certain sense, we experience such a reality at every moment. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Raise one of your hands to a position where you can see it, and wiggle the fingers. You see the fingers wiggling—or, more precisely, you see a representation of the wiggling fingers, and that representation is constructed in your mind out of bits of visual data, a great deal of memory, and certain patterns that seem to be hardwired into your mind. You also feel the fingers wiggling—or, here again, you feel a representation of the wiggling fingers, which is constructed in your mind out of bits of tactile and kinesthetic data, plus the usual inputs from memory and hardwired patterns. Pay close attention and you might be able to sense the way your mind assembles the visual representation and the tactile one into a single pattern; that happens close enough to the surface of consciousness that a good many people can catch themselves doing it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So you’ve got a representation of wiggling fingers, part of the world as representation we experience. Now ask yourself this: the action of the will that makes the fingers wiggle—is that a representation? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is where things get interesting, because the only reasonable answer is no, it’s not. You don’t experience the action of the will as a representation; you don’t experience it at all. You simply wiggle your fingers. Sure, you experience the results of the will’s action in the form of representations—the visual and tactile experiences we’ve just been considering—but not the will itself. If it were true that you could expect to see or hear or feel or smell or taste the impulse of the will rolling down your arm to the fingers, say, it would be reasonable to treat the will as just one more representation. Since that isn’t the case, it’s worth exploring the possibility that in the will, we encounter something that isn’t just a representation of reality—it’s a reality we encounter directly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the insight at the foundation of Arthur Schopenhauer’s philosophy. Schopenhauer’s one of the two principal guides who are going to show us around the giddy funhouse that philosophy has turned into of late, and guide us to the well-marked exits, so you’ll want to know a little about him. He lived in the ramshackle assortment of little countries that later became the nation of Germany; he was born in 1788 and died in 1860; he got his doctorate in philosophy in 1813; he wrote his most important work, <i>The World as Will and Representation</i>, before he turned thirty; and he spent all but the last ten years of his life in complete obscurity, ignored by the universities and almost everyone else. A small inheritance, carefully managed, kept him from having to work for a living, and so he spent his time reading, writing, playing the flute for an hour a day before dinner, and grumbling under his breath as philosophy went its merry way into metaphysical fantasy. He grumbled a lot, and not always under his breath. Fans of <i>Sesame Street </i>can think of him as philosophy’s answer to Oscar the Grouch. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Schopenhauer came of age intellectually in the wake of Immanuel Kant, whose work we discussed briefly last week, and so the question he faced was how philosophy could respond to the immense challenge Kant threw at the discipline’s feet. Before you go back to chattering about what’s true and what’s real, Kant said in effect, show me that these labels mean something and relate to something, and that you’re not just chasing phantoms manufactured by your own minds. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most of the philosophers who followed in Kant’s footsteps responded to his challenge by ignoring it, or using various modes of handwaving to pretend that it didn’t matter. One common gambit at the time was to claim that the human mind has a special superpower of intellectual intuition that enables it to leap tall representations in a single bound, and get to a direct experience of reality that way. What that meant in practice, of course, is that philosophers could claim to have intellectually intuited this, that, and the other thing, and then build a great tottering system on top of them. What that meant in practice, of course, that a philosopher could simply treat whatever abstractions he fancied as truths that didn’t have to be proved; after all, he’d intellectually intuited them—prove that he hadn’t!</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were other such gimmicks. What set Schopenhauer apart was that he took Kant’s challenge seriously enough to go looking for something that wasn’t simply a representation. What he found—why, that brings us back to the wiggling fingers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As discussed in last week’s post, every one of the world’s great philosophical traditions has ended up having to face the same challenge Kant flung in the face of the philosophers of his time. Schopenhauer knew this, since a fair amount of philosophy from India had been translated into European languages by his time, and he read extensively on the subject. This was helpful because Indian philosophy hit its own epistemological crisis around the tenth century BCE, a good twenty-nine centuries before Western philosophy got there, and so had a pretty impressive head start. There’s a rich diversity of responses to that crisis in the classical Indian philosophical schools, but most of them came to see consciousness as a (or the) thing-in-itself, as reality rather than representation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a plausible claim. Look at your hand again, with or without wiggling fingers. Now be aware of yourself looking at the hand—many people find this difficult, so be willing to work at it, and remember to feel as well as see. There’s your hand; there’s the space between your hand and your eyes; there’s whatever of your face you can see, with or without eyeglasses attached; pay close attention and you can also feel your face and your eyes from within; and then there’s—</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s the thing we call consciousness, the whatever-it-is that watches through your eyes. Like the act of will that wiggled your fingers, it’s not a representation; you don’t experience it. In fact, it’s very like the act of will that wiggled your fingers, and that’s where Schopenhauer went his own way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What, after all, does it mean to be conscious of something? Some simple examples will help clarify this. Move your hand until it bumps into something; it’s when something stops the movement that you feel it. Look at anything; you can see it if and only if you can’t see through it. <i>You are conscious of something when, and only when, it resists your will</i>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That suggested to Schopenhauer that consciousness derives from will, not the other way around. There were other lines of reasoning that point in the same direction, and all of them derive from common human experiences. For example, each of us stops being conscious for some hours out of every day, whenever we go to sleep. During part of the time we’re sleeping, we experience nothing at all; during another part, we experience the weirdly disconnected representations we call “dreams.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Even in dreamless sleep, though, it’s common for a sleeper to shift a limb away from an unpleasant stimulus. Thus the will is active even when consciousness is absent. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Schopenhauer proposed that there are different forms or, as he put it, grades of the will. Consciousness, which we can define for present purposes as the ability to experience representations, is one grade of the will—one way that the will can adapt to existence in a world that often resists it. Life is another, more basic grade. Consider the way that plants orient themselves toward sunlight, bending and twisting like snakes in slow motion, and seek out concentrations of nutrients with probing, hungry roots. As far as anyone knows, plants aren’t conscious—that is, they don’t experience a world of representations the way that animals do—but they display the kind of goal-seeking behavior that shows the action of will. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Animals also show goal-seeking behavior, and they do it in a much more complex and flexible way than plants do. There’s good reason to think that many animals are conscious, and experience a world of representations in something of the same way we do; certainly students of animal behavior have found that animals let incidents from the past shape their actions in the present, mistake one person for another, and otherwise behave in ways that suggest that their actions are guided, as ours are, by representations rather than direct reaction to stimuli. In animals, the will has developed the ability to represent its environment to itself. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Animals, at least the more complex ones, also have that distinctive mode of consciousness we call emotion. They can be happy, sad, lonely, furious, and so on; they feel affection for some beings and aversion toward others. Pay attention to your own emotions and you’ll soon notice how closely they relate to the will. Some emotions—love and hate are among them—are motives for action, and thus expressions of will; others—happiness and sadness are among them—are responses to the success or failure of the will to achieve its goals. While emotions are tangled up with representations in our minds, and presumably in those of animals as well, they stand apart; they’re best understood as conditions of the will, expressions of its state as it copes with the world through its own representations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And humans? We’ve got another grade of the will, which we can call intellect:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the ability to add up representations into abstract concepts, which we do, ahem, at will. Here’s one representation, which is brown and furry and barks; here’s another like it; here’s a whole kennel of them—and we lump them all together in a single abstract category, to which we assign a sound such as “dog.” We can then add these categories together, creating broader categories such as “quadruped” and “pet;” we can subdivide the categories to create narrower ones such as “puppy” and “Corgi;” we can extract qualities from the whole and treat them as separate concepts, such as “furry” and “loud;” we can take certain very general qualities and conjure up the entire realm of abstract number, by noticing how many paws most dogs have and using that, and a great many other things, to come up with the concept of “four.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So life, consciousness, and intellect are three grades of the will. One interesting thing about them is that the more basic ones are more enduring and stable than the more complex ones. Humans, again, are good examples. Humans remain alive all the way from birth to death; they’re conscious only when awake; they’re intelligent only when actively engaged in thinking—which is a lot less often than we generally like to admit. A certain degree of tiredness, a strong emotion, or a good stiff drink are usually enough to shut off the intellect and leave us dealing with the world on the same mental basis as an ordinarily bright dog; it takes quite a bit more to reduce us to the vegetative level, and serious physical trauma to go one more level down. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s take a look at that final level, though. The conventional wisdom of our age holds that everything that exists is made up of something called “matter,” which is configured in various ways; further, that matter is what really exists, and everything else is somehow a function of matter if it exists at all. For most of us, this is the default setting, the philosophical opinion we start from and come back to, and anyone who tries to question it can count on massive pushback. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty here is that philosophers and scientists have both proved, in their own ways, that the usual conception of matter is quite simply nonsense. Any physical scientist worth his or her sodium chloride, to begin with, will tell you that what we habitually call “solid matter” is nearly as empty as the vacuum of deep space—a bit of four-dimensional curved spacetime that happens to have certain tiny probability waves spinning dizzily in it, and it’s the interaction between those probability waves and those composing that other patch of curved spacetime we each call “my body” that creates the illusions of solidity, color, and the other properties we attribute to matter. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The philosophers got to the same destination a couple of centuries earlier, and by a different route. The epistemologists I mentioned in last week’s post—Locke, Berkeley, and Hobbes—took the common conception of matter apart layer by layer and showed, to use the formulation we’ve already discussed, that all the things we attribute to matter are simply representations in the mind. Is there something out there that causes those representations? As already mentioned, yes, there’s very good reason to think so—but that doesn’t mean that the “something out there” has to consist of matter in any sense of the word that means anything. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s where Schopenhauer got to work, and once again, he proceeded by calling attention to certain very basic and common human experiences. Each of us has direct access, in a certain sense, to one portion of the “something out there,” the portion each of us calls “my body.” When we experience our bodies, we experience them as representations, just like anything else—but we also act with them, and as the experiment with the wiggling fingers demonstrated, the will that acts isn’t a representation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus there’s a boundary between the part of the universe we encounter as will and representation, and the part we encounter only as representation. The exact location of that boundary is more complex than it seems at first sight. It’s a commonplace in the martial arts, for example, that a capable martial artist can learn to feel with a weapon as though it were a part of the body. Many kinds of swordsmanship, for example, rely on what fencers call <i>sentiment de fer</i>, the “sense of the steel;” the competent fencer can feel the lightest touch of the other blade against his own, just as though it brushed his hand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are also certain circumstances—lovemaking, dancing, ecstatic religious experience, and mob violence are among them—in which under certain hard-to-replicate conditions, two or more people seem to become, at least briefly, a single entity that moves and acts with a will of its own. All of those involve a shift from the intellect to a more basic grade of the will, and they lead in directions that will deserve a good deal more examination later on; for now, the point at issue is that the boundary line between self and other can be a little more fluid than we normally tend to assume. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For our present purposes, though, we can set that aside and focus on the body as the part of the world each of us encounters in a twofold way: as a representation among representations, and as a means of expression for the will.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Everything we perceive about our bodies is a representation, but by noticing these representations, we observe the action of something that isn’t a representation, something we call the will, manifesting in its various grades. That’s all there is. Go looking as long as you want, says Schopenhauer, and you won’t find anything but will and representations. What if that’s all there is—if the thing we call "matter" is simpy the most basic grade of the will, and everything in the world thus amounts to will on the one hand, and representations experienced by that mode of will we call consciousness on the other, and the thing that representations are representing are various expressions of this one energy that, by way of its distinctive manifestations in our own experience, we call the will? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s Schopenhauer’s vision. The remarkable thing is how close it is to the vision that comes out of modern science. A century before quantum mechanics, he’d already grasped that behind the facade of sensory representations that you and I call matter lies an incomprehensible and insubstantial reality, a realm of complex forces dancing in the void. Follow his arguments out to their logical conclusion and you get a close enough equivalent of the universe of modern physics that it’s not at all implausible that they’re one and the same. Of course plausibility isn’t proof—but given the fragile, dependent, and derivative nature of the human intellect, it may be as close as we can get. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And of course that latter point is a core reason why Arthur Schopenhauer spent most of his life in complete obscurity and why, after a brief period of mostly posthumous superstardom in the late nineteenth century, his work dropped out of sight and has rarely been noticed since. (To be precise, it’s one of two core reasons; we’ll get to the other one later.) If he’s right, then the universe is not rational. Reason—the disciplined use of the grade of will I’ve called the intellect—isn’t a key to the truth of things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s simply the systematic exploitation of a set of habits of mind that turned out to be convenient for our ancestors as they struggled with the hard but intellectually undemanding tasks of staying fed, attracting mates, chasing off predators, and the like, and later on got pulled out of context and put to work coming up with complicated stories about what causes the representations we experience. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
To suggest that, much less to back it up with a great deal of argument and evidence, is to collide head on with one of the most pervasive presuppositions of our culture. We’ll survey the wreckage left behind by that collision in next week’s post. </div>

When the DMN is turned off, another network called the Tasking Mode Network (TMN) is activated.

Schweitzer criticized Descartes' identification of the naked intellect as the essential fact of existence as an arbitrary choice, observing that one might just as well say that I have a toothache, therefore I exist. Schweitzer claimed that by focusing on the intellectual level of thinking, rather than on the emotional level of pain (or pleasure), Descartes put philosophy on the road to endless abstraction and separation, a direction away from the ethical that was Schweitzer's principal concern. For the good doctor, the primary fact of existence was both concrete and relational: "I am will-to-live(exist) surrounded by other wills-to-live(exist)." Having written his doctoral dissertation on Kant, Schweitzer was well aware of the representational nature of reality, and it would have been interesting if he had dabbled a bit more in epistemology. Abruptly decisive, however, as Schweitzer tended to be, he came to the conclusion that such philosophical speculation bore little relationship to ethics, which could accordingly "let both space and time go to the devil." Would The Archdruid consider the field of ethics for the next series of philosophical explorations (I'm kind of new here, and if this has already been done, forgive me)? Is it possible, for example, to distill even further what Schweitzer determined to be the most elemental and universal ethical principle: reverence for life?<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c7779200116206640095 title="comment permalink">2/15/17, 4:27 PM</a><br><br>

You will some different condition because you desire said condition over the present condition. Desire implies consciousness. You need to be aware (to some degree ... even if asleep ... or a plant) of the current condition and the one that could be better.<br> <br>The general consensus of eastern philosophies is that consciousness or being (take your pick they do not always see a difference) is primary. This is not without its problems though; chief among them is that the term "consciousness" or "being" tends to get expanded to something it is (conventionally) not i.e. the "consciousness" one is not conscious of become the "subconscious" or the "potential for consciousness" or the being that does not exist (but could) is the "unmanifest" etc.<br><br>I'm wondering if the same tendency might afflict the use of the term "will" as used by Schopenhauer. For instance, if the thing in itself is will (I think you implied this?), and we are addressing something that is not human, not animal, and not plant, then whose will is it (just as we could ask who is conscious or who exists)? In this case we have perhaps stretched the definition of "will" in the same way "consciousness" or "being" has been stretched.<br><br>This doesn't mean Schopenhauer's way of thinking (or the others) is not valid though. I'm just suggesting some caution is advised.

Rather than saying that the world operates on rationality, though, I'd say that rationality does a fairly good job of modeling some aspects of the world as we represent it. It's useful rather than true -- but it can be very, very useful.

The fact that the brain shows a decision being made before the decision is expressed in action doesn't disprove "free will" -- we're probably going to have to discuss the weird way that the notion of free will has been twisted out of shape in recent discussions, but that's a subject for another time -- it simply shows that there's a lag time between when the will acts and when the effects show up as a representation. Equally, Schopenhauer would agree that the ego is a surface phenomenon -- specifically, it's the representation each of us have of our own character, which is again produced by the deeper reality of the will.

That wasn't the way things were explained to me in physics class back in the day. I'm going to call on the other scientists who read this blog to comment on this -- yea or nay? <br><br>James, you're raising good questions, which we'll be discussing as we proceed further -- and yes, that includes the "cash value." You're right that Schopenhauer's pessimism, or more precisely the way he shoehorns pessimism into a philosophy that doesn't actually call for it, is the other reason he's dropped from sight. Nietzsche's call for a "joyous knowledge" will be coming up on our radar screens in due time. <br><br>Joe, I haven't read Schweitzer for a very long time; thanks for the reminder. Yes, we'll be getting into ethics as this sequence of posts proceeds. <br><br>Agent, good. What Schopenhauer is saying is that the thing we call "will" is the distinctive manifestation, in our experience as human beings, of the thing-in-itself. Obviously it has qualities in its manifestation in us that are probably not present in its manifestations in rocks and raindrops, for example, and losing track of that is a good way to fall into colorful confusions. One value of the word "will," though, is that it implies that the "stuff" behind all our representations, and ourselves as well, is active rather than passive -- the importance of this will become clear a bit further on. <br><br>Christophe, that's the plan! Our first task is to get a good enough working map of the funhouse that directions to the exits will make some kind of sense; then we can talk through the directions; then we can consider ways to put the funhouse in its proper perspective as one of the many entertainments of the carnival of being...<br><br>Ruben, I really do have to do a post on the modern electronic Gnostics, don't I? Until we get there, yes, you can ignore them; like the Singularitarians, they're just taking an old religious idea and dolling it up in science fiction drag. <br><br>Justin, you're welcome. Schopenhauer spends most of part four of his first book on the states in which the will, as experienced by human beings, becomes quiescent; he sees those states as having immense importance -- and a very good case can be made that he's right.

Things progressed quickly, and in 1981 I had the good fortune to listen to the Dali Lama teach for 2 weeks; since I couldn't be a student of his, I conceived the idea to take wood as my teacher, and I came to see that wood has alot of integrity. A Japanese potter tuned me into feeling or knowing the material through my hands, directly. It might be said that the Tibetan or Himalayan Buddhists use "ritual to change consciousness in accordance with will", which is how you have elsewhere defined magic. I never incorporated any rituals into my daily woodworking - now I see I could have!<br><br>I did do some ritual work from the Vajrayana tradition, but I didn't really get the process. My approach might be described as "inconsistent" or even hesitant. Not surprisingly, I now feel like I'm weak willed. Still I can imagine that changing too.

I hope you won't take it remiss if I note that the very direction that you seem to be pointing to would not be unusual at my alma mater (a small Catholic college, where Schopenhauer was popular), and would be very much in line with Christianity, in the tradition of Sts Paul, Augustine, and Aquinas, who spent no small amount of time talking about the will as the core of being. I'm interested to see if you end up with a similar conclusion as we have, despite coming from a different direction altogether. <br><br>In my experience with magic practitioners, there was a lot of focus on developing willpower in the active sense. For instance, I knew a practitioner who would occasionally engage in a known addictive behavior (such as smoking) so that he could exercise his will in not partaking most of the time (it seemed to work for him, after a fashion). In Catholic circles, though, I see a lot more focus on Aristotle's old maxim that "We are what we repeatedly do." For us, there is a focus on developing habits of action so that the good actions penetrate down to our will, and make it easier for us to act virtuously. In your estimation, at what level of consciousness does the will operate, and are we able to affect it purposefully?<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c1779539342696744752 title="comment permalink">2/15/17, 7:18 PM</a><br><br>

Time is interesting when you think about it from the perspective of Schopenhauer's "will". It's passage is constant but it doesn't always feel constant. That is we perceive time. We know that things can undergo Lorentz contractions under conditions of, great mass, (great will) or fantastic speeds. The slowing of the passage of time near bodies of great mass, says to me that the Will, whatever that is, might be timeless. We know that near the speed of light time slows immensely, M=M_0/√(1-((V^2)/(C^2)) or T=T_0/√(1-((V^2)/(C^2)). Moving from the cold sterile lexicon of physics, empathy, is every bit as much a perspective as mere perspective of location. <br><br>I think someone screwed something up in the realm of physics shortly after Einstein made his contribution to physics. At the very least I think there's something fundamental we're missing or have outright wrong. In a sick way, I think that something is what the religion of progress is chasing, perceived as unlimited power. And I feel under no circumstances should the religion of progress be allowed to possess such primal knowledge. However I don't think it's something the religion of progress or materialism can ever posses because empathy, compassion, all the cliched feel good stuff, could be part of the view point needed to know the ether or will. <br><br>I'm going to have to meditate on this.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c5077212313825012850 title="comment permalink">2/15/17, 8:10 PM</a><br><br>

While you technically cannot say the wave function has probability at a certain position (because probability is for the pdf), the wave function does have values different (enough) from zero throughout the material, which for me would suffice for not calling that space between the nuclei vacuum.<br><br>In fact, in most materials it's impossible to discriminate between the electrons of one or the other "atoms", the electrons belong to all nuclei together (that's also why a molecule is a molecule and not the sum of several atoms. In high school chemistry, what's called e.g. mesomeric effect are additional rules to cover up the fact that molecules are not atoms dumbly chained together because of misfiring representation.)

I'm seeing how Western philosophy relates to the intense immersion of Eastern modes of knowledge I have gotten into in the past.<br><br>I have to say, though, that I've never been very comfortable with the term "will" being applied to what you're getting at. For one thing, it carries a strong connotation of the future. More than a connotation, actually, it's right there in the conjugation of most of our verbs. And I just can't come up with any reason why the fundamental core of our knowing and acting should carry that.<br><br>It also carries a certain sense of imposing one's personal desires (another meaning of "will" in the English language) or at least our personality on what's "outside" there that strikes me as unnecessarily Germanic in its aggressiveness.<br><br>My main teacher for many years in my life, my Chinese martial arts master, used the word "Mind" with the understanding that it is as removed from the activity of the human brain as it is to anything in the world of phenomena or illusion, which is what I believe you and Schopenhauer are calling "representation." He described it exactly as you did, as what happens in that motivating moment that action occurs. <br><br>There is some amount of philosophical, religious, and more recently, neurological evidence and reasoning that casts doubt on exactly how free that "will" is, how much its effects can be said to be in the control of the being possessing that will. Whether what you call "will" really resides in the individual or, for that matter, anywhere. And yet, somehow those who are more in "touch," whatever that means, (perhaps "adept" is a better word) do seem to be able to produce better outcomes for themselves than the rest of us, who seem to be at the mercy of a blind, unreasoning reality.<br><br>That's the core of my wondering, but I doubt you have in mind in this series of leading us through a process that normally takes many years of devoted study.

The practical dimension of your question, though, can be answered easily enough by reference to the relative fragility of the different grades of will: the higher the grade, the more fragile the effect. Thus if your act of will is only at the level of the intellect, it's probably not going to do much -- and which of us haven't experienced purely intellectual resolutions being brushed aside by the force of habit or passion! Get it down to the level of representation and it becomes less easy to dislodge; get it all the way down to the unthinking levels of the self, by way of establishing habits and the like, and it becomes all but immovable. <br><br>Dion Fortune talks approvingly about the way that once daily meditation becomes a habit, skipping a meditation leaves you as off balance as skipping a meal -- and she's quite correct, of course. So you can work with will at any level you wish, depending on how enduring you want the effects to be.<br><br>Yucca, it's been a very long time since I last read Peirce, and I'd have to review him in detail to be able to answer that part of your question. As for Crowley, well, I'm not a fan -- rather the opposite, in fact -- and so my view may be jaundiced; but it seems to me that any influence from Schopenhauer got pretty thoroughly garbled on the way through Crowley's mind (and other organs). "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law" is nonsense from a Schopenhauerian standpoint; if will is the thing-in-itself, the reality of which all representations are appearances, then how can you <i>not</i> do what thou wilt? To my mind, Crowley was drawing instead on Victorian notions of willpower; it's just that where the Victorians used willpower to resist temptation -- well, at least in theory -- Crowley used it to pursue temptation as fast as his legs would carry him. To my mind, that's not a useful difference.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c4490467773753164659 title="comment permalink">2/15/17, 10:52 PM</a><br><br>

I know from martial arts experiences, though, that it's quite possible to feel things at a pretty fair distance even when there's nothing but empty air between you and your partner. Glad to hear you're interested in Thibault, btw; when I first self-published the initial eight chapters, one of the first copies was snapped up by an SCA rapier fencer, who used the basic techniques to nail a whole series of white-sashed individuals (to their intense annoyance, I might add). It really is elegant stuff. <br><br>Ray, that's another good example, yes. <br><br>RPC, excellent! What do you mean by the word "ourselves," though?<br><br>Armata, that's certainly a direction in which inquiry could be carried out... ;-)<br><br>Nestorian, I won't argue a bit. Medieval philosophy has gotten a bum rap, and deserves much more respect than it's usually given. <br><br>Alfredo, on the level of the absolute, no doubt -- in Schopenhauer's terms, there is only will -- but none of us experience that level, you know, and in terms of the world you and I and the nearest stray poodle experience, there's value in the distinction between inside and outside the mind. As for your metaphor of infants, children, etc., sure -- but notice that there's a finite number of things added to the mind at each stage, and an infinite number of things in the universe. By your own argument, that would mean that an infinite number of stages of maturation would be needed in order to reach a state where everything is within the mind...<br><br>Austin, good. I'd agree that physics has gone rattling down a blind alley, but that's a topic for a different time. <br><br>Unknown Jonathan, funny! You're quite right, of course. <br><br>Brian, fascinating. I know essentially nothing about Mesoamerican philosophy, but it would follow from Spengler's thesis that it would have followed the same course as the other great traditions, including the same face-first collision with the limits of human knowledge that all philosophy has to face. <br><br>Fdr, interesting. Thank you. <br><br>HalFiore, do you happen to know which Chinese word for "mind" your teacher was thinking of? If it was <i>yi</i> (as in Hsing-Yi Ch'uan,) my understanding is that it has some of the same connotations of intention and direction as will, to the extent that some people translate <i>yi</i> "mind-will" or "intention." As for the location of the will, its character, and so on, we'll get to that. <br><br>Renaissance, interesting. The whole question of trance probably needs to come into this discussion in due time. <br><br>Grisom, fair enough; I don't speak mathematics, so will have to take your word for it. Certainly, though, when physicists try to communicate what they've found to the rest of us, they do seem to flail.

Might be the present discussion on philosophy would be a relevant place?<br><br>Yes, once while doing my regular routine of deep meditation I had one of those ‘deep’ experiences that somehow throw a bit of light on the workings of the mind. Four very distinct changes occurred. At that particular session I sat down in a comfortable yoga position with my head rolling free on top of my shoulders and began a simple process of distracting the thinking process (when it is distracted enough it goes away) by the effortless use of a simple ‘mantra’* (a word-sound of no inherent meaning).<br><br>Alright, so I close my eyes, sit for a while, I start noticing thoughts and after a while I just add the word-sound to the flow of thinking … an’ into The Deep I go! What happened this time was that as my mind relaxed and settled I suddenly had the thought “Where are my hands?”. Um? This is quite a common experience during the process of meditation. I wasn’t sure if I had them beside me or in my lap. Well “whatever”, I said (thought) to myself, “doesn’t matter.” I knew very well that I was doing a dive into my inner depths, nothing to worry about, I’d but have to open my eyes and verify the location of them hands. But why bother as I’m safe in my meditation posture, so I continued.<br><br>After a little while (as thinking grew more distracted, disjointed thoughts an’ all, the mantra sometimes there, sometimes not) I suddenly had the thought “Where am I? In my living room at home? In my bedroom? Somewhere else? Hm? I didn’t know, but I knew I but had to open my eyes to verify the surroundings, and yet I felt no need to do so, just a slight urge which I just let go of by not opening my eyes, and I added just a slight attention to the word-sound and off deeper I am towards that unspecified ‘inner’ field.<br><br>Then after a while I suddenly had the thought “When is this?” Um? What year? Well no bother I thought, I can open my eyes to check. But why step out of the process? So I stayed, not opening my eyes. Everything about the inner field had now grown slightly fuzzy, thoughts becoming hazy, drifting away by themselves. (The easy effortless use of the mantra is thus distracting the thought flow up to a point where thinking seemingly doesn’t bother trying to catch my attention anymore.)<br><br>Then the fourth stage arrived. I suddenly had the thought “What is my name?” Um?? I knew I know my name, but, but, nothing came. “Open your eyes and check,” the lure of thinking said to me, but why would I bother. I am having a break from activity, no reason to break the inward progression, I’ll remember when I finish this session. And that I did of course.<br><br>After this fourth distinction arrived I flowed out into something I of course cannot put my finger on. Any attempt to do so would have shattered this subtle experience of being here, there, everywhere, and nowhere at the same time. I stayed in that ‘undefined’ state for almost an hour … the clock told me so when I came out of it all<br><br>As I was sitting in a good position my mind sort of stayed awake (I didn’t have to reference the awakity, so to say :) ) with absolutely nothing to fill it, not even nothingness. An’ it felt good. Coming out of this state was quite blissful, I was feeling refreshed, oh so refreshed!<br><br>So what happened? I must have traversed the mental categories of thing, place, time, and ego. These really being quite illusive experiences I realized afterwards as I contemplated my dive into The Deep.<br><br><br>*“The word ‘mantra’ stems from the Sanskrit verbal root ‘man’ meaning “to think, ponder”. <br>The suffix ‘tra’ indicates instrumentality.”<br>“The Spiritual Heritage of Ancient India”, Feuerstein, Kak och Frawley , 2001, p. 189.<br><br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c7743012531807290978 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 2:05 AM</a><br><br>

You can explain to novices the theory of picking a pin-tumbler lock and the proper use of the lockpick and the tension wrench, and no matter how hard they try to apply what they've just learned, the lock will not open for them. Have them put on a blindfold and try again, and often as not the lock pops open almost on the first attempt. -- Shut down sight, and unused senses wake up. (Shut down hearing, too, and the senses wake up even more. Refuse to use words at all for a while, even inside one's own head, and other useful things wake up, too.) <br><br>When I teach the sort of magic I learned growing up in my family, I often start with lock-picking, which requires transgressing not just the norms of our conventional society -- it's a kind of forbidden knowledge --, but the norms of how we use our senses and our bodies to affect the world in which we live. Another magical teacher might, I dare say, start by teaching a novice the art of the sword, with much the same effect.<br><br>Another early lesson I teach early-on is the art of cold-reading, as developed by stage magicians and con-artists. Cold reading equally counts as "forbidden knowledge." Much forbidden knowledge involves learning to wake up senses and develop abilities that one is not supposed to possess at all, or even that are not supposed to exist at all, even as possibilities. <br><br>I suppose that might count as "altering consciousness in accord with will," but when you toss Dion Fortune's definition of magic around, most people hear that part of it as meaning "expanding consciousness ..." just in the sense that a psychedelic can expand consciousness. That's far too narrow a meaning, and one that limits a magician's reach. <br><br>The "self" is a very tricky thing, indeed. In my own experience, drawing on the magic I learned as a boy, a body has many more than one self, though most of the selves sleep soundly in most people. (Even the selves that are awake are usually very drowsy.) A magician needs to explore her many selves, learn how to wake them up from their slumbers and also how to put them back to sleep. These selves have different abilities, different strengths and weaknesses. The more of one's selves one gets to know, the more one becomes able to shape one's own life into a thing of beauty and strength.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c477781588416476675 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 2:41 AM</a><br><br>

Didn't Carl Sagan attempt that trick by claiming that somehow extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence? Of course it is not polite to speak ill of the dead (they may come back and get us after all!) but I did also note that he retained the right to determine what was extraordinary and what was not and was not allowing himself to be subject to such a harsh critique.<br><br>Spin, spin, spin. That is the sound of my head spinning around and around with all of the many ideas that you wrote about this week. Of course that unfortunate child in the Exorcist film pulled that trick too and it didn't work out so well for them either! I will have to re-read your essay. <br><br>So the thing I don't understand is how can we as humans know that we are the only ones with life, consciousness, and intellect? It seems a very big call to me to suggest that that is in fact the case.<br><br>And the other thing that comes to mind is I suspect that we can exercise a little bit of independent will on matter, but not nearly as much as we would believe if questioned on the subject. I've often had the sneaking suspicion that a lot of people (not everyone and not all of the time either) are operating on what I call auto-pilot a lot of the time and where is the free will in that? Auto-pilot is a huge collection of cultural programming and narratives, although I'm probably far off the mark with my thinking in that regard.<br><br>Does it matter that I am not overly concerned that matter as an incomprehensible and insubstantial reality, a realm of complex forces dancing in the void?

Their conception of matter is much more sophisticated than Newtonian billiard balls knocking each other around. They fully allow for all kinds of quantum weirdness and exotic states of matter that the wizards who work in theoretical physics departments have dreamed up. <br><br>I happen to disagree with Schopenhauer's metaphysics, on the basis that I distrust any philosophy based purely on another person's introspection. A century of experience in psychology and neuroscience should have taught us that people's intuitions aren't as reliable as we think, especially when it comes to questions involving the ultimate nature of reality. Perceptions and impressions that seem 'obvious' and 'natural', such as those that underlie feelings of intentionality and consciousness, are something that the brain works very hard to generate, and we know a lot more about how it does it than we did in the 1830s. <br><br>On the subject of consciousness, have you ever chanced upon Colin McGinn's book The Mysterious Flame? He goes through all the current theories about the nature of consciousness, from reductive materialism to idealism and panpsychism, and finds them all lacking. His position has been described as 'mysterianism': that the brain generates conscious states in a way that we're fundamentally unequipped to understand.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c8487622246485406798 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 3:06 AM</a><br><br>

It seems to fit in. The night before I read last week’s post I experienced a dream/disturbance. As it developed in intensity I heard my wife telling me to wake up. But I was too busy resisting whatever – perhaps farm animals – trying to come through a door I was trying to keep shut. Nothing unusual about the metaphor and etc., but I must have been particularly noisy. This dual state went on for more than a few seconds, until ‘my will’ clicked in and made the move into waking. I responded to the external signal.<br><br>Perhaps also of significance: many years ago during a phase requiring intense introspection I realised that ‘cause and effect’ was not what it seemed and that C&amp;E had no convincing intellectual explanation, or at least not a material one.

It seems a sneaky way to imply that humans are somehow separate/superior to the rest of life, and to endow ourselves with an "extra" grade of will.<br><br>Whereas, it seems to me that the relationship between Schopenhauer's "grades" can be just as accurately understood using a metaphor based on fractals. <br><br>For example:<br>"For example, each of us stops being conscious for some hours out of every day, whenever we go to sleep. During part of the time we’re sleeping, we experience nothing at all; during another part, we experience the weirdly disconnected representations we call “dreams.” Even in dreamless sleep, though, it’s common for a sleeper to shift a limb away from an unpleasant stimulus. Thus the will is active even when consciousness is absent."<br><br>To my mind, the will that shifts a limb in sleep is simply not the same will that moves that limb through a day's worth of purposes. The first is nested within the second, a conscious (to itself) sub-body system that consciously keeps watch in a sense not accessible (therefore "unconscious") to the whole-body that sleeps, and both could be nested within a third, via the same process you described later on here:<br><br>"There are also certain circumstances—lovemaking, dancing, ecstatic religious experience, and mob violence are among them—in which under certain hard-to-replicate conditions, two or more people seem to become, at least briefly, a single entity that moves and acts with a will of its own."<br><br>I don't think such composite, willed, single-entities made of smaller willed sub-units are that hard to replicate, because I believe that *I* am exactly such a being.<br><br>The effects *my* will has on the world are primarily effected by the motions of *my* body, yet I cannot will my pancreas to produce more insulin, for example. I do believe that the cells which take charge of insulin production and release do so consciously and in accordance with *their* individual wills and informed by *their* representations of their purposes/environments/circumstances, in which *I* appear as, perhaps, a distant rumble of thunder, if at all. <br><br>That will, purpose, consciousness and action can arise just as easily and completely from single agents or composite agents, is reflected in Donald D Hoffman's equation: 1+1=1. The composite will can act as one, without changing the fact that the component wills can continue to act as many. <br><br>Hoffman also uses the term "user interface" when discussing representation, and this usage makes a lot of sense to me. If you had to comprehend every aspect of how electron gating and pixel storage worked inside your computer it would quickly become non-functional for you. But if there is an image (representation) of a folder in the left hand corner of a screen activated by a complicated dance of lights, and you interact with that image, it allows you to do something useful, in accordance with your will. You can use it to open the draft of your letter to your beloved, for example, and labour over it some more. <br><br>If representations (in Schopenhauer's sense) are user-friendly interfaces to the world, that enable a will to move forward and accomplish its purposes within it, then they are both useful and true, despite being "false" in almost every way. (your computer contains nothing at all that resembles a folder, or a love letter, after all).<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c4758465417699332426 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 6:13 AM</a><br><br>

You have a talent for boiling down these fairly abstruse concepts into immediately available tropes -- in a way you are like Greg Louganis and you make this stuff seem easier than it actually is!<br><br>I struggle with the immediacy of our experience of the will, the non-reflective way we experience it. I think it is because every time the term, "will," shows up, the moral and ethical philosophers want to talk about its freedom (or lack thereof). They construct a scenario with your wiggling fingers and say, "I see my finger go up, in accordance with my intentions to move it in that direction. I could have moved it down, or to the right, had I so chosen to do so. I can imagine a scenario where I intended my finger to go up and it didn't move at all, or moved downward, or to the left, and the effect of such an event on my emotions surrounding how I've come to rely on control over my fingers."<br><br>Of course, this thought experiment trying to tease out the nature of freedom of intention, and conflating the intention with the will itself, recasts our immediate experience of the will in a reflective sense and turns it into a representation, which is the source of the confusion. The language reflects this. When the finger moves in the direction you intended it to move, "I moved my finger upwards." When the finger moves in a direction that doesn't accord to how you remember your intention, "my finger moved downwards," shifting the source of the will from "I" to "my finger."<br><br>Good stuff.

Daniel Dennet is the main proponent of this idea. This has always struck me as ridiculous since consciousness seems like the one thing I can know for sure. Though this week's blog has made me see that will is more primary. These might not be the best metaphors, but denying consciousness/will seems like saying, "words don't exist" "or "I can't type". I have not read Consciousness Explained, but the critiques I have read of it make me think he deals with "the hard problem" (the description you have sketched out of will and consciousness) with a lot of hand waving by insisting the problem does not exist.<br><br>After reading last week's blog I thought of your classifications of art and the extent to which it it applies to philosophy. I can't come up with low brow and kitsch (perhaps The Secret fits in there), but Heidegger is definitely high brow trash and Derrida is warhol. I tried reading Heidegger and came to the same conclusion as you. When I read Derrida I actually found some of it enjoyable, because I did not take it seriously. It is more like Discordian poetry than philosophy. It seems to me like he was playing with the confusion in the field and poking fun at it which I enjoy, even if it was not very useful in terms of being actual philosophy. I have an amusing story about my encounter with Derrida's writing that I might share at some point if it seems relevant. Perhaps when you get to talking about some of the consequences of ignoring Kant.<br><br>Speaking of Kant, critique of pure reason's discussion of antinomies influenced me a lot when I was younger and helped me break out of some of the rational grid lock that can occur when two people have equally rational arguments on different sides of an issue.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c3044541692408232732 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 6:41 AM</a><br><br>

Steiner after I saw you mention it in a response. what a mind blowing read! Games People Play is in the mail. Mr Steiner goes into quite a bit of detail about the structure of the psyche; discussing in depth the Natural Child, Little Professor, Pig Parent, Adult and Nurturing Parent. These are all different voices in the head and all of them can be cathected, ie lead to physical action being expressed. will is often talked about as singular, but it appears to me as structurally a bit more complex since each organ of the psyche has its own distinct voice and causes different sorts of actions in the world. Or maybe will is less of an organ and more of a membrane which the various impulses generated by the organs of the psyche have to pass through it in order to translate in action.<br><br>It seems a distinctly important question of psychic anatomy whether there is one will within the individual or various wills that compete to become manifest in the world, at least in terms of endogenous will(s). With external wills influencing an individual will they seem like they would manifest through various organs based on degrees of structural resonance; Natural Child would be the conduit for religious experience coming through a deity, Little Professor would be where people exert dream logic on another or ghosts would enter, Adult would be where concepts are exerted and Nurturing Parent would be where new moral codes could perch. Of course the Pig Parent is a tape recording of the will exerted on the maturing child by caretakers. This is a sloppy correspondence, but I think highlights the argument for several discrete wills rather than a singular one. This too would then have broad applicability in healing and magic; rather than a blunt will there could be a more pointed application to the correct organ. This is at least my current understanding based on my readings and reflections, I'm curious for your thoughts John Michael Greer and other experienced mages and philosophers.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c1727847010357648051 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 7:05 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. <br><br>An observation if I may. His conception of Will as 'the most basic grade of matter' (as you elegantly put it) is similar to a way of thinking about how the Tao Te Ching describes the Way or Tao. As Schopenhauer goes on to assert that everything we see is a representation of one fundamental underlying Will, the Tao can be read to describe the world as 'hidden but always present.' Meister Eckhart got to a similar place from the medieval Christian mystical tradition too, which is interesting, as did the Neoplatonists.

Et tu JMG! You too feel the need to prop up Schopenhauer's (and yours) philosophy by claiming closeness to the so-called vision of modern science i.e. quantum mechanics. There are way too many pitfalls here but one of the easiest to point out is that the "vision of modern science" after all is scientific materialism. Are you suggesting then that Schopenhauer's philosophy is close to that?<br><br>What Grisom said in his comment is quite accurate - the mathematics of quantum mechanics is incomprehensibly complex, and yet is unbelievably accurate in its prediction of behavior at the quantum level. No philosophical problem arises because we do not know the nature of fundamental<br>particles - if knowing is the same as having a mathematical model then we know them very well indeed. For example, there is nothing uncertain about the Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle - please see the first few paragraphs of the Wikipedia entry on the Uncertainty Principle to understand what I am saying. These are mathematically very well defined phenomena.<br><br>A philosophical problem arises because one cannot extrapolate from the microscopic quantum level to the macroscopic without a whole lot of hand waving (and simplifying assumptions). In other words, the complexity of life we experience cannot be deduced from the mathematics of the so-called fundamental level.<br><br>I do not know if Schopenhauer's philosophy is or isn't comparable to the vision of modern science. Given that both are reductionist it is always possible to say one is similar to the other. But while quantum mechanics is precise, will, consciousness, life, et al are, as Grisom implies, imprecise and incoherent. What happens when you draw a similarity between a precise entity and one that is fuzzy and ill understood ? The precise entity will walk away with the prize which in this case is the "nature of reality". When that happens (as it has happened), your case against a rationalistic world view is weakened considerably since the precise mathematics was the result of rational thought after all.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c9187101247655678246 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 8:26 AM</a><br><br>

Reason—the disciplined use of the grade of will I’ve called the intellect—isn’t a key to the truth of things." How then would Schopenhauer account for the phenomenon known as "the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics"? ("unreasonable" here obviously being used in a different sense..)<br><br>In the math classes I teach, I often tell the story of Evariste Galois--a tragic, fascinating figure in the history of math-- who laid the foundation of a branch of math known as Abstract Algebra. It was a "pure" branch of math totally disconnected from the physical world (as far as Evariste could tell). Some 150 years after his death, it turns out that Abstract Algebra held the key to Peter Higgs' ability to predict the existence of the Higgs Boson... in other words, math, pursued purely as an exercise in rational thinking, was able to describe a physical phenomena totally unrelated to the experiences of the person doing the reasoning and in a completely different time and place. <br><br>This seems to me to be something deeper than just the abstractions we all agree upon based on (seemingly) shared experiences such 2 and 2 being 4... how would the philosophy you're describing account for this?

I've been doing a lot of work recently pondering exactly where the Will merges with other Wills. When you read the words of another, it's almost like a form of telepathy, but perhaps even more intimate because you read <i>their</i> words in <i>your</i> voice. I've ultimately come to a conclusion like this: just as what we experience as ourselves is a composition of smaller organisms, so we too are component parts of greater organisms. Racial/genetic; nation-state; even, perhaps, divinities. This isn't quite the direction I wanted to go with this stuff. What I really want to understand is what means we have at our disposal to reassure ourselves that personal self-hood can transcend death. It's a little easier to imagine a great ape of sufficient sophistication reincarnating as a human, but much harder to imagine a muscle cell accomplishing the same feat. For animals, our behavior might seem almost completely inexplicable, but at least they can actually <i>perceive</i> us.

Despite what the teacher professed, I found western philosophers to be extremely long-winded and meandering. I appreciate your more concise explanation of their findings. I can only imagine how many hours, days, years it has taken you to digest their writings to the point where you can make sense of them for others. With this said, I am sure you have considered Representation and Will to be versions of the eastern concepts of Yin and Yang, respectively. Either way, I look forward to next week's post.

However, the argument that otherwise there should be 'a perfect match between the contents of the world and the contents of our minds' is not convincing. Anyone who has listened to the imaginary stories of children knows that it's perfectly common for there to be irreconcilable inconsistencies among and even within those stories. Since there is no such 'perfect match' even within their own fantasies, I see no reason to believe that the lack of a match to the contents of the world demonstrates anything. Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems to me that this argument is based on a false assumption.<br><br>The second argument, that will is not itself a representation, seems true to me, but is much too narrowly circumscribed. Why not consider hunger, or the drive for sex, or terror? These are all things that can be experienced without any representation required; after all, we see them clearly in animals that are too young or inexperienced or simple for them to be representations. Even in humans, hunger can kill you one before you've had the chance to learn any kind of representation, so clearly it is not just in one's head. Again, maybe I'm missing something, but in this case it seems that 'will' is being given a primacy that's not obviously deserved.<br><br>I also have issues with the argument about the relationship between will and consciousness, and the varieties of will, but I'll hold off with that until I understand where I've gone wrong (or not) with the above before going there...<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c6058363073482744435 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 9:37 AM</a><br><br>

In the created things for Maximus, the will seems to come out of their logoi, that is, their teleological element given them by the Logos. Will may underlie rationality for us, but in this understanding will also rises out of it, and our use of reason is fulfilling our proper ends. Maximus was mostly concerned with the question of the Christ of Orthodox theology, but in order to answer the question he had a lot to say about human experience, as well; Maximus recognized the conditioning nature of the will and its habits on our perceptions and behaviors and that it was more primary than intellect in us. These conditions of the human will are what make it different from the Divine Will, and why a fully human Christ had to possess a human will. I've long thought there's a thesis for a theologian or historian of philosophy in comparing Schopenhauer and Maximus— but try finding people who can read both with sympathy!<br><br>As I'm more sympathetic to Maximus than Schopenhauer, I've always thought Schopenhauer made the error of looking at the limits of philosophy as the limits of phenomenology(— to be fair, Schopenhauer was an excellent phenomenologist). If we look at the human will as somehow susceptible to <i>bad habits</i> (hard to deny), we can see the problem with reading the bad habits of our will onto the structure of reality, which is I think where Schopenhauer errs. That reason is epiphenomenal for us does not make it so for the World, though the former is enough to take most of Schopenhauer's prescriptions seriously.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c157954918744953066 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 10:10 AM</a><br><br>

But your will doesn't. When you move your fingers it looks to me just like any other external event. Hypothetically, with the right equipment I could see the neural impulses that predict whether and when your fingers will move. There's plenty of room for disagreement on that hypothesis, but looking at a thermostat, for instance, or the mechanisms by which plants orient themselves toward sunlight, or the functioning of the exactly 302 neurons of the roundworm nervous system, I don't see any basis for perceiving those entities' will as anything separate from representations of increasingly complex configurations of cause and effect.<br><br>If everything (-in-itself) is will then there's no ultimate dichotomy, of course. But that seems a very ambitious conclusion to reach based on a perception of the subjectively special nature of such a tiny fraction of all the will that must (barring solipsism) exist. Metaphorically: every instance of visible light I perceive directly is one that has entered my eyes, but there's enough evidence for self-other symmetry to make me more than a little reluctant to conclude that all light in the universe converges toward my eyes (or emanates from them).<br><br>On the other hand, in general you and I tend to take different paths to reach similar conclusions. There's nothing in my view that insists that the universe must be rational. Why expect a bunch of interacting material stuff to be any such thing?

For instance, “It required an enormous effort of will for her to overcome the obstacle” or “Then the morphine took effect and he lost consciousness.”<br><br>However, when we use such words to refer to 'ultimate reality' we are very far from ordinary usage. That does not mean, as many linguistic philosophers have claimed, that their use in such contexts is nonsense. It just means that their meaning has to be heavily qualified by other ordinary words, in order for them to do the work we want to assign to them. That, after all, is how any technical language is created, including scientific language.<br><br>JMG has pointed out some problems with using the word 'consciousness' to refer to ultimate reality. That is to be expected. Ordinary usage will have to be modified in order for the word to become useful. However, 'will' has similar problems. For instance, in everyday use, 'will' implies an action taken against some sort of resistance. (See my example above.) But if there is a resistance, either there must be something other than will that is resisting it, so that will is not the ultimate reality, or there must already be two wills, one of which is resisting the other. In that case a single will, on its own, would have nothing to resist it and would not, in ordinary usage, constitute will.<br><br>There is an even more fundamental problem. In normal usage you cannot effect an act of will unless you are conscious. (Legally that is axiomatic.) So consciousness must be prior to will.<br><br>So both will and consciousness, as concepts in ordinary language, have to be severely modified in order to be useful in the context of ultimate reality. I suggest that, when both are sufficiently modified, they both may actually refer to the same thing. Which we choose is a matter of preference.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c7848065521884900879 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 10:53 AM</a><br><br>

The outcome of their particular style of meditation, if it can be described at all, may be referred to as 'consciousness only'.<br><br>JMG advocates a different style, namely discursive meditation. As far as I know, Schopenhauer did not meditate in any formal sense. (If he had done he might have been less grumpy!) However, it may be possible to consider his philosophising as a sort of discursive meditation, and this would presumably have been far more similar to the discursive meditation practised by JMG than to Indian practice.<br><br>Wittgenstein was a supporter of Schopenhauer's ideas in his youth. Whether he held the same views later in his career is less clear, but he does not appear to have attacked them in the way that he attacked his own early ideas. Like Schopenhauer, he did not formally meditate so far as I know, but again his philosophising could be considered a sort of discursive meditation.<br><br>Such a difference of meditation styles between the 'consciousness only' of the ancient Indians and the discursive style of JMG, Schopenhauer and (very early) Wittgenstein may underlie the preference of the former for consciousness as the 'ultimate reality' and that of the latter for 'will'. They may be referring to the same thing but using the conceptual apparatus they are familiar with.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c6947135681989154986 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 10:55 AM</a><br><br>

When people ask whether a cat or a fungus is a living thing, they are not asking a question about metaphors and handwaving imperfect analogies, they are asking about an ordinary category or class, one which is useful in the same way as lots of other classes like 'weapon' or 'literate'. Classifications can turn out to have corner cases where they don't work very well. (Is a virus a living thing? It reproduces ... but only in the presence of other living things, by hijacking them.) That doesn't make them metaphors, or make them occasionally-useful imperfect analogies like thinking of a state as an organism, or thinking of propaganda as a weapon; they are ordinary classifications.<br><br>The kind of interference patterns that you can occasionally see even in preindustrial life (rainbow-ish effects on oil slicks) and more commonly in modern life (rainbow-ish patterns on optical media like compact disks, and characteristic "laser speckle" shifting patterns in small laser spots on flat surfaces) are very characteristic of things in the wave category, things governed by wave equations.<br><br>Light acting more like a particle than a wave isn't conspicuous in our everyday experience but it shows up in experiments which were routine more than a century ago, notably the photoelectric effect. It's also only slightly under the surface in how radiation up and down the electromagnetic spectrum affects inanimate materials and living things: visible light has enough energy per photon to break some kinds of chemical bonds, harder and harder ultraviolet light breaks a larger and larger proportion of them, very hard UV and X rays and gamma rays shred them, and going the other way along the spectrum things like microwaves tickle them so gently that the effect can't be teased out of the gross heating effect.<br><br>The fuzziness in categorization between wave and particle is not because of inherent vagueness or looseness of metaphoric analogy, it's because it turns out that like a surprising number of other physical properties, the category starts acting weird under extreme physical conditions. To pick one of many examples from the physics of the first half of the twentieth century, the mass of a particle turns out to increase when it travels at high speed, and increase without bound as it approaches the speed of light. That doesn't make mass a loose metaphorical concept, it means that the concept of mass (and category of "thing with mass", etc.) turns out to be more complicated than we thought in the general case. (But the new equations with a dozen or so terms in them give results as precisely correct as the experimentalists have ever been able to measure, and the old simple-case rules with just three or four terms in them turn out to become more and more exactly true the further one is from the speed of light, as a consequence of the general-case rules in a simple way.)<br><br>In the case of wave vs. particle, experiments where one simple case or the other dominates fall out of the general case in a similarly natural way. It's not a metaphor, any more than "turbulent flow" or "laminar flow" is a metaphor in fluid mechanics --- it's a category which correctly describes a large set of special cases, a set of special cases so large that it's not hard to spend one's entire in it accidentally. (E.g., lensmakers seldom need to worry about whether light is not a wave, because for them it always acts so much like a wave it makes no difference.)<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c8066080573726767661 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 11:06 AM</a><br><br>

It seems to me that there is a great deal more overlap between different grades and fuzziness between them, especially when it involves will that encompasses more than one being.<br><br>One example is mother-infant synchrony. With a breastfeeding, cosleeping mother-infant dyad, there's way more going in in sleep than even the mother usually realizes. There's all kinds of feeding, soothing, protecting, and adjusting going on. Further, the mother usually wakes up about 5 minutes before the child does. This effect seems somewhat attenuated by distance but not completely. I've experienced this myself at naptimes; even with a weaned three-year old I find that I get restless and start to wrap up what I'm involved in just before he wakes from a nap in another room.<br><br>Another example is the bacterial intelligence involved in the development of antibiotic resistance. Stephen Buhner has a good discussion of it in several of his books (I would quote them but they are in the same other room with the napping preschooler). Basically there's some good research that the bacteria are working together in something that looks to me a lot like experimental science, iterating different attempts to defeat antibiotics, sharing their results with each other, and then improving on those results. It all happens far faster than pure natural selection would.<br><br>And is there a will specific to an entire species? Gordan White and Stephen Buhner both describe something like "plants on a mission" where a species of plant seems, as a species, to display very purposive behavior in moving to a new place or performing a specific function in an ecosystem.<br><br>So it seems like there is a lot more going on here than the grades of will described. And I guess we can't know if other beings abstract and represent things the same way we do, but maybe that doesn't matter? Like, it seems clear that that's the human mind's quirk of evolution, but there's no reason to think that it's "higher" as far as I can see, if other beings get good results by whatever methods they are doing.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c9152241945209087173 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 1:33 PM</a><br><br>

They got people to agree that while watching some movement on a screen, colored balls say, they would press a button when they saw a blue one. They were also to mark the moment when they were aware that they had made a decision to push that button. And they found that in fact the cascade of preparation to push the button was visible in the brains of the participants before they were consciously aware of deciding to push it. From this they concluded we do not have free will. But I ask, in that case, why did the person comply with the rules of the experiment? If we had no free will, they would not be randomly pushing the button at the right time. <br><br>To me this simply means that as a whole person, there are parts of our minds that we don't fully understand. I thought of examples. One decides to drive somewhere, becomes lost in thought, and suddenly looking up, is not sure where on the road one is – but there has been no deviation from the decision of where to go. In fact, sometimes one actually does better if not thinking “consciously” about what to do. I used to play tennis, and would unconsciously switch the racket to the other hand, probably because I'm left handed. Another player noted it as strange. After that, I tried to do it sometimes, but usually flubbed it. But if it happened without my planning it, it went well. Double digging in the garden with my husband, my job was to pick up the stones and toss them into a bucket. I missed a lot. Then, I took a different tactic, and simply stared at the spot I wished the stones to go, and gave no thought to the throwing. Rarely missed. Does that mean I gave up my free will? In that case, who was it that was doing these things, and why were they perfectly in alignment with what I had decided consciously to do? Then I thought, heck, I don't need these exotic examples. I might decide to walk out to the mailbox, but I don't consciously decide to put each leg in front of the other!<br><br>Therefore, I don't think it is correct to say we are unconscious because we are in dreamless sleep. If the alarm rings or someone shouts our name, we wake up. So there is a tether.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c5333390444010502950 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 3:53 PM</a><br><br>

This is truly interesting as I considered that the eastern philosophers were right that it is consciousness. But I am trying to deeply consider Schopenhauer's view. That which Schopenhauer called different grades of will, I had called levels of consciousness. The reason I am willing to consider his opinion, is that in my own musings about the difference between animate and inanimate objects I decided that at root, all living things have what I called desire or motivation. Inanimate objects appear to have none. The simplest living things all possess it. Motivation and will are of course synonymous here.<br><br>But the watcher can be active without any apparent willing. Can the will be active without that there is a conscious being?<br>Then again, if consciousness is the ability to experience representations, then without things there could be nothing to be conscious of. <br>I am in this context not sure what to make of the argument that if one can see an object it is “in the way” and therefore a resistance to one's will. Am I right that Nietzsche was a reader of Schopenhauer? Because he made much of will.<br><br>But to say that love is an expression of will!

Go looking as long as you want, says Schopenhauer, and you won’t find anything but will and representations. What if that’s all there is—if the thing we call "matter" is simply the most basic grade of the will, and everything in the world thus amounts to will on the one hand, and representations experienced by that mode of will we call consciousness on the other, and the thing that representations are representing are various expressions of this one energy that, by way of its distinctive manifestations in our own experience, we call the will? <br>That’s Schopenhauer’s vision. The remarkable thing is how close it is to the vision that comes out of modern science."<br><br>Certainly I am not against the idea that everything is (ahem) onething. But I'm not sure how Schopenhauer got there. Nor why you say modern science has as well, since they generally consider that all is matter, albeit that matter is as yet undefined and very weird. Even if all things are experienced as representations, they are still out there, and we don't know how they got there.

Not a native Chinese speaker, and having gained a lot of the insights that brought him to his level of understanding through intense meditative practices from a range of cultural traditions, he usually took pains in those days (the 70s and 80s) to avoid using non-English terms. The Bay Area in those days had a lot of people running around blowing smoke up people's behinds and using exotic foreign terms to the point that they often devolved into forms of jargon that more often endarkened than enlightened. <br><br>"Hsin" was certainly another important mind-concept he was aware of, hence the name of the school, "Cheng Hsin." But in his use of the word "mind," it was probably closer to what you are talking about. He used to deliver an amusing talk that included someone unsuccessfully yelling at their hand to try to get it to move. Your illustration reminded me of that, but his use also made room for the ability to be in a mind-space (utterly insufficient term, but I don't have time for a book) that not only encompassed the origin of our movement, but that of an other. Hence the ability to act before cognition and join or move appropriately to the movement of an "opponent." Which probably sounds far-fetched, but I have first-hand experience of it.<br><br>That usually required a lot of "hsin" work, because what blocks the ability to do that often has its roots in "heart" issues, but I think what it is that he was getting at is more "i," if that helps. In the early years, he referred to his fighting "style" as "I Ch'uan."<br><br>Here's a link to his current work, much has changed since my days. He's using the word "Zen" a lot, and I sort of understand why when you're trying to give people something somewhat familiar to hang a meaning on, but it's not in any way any kind of orthodox or unorthodox Zen Buddhism.<br><br>http://chenghsin.com/chenghsin-main.html<br><br>Anyway, a remarkable individual to say the least.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c3136093735289438627 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 5:15 PM</a><br><br>

After reading this, it’s obvious why. If Schopenhauer is right, then Will is the fundamental element in the Cosmos, the “stuff” that everything is made of, for lack of a better analogy. Dion Fortune famously defined magic as the science of causing changes in consciousness in according with will. <br><br>- From a monotheistic perspective, God could be defined as the Ultimate Will, the Will so powerful and creative it creates all other wills as the Supreme Act of Will.<br><br>- Schopenhauer’s philosophy makes the Great Chain of Being tenable again. If there is an Ultimate Will, which we know as God, the Divine Source or what have you and at least four levels of will that we can see in the physical world, then it would make sense, as I suggested earlier, that there are other levels of will that are higher than the conscious human mind but lower than the Divine Source. <br><br>- This also suggests that monotheism and polytheism may not be incompatible after all, as many Classical and Indian philosophers have argued. There can be both an Ultimate Will which is the source of all other wills, and many lesser wills that are nevertheless much higher and much more powerful than the will of even the most developed human being. Some of those wills we call gods for lack of a better term. This is in fact what I believe. There were a number of Christian thinkers, including JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis, who appeared to have had similar views.<br><br>- Julius Evola discusses the idea in the Revolt Against the Modern World that there are two main paths a soul can take after the physical death of the body, what he calls the Path of the Gods and the Path of the Ancestors. He derives this idea from certain Hindu teachings, but one finds the same basic idea in Gurdjieff and some other esoteric traditions. <br><br>In the Path of the Gods, the consciousness personality survives death and goes on to a higher state of existence while retaining conscious awareness during the process. In the Path of the Ancestors, the person’s consciousness dissipates and sinks back into the collective unconscious, where it merges with that of others who have undergone the Path of the Ancestors and becomes the raw material out of which new human wills are created through a process of metempsychosis. The personality does not survive death in this case. <br><br>The difference, viewed in light of Schopenhauer, is that those who attain the Path of the Gods are those who were able to develop their will to a high enough degree that their consciousness remains intact and does not dissipate after death, while those who go through the Path of the Ancestors were those who did not attain that level of development, so their will dissolves after death.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c1663731999894902546 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 5:37 PM</a><br><br>

Most of the arguments for plant intelligence I've seen so far are actually arguments for plant will -- that is, demonstrations that they take action to meet their needs and ward off dangers. But I'll suspend judgment until I read it. <br><br>Lordyburd, the point Schopenhauer makes is that the will in its various forms (including consciousness) is the only thing other than representation that we encounter, we have no justification for believing in the existence of matter once that concept is subjected to close analysis, and we can infer, from observing our representations, that a great many of our representations are caused by things that have the same character of will we encounter in our own bodies. Since we've got no evidence that anything exists but will and the representations it creates, why drag in some third thing for which no justification can be found? <br><br>Brigyn, thank you!

I certainly grant that Fortune's definition is misused a lot! There are a lot of ways to change consciousness in accordance with will, and the sort of expanded-bubble thing is far from the most useful. <br><br>Cherokee, nah, no need to be overly concerned about it. The implications, which we'll get to as this discussion proceeds, usually sit very easily with ordinary practically minded people, who are used to dancing with uncertainty. <br><br>Manlet, as I thought I made clear, my discussion of matter was focused on the folk concept. Yes, I'm aware that there are more complex versions, some of which are fairly subtle. <br><br>Peakfuture, Retrotopia at the time of Peter Carr's visit will likely be in the salvage phase of philosophizing, with a coffee shop or two in every large city developing a clientele of people interested in philosophy, and a few small publishers beginning to bring out reprints of the classics. Give it a couple of generations and there could be all kinds of debates and new ideas circulating! As for <i>Star's Reach</i>, Meriga in the 25th century is a dark age society just beginning to move into its medieval period, and so is mostly pre-philosophical; the era of theologically motivated philosophizing will begin to dawn, maybe, toward the later years of Presden Sharl sunna Sheren, with the rise of rationalism centuries further off. And your last question? I hope to get there in this series of posts. <br><br>Sandy, granted -- and that's one classical view from the perspective of Indian philosophy.

To some extent it's simply a linguistic habit we apply to our surroundings. We're used to thinking in terms of subjects, verbs, and objects, so when we consider the representations we experience, we look for a cause (subject) causing an effect (verb) to a recipient of that effect (object). How many things "cause" a rainstorm? <br><br>Sven, a fine Latin pun, "vulto." Schopenhauer would have liked it -- running together <i>volo</i>, "I will," and <i>vult</i>, "it wills." As we'll see, "I will, therefore I am" and "it wills, therefore I am" are both relevant! <br><br>Scotlyn, no, it's simply a reflection of what we know -- thus of the limits to our knowledge. We see some things that apparently just are; that's the first grade. We see some things that are, and also live and grow; that's the second grade. We see some things that are, live and grow, and also display the signs of conscious behavior; that's the third grade. We see some things that do all these, but also display the signs of conceptual intelligence; that's the fourth grade. As I noted already, I'm entirely open to the possibility that there are other living things at the fourth grade -- I'd be astonished if the larger cetaceans aren't there -- and our inability to know this for sure is simply an indication of our cluelessness. <br><br>As for whether it's "the same will" or "different wills," that's an extremely subtle question with no single answer. More as we proceed...<br><br>Bruce, exactly. That's why it's essential to go back to the experience itself, and not get stuck in badly structured conceptual binaries of the "is there free will, or not?" sort. <br><br>Greg, au contraire, those are splendid metaphors, better than the ones I'd come up with, and I'll be sure to include credit when they get used next. Exactly; claiming that consciousness doesn't exist is as self-refuting as typing the words "I can't type." Alternatively, maybe Daniel Dennet isn't conscious and has no mental life, and he's merely making the mistake of generalizing his unfortunate condition to the rest of us, who don't suffer from the same sad condition... ;-)<br><br>Violet, the only reasonable answer to "is the will single or multiple?" is, of course, "yes." ;-) I'm delighted that you've found Steiner's book useful! <br><br>Unknown, better late than never! <br><br>Donald, fascinating. <br><br>Phil, are you sure that entropy isn't the direction the will is ultimately moving? <br><br>Andrew, I don't happen to know if Schopenhauer knew the Tao Te Ching, but it wouldn't surprise me -- he was fluent in most of the usual languages of European scholarship and read a good many Asian spiritual classics in translation. One of the things that I find fascinating about his thought is that his ideas mesh well with a great many mystics -- and this idea of the ultimate reality as an urge, a dynamism, is also found among them.

The fact that a clever mathematical model can predict the outcome of experimental manipulations simply shows that the people who came up with it were good at making models. It does not prove that the model is a true statement of what goes on in the universe. Ptolemaic astronomers were able to produce very accurate predictions of planetary motion; that fact did not prove that the Earth was the center of the solar system, much less that epicycles exist. As for my references to science -- why, as you'll see if you reread that part of my post, my point was simply to remind those of my readers who find modern science convincing that some of the things about Schopenhauer's philosophy that most offend the common sense of our time are also found in modern physics.<br><br>Ryan, my understanding -- and I've been told this by an assortment of mathematicians -- is that for every branch of mathematics that turns out to do a good job of modeling certain features of our experience, there are many others that don't. Furthermore, for every part of the universe we experience that can be modeled by mathematical means well enough for accurate prediction, there are many others that resist mathematical modeling. Our civilization has seen an extraordinary profusion of mathematical creativity; no other civilization known to me has generated such a diversity of mathematical fields; and if we're to assess the supposedly unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics, we need to ask two questions. First, what fraction of the total range of mathematical schemes are useful for modeling the world? Second, what fraction of the total range of things we experience have been effectively modeled using mathematics? My working guess here is that what's going on is a version of the <a href=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/texsharp.html rel=nofollow>Texas sharpshooter fallacy</a>, where the admittedly impressive hits are being treated as typical, while the majority of mathematical methods that don't model realities, and the majority of phenomena that resist mathematical modeling, are passing unnoticed. <br><br>Matthias, thank you!<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c3767922272609103191 title="comment permalink">2/16/17, 11:50 PM</a><br><br>

Thus the will is active even when consciousness is absent.”<br><br>The idea that there is such a thing as dreamless sleep is inherently undemonstrable. If someone wakes up and cannot remember dreaming, that merely demonstrates lack of memory, not lack of dreams. If there are none of the brain activities that normally seem to accompany dreams, that does not mean there were no dreams: it could be that some dreams are not accompanied by such brain activities. To assume otherwise would be to assume what you are trying to prove.<br><br>After all, one thing that is assumed by many contributors to the other blog is that consciousness continues after death. Yet there is no brain activity. Perhaps, during sleep without the brain activities characteristic of dreams, we are actually visiting planes of existence that we have no access to in normal dreams or in normal waking consciousness and which we necessarily forget on our return. I am not claiming that this is the case, but to claim that it is not the case is quite arbitrary.<br><br>Of course, this argument does not affect JMG's main point, which is that the will is active even when consciousness is absent <i>from the body</i>. However, it seems to me that this is still wrong in that, according to my understanding, the body is a representation of many different levels of consciousness, corresponding to the levels of organisation within the body and brain, and that while the uppermost level, with which we are normally identified, may be occupied elsewhere, lower levels still operate and can shift a limb without instruction from the uppermost level.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c4163587434890724642 title="comment permalink">2/17/17, 4:37 AM</a><br><br>

I have been looking for ways to discuss the Witness with my children. The wriggling fingers might be worth a try.<br><br>You've triggered some questions:<br><br>1. On the idea that there is no material world, only each person's representations of it, then why is it that if an object that represents to be a cast iron safe, falls from an opening that represents as a window, and then lands on what appears to be my head, why does it seem that my particular Will loses its vessel as a consequence of this non-event? I never looked up and saw the safe coming (the Will was happily assembling the woman walking in front of us into a very familiar pattern), so I had no opportunity to assemble the safe into a recognizable object. But it squished me all the same.<br><br>1b. Even if the Will returns to the universal gumbo that it never left, why did my Will bother to aggregate (albeit temporarily) in my non-body in the first place? And why did it chose to manifest in a vessel that was susceptible to termination by something as illusory as non-material non-falling objects?<br><br>2. On the idea that there is no matter, only a vast mostly-empty space populated by wave-like and particle-like objects swirling around in a web of probability (perhaps not unlike a swarm of gnats mating in a ray of sunlight), then what is it that attracts a particular set of these probabilities to swirl around a common axis (me) in the first place? Does my Will arrive and summon them together (did it take Seven days?), or did the probabilities pool together in an eddy of the space/time continuum, and then an opportunistic Will happened by to take up residence (like a hermit crab trades up for a larger shell)? i.e. chicken or egg?<br><br>2b. Why do these probabilities choose to assemble into rocks and coffee cups? Or did our minds invent these? I mean, things like grains of sand and little bits of moss, the stuff left over from a pencil eraser, and little swirls of cream curdling in my cup of coffee. Why did we bother to dream those details up? Or did some Wills draw the short straw and have to do a turn as a sheet of toilet paper stuck to someone's heel?<br><br>3. Following #2 above, if I am merely a swirl of probabilities, held together fleetingly by a faint magnetic attraction or the like, then there must be the possibility that this swirl could come unglued without any apparent trigger in the represented world (perhaps spontaneously, or maybe as the result of an intervention or alteration in the attraction). What sort of event might cause me to simply fly apart and disappear, leaving not so much as a wisp of smoke? Let's imagine that I am sitting at the illusion of a table in a restaurant, surrounded by other manifestations of Will chatting amiably, and then my cosmic glue comes undone right as I appear to be reaching for my wine. All the other manifestations blink for a moment at the now apparently-more-empty-than-before space. Perhaps their own representation-engines still imprint the image of me for a moment still sitting on the now-apparently-empty chair. But eventually they turn their heads to each other and ask "did he just, like, go to the bathroom or something?" Consider the old story: he just went out for a pack of smokes... it could be that he actually de-constituted on the way to the bodega. (if he did dissemble as he reached for the door, would that be captured on the ubiquitous CCTV's pointing down at the sidewalk, or would it be as a tree falling silently in the forest?)<br><br><br>Groovy. My Will is suddenly directing my body to go buy some pot.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c8258953542850418851 title="comment permalink">2/17/17, 6:38 AM</a><br><br>

The moment was intense as one might imagine, time slowing down, each footstep playing out in slow motion, faces floating in and out of view, and the like. The energy was intense, and a lot like tripping on mushrooms. It was as if there was some kind of vortex forming around the site. I get it that this was only in my head, however there obviously were many other heads in similar states of consciousness. I was struck on reflection later with the distinct impression that what was going on was that I could feel the cosmos getting ready to suck the victim's Will back into itself. <br><br>You can see this in movies that try and convey these moments. The pace goes to slo-mo, the camera swirls and twirls in close focus. We hear maybe only the protagonist's own breathing, all other sound curt off. Then the camera pans away, like the scene of dead and wounded in the railyard of Gone with the Wind.<br><br>I had a similar experience, in the opposite, when my first child was born. What emerged from the probabilities of my wife's womb entered this representation space with a tremendous surge of energy. Imagine a championship basketball game won by a last second half-court shot, the crowd stops and floats through space with the ball, forgetting itself for a moment in a collective hush, then the ball snaps through the net like a bomb going off.

In their liberating influence, collectively we may join in cosmic unity of evolution toward ever greater elaboration of Divinely-inspired fulfillment of promise. With Deacon we sense that thermodynamic agencies auto-create successive moments of any actuality out of probabilities of circumstantial constraint that are the crux of their own in-forming, wherein they attain particular determinate form, as well as accomplish emergent influence upon other actualities.<br><br>Now we find that every decision, however simple, bears fruit from imaginal prowess to cultivate its own circumstance already fertile in unique opportunity. Now we may grasp that individually each entity jointly is responsible to and for all, even as all are informed and enriched by the uniqueness of each and everyone. Ethics thus arises from an encompassing aesthetic of unity seeking balance with variety.

I did guess that you wanted to appeal to those who found modern physics convincing. Yet that wasn't obvious from what you wrote nor do I think it always works that way. You see, you are not the first person I have seen do this - I have heard several philosophers of Advaita, Buddhism and the like make the very same claims about how the ancient philosophy they find appealing is affirmed by quantum mechanics. Once when an Advaita scholar said the same about Brahman to a room full of scientists one of my brash physicist friends quipped that not only do we know Brahman but we can also describe him precisely with equations. <br><br>So my point is that there are two kinds of people who find modern physics convincing - those who don't understand the math and those who do. If the former were persuaded to take, say Schopenhauer's philosophy seriously based on what you said, one could argue that its largely from a position of ignorance of quantum physics. As far as the latter are concerned their view may not be too far from that of my brash physicist friend. So either way I am not sure if anything useful has been achieved. <br><br>While I am at it let me also add that I certainly do not claim that having a nifty mathematical model is the same as knowing the truth. But that is what quite a few people do believe. Sorry if that wasn't clear in what I wrote. Also, your claim about reason in the second last paragraph does not seem to follow from anything else in your essay. I presume you will clarify that aspect in your next essay.<br><br>I also wonder how it will play out if one argues the opposite of what you have argued - that Schopenhauer's Will has nothing whatsoever to do with quantum mechanics. That it postulates the existence of an active entity with maybe values and habits, and not just the working out of dumb equations. For what it is worth, I do think the challenge to scientific materialism is best attempted by staying far away from quantum mechanics.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c555145341282223679 title="comment permalink">2/17/17, 7:11 AM</a><br><br>

I wonder if there are a few more exceptions, and if there are that points in some interesting tangents.<br><br>Dwelling on this and on the grades of will discussed in this blog post has reached past my limits for constructing argumentation, and has forced me to go is search of modified metaphors. First, let me recount to you a popular saying from my second year of College in a Schopenhauer &amp; Nietzsche class "Nietzsche inverts Platonism". As a second year philosophy student I couldn't do much with this phrase, since Platonism was still to me the Freshman cartoon of Plato. But my friends and I had much fun trying to draw schema of Platonism and then flip them or invert them, or some such. After months of chewing on this idea, with nothing worth swallowing it was forgotten. <br><br>The idea came back some time ago when you mentioned on one of your Blogs that you were seriously questioning some of the assumptions of Platonism, specifically ones which have become historically important to Occult theories. I believe that you said something to the effect that certain interpretations placed more reality on abstractions, than on the experiences that the abstractions are built upon. This has got me thinking, for some times now, about Platonism what features of that image of reality are useful and which are distorting.<br><br>So now to the image. Consider the Great Chain of Being, then substitute for that the Great Mountain Chain of Being. A vertical chain is supported from above. A mountains peak is supported by its base. A chain hands from a single point. A mountain range is supported by a wide wide base and reaches up to several different points. We occasionally mount intellect peak, above the ridges of consciousness which reach outward to the many other animal occupied zones. In the valleys of intention that cover the mountain side are the plants and the will which intends but lacks the view of the ridges we call representation. Below the valleys there are vast vast flat lands going out beyond the horizon of base force, willish in a vague and strange sense, but lacking the higher grades. Beyond them there is perhaps an ocean which we cannot see from a top intellect peak, a vast reality we cannot even represent, but the effects of which are hinted to us by phenomena with in our range of representation.<br><br>Also from intellect peak we can see, blue washed by vast difference, other sights that seem, to some, to be peaks themselves, perhaps also peaks of intellect, perhaps strange peaks of The Will of another kind all together... it is hard to say.<br><br>Complicating this is the role of mathematical truth in Platonism. I have been looking deep into the mandlebrot set and contemplating what strange thing is going on there, patterns which follow from abstractions, but complex and unpredictable. Maybe this is something which fits into my image, perhaps it is the structure of the rock I am seeing, perhaps something else, perhaps beyond the keep of this metaphor. Right now I am contemplating maths as the geology of the metaphor, with some promising analogies, but the image is too young to work with. Still my Western Horizon is the sacred mountain of the Ute people, so I will look to it for what insights it can offer.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c4133550932601535234 title="comment permalink">2/17/17, 7:20 AM</a><br><br>

It seems a slippery view to identify the evidence of things outside our minds and still to claim that all is will and representation. If you mean to go in the direction of observer dependence of quantum reality, I would urge caution. That is a world full of meaningless rhetoric. Much better is the view you articulate that our minds are very limited tools and the entanglement of macroscopic systems where determinism seems to rule with quantum systems where indeterminism seems to rule is one of the things humans have not yet figured out. <br><br>I think a more sophisticated description of the 'matter' model is necessary. You are right about the fact that reductionist descriptions of matter end up with quantum descriptions of probability fields. But the continuum matter model that is being used when someone talks about 'solid matter' can be quite rigorously derived from quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. It is a macroscopic approximation. And it is clearly recognized as a representation, while some don't as easily recognize fundamental quantum particle physics as a representation. Continuum mechaniucs is so extremely accurate that we use it all the time to describe balls hitting bats, flowing water, and a thousand other things. It is a much more useful model to an engineer than quantum mechanics is. <br><br>Of course, you want to focus on the mind/world interface about which our quantitative understanding is still quite limited, and I find your description very interesting. But sometimes the rhetoric takes over and you write things like 'The philosophers got to the same destination a couple of centuries earlier.' The philosophers have interesting insights about representations etc, but the question of whether our experience is best described by continuum descriptions of solid matter or quantum descriptions of wave functions comes down to experiments which tell us which representations most accurately describe our experience in which situations. The armchair philosophers couldn't get there until the experiments were done by natural philosophers. Their ideas that demonstrated that continuum matter was not the only logical possibility were useful in opening some minds, but could not lead to a conclusion about what kind of model should replace the ancient Greek ideas about matter until we developed the tools to do the experiments to determine the structure of an atom in the late 19th century.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c5921611873959437031 title="comment permalink">2/17/17, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>

However, the argument that “the universe is a simulation” in vogue is unaffected by quantum mechanics. It’s arguably a version of “am I a man dreaming I’m a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming it’s a man?” and should be treated as such, but the twists and turns are different.<br><br>An important concept involved is the turing machine. Imagine a ribbon of infinite length divided into discrete cells. Each cell contains a symbol. A device then travels along the ribbon. The device can only read and manipulate the symbol of one cell at a time, following a table of instructions it carries. <br><br>A basic tenant of computer science (the Church-Turing hypothesis) is that given unlimited time, everything computable / calculatable can be done by such a device. Similarly a turing machine can replicate any other turing machine. Computers more or less work as limited turing machines. They obviously don’t have infinite storage or time, but otherwise function the same. <br><br>There are things that can’t be computed such as the halting problem or busy beaver numbers. However quantum effects aren’t one of them. Quantum mechanics can be computable even by a classic non-quantum computer. It just takes (a lot) longer to calculate. If you let a turing machine’s cell handle quantum states in addition to symbols / real numbers, there is no “slowdown”, but that just cuts overhead rather than adding a new ability to the machine.<br><br>If you take the generally held assumption that physics including quantum physics is computable and combine it with materialism, then it follows the universe and by extension ourselves can be replicated by a turing machine and therefore any computer like device. Since a universe can hold many simulated universes and simulated universes can make more simulated universes, odds are we are in a simulated one.<br><br>There are many places to attack this chain of reasoning. JMG’s clearly gathering troops for just an assault. Please correct me if I’m wrong as I’ve only read critiques, Penrose’s argument is also an attack on it. The reasoning is that there exists quantum effects that aren’t computable and that our brains make use of these uncomputable effects as a part of consciousness. Therefore he goes, a turing machine can’t replicate consciousness. However, his ideas are quite the fringe in many of scientific circles I’ve encountered.<br><br>Brain uploading and related ideas also base themselves off of this chain of reasoning. For example if I replicate your neurons with silicon chips that emulate said neurons, the argument goes that you’re still “you” since hardware is abstracted. Given that, I can just run you all off some computer somewhere to experience things virtually which are functionally real.<br><br>To tie things back to this week’s article, the scientific materialist discussions about consciousness, besides the odd side talk on qualia, almost always center around identity and “can computers be conscious?”. Both of which are barely relevant to Schopenhauer’s ideas of consciousness. Identity is baked into will. You are will, and if it has a different will it’s not you. The question “can computers be consciousness?” is a non-starter since both silicon and meat are representations. Personally I find Schopenhauer a better place to work from. There’s a bunch of questions that it’ll be interested in seeing answered, but I suspect JMG will get to them in due time.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c5286443060967889702 title="comment permalink">2/17/17, 9:50 AM</a><br><br>

Now here is the part were I make a hairy nuisance of myself and it comes down to this. I can see where the term 'will' from but I am having problems with the term itself. The word 'will' implies direction and perhaps a foundation of ego. OK, then. The thing is, if someone is using a term to describe something it should match as closely as possible what it is describing and Schopenhauer’s adoption of this word was, I believe, was a huge disservice. The word 'will' (Wille in German) does not really do so here and to be truthful, it can be a sort of verbal Rorschach test in that you can see in it what you want. This can lead an enquirer into some pretty strange detours that get you away from what is trying to be described.<br><br> As an example of where it can take you, you start using the word 'will' and that can lead you to thoughts of national wills between nations and how you can be a part of a larger will and next thing you know you have your triumph of the will. You think that I am pushing a point here? At the risk of being accused of the Reductio ad Hitlerum argument, you-know-who could have taken any one of thousands of books when he went to war but it was Schopenhauer’s 'The World as Will and Representation' that he had in his knapsack throughout WW1 and his concept of Schopenhauer’s will helped shape his personal philosophy the rest of his life. It would be interesting to know, on a side note, if Schopenhauer would have used the word 'will' if he had been born half a century later or not. Taking a leaf out of Freud, he may have come out with the working title 'The World as Ego and Representation' instead. <br><br> In addition, the concepts of life, consciousness, and intellect are three grades of the will but they are also three functions of biological complexity based perhaps on neuron density. I am going to go out on a very narrow limb here and wonder if there may be a fourth grade of so-called will and that is of spirituality. I cannot call myself a spiritual person but I know that it is a strong force in human life. It may be that we are all of us islands of consciousness in a sea of space-time and spirituality may be the bandwidth that any connection to a greater reality is made. We still do not know how mind hooks into matter yet and may not be even built to understand what reality which is why we need the language of mathematics to even get handle on it. Time will tell.<br><br> One last thing. It was stated "There are also certain circumstances - in which under certain hard-to-replicate conditions, two or more people seem to become, at least briefly, a single entity that moves and acts with a will of its own". True enough. I only wonder if this is like an act of fusion or whether it is more a matter of synchronization.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c6086716939077901456 title="comment permalink">2/17/17, 3:21 PM</a><br><br>

People can usually empathize more with a dog than with a tree because the dog has more similarities in its expression of will to humans than trees do. We can to a certain extent imagine what it might be like to be a dog, but when it comes to trees that's a much more difficult prospect. Who knows what the inner experience of a tree is like, it may not have any of the sort of consciousness that people and animals have, but it may have a form of experience that is so different from ours that we cannot fathom it, so who's to say one is at a higher level than the other.<br><br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c5305528835065304586 title="comment permalink">2/17/17, 6:00 PM</a><br><br>

Other cultures, in which religious experience isn't either suppressed or forced into a dogmatic mold, don't generally have that problem. <br><br>Clark, thank you. It doesn't actually take much work to summarize Schopenhauer; unlike most philosophers since his time, he put a great deal of effort into being clear and understandable, and <i>The World as Will and Representation</i> is only as long as it is because he wanted to follow out every detail of his account of the world as far as it would go. If you want me to summarize Hegel, on the other hand, that would be a lot of work! <br><br>Vesta, you're misunderstanding my first point. Children's fantasies -- or their close equivalents in, say, modern politics! -- are often internally inconsistent, but the child (or politician) can typically tell you to their own satisfaction, if not to yours, what they mean by every element. The distinctive thing about our encounter with the world is that so often we encounter things that are opaque to our understanding and stay that way no matter how hard we try to grasp them. As for the second, as I tried to suggest in my post, all the things you've cited are conditions or states of the will, as Schopenhauer understood it. <br><br>Wayne, yes, and thanks for catching that. As for awareness, Schopenhauer argued that it's a secondary phenomenon, born when the will meets resistance and reacts to that event. Be careful of distinctions between the "true will" and such modes of will as passions and appetites; there's a difference, but the moral spin that's usually put on it leads in unhelpful directions. More on this as we proceed! <br><br>Ariston, that's a thesis I would read with great interest. The insistence that the world must be founded on reason has deep roots, and we'll be discussing those shortly; it's precisely because Schopenhauer refused to go past the limits of what we actually experience that he seems so useful to me -- but here again, we'll discuss that in due time. <br><br>Escape, thanks for the link! <br><br>Brian, here again, that's pretty much exactly what Spengler says. Have you read him? If not, you may be interested to know that, unlike too many historians of his time and since, he counts Mesoamerican civilization as one of the world's great cultures, on a par with Egypt, India, classical civilization, and us. <br><br>Myriad, self-other symmetry to my mind supports Schopenhauer's argument. Since the part of the world we encounter directly -- i.e., our bodies -- appears on close analysis to be will, it's reasonable to assume that the bodies of others whose representations we experience are also twofold in the same sense.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c6203717750737265453 title="comment permalink">2/17/17, 6:12 PM</a><br><br>

I just ran across this: "Global Trends: The Paradox of Progress", pub. Jan, 2017, at www.dni.gov/nic/globaltrends. DNI = Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the US Intelligence Community. In addition to the usual sort of descriptive futurism, this time they've sketched three <i>fictional</i> scenarios to illustrate their views.<br><br>Who else do we know who encourages the use of fiction to stimulate the imagination?<br><br>Some sample paragraphs follow:<br>...<br>The next five years will test US resilience. As in Europe, tough economic times have brought out societal and class divisions. Stagnant wages and rising income inequality are fueling doubts about global economic integration and the “American Dream” of upward mobility. The share of American men age 25-54 not seeking work is at the highest level since the Great Depression. Median incomes rose by 5 percent in 2015, however, and there are signs of renewal in some communities where real estate is affordable, returns on foreign and domestic investment are high, leveraging of immigrant talent is the norm, and expectations of federal assistance are low, according to contemporary observers.<br>...<br>Examining the trends across the three scenarios makes vivid that the world will become more volatile in the years ahead. States, institutions, and societies will be under pressure from above and below the level of the nation-state to adapt to systemic challenges— and to act sooner rather than later. From above, climate change, technology standards and protocols, and transnational terrorism will require multilateral cooperation. From below, the inability of government to meet the expectations of their citizens, inequality, and identity politics will increase the risk of instability.

There are also important cultural differences between India and the West that have to be taken into account. That said, there's a point to using the term "will" rather than "consciousness" here, as I hope to show further along this inquiry. <br><br>William, nah, you've misunderstood my point. When I talk about "particle" as an abstract metaphor, I'm talking about the origins of the concept; that there are in fact representations that correspond to the concept well enough for the metaphor to help us model their behavior is another point, and one I don't deny. Probe at the way people think about particles, though, and you'll find that pebbles, marbles, and other small objects provide the template, however modified by later education, around which their notion of "particle" tends to cluster. <br><br>I_s, I'm not sufficiently sure I understand the concept of atman in its full philosophical meaning well enough to be sure. <br><br>Kristoffer, interesting! Thus the difference between the grades of will might simply be a matter of speed. Hmm...<br><br>Mark, it's simply that with most of the people I know who are conscious of the point at which they became conscious, it happens in very early childhood. As for vision, you don't control the light, but you do control whether you attend to it or not. Similarly, your clothing is pressing on your skin in a variety of ways; before I called your attention to it, did you notice that? Those are examples of the way that will provides the context for consciousness. <br><br>Breanna, I don't recall saying that the grades of will *aren't* fuzzy and complex. What Schopenhauer is doing with them is simply pointing out that some of our representations appear to express will in different ways than others. Note also that I never said that the grade of intellect is "higher" than the others; I said that it's more complex and less basic, which is not the same thing. It's also considerably more fragile and, as we'll be discussing further on, more bug-ridden and easily scrambled than the others. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Shane, shhhh! ;-)<br><br>Emmanuel, nicely put. Exactly; materialism stands the world on its head, insisting that matter is the only reality and mind is an epiphenomenon of matter (or doesn't exist at all), when this thing called "matter" is an abstraction based on representations experienced by our conscious minds (the third grade of will, remember) -- and matter is therefore basically an epiphenomenon of mind! <br><br>Shawn, that's another issue, and a huge one. We'll be talking about it as this discussion proceeds. <br><br>Grisom, exactly -- Einstein was speaking to a public that, by and large, got the philosophical points I'm discussing, so it was easy for him to make himself understood. Nowadays? Here in the US, certainly, the vast majority of people have never even learned to think, much less been exposed to any amount of meaningful philosophical discourse, and so a lot of incredibly basic ground has to be covered before you can get to the point where Einstein's discussions started. Look how far we've, ahem, progressed...<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c2935490690845479597 title="comment permalink">2/17/17, 10:07 PM</a><br><br>

You're quite right that the experiments don't prove that there's no free will -- they prove that free will isn't located where a lot of us assume it is, i.e., in the conscious mind or the intellect (the third or fourth grade of the will, in Schopenhauer's terms.) In dreamless sleep, the first two grades of the will are very definitely active -- you still exist, you keep breathing, etc. -- and there's your tether! <br><br>Eric, there's no law. There's just will. ;-)<br><br>Onething, Schopenhauer talked quite a bit about those states where the will wills its own suspension; we'll get to that. As for love, if Schopenhauer's right, the entire universe and everything in it is an expression of will, so clearly there's room in there for love. <br><br>As for how he gets to matter as the most basic grade of will, here again, remember that he's looking at what we actually experience, and trying to get past familiar misleading concepts to the experience itself. We don't experience "matter." We experience representations, on the one hand, and will on the other. The one piece of apparent "matter" we can encounter in a nonrepresentational manner, the one we each call "my body," is encountered as will. Since will and representations are all we actually experience, and what's called "matter" turns out to be will when we encounter it directly (and representations when we experience it), why drag in some unknown third something to explain what will and representation explain perfectly well by themselves? <br><br>Doryman, fascinating. I'm glad you recovered!<br><br>Blue Sun, Schumacher was almost certainly riffing off Schopenhauer. You're right that I don't call will the source of matter, because there's no such thing as matter in the usual sense of that word; there's just will on the one hand, and representations on the other. Will is certainly the source of those representations we call "matter" in casual speech, though...<br><br>Nati, agreed. That's why I put some aliens in my novel <i>Star's Reach</i> who were as far from human as I could get, and who understand the world in ways that the human mind didn't evolve to grasp! <br><br>HalFiore, thanks for the clarification! I don't have the least doubt about the "mind-space" where you can move before cognition takes place -- that's a common experience in most internal martial arts, including the one I studied. It really does redefine one's sense of what's primary in the self. <br><br>Armata, good. Evola got his idea on the afterlife in part from the Stoics, and your interpretation of his views is precisely what the Stoics believed: if your soul becomes strong-willed and independent enough, it survives; if not, it goes blorp when you die. I don't know that I'd agree with that, based on my own experiences, but it's a view with a long history.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c3415574898575342690 title="comment permalink">2/17/17, 10:25 PM</a><br><br>

I have been reading The World As Will And Representation and had been hoping for a while that you were going to write (and hopefully maybe even publish a book) about your take on philosophy. I think it's a really important field - important enough that it needs to be grabbed out of academia and put in the hands of normal people - as a tool we can make genuine use of in our lives. Part of that is by people outside of that realm trying to tackle the ideas, learn them and be able to restate them in common terms, to make sense of them and make use of them. I do think part of this is important because otherwise they risk being lost in the uncertain future. At any rate, I was eager to see how you would go about the process of de-jargoning some of these texts but wasn't sure if you would be able to make it fit into the themes of this blog. Anyway, very happy you are doing these so wanted to say thanks.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c2305412961862825532 title="comment permalink">2/18/17, 1:57 AM</a><br><br>

In my case I prefer 'consciousness', partly perhaps because my meditation style is emptiness-oriented rather than discursive, but also because using the word 'consciousness' provides a direct route to the solution of the 'problem of consciousness', which is the bane of modern philosophy and is what led me to investigate this subject matter. The same philosophical solution can certainly be expressed using the word 'will', but to do so will be somewhat less straightforward. Evidently you have some other problem in mind that will be helped more by the use of the word “will” than by the word “consciousness”.

When you mentioned a couple of posts ago that you were going to delve into philosophy, I got an uneasy feeling in my stomach because I have always believed that the West “threw the baby out with the bathwater” philosophically-speaking with the so-called dawning of the Age of Enlightenment. Reading the Upanishads at the age of 17 truly blew my mind and meditations on these gems over the ensuing decade deeply embedded their teachings into my consciousness. I have never had the patience to search for a “straight mirror” in post-enlightenment Western philosophy’s fun-house (more like a horror house to me), so I am greatly indebted to you for these series of posts. The one thing that I will need to ponder over, however, is Schopenhauer’s notion that consciousness is a manifestation of will and not vice versa. In fact, I still have a sense of uneasiness regarding “will” as the bedrock of “self” as I have always thought that will = consciousness + ego and in the philosophy I follow, ego is spiritual enemy #1. So I am looking forward to your future discussion/definition of “will” to supplement my own meditations.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c7977929101365108670 title="comment permalink">2/18/17, 6:02 AM</a><br><br>

I get this stuff at some level but I struggle with describing it to others, maybe because I didn't get to my understanding of it through philosophy per se in the first place. <br><br>The idea that the world must be founded on reason is in Christianity isn't it? The idea of God as Logos. But it must go back before that because that has to be one of those borrowings from classical philosophy. <br><br>I notice that a lot of people have problems with the idea of levels of will in which some are higher than others. They seem to be reading into it a hierarchy in which higher is superior and lower is inferior. It's like the idea that civilization is 'better' than barbarism. Or that reason and logic are superior to personal experience and feelings. And the human reaction is often simply to turn the binary on its head instead. <br><br>George Lakoff, I think it is, traces those kinds of metaphors to our earliest experiences. As you're doing with particle as pebble. So from our experiences as toddlers we get a morality of up is good and down is bad. Which then translates into moral judgments and emotional reactions to metaphorical verticalness as adults! It's mad really. In politics, for people who've benefitted from imperialism, and feel bad about that, it also seems to trigger associations with the cultural supremacism that was and is often used to justify imperialism. <br><br>So in order to avoid triggering all of that, wouldn't it be better to use metaphors that don't involve vertical levels other than for, say, the design of lifts in an apartment? But then the idea of levels of being seems to be so ancient and widely used that maybe it is one of the best metaphors. <br><br>Mallow.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c9022560207577284615 title="comment permalink">2/18/17, 6:05 AM</a><br><br>

(I related my own little story of waking that I posted earlier.) <br><br>I am interested in scientific knowledge and our relationship with being both in the world and of the world, and, somewhat differently, with our ‘knowing about’ the world. I recognise that knowing about electrons is not the same as consciously being able to ‘see’ electrons as entities, though I claim to have experienced when I was 17 an insight (brief ‘flash’ mental image) into the state of an elemental atomic nucleus - not the electron shell - when my image managed to combine extreme activity and extreme confinement. This was before I knew much actually of the matter, except E = mc 2, and I owe physicist Walt Patterson decades later for his understanding of the atom when he used a written, calculated, version of the same image. I have mentioned before my debt also to Roger Penrose for his discussion of non-verbal thinking in mathematics. Clearly ‘my image’ was a representation, though in its way surprisingly accurate. <br><br>You know of course the background to our knowing that we are made from stardust, though we owe our particular dynamic configuration to perhaps a billion years of evolution of electro chemical signalling relationships (lots of ‘tethers’?) that we now call biochemistry. And this chemistry is all about electrons, which is the name we usefully use, and the relationships thus configured among the elements adjunct to a dissipative flow of concentrated ‘energy’; (elements as in Periodic Table). I have always felt it to be relevant, without quite knowing why, that we are ‘made’ of this ‘unconscious’ stuff. Though we are begotten (somebody here recently introduced that word into our discussions) of the sifting of a hypothetical infinity of such configurations. <br><br>I have the feeling that none of this is necessarily in contradiction with Schopenhauer, but I also have a feeling that ‘will’ is a term too nearly misunderstood. ‘Scientific Determinism’ is not refuted by invoking chaos theory or the non-computability of future ‘positions’ within states of immense complexity. We both ‘choose’ and we are ‘chosen’? Did you catch that piece about Pope Francis experiencing profound peace since his being chosen?<br><br>Postscript: I have this image – I believe it might actually have been observed, of stem cells early in foetal development, those that are going to be germ cells, forming a line holding onto the one in front and making their way to the quiet place (electro-chemical signalling minimised) where they wait through the years for bodily maturation. <br><br>best<br>Phil H <br><br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c4383786063816290311 title="comment permalink">2/18/17, 7:03 AM</a><br><br>

What other wills may be out there that exhibit significant trappings of consciousness and/or intellect?<br><br>I have spent my life enjoying the study of the world from a scientific perspective. The marvelous variety of ways which living things go about their lives has particularly fascinated me. Molecular biology in particular provides quite the impressive variety innovative mechanisms that we have figured out at least in part with our quite reductionist efforts of modern science.<br><br>This brings up thoughts of the debate between the Intelligent Design movement and the Evolutionists. The proponents of intelligent design say that the irreducible complexity and generated information apparent in the intricate and clever mechanisms that operate to maintain the operation of each living thing show evidence of the work of a higher intellect. The evolutionists respond that these mechanisms are simply the result of random variation and natural selection working over long periods of time and that no higher power is operating. The proponents of ID do not engage in public speculation as to the identity of this higher intellect with the obvious unstated undertone that it is the Christian God.<br><br>I have spent my working life as a professional design engineer. When I study the mechanisms of life I see the work of a willful and creative intellect with design and organizational capabilities far beyond my meager intellect. There is beauty and art in the design of life, but certainly not omniscience or omnipotence.<br><br>When two loud parties are apparently at each other's throats and implacably at odds the question comes to my mind of what idea they are cooperating to support and what idea they are cooperating to repress. The proponents of ID seem to support the idea that their God has created this world and that through their faith in God they are the select. The evolutionists would seem to be supporting that there is no higher power and by virtue of their winning the battle of natural selection, they are the select. One possibility that never seems to be suggested is that there is a higher power and said higher power has no particular reason to find either party amongst the select.<br><br>To me there is an obvious candidate for a willful and creative intellect with capabilities far beyond those of us mere mortals. This would be the human species as a whole. It is a coherent "thing in itself" that operates through a variety of social organizations. Among these social organizations are the community of genes that are spread throughout the human race, the community of cells that grow to form each individual person, and the communities that people form as they go about their live. Indeed the human species as a whole might exhibit some form of consciousness with thoughts proceeding across the millennia with the genes operating as signals through the individuals acting as synapses.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c8512615421436389270 title="comment permalink">2/18/17, 9:41 AM</a><br><br>

It seems to me that a constant war of all against all would not be appealing to the species as a way of operating. Among the tools the species would use where appropriate would be natural selection and randomness. In the interest of flexibility a variety of kinds of will would be appropriate. A near universal balance of good will to man and will to life would appropriate in almost all individuals. Since we are a social species and social organizations seem to work better with some form of leadership the occasional individual with will to power would be appropriate. But from the species' perspective too much will to power is destructive. The problem of how to prevent the spread of will to power is a problem species have solved a long time ago. The phenomena that it is "good to be the king" would lead to spread of these destructive in quantity forms of will if these qualities are inheritable. I would suspect that species have solved this problem a long time ago (a billion years). Leadership ability and will to power are not inheritable, but pop up randomly at a rate that the species finds appropriate.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c3382203163970498567 title="comment permalink">2/18/17, 9:45 AM</a><br><br>

And I whispered to my sister, just watch, we'll leave and he'll die. And that's what happened. I knew my dad. <br><br>And this business with my grandfather: this is the second time he appeared to me in a dream - I relayed to you the first experience in your other blog. Two days after Dad died I went to bed aggrieved at the cruelty of his death. But I was exhausted and I slept. And that night I saw my deceased grandfather, my dad's dad. Like the first time, the dream so intense as to BE real. I was convinced, against all rationality, that he was there. <br><br>In this second dream I saw my grandfather smiling (in that kitchen again) and I asked him but how can this be, you're gone, this HAS to be a dream. A dreaming doubting Thomas, I touched my grandfather and he WAS as real as can be. And so, in my dream, I stopped questioning, I stopped thinking that this was a dream, and I accepted that this was really him and the great joy at seeing him. And then I awoke. <br><br>Was my grandfather "real"? Was he a by-product of a neurological storm caused by my father's passing? Reason says my grandfather died a long time ago. But so intense was the experience that reason comes up short. "Matter" is what really exists? I don't know. I don't care what the tall foreheads say, there's more to things than "matter" and the mathematics that describe it. <br><br>See, I can't shake the first time I saw my wife, the weeks of my dad's decline, the day he died, and my grandfather's coming in my dreams.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c5631893229476422137 title="comment permalink">2/18/17, 11:04 AM</a><br><br>

This displacement triggers further electrical activity in nerves, first sensory neurons (which alert your consciousness to the result of the experiment), then motor neurons (with which you alert those around you to the results of your experiment, possibly to include profanity). So, even though our model of matter includes lots of empty space, such particles of matter as there interact over the span of that "empty" space through the electromagnetic (EM) force.<br><br>Electrical engineers (such as myself) usually have some college-level study of EM, but it barely scratches the surface. <b>All</b> of our common experiences are manifestations of either the EM or gravitational forces, and the gravitational effects are so simple (relatively speaking) as to be trivially predictable. An apple falls: that's gravitational force. I cut my finger while slicing onions: an incredibly complex sequence of EM interactions result. (The EM representation is not usually the most practical one to consider while the blood is flowing.)<br><br>Pushing your toe into a chair leg is something like trying to push together two magnets, with matching poles. The force of repulsion can be felt long before they come into "contact" (at which time the force of repulsion becomes much, much, stronger).<br><br>BTW: The book "Men Who Stare at Goats" begins with an attempt much like yours to exploit the "mostly empty space" concept of the material world.

What philosophers demonstrated, using their own tools, was that the sort of straightforward faith in the reality of matter that most people have in western societies isn't compatible with our actual experience of the world.

There's been a fairly long fight in the Western world (going back all the way to Plato, and likely well before) about who should bear arms. This conflict only intensified with the development of the crossbow and of course the firearm.<br><br>As you know, crossbows and guns are important technologies because they let some jackass with 2 weeks training kill a professional warrior. So, there's a very important symbolic difference between a civilian who is allowed to own a gun or a crossbow vs. one who isn't. Orwell had something to say about the rifle on the wall of the laborer's cottage. A lot of people mock gun rights based on the idea that civilian gun owners could never overthrow the government, because the government has tanks and fighter aircraft and drones.<br><br>Of course, in a strictly base material sense, it is true that if the American military could be motivated to engage in warfare against Americans, that the tanks and other expensive weapons would make a big difference in the conflict. This is undoubtedly true in a certain sense, because a Stryker or Abrams crew has nothing to fear from a few guys with AR-15s.<br><br>Once you step outside the base matter of the question, it gets considerably more interesting.<br><br>Maybe the real question of civilian gun ownership has nothing to do with whether or not civilians can realistically overthrow the government, but how gun ownership changes the civilians and the government. To circle back, a person with the right to own a weapon suitable for killing professional soldiers is fundamentally different than someone who isn't allowed to have cool stuff like that, and no explanation about how the soldiers would win anyway really matters.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c8753203593283713002 title="comment permalink">2/18/17, 8:53 PM</a><br><br>

If the tolerances for intellectual will are limited something so profound it figures that so dramatic a change as ecstatic experience is likely to throw it off. I do think I practiced conversation with out intellectual ecstasy for countless hours before I realized that the hive-mind could function at the intellectual level to produce insights inaccessible to the participants by themselves. If I recall right, it took rather less than a second of practice kissing a girl to encounter the other form of ecstasy where the intellect is blasted deep into the background radiation of the universe.<br><br>When I try to represent my will, the experience is like trying to paint a camp fire, or a particular flame in a camp fire. The shapes intensities and boundaries move faster than my minds eye can catch. Indeed I can feel the will to represent, and fill that feeling with the sensation of the strain that gazing too deeply into a fire exerts on our eyes. In trying to watch the will so much will focuses itself in the representation. Ouroboros. <br><br>Ecstasy, in love, passions, dancing, I tend to be a bit resistant to, my will tends toward being protective of its boundaries, of the limits which focus it to the intellectual level. Yet the mixing of wills is still a need it seems, and I crave it in conversation. Interesting, I didn't know some of that about myself. Generally our will is associated with our body, but only a wisp of will is both of the body and of the conscious mind, and a hair of a wisp is of the body and the intellect. Work is ecstasy, it can be when working in accord with ones calling. In work our will expands from the body, through the tools, into our medium, and on ward on the inspiration of an intention. As a gardener the sun landing on my plants is incorporated into that greater self.<br><br>Emotions, to play off your point from the post, indeed are our direct, not necessarily representational, experience of states of the will. We experience them when the will changes, they are unconscious when they are static, even to turn the consciousness upon them by intellectual choice stirs them. Have you felt sorrow today? If your minds eye is turned upon your day by the question the glance has a wake in your sea of emotion. What emotions we try to represent, and how we represent them will profoundly adjust the patterns of the will. <br><br>The tension between the emotions and the intellect is related to the intellects need for homeostasis and the uncertainty and change of the will in emotion.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c3864372667304588838 title="comment permalink">2/18/17, 9:41 PM</a><br><br>

Strictly speaking, we can't know how -- or whether -- bacteria or ecosystems "see" us at all. From a less strict and more speculative perspective, it's entirely possible that you're right. <br><br>Wendy, go back to the finger-wiggling exercise. The thing that allows you to make your fingers move is the expression, in human experience, of what Schopenhauer meant when he talked about will. Definitions are slippery things; grounding what we're talking about in experience is less vulnerable to galloping abstractionitis. <br><br>Yanocoches, thank you for the reminder about the McNeill book! I read that some years back and then lost the reference. I don't believe I said that there's anything uniquely human about the phenomenon we're discussing; as you've noted, a lot of animals seem to do it routinely. <br><br>Chris, I'm actually aiming my assault a little more broadly, but certainly the notion that every phenomenon is computable is one of the targets I hope to overrun as we proceed. <br><br>SLClaire, hmm! That's going to want some reflection. <br><br>Redoak, as I understand him, Schopenhauer wasn't trying to advance. He was trying, if you will, to descend: to work down to what we can actually know about ourselves and the world, so that we can recognize where our intellectual efforts can be useful and where they can't -- and there, I think, he did do a better job than Hume. <br><br>Sven, hah! <br><br>Phil, well, of course. Physicists haven't yet found a general solution to the three-body problem, but moving objects in space solve it for themselves moment by moment without even doing the math. ;-)<br><br>Artorias, interesting. I have my own suspicions about what's going on there, but those really belong to the other blog. <br><br>Candace, to grasp the four levels of consciousness, pay attention to yourself when you're (a) thinking about something, (b) looking out the window and not really thinking about anything, and (c) asleep; then imagine the state your body will be in when you're dead. Those are the levels, in their human manifestation. As for the distribution of will (whether or not it takes the form of consciousness), of course. Have you ever almost dropped something, and had your hand snatch it in midair before your mind even realized it was falling? That's akin to the octopus tentacle.<br><br>Kevin, once again, Schopenhauer used the term will because when you pay attention to human experience, will is the one thing that's clearly present that's not a representation. He didn't just pull it out of a dictionary. As for the reductio ad Hitlerum, er, a lot of people carried Schopenhauer with them to the battlefield, you know, and that kind of ad hominem argument -- "this awful person liked X, therefore X is evil!" -- is a very, very cheap shot. <br><br>LatheChuck, hmm!

Hinds, the idea that the universe is fundamentally mathematical goes all the way back to Pythagoras. As that scene in <i>Star's Reach</i> suggests, I find it dubious at best -- not much more plausible than the claim that the laws of nature are dependent on English grammar. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Kristoffer, true -- though it's equally possible, of course, that there are invisible unicorns browsing on the invisible grass that rises from your living room floor. ;-)<br><br>Scotlyn, here again, you're missing the point. (This is beginning to get a bit frustrating.) "Agents" are representations, or conceptual abstractions from representations. <i>What do you actually experience?</i> Representations, on the one hand, and on the other the effects of the thing we call "will" -- see the finger-wiggling experiment if you're no longer clear on that. Sure, from there you can construct an argument that the representations around you are best explained by positing agents who, like you, encounter themselves as will and experience others as representation, and that argument may even be correct -- but that's a very large step into abstraction, away from the focused attention to what you actually experience that Schopenhauer is talking about. <br><br>Johnny, you're welcome and thank you! <br><br>Doug, to some extent, yes, it's a matter of different problems. The problem of consciousness, though, is to my mind simply a problem implicit in the way that we in the western world are taught to divide up the universe of our experience, and goes away very quickly once you see the difficulties in that way of thinking. More on this as we proceed.<br><br>Ron, thanks for being willing to follow along! Schopenhauer read the Upanishads in translation, and to some extent his thought can be seen as an attempt to explore the common ground between classical Indian philosophy and modern European philosophy, while critiquing both. As for the ego as enemy #1, that's going to merit some discussion as we get deeper into all this. <br><br>.Mallow, it really is difficult to avoid spatial metaphors in English -- possibly in human language generally. I suppose it's probably going to be necessary to point out repeatedly that the different grades of the will aren't better or worse than one another, just different -- and of varying degrees of fragility. <br><br>Phil, no, none of that is in contradiction to Schopenhauer. You've described one of the things that makes living in a world of representations so interesting -- they interact with one another in ways that can only be modeled by supposing a world very different from the one our senses present to us. Science is the most sustained effort so far to make sense of that very different world, by applying the tools of the intellect to our representations. <br><br>Moebius, one of the ways you can talk meaningfully about evolution is to see it as a process by which species learn new ways of relating to the world. That's not a popular way to talk in science these days, but back in the 1970s and early 1980s you heard such talk in systems theory circles tolerably often. I think you're being a bit optimistic, though, in thinking that the species would necessarily find it beneficial to have nearly universal mutual benevolence and reverence for life; if that were actually a good thing, we'd have it, and we clearly don't...<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c2808759131653791323 title="comment permalink">2/19/17, 12:03 AM</a><br><br>

Before you get to those, ask yourself this: if a child in a modern Western industrial society were to encounter a nature spirit, say, and mention this to her parents, what would the reaction be? <br><br>Birdie, I haven't -- I'll put it on the get-to list. <br><br>Justin, that's a very good point, but there's another, highly pragmatic point to keep in mind. The US government had tanks and planes and all kinds of hardware in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq, fighting people with guns and an assortment of improvised hardware. Who won? <br><br>Ray, good. Yes, all of this follows very neatly from a Schopenhauerian perspective. <br><br>Shrama, excellent! I ended up rejecting monotheism as a reasonable explanation for religious experience because it simply doesn't fit the data without a vast amount of special pleading. In exactly the same way, I find Schopenhauer's philosophy satisfying as an explanation for the cosmos because it doesn't require special pleading, only sustained attention to what we actually experience. The will as Schopenhauer describes it, and we each encounter it, is emphatically not the god of the Abrahamic monotheisms; it's not omnipotent (can you by willing make your arm sprout feathers?), omniscient (can you by willing see through a brick wall without having a bulldozer go through first) or -- crucially -- omnibenevolent. Nor is it without internal as well as external conflicts! The only deity I can think of who has much in common with the will as Schopenhauer describes it is Azathoth, the blind daemon-sultan that bubbles and blasphemes at the center of creation: <br><br>"Out in the mindless void the daemon bore me,<br>Past the bright clusters of dimensioned space,<br>Till neither time nor matter stretched before me,<br>But only Chaos, without form or place.<br>Here the vast Lord of All in darkness muttered<br>Things he had dreamed but could not understand,<br>While near him shapeless bat-things flopped and fluttered<br>In idiot vortices that ray-streams fanned.<br><br>They danced insanely to the high, thin whining<br>Of a cracked flute clutched in a monstrous paw,<br>Whence flow the aimless waves whose chance combining<br>Gives each frail cosmos its eternal law.<br>“I am His Messenger,” the daemon said,<br>As in contempt he struck his Master’s head."<br><br>...and it's very likely that Lovecraft, who knew Schopenhauer's work tolerably well, had that in mind when he centered his imaginary cosmos on so un-Jehovahlike a character. <br><br>(The poem's one of the sonnets from Lovecraft's "Fungi from Yuggoth," btw.)<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c3196647130360283757 title="comment permalink">2/19/17, 12:20 AM</a><br><br>

The thing is, you could make exactly the same case about "thought" or "mind," or, really, any other word you like. To anticipate next week's discussion a bit, the default philosophy of western cultures divides the world up into "mind" and "matter," and treats these exceptionally complex and cumbersome abstractions as though they're simple realities; I'd argue that that's why a number of commenters here have tried to drag the discussion back into those terms, when Schopenhauer is deliberately rejecting them in order to point to aspects of the world of our experience that the mind/matter duality obscures. More on this as we proceed!<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c2595193020578298167 title="comment permalink">2/19/17, 12:41 AM</a><br><br>

By way of introduction I should like to say the following: it is not until the nature of the will is really known that it is possible to understand even a part of the other emotive powers, a part of the feelings. We can ask the question: what is a feeling in reality? A feeling is very closely related to the will. I may even say that will is only the accomplished feeling, and feeling is will in reserve. Will which does not yet express itself, which remains behind in the soul, that is feeling: feeling is like blunted will. On this account the nature of feeling will not be understood until the nature of will has been thoroughly grasped. (1919)<br><br>This strikes me as being very close if not identical to some of what is said above.

I'm enjoying your essay but fear that it is above my head in terms of understanding, but at the same time are fascinated enough to go along with you on your intellectual journey.<br><br>I just wanted to give you a completely different perspective on languages.<br><br>My experience has been that I learn a language through putting that language to use. Take the word: granite - as an example. I know what is meant by that descriptive word because I have contact with rocks and although the idea of granite is abstract and it does not describe a rock itself, I understand what that type of rock is, because I understand the story behind that type of rock and I know where to find them. They are part of my day to day experience.<br><br>A lot of languages are taught, I've noticed by concentrating on the syntax, and to be honest syntax is usually an abstract concept that is applied to a language after the usage of the language has come into common usage. The syntax and structure isn't the language itself, it is an abstract overlay that may approximate some of the language and it is also an attempt to describe the language. I see this in music, mathematics, other languages etc.<br><br>Unfortunately for me that syntax and structure overlay is lost on me because I want to know the story behind the abstract concepts and that is the only way that I can recall what all of these things actually mean. <br><br>So when you wrote about the abstract concept representation, despite your story, it just didn't lock into my mind as I know that word by its other meanings and I didn’t get the story behind it.<br><br>This comment is not intended as a criticism of your writing, I'm just trying to provide an insight for you into how other people go about the process of thinking so that if you see dumb questions and comments it may help you put them into some sort of context.<br><br>Another insight for you is that I understand the many rules of language through usage. Those rules are locked into my mind, but if you asked me to describe them to you, I would probably struggle doing so as I've never had the need to do describe them. To me language is a bit like listening to music in that I understand the musical scales as they are generally understood and I can intuit that certain notes being played in the musical composition are "off" and that is as far as I've thought to learn about the process.<br><br>Dunno, I just noted that you had a sense of frustration in your "voice" and thought that you might appreciate seeing the world through other peoples eyes.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c6652073371500949646 title="comment permalink">2/21/17, 2:52 AM</a><br><br>

I accept that it's a possibility, as you say, that we experience will directly, but do we have a strong reason for believing that? Let's say I'm looking at my hand and I happen to have a twitch, so sometimes my fingers move seemingly by themselves, and at other times as a result of my will. It seems to me that I am having some kind of experience of my will in this situation - why can't that simply be another representation that is being integrated into my experience?<br><br>Second, the argument as you have represented it seems to centre almost exclusively on what we can experience. Of course as human beings that's incredibly important to *us*, but I don't see why that's the measure of *everything there is*. The argument seems to be: there's only will and representation in our experience, hence that's all there is. But why shouldn't there be something we think of as matter, which is out there, separate from our will and representations, and underlying the seemingly shared experiences we have? Is it just Occam's Razor?<br><br>Matt<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c617528685448206393 title="comment permalink">2/21/17, 8:53 AM</a><br><br>

What philosophers demonstrated, using their own tools, was that the sort of straightforward faith in the reality of matter that most people have in western societies isn't compatible with our actual experience of the world. Scientists have come to the same conclusion in a different way, by showing that the only set of models that explains all the observed behavior of matter presupposes that matter can't be what we think it is. In both cases, using different tools, the apparent reality is shown to be an illusion."<br>I think I see what you are getting at. I tend not to go toward the reductionist idea that what is apparent is some kind of illusion. Everyday ideas about continuous matter are very effective in describing our actual experience of the world. Continuum mechanics makes these ideas precise, and helps us know when they will fail. The logical critique from the philosophers that other possibilities existed contributed something. But not the same thing as the empirical observations that showed which more fundamental models should replace continuous matter models for describing atomic phenomena. But the more fundamental and reductionist ideas are not somehow the 'real' story. They are simply another useful model that happens to describe atomic phenomena and can be shown to be consistent with macroscopic models of continuous matter.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c6143867598520748545 title="comment permalink">2/22/17, 8:00 AM</a><br><br>

Very linear. But in the world we're in there is no X that causes Y in any kind of linear fashion. <br><br>You are will, in a way. And so is the universe as you can know it. No one will is totally separate from any other. So you are will, you will and will acts through you. I think... <br><br>@Ilmaiwi <br><br>Epistemology is about what we humans can know. So it kind of has to be anthropocentric when talking about what we know through actual experience. We can't directly experience the world that a cat experiences, so knowledge about the world of a cat must always be limited for us. That must always be a different kind of knowledge. <br><br>Mallow.<br><br><a href=the-world-as-will.html#c4301880109278603865 title="comment permalink">2/22/17, 10:33 AM</a><br><br>
