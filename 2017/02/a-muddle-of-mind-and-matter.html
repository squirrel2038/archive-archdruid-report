<div class=MsoNormal>
The philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, which we’ve been discussing for the last two weeks, has a feature that reliably irritates most people when they encounter it for the first time: it doesn’t divide up the world the way people in modern western societies habitually do. To say, as Schopenhauer does, that the world we experience is a world of subjective representations, and that we encounter the reality behind those representations in will, is to map out the world in a way so unfamiliar that it grates on the nerves. Thus it came as no surprise that last week’s post fielded a flurry of responses trying to push the discussion back onto the more familiar ground of mind and matter. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was inevitable. Every society has what I suppose could be called its folk metaphysics, a set of beliefs about the basic nature of existence that are taken for granted by most people in that society, and the habit of dividing the world of our experience into mind and matter is among the core elements of the folk metaphysics of the modern western world. Most of us think of it, on those occasions when we think of it at all, as simply the way the world is. It rarely occurs to most of us that there’s any other way to think of things—and when one shows up, a great many of us back away from it as fast as possible. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yet dividing the world into mind and matter is really rather problematic, all things considered. The most obvious difficulty is the relation between the two sides of the division. This is usually called the mind-body problem, after the place where each of us encounters that difficulty most directly. Grant for the sake of argument that each of us really does consist of a mind contained in a material body, how do these two connect? It’s far from easy to come up with an answer that works. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Several approaches have been tried in the attempt to solve the mind-body problem. There’s dualism, which is the claim that there are two entirely different and independent kinds of things in the world—minds and bodies—and requires proponents to comes up with various ways to justify the connection between them. First place for philosophical brashness in this connection goes to Rene Descartes, who argued that the link was directly and miraculously caused by the will of God. Plenty of less blatant methods of handwaving have been used to accomplish the same trick, but all of them require question-begging maneuvers of various kinds, and none has yet managed to present any kind of convincing evidence for itself. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then there are the reductionistic monisms, which attempt to account for the relationship of mind and matter by reducing one of them to the other. The most popular reductionistic monism these days is reductionistic materialism, which claims that what we call “mind” is simply the electrochemical activity of those lumps of matter we call human brains. Though it’s a good deal less popular these days, there’s also reductionistic idealism, which claims that what we call “matter” is the brought into being by the activity of minds, or of Mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Further out still, you get the eliminative monisms, which deal with the relationship between mind and matter by insisting that one of them doesn’t exist. There are eliminative materialists, for example, who insist that mental experiences don’t exist, and our conviction that we think, feel, experience pain and pleasure, etc. is an “introspective illusion.” (I’ve often thought that one good response to such a claim would be to ask, “Do you really think so?” The consistent eliminative materialist would have to answer “No.”) There are also eliminative idealists, who insist that matter doesn’t exist and that all is mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s probably been as much effort expended in attempting to solve the mind-body problem as any other single philosophical issue has gotten in modern times, and yet it remains the focus of endless debates even today. That sort of intellectual merry-go-round is usually a pretty good sign that the basic assumptions at the root of the question have some kind of lethal flaw. That’s particularly true when this sort of ongoing donnybrook isn’t the only persistent difficulty surrounding the same set of ideas—and that’s very much the case here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
After all, there’s a far more personal sense in which the phrase “mind-body problem” can be taken. To speak in the terms usual for our culture, this thing we’re calling “mind” includes only a certain portion of what we think of as our inner lives. What, after all, counts as “mind”? In the folk metaphysics of our culture, and in most of the more formal systems of thought based on it, “mind” is consciousness plus the thinking and reasoning functions, perhaps with intuition (however defined) tied on like a squirrel’s<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>tail to the antenna of an old-fashioned jalopy. The emotions aren’t part of mind, and neither are such very active parts of our lives as sexual desire and the other passions; it sounds absurd, in fact, to talk about “the emotion-body problem” or the “passion-body problem.” Why does it sound absurd? Because, consciously or unconsciously, we assign the emotions and the passions to the category of “body,” along with the senses.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is where we get the second form of the mind-body problem, which is that we’re taught implicitly and explicitly that the mind governs the body, and yet the functions we label “body” show a distinct lack of interest in obeying the functions we call “mind.” Sexual desire is of course the most obvious example. What people actually desire and what they think they ought to desire are quite often two very different things, and when the “mind” tries to bully the “body” into desiring what the “mind” thinks it ought to desire, the results are predictably bad. Add enough moral panic to the mix, in fact, and you end up with sexual hysteria of the classic Victorian type, in which the body ends up being experienced as a sinister Other responding solely to its own evil propensities, the seductive wiles of other persons, or the machinations of Satan himself despite all the efforts of the mind to rein it in. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice the implicit hierarchy woven into the folk metaphysics just sketched out, too. Mind is supposed to rule matter, not the other way around; mind is active, while matter is passive or, at most, subject to purely mechanical pressures that make it lurch around in predictable ways. When things don’t behave that way, you tend to see people melt down in one way or another—and the universe being what it is, things don’t actually behave that way very often, so the meltdowns come at regular intervals. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They also arrive in an impressive range of contexts, because the way of thinking about things that divides them into mind and matter is remarkably pervasive in western societies, and pops up in the most extraordinary places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Think of the way that our mainstream religions portray God as the divine Mind ruling omnipotently over a universe of passive matter; that’s the ideal toward which our notions of mind and body strive, and predictably never reach. Think of the way that our entertainment media can always evoke a shudder of horror by imagining something we assign to the category of lifeless matter—a corpse in the case of zombie flicks, a machine in such tales as Stephen King’s <i>Christine</i>, or what have you—suddenly starts acting as though it possesses a mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, listen to the more frantic end of the rhetoric on the American left following the recent presidential election and you’ll hear the same theme echoing off the hills. The left likes to think of itself as the smart people, the educated people, the sensitive and thoughtful and reasonable people—in effect, the people of Mind. The hate speech that many of them direct toward their political opponents leans just as heavily on the notion that these latter are stupid, uneducated, insensitive, irrational, and so on—that is to say, the people of Matter. Part of the hysteria that followed Trump’s election, in turn, might best be described as the political equivalent of the instinctive reaction to a zombie flick: the walking dead have suddenly lurched out of their graves and stalked toward the ballot box, the body politic has rebelled against its self-proclaimed mind! </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s go deeper, though. The habit of dividing the universe of human experience into mind and matter isn’t hardwired into the world, or for that matter into human consciousness; there have been, and are still, societies in which people simply don’t experience themselves and the world that way. The mind-body problem and the habits of thought that give rise to it have a history, and it’s by understanding that history that it becomes possible to see past the problem toward a solution. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That history takes its rise from an interesting disparity among the world’s great philosophical traditions. The three that arose independently—the Chinese, the Indian, and the Greek—focused on different aspects of humanity’s existence in the world. Chinese philosophy from earliest times directed its efforts to understanding the relationship between the individual and society; that’s why the Confucian mainstream of Chinese philosophy is resolutely political and social in its focus, exploring ways that the individual can find a viable place within society, and the alternative Taoist tradition in its oldest forms (before it absorbed mysticism from Indian sources) focused on ways that the individual can find a viable place outside society. Indian philosophy, by contrast, directed its efforts to understanding the nature of individual existence itself; that’s why the great Indian philosophical schools all got deeply into epistemology and ended up with a strong mystical bent. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Greek philosophical tradition, in turn, went to work on a different set of problems. Greek philosophy, once it got past its initial fumblings, fixed its attention on the world of thought. That’s what led Greek thinkers to transform mathematics from a unsorted heap of practical techniques to the kind of ordered system of axioms and theorems best exemplified by Euclid’s <i>Elements of Geometry</i>, and it’s also what led Greek thinkers in the same generation as Euclid to create logic, one of the half dozen or so greatest creations of the human mind. Yet it also led to something considerably more problematic: the breathtaking leap of faith by which some of the greatest intellects of the ancient world convinced themselves that the structure of their thoughts was the true structure of the universe, and that thoughts about things were therefore more real than the things themselves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The roots of that conviction go back all the way to the beginnings of Greek philosophy, but it really came into its own with Parmenides, an important philosopher of the generation immediately before Plato. Parmenides argued that there were two ways of understanding the world, the way of truth and the way of opinion; the way of opinion consisted of understanding the world as it appears to the senses, which according to Parmenides means it’s false, while the way of truth consisted of understanding the world the way that reason proved it had to be, even when this contradicted the testimony of the senses. To be sure, there are times and places where the testimony of the senses does indeed need to be corrected by logic, but it’s at least questionable whether this should be taken anything like as far as Parmenides took it—he argued, for example, that motion was logically impossible, and so nothing ever actually moves, even though it seems that way to our deceiving senses. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The idea that thoughts about things are more real than things settled into what would be its classic form in the writings of Plato, who took Parmenides’ distinction and set to work to explain the relationship between the worlds of truth and opinion. To Plato, the world of truth became a world of forms or ideas, on which everything in the world of sensory experience is modeled. The chair we see, in other words, is a projection or reflection downwards into the world of matter of the timeless, pure, and perfect form or idea of chair-ness. The senses show us the projections or reflections; the reasoning mind shows us the eternal form from which they descend. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was the promise of classic Platonism—that the mind could know the truth about the universe directly, without the intervention of the senses, the same way it could know the truth of a mathematical demonstration. The difficulty with this enticing claim, though, was that when people tried to find the truth about the universe by examining their thinking processes, no two of them discovered exactly the same truth, and the wider the cultural and intellectual differences between them, the more different the truths turned out to be. It was for this reason among others that Aristotle, whose life’s work was basically that of cleaning up the mess that Plato and his predecessors left behind, made such a point of claiming that nothing enters the mind except through the medium of the senses. It’s also why the Academy, the school founded by Plato, in the generations immediately after his time took a hard skeptical turn, and focused relentlessly on the limits of human knowledge and reasoning. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Later on, Greek philosophy and its Roman foster-child headed off in other directions—on the one hand, into ethics, and the question of how to live the good life in a world where certainty isn’t available; on the other, into mysticism, and the question of whether the human mind can experience the truth of things directly through religious experience. A great deal of Plato’s thinking, however, got absorbed by the Christian religion after the latter clawed its way to respectability in the fourth century CE. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Augustine of Hippo, the theologian who basically set the tone of Christianity in the west for the next fifteen centuries, had been a Neoplatonist before he returned to his Christian roots, and he was far from the only Christian of that time to drink deeply from Plato's well. In his wake, Platonism became the standard philosophy of the western church until it was displaced by a modified version of Aristotle’s philosophy in the high Middle Ages. Thinkers divided the human organism into two portions, body and soul, and began the process by which such things as sexuality and the less angelic emotions got exiled from the soul into the body. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even after Thomas Aquinas made Aristotle popular again, the basic Parmenidean-Platonic notion of truth had been so thoroughly bolted into Christian theology that it rode right over any remaining worries about the limitations of human reason. The soul trained in the use of reason could see straight to the core of things, and recognize by its own operations such basic religious doctrines as the existence of God:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>that was the faith with which generations of scholars pursued the scholastic philosophy of medieval times, and those who disagreed with them rarely quarreled over their basic conception—rather, the point at issue was whether the Fall had left the human mind so vulnerable to the machinations of Satan that it couldn’t count on its own conclusions, and the extent to which divine grace would override Satan’s malicious tinkerings anywhere this side of heaven.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you happen to be a devout Christian, such questions make sense, and they matter. It’s harder to see how they still made sense and mattered as the western world began moving into its post-Christian era in the eighteenth century, and yet the Parmenidean-Platonic faith in the omnipotence of reason gained ground as Christianity ebbed among the educated classes. People stopped talking about soul and body and started talking about mind and body instead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Since mind, <i>mens</i> in Latin, was already in common use as a term for the faculty of the soul that handled its thinking and could be trained to follow the rules of reason, that shift was of vast importance. It marked the point at which the passions and the emotions were shoved out of the basic self-concept of the individual in western culture, and exiled to the body, that unruly and rebellious lump of matter in which the mind is somehow caged. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s one of the core things that Schopenhauer rejected. As he saw it, the mind isn’t the be-all and end-all of the self, stuck somehow into the prison house of the body. Rather, the mind is a frail and unstable set of functions that surface now and then on top of other functions that are much older, stronger, and more enduring. What expresses itself through all these functions, in turn, is will:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>at the most basic primary level, as the will to exist; on a secondary level, as the will to live, with all the instincts and drives that unfold from that will; on a tertiary level, as the will to experience, with all the sensory and cognitive apparatus that unfolds from that will; and on a quaternary level, as the will to understand, with all the abstract concepts and relationships that unfold from that will. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice that from this point of view, the structure of thought isn't the structure of the cosmos, just a set of convenient models, and thoughts about things are emphatically <i>not </i>more real than the things themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The things themselves are wills, expressing themselves through their several modes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The things as we know them are representations, and our thoughts about the things are abstract patterns we create out of memories of representations, and thus at two removes from reality. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice also that from this point of view, the self is simply a representation—the ur-representation, the first representation each of us makes in infancy as it gradually sinks in that there’s a part of the kaleidoscope of our experience that we can move at will, and a lot more that we can’t, but still just a representation, not a reality. Of course that’s what we see when we first try to pay attention to ourselves, just as we see the coffee cup discussed in the first post in this series. It takes exacting logical analysis, scientific experimentation, or prolonged introspection to get past the representation of the self (or the coffee cup), realize that it’s a subjective construct rather than an objective reality, and grasp the way that it’s assembled out of disparate stimuli according to preexisting frameworks that are partly hardwired into our species and partly assembled over the course of our lives. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice, finally, that those functions we like to call “mind”—in the folk metaphysics of our culture, again, these are consciousness and the capacity to think, with a few other tag-ends of other functions dangling here and there—aren’t the essence of who we are, the ghost in the machine, the Mini-Me perched inside the skull that pushes and pulls levers to control the passive mass of the body and gets distracted by the jabs and lurches of the emotions and passions. The functions we call “mind,” rather, are a set of delicate, tentative, and fragile functions of will, less robust and stable than most of the others, and with no inherent right to rule the other functions. The Schopenhauerian self is an ecosystem rather than a hierarchy, and if what we call “mind” sits at the top of the food chain like a fox in a meadow, that simply means that the fox has to spend much of its time figuring out where mice like to go, and even more of its time sleeping in its den, while the mice scamper busily about and the grass goes quietly about turning sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into the nutrients that support the whole system. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Accepting this view of the self requires sweeping revisions of the ways we like to think about ourselves and the world, which is an important reason why so many people react with acute discomfort when it’s suggested. Nonetheless those revisions are of crucial importance, and as this discussion continues, we’ll see how they offer crucial insights into the problems we face in this age of the world—and into their potential solutions. </div>

This week's post, like the last two and others still to come, is trying to sketch out a way of thinking about the world that's very unfamiliar to most people in modern industrial society. That's fielded me a lot of pushback, as noted toward the top of this week's post, and a great deal of that has amounted to an insistence that I ought to use familiar terms such as "mind" (or "consciousness") and "matter," with their familiar implications, rather than the jarring terms "will" and "representation," with their sharply unfamiliar implications. Um, folks, I'm trying to suggest that there's another way of looking at the world. Yes, I know it's not the one you're used to; <i>that's the whole point of the discussion</i>. Can we please get past that, and spend the time exploring an unfamiliar landscape of ideas and perceptions, instead of trying to push things back onto familiar ground?

However, Plato's dialogues very poorly align with that vision of Platonism. In fact, I'd say it would be easier to align Plato with Schopenhauer or Nietzsche than with Augustine. A few examples to bring forward the recent ideas of will and representation. For starters the philosophical soul is dominated by eros (cf Symposium) and Socrates proudly declares that wisdom of all things erotic is his only knowledge. Eros is the seat of desire, willing, and ambition, not far from the role assigned to will by Schopenhauer. The paradoxes of representation are well presented in the Theatetus and Parmenides, in the latter a young Socrates is disabused of his naive theory of ideal forms, in the former, just prior to his execution, Socrates can give no coherent logos for knowledge. Often commentators will single out the Republic as representative of the whole tragic tyrannical culmination of this idealism, never wondering what argumentative purpose the city in speech serves (cf 368d) and how ironic the failure to calculate the "nuptial number" really is (eroticism ends the utopia... of course!, cf 546a-c). Finally, given the form of his writing it is about as meaningful to talk about Plato's Philosophy as it is to talk about Shakespeare's Philosophy. Just because Macbeth says life is a tale told by an idiot does not mean Shakespeare thinks so. There's a lot more to a Platonic dialogue than Platonism. Ok, that axe is sharp enough now!<br><br><a href=#c2876216758002910388 title="comment permalink">2/22/17, 12:24 PM</a><br><br>

The fact that this thing we understand and experience as the self represents a distinct and finite portion of the cosmos... and that our will extends within a very particular reach... that we can know our own will and through introspection pick apart our own representations shows that there does exist some sort of distinction between individual beings. Of course, things like emotion, sexual desire, or physical sickness show that even within that individual there are multiple wills in relationship to each other that are usually, but not always in accordance as a whole. What that suggests then, is that Will is not a singular cosmic force that we are all doing the bidding of, and even if we are it would work much like our own individual selves (in which an immune cell turn on an allergen, a skin cell may become cancerous or some other event in which a part of the system defies the whole of the system), since not everything individual will does seems to be a direct expression of universal Will. As you mentioned last week, it's the conflict between wills that allows awareness to exist at all. Which means that there are multiple sources of will at work... So, once again I ask: who or what is doing the willing? And how does one distinguish between that which is part of an individual will and that which is part of some other, larger, universal will? (I have a feeling that a part of the approach to the question resides within an essay about a certain seafood dinner from the other blog). Ultimately, though, are these questions it's possible to ask and address without another flight to abstraction?<br><br><a href=#c8288948649914573997 title="comment permalink">2/22/17, 1:31 PM</a><br><br>

No difficulty there. <br><br>Also, I am not aware of having any difficulty grasping or accepting your exposition of Schopenhauer's concept of "representations" -including the conclusion that the self is a representation (or more likely a whole collection of them). Again, straightforward enough, I think.<br><br>But it is definitely fair to say that the Schopenhauerian concept of "will" is unfamiliar ground to me and is therefore going to takes some time and effort to explore. I don't have much fluency in philosophical language to do it with, either, so, I will do my best with the words that I find in the grab bag of my personal lexicon. <br><br>So, bear with me while I explore this unfamiliar ground - and maybe stub my toe on a tree root, or fall into a puddle on the way.<br><br><br>By your account, the will is first encountered through direct experience from the "inside", as it were, of the phenemenon of "my" agency willing "my" fingers into motion. But although at that moment, "I" am simultaneously agent-who-is-aware, agent-who-wills and agent-who-moves and although those are the precise circumstances (and no others) under which "I" COULD conceivably directly experience will, it is then asserted that will can exist apart from consciousness (and implicitly apart from agent-who-wills - though this may be a failure in my understanding). <br><br>To this end, an example is given of a sleeper, unconscious, moving a limb in sleep. Note, this example is not directly experienced from "inside" but is seen, like any other representation, from the "outside". The observation that "agent-who-wills/agent-who-moves" the leg is not necessarily identical to agent-who-now-sleeps does not entail that will exists apart from consciousness (or possibly apart from agents), only that when seen from "outside" it may be difficult to determine the identity of the agent-who-wills any particular observed movement.<br><br>Now here you have thrown me a bone when you say "The Schopenhauerian self is an ecosystem" because I can certainly understand an ecosystem as a composite agent composed of a multitude of independent and autonomous agents in busy pursuit of their purposes, sometimes acting in concert, sometimes at cross-purposes with each other, and the self certainly seems to me to work exactly that way. <br><br>But when you/Schopenhauer depart from examples that can be directly appreciated from the "inside" perspective, a reification (appears to me to) occur whereby will is definitely split off from the agent-who-wills to become a "thing" or a force - that is to say, an abstraction. <br><br>As if one had danced, experienced oneself as she-who-dances, and then said the world is made of Costumes and Dance (but where are the dancers?).<br><br>In this exploration, I find that the path from the will I experience from the "inside" when I am the agent-who-wills to the will that is the "thing itself" is not straightforward. There seem to be ravines across it that I cannot cross without a guide. I'd be grateful for any that's going.

I would argue that the perhaps most valuable lesson you keep hammering in - regardless of what topic is at hand - is that our (mostly unconscious) belief structures actually have a history. As for the pushback you've gotten, remember that most people operate on the level of content, while you are taking things a notch below into the realm of structure and pattern. As a result those who can't (or won't) go there will seek to haul things back to the level of content (I've long suspected that the validation of unconscious belief structures through the encouragement of endless debating of the content based upon them is the main motivation behind the frankly absurd amount of intellectual noise our civilization produces, but that is perhaps a discussion best kept for another time). Annoying? You bet. Though a certain amount of it is probably unavoidable.<br><br>I've fallen in love with the Schopenhauerian self, simply because it makes sense. The idea of self as a bubble of abstract intellect confined within a "solid" structure has always struck me as one of industrial civilization's supreme absurdities, right up there with electric can openers and the religion of progress.<br><br>Enjoy your speaking gig.

The section in Introduction to Magic called "Knowledge of the Waters" begins:<br><br><i>The life of all beings, without exception, is ruled by a primordial Force deep inside them. The nature of this force is craving: an appetite that is never satisfied, an endless restlessness, an irresistible need, and a blind, wild yearning.</i><br><br>The passage goes on to connect this force with quintessence, first substance, etc. I'm guessing the concept of astral light would fit right in here as well. (Please correct me if that doesn't seem right.)<br><br>I mention this because last night I picked up my copy of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> and was reminded that the Tao is described as a thing that exists underneath our representations (to paraphrase).

Very similar to learning a foreign language. Let's take Spanish 101. Picture me staring blankly at the paragraph defining the difference between "para" and "por", both translated as "for." Until during the homework, a sentence clicks a memory of old ballads, and "para" suddenly becomes "for to" as in "Juan went to town for to buy a car."<br><br>Likewise, "representation" came more easily than "will" because I already had the concept of "all we know comes to us through our senses "as through a glass, darkly," and hits a second filter constructed by language and culture. But "Will" has a pretty well defined set of connotations in English, which confuses everyone and leads right into the "Free Will Yes or No" trap." As I said last week, I got that one through Pete Seeger via Malvina Reynolds in a song about grass, "it's will is to grow."

But yet, and this is revealed with lucid or partially lucid dreams, behind that unfolding dream world created by consciousness, there's still a more primal driver. Usually, that's simply constant movement, but there seems to be a will to make that movement. Perhaps that's another example of the will at work.<br><br><a href=#c7901026893514699566 title="comment permalink">2/22/17, 3:38 PM</a><br><br>

This past week, I had this thought: the sanskrit word "Bodhicitta" is translated as "the desire to attain enlightened consciousness", which is itself beyond desire, and beyond words. If I replace the word "desire", with the word "will", then the little matter of using desire to become desire-less becomes moot. Will does not need to be modified in that way, it just continues on the path of the bodhisattva. It has a function, which may in fact be useful to bodhisattvas, perhaps even to Buddhas.<br><br>You may be right about woodworking itself being a sort of ritual. It has this to recommend it: mindfullness and focus are rewarded moment to moment with fewer splinters, cuts, and time wasting mistakes that cut into the very small margin of profit one aims at.

Then too, one senses the fellowship with the men of old.<br><br>I wonder if using will to change consciousness doesn't inevitably become using consciousness to change will, in a way similar to working wood becoming: wood, changing the workers will, which it does, if one respects the integrity of the wood.<br><br>Does "will" have some cultural baggage, like "faith"?

It's the way that most of them consider only our brains and maybe animals to have any mind or inner experience, and consigning the world at large to the category of dead or inert matter.<br><br>Lets say for the sake of this argument that the reductionist materialist is right about matter being all their is, and that everything we experience is the result of interactions of matter and energy. If that's the case, why would it stop at the bounds of our (and possibly other creatures') bodies? Couldn't the interactions of matter and energy that come from water in a stream flowing down a mountainside give rise to a form of internal experience, even if it's on a completely different scale than in a human or animal? Most would reply that it's only the complexity that our brains contain that make experience arise there, but that leads to the question of at what point of complexity does "inert matter" suddenly end up with an internal experience? It would make more sense to me that there would be a form of experience in everything, just with widely varying levels of complexity. And, whole ecosystems, the whole planet, and even the whole universe could be having their own forms of experience, Hardly any reductionist materialists see it that way, though. I would think that dividing the world neatly into "inert matter" and matter that has mind isn't compatible with monism. I should say that I've always thought of mind more as the capacity to experience, more like the will you've referred to, rather than the much more limited definition of mind you've talked about in this post.<br><br><a href=#c5871494406811690638 title="comment permalink">2/22/17, 8:31 PM</a><br><br>

What I'm getting is that you find his permutation of the mind/body problem as representation/will rather more subtle and I'd have to agree with you there. Also that the concept of will allows for a bridging of the mind/body problem in a manner that is both subtle and rooted in a kind direct experience accessible to anyone. Finally that this concept of will, as derived from the functioning of the body and bodies in general allows for the existence of a kind of organic force or spirit in the world that is not overly identified with the human mind and the tradition of extreme self-regard of the human mind towards itself that seems to be characteristic of the Western tradition, especially post-Christian orthodoxy. All of the above is probably as clear as mud. <br>But I share, I think, some of Scotlyn's hesitations over the concept of the will, simply in that it really doesn't quite give a satisfying account of the body as existing pre- and post- and entirely entangled with what would be considered will by your account. To put it another way, to experience one's own body as representation, although occasionally valid, is essentially absurd (though an improvement on looking at is as a tool of Satan). On the other hand to posit the body as a working out of so insubstantial a force as the will is equally unsatisfying. Still, I'd have to agree overall, within the tradition of Western thought, representation/will certainly seems better deal than some of the other options. <br>Anyway, tally-ho, you're on a merry hunt!<br><br><br><a href=#c7492032928225921955 title="comment permalink">2/22/17, 9:53 PM</a><br><br>

Just let me rave a minute. I took two hours to read through this week's post, and added about two pages of material to my file with definitions of philosophical terms and which philosopher said what. In particular, you really helped me get a basic grasp of where oriental philosophies (Indian + Chinese) differ from western ones, and how that arose. I can see where I am apt to disagree with the Catholics, for example, no matter how I admire what they have become, and that way I can avoid land mines. It will also help me touch up what I've written in my novel.<br><br>Confucianism was presented to me from the start as a philosophical guide on how to organize a decent society. It was one of the biggest culture shocks for me in Japan, and an area in which it is much much harder for women to assimilate than men. But just as with Buddhism, which I grew up seeing as non-discriminatory, Confucianism isn't as rigid as it first comes across. Older books on Japanese Buddhism are shockingly negative toward women: They both picked up quite a bit of cultural baggage on their way through war-torn regions and histories. When warring is prolonged, women wind up cowering the the back of the house with the children in multiple senses. A more updated version of Confucianism basically rephrases JFK in saying, "Ask not what your society can do for you, rather ask what you can do for your society." People are brought up from kindergarten here thinking in those terms. It takes practice, and I'll never be as good as they are at this, but what counts most is recognizing the value of it and trying.<br><br><a href=#c554829487544430893 title="comment permalink">2/22/17, 11:00 PM</a><br><br>

Yet our same media pop culture still holds to the mind-body separation we get from medieval Catholicism – think of all the times that fantasy or science fiction characters see their mind separated from their body, or “upload” their mind to a computer, or some such thing.

And anyone who has studied the occult to any degree can tell you it is emotions that drive this psychic level of existence far more than the intellect. It is my contention that a big part of the reason our society is having the convulsive collective nervous breakdown it is currently experiencing is simply emotional and intellectual cognitive dissonance resulting from believing that matter and its behavior according to certain laws is the sum total of all existence. <br><br>In typical American fashion, we are of course responding to this cognitive dissonance by simply doubling down on the mistaken belief in the hope that more of what isn't working will somehow solve the problem. This really is quite tragic, because all this doubling down is succeeding in doing is creating a positive feedback loop on the psychic level that just keeps growing and growing. The election of a personality-disordered charlatan such as Donald Trump is but one outward manifestation of this existential crisis. Another manifestation is the severe and unprecedented social and political backlash that what passes for the left in this country is cultivating for itself with its banshee-shrieking sore-loserism and its redoubled fixation on The Rescue Game. A third very possible manifestation may very well be a new economic dislocation brought about by papering-over economic contraction with gargantuan wads of printed money, one that will make the recession of 2009 seem like "the good old days" in comparison.

I think of "will" as one of a class of nouns (things) that in our particularly thing-oriented language we've derived from verbs (ie moves made by agents). We can use "speech" "dance" "act" "word" "sale" "punch" grammatically as if they were things - the objects of action in a parsed sentence. And yet none of these nouns IS a thing. Each is more like a trace left by a purposive agent moving in some way.<br><br>Our language trips us up in this way making it too easier to ask "what is the world made of?" rather than we might, in a different language, ask, "WHO is the world made of?"<br><br>In this context, both "mind" and "body" are "whats" and therefore neither can speak to the "who-ness" of me which I directly experience from the "inside". That is to say no " side" of mind-body dichotomy works.<br><br>Representation and will, as expounded, get closer - because representation can map onto the "outsides" of a world made of "who's" as well as it can map onto the "outsides" of a world made of "what's".<br><br>However the word "will" seems to me to be too easy to use in that thing-derivative abstract way - which obscures, hides or loses the "who". <br><br>And if it does that, it becomes unmoored from the "who" I can directly experience and stops being able to account for my experience.<br><br><a href=#c1005959509403840612 title="comment permalink">2/23/17, 5:22 AM</a><br><br>

Is the will a being? It would seem that it is because it can enter into causal relationship s with other beings and because the will does have determinate properties, such as in its being a source of striving and suffering, etc. But if the will is a being, then it belongs to the realm of representations and is thus just another thing. And I guess I am assuming that whatever it is that gives unity to the field of representations cannot be a being given in that manifold. <br><br><br><a href=#c8188655219959536639 title="comment permalink">2/23/17, 5:53 AM</a><br><br>

Thomas Fuchs, whom I mentioned last week in the comments, coined a useful distinction which seems to apply here: When we see the sleeper, we see a "living body" (in German, "Körper"), i.e. we deduce that there is life in that body. When we cut our (or somebody else's) finger nails, or when we plan a healthy diet for ourselves or somebody else (my examples), we treat ourselves as a "living body", a body just like many others. However, most of the time we feel part of a "lived body" (in German, "Leib"), which is very close to JMG's description of our "feeling" the will moving our body. Fuchs arguments very strongly that there is no privileged role for the brain in this "lived body", that the whole body, and even pens or prosthetic limbs, is special in this way.<br><br>The point where I feel unsure about following Schopenhauer, JMG (and apparently Lovecraft) is exactly the same as the one you point out: who says that all the particular wills/agents are part of a single, impersonal Will? <br><br>By the way, I always enjoy your comments very much.

Since I won't inflict my drawings on you, please imagine the following.<br><br>The "folk metaphysical" dualism would be an ocean of matter, and each individual mind is a boat floating on top of it, outside matter, but somehow(!) in touch with a specific part of matter and able to manipulate the immediate surroundings of the contact point. Both the water and the boats are real, each as important as the other one and each, in principle, capable of existing without the other.<br><br>In materialism, each "mind" would be more like a sound wave or a ripple in the water. The water is the primary fact and not to be doubted. The ripples are simply a particular arrangement of the water molecules, in a way an abstraction of the particular arrangement, and one can discuss (among materialists) if the ripples are useful abstractions. On a calm day, there might be no ripples at all, and the ocean would still exist.<br><br>(I won't try to imagine idealism since I haven't been exposed to it.)<br><br>The way I understand Schopenhauer and JMG, each of us is like a sun, sustaining ourselves by fusion, rotating, pulling on the world out there and "perceiving" that there is stuff outside us because it pulls on us. Everything that pulls on us must in some way be similar to ourselves, but (being a sun) we can't really perceive what it is that pulls on us. We might come to the conclusion that some of the pulls we feel are due to other suns just like us, while the rest is less "active" (e.g. it doesn't do fusion).<br><br>Graeme said the Will was just like mind. If I understand JMG correctly, the important point is that sustaining ourselves by fusion and pulling on others is inextricably bound up with one another. There is no perceptive "mind" separate from the base "body". On the other hand, there is (in this metaphor) no continuum of matter which we are a part of; each sun is self-contained.<br><br>I realize the metaphor isn't ideal and will probably suffer changes as JMG continues his series (or if I manage to read Schopenhauer directly).<br><br><a href=#c172631340881415525 title="comment permalink">2/23/17, 7:31 AM</a><br><br>

But aren't words also just representations? So there will always be a disconnect between words and the "thing in itself." This is why the concept of right and wrong seems impossible with regard to religion and even philosophy. Perhaps the only way to judge such things is by their utilitarian value to our psyches, emotions, and health. Two philosophies or religions can directly contradict each other, and yet both be useful for different personalities or in different circumstances.<br><br>Or perhaps we can "know" the "thing in itself" through direct mystical experience. Even so, to someone outside that experience, it just looks like a trick of the "mind." But people who have these mystical experiences seem to feel pretty sure about what they mean. But of course once they try to share this "knowledge" with anyone or even ponder it themselves, they begin distancing themselves from it with representations and would be left with a mere memory of "knowing."

I took a course called "Philosophical Psychology" as an elective. It felt like a bait and switch. I didn't look into what it was actually about and just assumed it dealt with figures, such as Frued, Jung, Nietche and so forth, who straddled the two disciplines. Turns out, the entire course was about answering the question of whether the mind and body are separate or not. Maddening! I think it's like so many philosophical debates - free will, good and evil, particle or wave, subject/object: the question is fundamentally misguided because the terms used in asking the question are abstractions that feign accuracy/concrete definition when accuracy is neither possible nor a desirable goal. <br>I'd like to get your take on something: I see a red ball. Let's say you could scientifically describe everything that happens when I'm seeing the red ball. That still doesn't address the actual experience I have of seeng the red ball.

Non-living matter seems to be very ‘deterministic’, and scientific use of intellectual tools seems to endorse that description. <br><br>According to Roger Penrose <i>The Emperor’s New Mind</i> (a book quoted by JMG), even quantum mechanics having a random element does not alter the argument much. Even if the future is not ‘fixed’ by the past, as in many forms it appears to be, my own view is that matter can be identified usefully as essentially deterministic, and this squares with it being the ground of ‘will’. (Will is ‘determined’ sounds about right! Smile) Which as Penrose speculates could bring us back to Plato and the logical structures of the world – or at least in the non-living basic grade of the world.<br><br> I personally have seen ‘stuff’ in such a light, eyes-open and in plain sight with no conflict with usual sensory perception, which caused me to speculate that a ‘real’ experience lies at the origin of Platonic thought. I have speculated that this kind of ‘seeing’ might have some similarity with ‘religious experience’. <br><br>I like the differentiation of opinion from truth. That seems to continue the history along the right lines. Smile. And ‘life’ lives along both fixed and moveable lines – a different kind of future - perhaps forming a language of some kind.

Your series is getting better and better. I can see I am going to have to read Schopenhauer, preferably in German, and reflect deeply on what he says. When I was younger I would have resisted him, but of late I have come to feel less and less like a being with a rational mind and more and more like an unstable coalition of more or less rational entities. Mostly less, I have to say. I'm in Germany at the moment on a course of study with some sightseeing thrown in (no need to fly there from the UK these days - the rail connections from London are amazing) and thought of your blog today as I climbed through the woods to the Wartburg castle - not quite the right shape and orientation for your mantelpiece castle but all the right associations, including Wagner of course...<br><br>Alan<br><br><a href=#c4684238845966835812 title="comment permalink">2/23/17, 2:58 PM</a><br><br>

But it seems to me that Schopenhauer just started from what we can experience directly and then he went on to posit a broader theory about what exists from there using the tools of logic. He wasn't saying that a human can directly experience the universe itself as being made up of will and representation. That was the theory he built up from the starting point of what we can directly experience. <br><br>But if you think about the ecosystem of a meadow and work for a moment on the assumption that everything in it is will and representation, then you can look at the impulse that drives the fox to chase the mouse and the impulse that drives the mouse to run away. Those wills are certainly 'personal' to each of them - so much so that they conflict with each other. <br><br>But from another perspective, say that of the meadow as a whole system, they're both expressions of the same will to live that's also shared by other creatures within the system. And from that same perspective, you could describe the will of the ecosystem of the whole meadow as a unity - the sum of the wills to live of every individual thing within it. Their personal wills - in the form of instincts here maybe - are both personal and impersonal at the same time. <br><br>There's a big problem with the concept of an Agent in these discussions I think. Because no one is just an agent. We're all also simultaneously subjects of the agency of others. Just like the fox and the mouse. The word agent seems to me to come from ethics - moral agents, patients and subjects. But ethics has to come after sorting out epistemology. Here in epistemology, the word agent is just another word for Self. And the question in epistemology is how you can know what your Self is. <br><br>Mallow.<br><br><a href=#c5174080586146824409 title="comment permalink">2/23/17, 3:53 PM</a><br><br>

At a Swedenborg reading group, a woman once related to me something a German had told her: "Modern English has no word for will." This is paradoxical, but I think it's pretty accurate than we might assume at first!<br><br>To really bring out the puzzle, here's another way of considering this problem. Harvard University was founded in 1636, and throughout the 17th century it put thousands of Bostonian boys to work studying philosophy. (Maybe a more useful pursuit than what it makes them do today!) The most popular topic of debate in those early days was between intellectualism and voluntarism. What is voluntarism, you ask? It's the doctrine that the basic force that moves the world is the will, as opposed to the intellect. <br><br>What does that even mean? That is a good question to ask, and you would be wise to ask it! Look in a modern encyclopedia and you might not even see voluntarism at all. The English Wikipedia editors have devoted many more words to a dialect of American libertarianism called "voluntaryism" (a completely different thing). Voluntarism has fallen out of favor since roughly 1900, as intellectualism came to enjoy an undeserved monopoly on philosophical and later political discussions. <br><br>Voluntarism holds that rather than a conscious self choosing its behaviors based on scientific evidence, the will moves in people and causes them to invent justifications for things they want to do. This is clearly a politically dangerous type of thought, which is probably why Richard Hofstader, the biggest know-nothing intellectual of all time, mislabeled voluntarism as "anti-intellectualism". But it is also a jumping off point for serious, meaningful discussion. Those 17th century Harvard kids would have held that love is a movement of the will which informs the intellect, rather than the other way around.<br><br>We have many loves in this world: love of God, love of pleasure, patriotism, romantic love. Our love, i.e. our will is not merely a force that can overpower obstacles, it is also a direction. It can point us in any way. A poem written from romantic love is qualitatively different from a poem written out of vanity, even if the words are mostly the same.<br><br>Consider this in the context of what we Americans have been pondering for months, our last election. Bernie Sanders represented the will seeking moral purity and bullied into weakness by the intellect: his character is reputable, but he also accepted the status quo of the DNC and refused to rise up against it. Trump employs the untamed and wild will, full of vicious self-love to be sure, but with a strength that refuses any domination by the intellect of others. It's definitely not his own intellect that provides this strength. It can only be said to be the will, which generations of intellectualists thought they were totally successful at repressing. <br><br>In this sense, I think it is true what I was told in that reading group: English no longer has a word for the will. Maybe with these examples I helped show a few people why it's so important, but we still do not have comfortable language for talking coherently about how to solve problems relating to the will, to consider whether we possess it or whether it possesses us, and how we might push it in directions that move closer to our dreams. That's why we need something like this "Schopenhauerian ecosystem."<br><br><a href=#c5015834144925291169 title="comment permalink">2/23/17, 8:11 PM</a><br><br>

One question regarding your discussion of Parmenides (though it's perhaps peripheral to the main thesis you're exploring here): have you ever come across Peter Kingsley's heterodox take on Parmenides and Empedocles, explored in depth in his 2003 book "Reality"? It's well over a decade since I read it, and I'm a bit rusty on the details. But in reading over Kingsley's wikipedia entry just now (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kingsley_(scholar)), it seems to line up well enough with my recollection. His characterisation of Parmenides as a practitioner of magic struck me as particularly noteworthy. It occurs to me that Kingsley's interpretation, if accepted, might situate Parmenides quite differently with respect to the direction I sense you may be taking us in. But then again, I don't want to jump to any premature conclusions on that front.<br>All the best,<br>Josh<br><br><a href=#c6037397639041743327 title="comment permalink">2/23/17, 10:11 PM</a><br><br>

They must have seen opposites like male/female, day/night, rational/emotional, civilised/barbarian and said ahah! That is how the world is. It's all a world of duality - and we have never shaken off this idea in the past two millennium of philosophical thought. This whole mind-body is yet another manifestation of this idea. Here's an idea. What if they stuffed it up and I mean big-time? What if things did not have to neatly divide into two separate entities? We were quite ready to say that particles and waves were totally different until quantum mechanics grabbed us by the sleeve and said not so fast! Maybe duality is a misleading concept and just maybe our universe has all the fuzziness of those particle-waves in quantum mechanics.<br><br> Duality is an easy thought and it could be that there was an element of 1980's style Masters of the Universe hubris in the all these philosophers over time. The Chinese have this idea of Yin and yang too which is a form of dualism and even the Buddhist appear to have the same with their divisions of states of consciousness and Buddhist atoms. You see this sort of idea at work as when people insist on knowing who the bad guys are and who are the good guys as a way of understanding a situation. In fact, there are all sorts of shades of grey areas at work and no, there are not fifty. It gets worse. Once you accept the idea of linked dualisms, the next step is take on the concept of dominant/subordinate in which one is superior to the other. Examples of how this has come down to us in use are the ideas of masters and slaves, dominate patriarchs and subordinate wives, lord and peasant, upper and lower classes. Different but equal is a concept that is still make itself heard because of this.<br><br> Even here when we talk of 'will' and 'representations' that itself is a duality and should be more accurately described as several billion human 'wills' and 'representations' as the sentence 'will' and 'representations' has an implication of solipsism embedded into it. How they relate and interact with another is a bucket of worms for someone braver than myself to go delving into. Certainly 'will' itself is not a static thing but is constantly changing. If you doubt this, reflect that we are not the same people at 17 as we are at 57 for example (thank God). For that matter 'representations' is also constantly changing. Think how much in your own lives things have changed or gone away. For those who would argue that the laws of physics never change I would have agreed in the past. However, there are several laws of physics that I was brought up on that are now up for revision as exceptions have been found for these laws. In short no, we have not worked the Universe all out yet. Maybe by next Thursday.<br><br> And now for something completely different. Something JMG said in his essay made me have a laugh unintentionally. When he talked of how the Left "likes to think of itself as the smart people, the educated people, the sensitive and thoughtful and reasonable people" I suddenly wondered if he was subtly saying that the Left is from Mars and that the Deplorables are from Venus. Hah! Now that is a thought.<br><br><a href=#c5456232915737131699 title="comment permalink">2/24/17, 1:28 AM</a><br><br>

Just "subjectively flowing" or something like that...: another representation to support the appearance of perception and the "processes" that bring about the representations themselves.

On an everyday level, yes, we work with representations of our body quite often as a matter of practicality and of sharing experiences through language. But there are things that we do or participate in, and they tend to be "primitive," for which the representational content is non-essential. Using your example of hunger/food - what is essential to that complex of relations is something we call digestion which we do not experience as representational (at least I don't.)<br>We could theorize digestion as a relationship of will and gradients of resistance or levels of predation in an ecosystem, but I find the metaphor overly bellicose, and such metaphors as Lynn Margulis' bacterial cooperations or Emma Restall Orr's wakefulness (The Wakeful World: Animism, Mind, and the Self in Nature) to be rather more simpatico.<br><br><a href=#c8144453914425614600 title="comment permalink">2/24/17, 9:10 AM</a><br><br>

It is indeed helpful to think in this ecological metaphor.<br><br>What itches me about Schopenhauer's vision, and especially the way it seems to be expressed in the Lovecraft sonnetJMG drew attention to, is to imagine the impersonal, amoral Will as something unitary and separate from the individual wills. From what I read, it is this that grated on Scotlyn as well, and not the ecological metaphor. I think Schopenhauer even compares the different manifestations of the Will to Platonic ideas, ontologically prior and more fundamental than the individuals.

Please forgive the length and complexity of the quote, pregnant nevertheless with insight gleaned in part from Schopenhauer.<br><br>"It is in reason that intellect and will, which in our nature are mysteriously bound up together, seek to come to a mutual understanding. The ultimate knowledge that we strive to acquire is knowledge of life, which intellect looks at from without, will from within. Since life is the ultimate object of knowledge, our ultimate knowledge is necessarily our thinking experience of life. But this does not lie outside the sphere of reason, but within reason itself. Only when the will has thought out its relation to the intellect--has come, as far as it can, into line with it, has penetrated it, and in it become logical--is it in a position to comprehend itself, so far as its nature allows this, as a part of the universal will-to-live and a part of being in general. If it merely leaves the intellect on one side, it loses itself in confused imaginings, while the intellect--which, like the rationalism of the past, will not allow that in order to understand life it must finally lose itself in thinking experience--renounces all hope of constructing a deep and firmly based worldview. Thus reflection, when pursued to the end, leads somewhere and somehow to a living mysticism, which is for all men everywhere a necessary element of thought."<br><br><a href=#c2893754339132384226 title="comment permalink">2/24/17, 10:54 AM</a><br><br>

It confirmed something I experienced once in meditation--the type of meditation where you put aside verbal thought and simply observe "the thing in itself," by looking around at the setting in which you find yourself. I was sitting in my car in the Home Depot parking lot at the time. (You can meditate anywhere.) It happened to occur to me to reflect on "who" or "what" was doing the looking--not the physical apparatus of the physical eye, but of the "mind." I felt I perceived a kind of abstract "self," and inner "observer." The feelings that arose from this were extraordinary.<br><br>I also had a sense of all the inanimate objects around me having a kind of sentience of their own. I could perceive it. It did seem like kind of a travesty that these sentient objects should have been shaped by the human will into things like steering wheels and hood ornaments, pavements and parking-lot stripes, though I could not discern that they had a problem with this. <br><br>Since reading your piece on this, I got to thinking a little more about this experience, and this division of the "inwardness" who is the "observer" into a will to exist (the sentience of the inanimate), a will to life, and a will to experience. <br><br>So it would seem like the human body itself is composed of an aggregation of both inanimate and animate "wills to exist" and "wills to life" oraganized into the human organism (the body) by that human's "will to life." The "will to life" seems to me to be pretty much the same as the "will to experience," since the purpose of willing so many other wills into a organization like the human body is a purposeful expression of will of the "inwardness" or "observer" to construct a sensory apparatus to observe <i>with</i>. <br><br>I tend to think of the mind as simply the activity of the physical brain as "processor" of sense data. The mind is for what I would call "operative" knowledge. The mind is what shapes "the thing in itself" into the image we project onto it, and it does so for pure "operative" purposes, related to maintaining the body's desired organization (keeping it alive). It's interesting, too, that, the "will to life," having organized a biological organism, has also organized a will to create more life through reproduction--at least equal to the "will to life" itself, and sometimes superseding it. So you would suppose that the "will to life" requires an aggregation of many "wills to life" operating as a kind of social communion.<br><br>You could suppose that the inanimate "stuff" also exists in a sort of social communion with us, in the sense of its being "willing" to be aggregated into life forms by our wills, or shaped by our wills into objects that support these aggregates' (our bodies') persistence as life forms. They are fine with being shaped into quilts or steering wheels--though the animate forms are perhaps resistant to becoming food in many cases.<br><br><a href=#c5530436070323438196 title="comment permalink">2/25/17, 12:02 PM</a><br><br>

There are more things in mind, in the imagination than “you” can keep track of – thoughts, memories, images, angers, delights, rise unbidden. The depths of mind, the unconscious, are our inner wilderness areas, and that is where a bobcat is right now. I do not mean personal bobcats in personal psyches, but the bobcat that roams from dream to dream. The conscious agenda-planning ego occupies a very tiny territory, a little cubicle somewhere near the gate, keeping track of some of what goes in and out (and sometimes making expansionistic plots), and the rest takes care of itself. The body is, so to speak, in the mind. They are both wild. ” <br><br>Seems a passable correlate of JMG's ecological description of mind.

We are defined by our relationships. This radical ambiguity and radical dependence can be deeply troubling, as anyone whose lived with even another human being for any length of time soon discovers. We must learn to get along with those upon whom we depend, even as they annoy us. In order to move on from the nihilistic torpidty that can accompany the realization of such radical ambiguity, we have the opportunity to learn certain skillful ways of orienting our thinking and perceiving (through meditation, ritual)-- soas to fulfill this hackneyed, yet perspicacious prayer:<br><br>God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,<br>Courage to change the things I can,<br>And wisdom to know the difference.<br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c7867778710408054228 title="comment permalink">2/25/17, 4:05 PM</a><br><br>

This is not what Confucianism is talking about, however. At most, it would be a neo-Confucian experimental blend with capitalism, but anyone aside from a blind ideologue can look down the road and see that rampant consumerism has no future. In Japan, even those who believe in progress are critical of people driving extinctions worldwide. To them, that is not how progress was supposed to unfold. Excessive consumerism is seen as mere selfishness: the antithesis of desirable behavior. In the Edo period, where Confucianism was more highly esteemed than currently, they created a sustainable society, with Confucian ethics playing a big role in it. Stability and harmony are two of its highest ideals.<br><br>The focus is very local (with notable exceptions such as the World War II nationalized "Shinto" ideology, which was rightly discredited), on the household and community level. Thus, if "consume, consume, consume" within your community would help cement it, then by all means. Usually, it doesn't. In Japan, however, I have long noticed a tendency to focus so strongly on local relationships that even national impacts, not to mention global, go ignored. That is a valid criticism of Confucianism as it exists. Each community needs a sage or two who can point out larger-scale impacts of local behavior. The highly mobile modern age has resulted in a breakdown of such communities, with the Internet age adding even more damage, as you see everywhere now.<br><br><a href=#c6340853230273125194 title="comment permalink">2/25/17, 5:29 PM</a><br><br>

And, as such, not at all something we directly experience. <br><br>In my opinion, you need to invoke blind forces when all you think you have to work with is inert matter, which can do nothing of itself. But if that is all you believe you have to work with, then your world is still a materialist one - and such a world model cannot account for ANYTHING I experience - will, representation, mind, body - any of it. As soon as I have AN experience, inert matter worked upon by blind force fails to be the model that explains me. It fails to describe the universe that contains me. (This works so long as you can sustain the materialist trick of discounting "subjective" experience, though).<br><br>I do not think "agent" and "self" are interchangeable terms. By agent I simply mean any entity which moves itself. (As JMG said in a tongue in cheek aside - "they do it themselves (interact) without doing the math" [comment on the three-body problem].<br><br>As I understand it, my "self" may comprise many different agents, nested inside one another in different ways, at different scales, sometimes working in concert, sometimes at cross-purposes - an ecosystem of agents. <br><br>In theory, agents could include every entity that there is - electrons and other particles, though the nature of their "selfhood" would lie far outside the reach of our understanding. <br><br>Perhaps people who get the math would be interested in seeing (or critiquing Hoffman's calculations on how physics *could be* derived entirely from agents (he says "conscious agents" I say wilful agents" - but anyway, agents). <br><br>It goes without saying that a world made entirely of agents at every scale, can certainly account for "me" - and for all the representations I experience! <br><br>"Deriving Physics From Conscious Agents: Transforming View-Look..." http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/PhysicsFromConsciousness.pdf<br><br><a href=#c7751149674961320937 title="comment permalink">2/25/17, 9:09 PM</a><br><br>

The question for me is whether matter can exist independently of will and perhaps more importantly whether will can exist independently of matter.<br><br>If at its primary level 'will to exist' applies to matter (matter as we perceive it) then I can only assume that will is a requirement of matter and integral to its existence. This naturally leads to a possibility that matter is a combination of energy and will or that energy and will are the same.<br><br>If this is the case, can will exist outside of matter? Energy seems to be able to radiate in waves that we don't perceive as matter. Maybe will can? Can different levels of will exist in different states? It would seem so but can they do it without matter? How does memory fit into this (I'm thinking of Sheldrake's work in particular)?<br><br>I've just re-read Emma Restall Orr's book The Wakeful World which covers very similar ground in her exploration of Animism and what she refers to as mind but is clearly semantically aligned to Shopenhauer's will. Her book and your blog posts leave questions of what happens when our bodies die and whether there are non-physical spirits that we can somehow communicate with, unanswered.<br><br>On a related note, I see that the existence of ghosts has been disproven by science. They are not detectable by the Large Hadron Collider which can detect all forms of energy apparently (but maybe it can't detect will...) <br><br>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/ghosts-brian-cox-large-hadron-collider-cern-real-truth-standard-model-physics-a7598026.html <br><br><br><br><a href=#c8032212586299654359 title="comment permalink">2/26/17, 12:31 AM</a><br><br>

In the cyclical theory of history, the educated classes of western civilization (and most people reading this blog form part of that class one way or another) have reached the point where reflection runs off the rails into nihilism. It expresses itself in relativism and post-modernism, among other things, in our civilization. That's the cause of the current psychological and social chaos. That's why Schopenhauer's emphasis on getting back to epistemology could be a good antidote. <br><br>I think the way it links in with Burke is that once you embrace epistemological modesty, the idea of organizing human societies based on the precautionary principle rather than abstract ideas makes perfect sense. <br><br>That means the end of the left insofar as it's based on the 'scientific' rationality of Marx etc. It also means the end of liberalism in the sense of a principle of organizing society based on abstract concepts like Equality, Justice, Liberty, Solidarity etc. And the end of conservatism in the sense of organizing the world based on ideas like Americanism, Spreading Democracy, Capitalism/Free Enterprise, Libertarianism etc. They're all going to dissolve just as the political disputes within Roman civilization meant nothing to a 7th century inhabitant of Britain. <br><br>If you take Schopenhauer seriously, and follow his logic, he offers a potentially sane ending to the Age of Reason that our civilization has been in since the Enlightenment. If anyone is to succeed in conserving the best parts of western civilization through the Dark Age we're currently entering then they need to get ahead of the curve philosophically. <br><br>This is what's happening under the hood of 21st century western politics:<br><br>"Shatter the shared figurations and abstractions that provide a complex literate society with its basis for collective thought and action, and you’re left with a society in fragments, where biological drives and idiosyncratic personal agendas are the only motives left, and communication between divergent subcultures becomes impossible because there aren’t enough common meanings left to make that an option. The plunge into nihilism becomes almost impossible to avoid once abstraction runs into trouble on a collective scale, furthermore, because reflection is the automatic response to the failure of a society’s abstract representations of the cosmos. As it becomes painfully clear that the beliefs of the civil religion central to a society’s age of reason no longer correspond to the world of everyday experience, the obvious next step is to reflect on what went wrong and why, and away you go."<br><br>Mallow. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c4291172945905545294 title="comment permalink">2/27/17, 3:17 AM</a><br><br>

"The body politic has rebelled against its self-proclaimed mind!"<br><br>The predominantly reductionistic materialists I hang out with (and number myself among) also contend mostly against the prevailing dualistic view, though we do occasionally get idealist monists and various philosophical extremists (such as mereological nihilists) to challenge us. We frequently refer to the legs-running problem as a metaphor for the body-mind problem (e.g. "If you dissect the legs where do you find the running?" and "where does running go when the legs stop moving?")<br><br>But, I find that most materialists, however vehemently they claim to disagree with the dualists, tend to veer toward conclusions congruent (even if by negation) with those of dualism. For instance, they overwhelmingly maintain that without a traditional afterlife, our experiencing selves must instead cease to exist utterly after death. This might be justified if they also held that those selves originated out of nothing (or out of brain functioning alone) to begin with, but materialism cannot make any such claim. The misleading notion that there is a sharp divide between what we experience as self and everything else in the world carries over from dualism, in the form of viewing the self as resulting solely from "neural activity" rather than, more reasonably, from the interaction of neural activity with a complex world that is already vastly enriched by, among other important things, effects and products of eons of previous neural activity. For me, the logical conclusion from monist materialist premises, and from what we think we know so far of how brains and bodies actually work, is that the separation between the perceived self and the world is largely or entirely illusory—much like certain other traditions have long claimed.<br><br>That's if there is even such a thing as "after" death. I'm reasonably confident that the nature of most things I perceive, those representations, have some resemblance to some actual thing. When I see and feel a tree, there's something tree-shaped and tree-functioning out there, even if it's actually made of energy fields or quantum probabilities or god dreams or whatever. But I have no such confidence when it comes to the nature of time.<br><br>Not that I think time isn't real. Our perception of time probably has some cause; for example, evolution seems to have equipped us to attempt to survive by anticipating and avoiding adverse events in the future rather than by altering adverse events already suffered in the past. That strongly suggests the former works and the latter, for whatever mysterious reason, doesn't. But it doesn't mean time necessarily takes the form we perceive it as, a steady flow of events from one moment to the next.<br><br>I note that the occasions at which I'm aware of will, I'm also aware of time, and wherever I perceive Schopehauerian will in action, that is to say when I see movement or change, I also perceive separation in time, a "before" and "after" the change.

(Do you recall Jung's famous remark that he thanked God he wasn't a Jungian? I suspect Plato must have said the same sort of thing at least once.) It's the Platonic tradition as it evolved in history, rather than Plato himself, that had an enduring influence on the way we think. <br><br>Chrisroy, good. It explains both the successes and the failures -- but we'll get to that. <br><br>Gottfried, thanks for the links. <br><br>My Donkey, excellent. You get Wednesday's belated gold star for noticing that something has to power those pumps, and that something is going to emit carbon...<br><br>Eric, once people start capitalizing abstractions (e.g., Being) you've plunged way too deep into abstraction. As for "who or what does the willing," do you know for a fact that there must be someone doing so? Or are you simply, as I suggested in the post, allowing a representation ("myself") to slip into your analysis? Pay close attention to your experience and there is no agent -- there is simply will -- and at that point you no longer have to debate how many agents can dance on the head of a single act of will...<br><br>Scotlyn, I addressed this directly in the post. The agent -- that is, "yourself" -- is the ur-representation, and close logical analysis, introspection, or scientific experimentation allows you to get past that to impersonal will. To borrow your metaphor, the will is the dancer, the agent is the clothing. Again, I quite understand that this is an unfamiliar and even a troubling perspective, and it's very natural to insist on not thinking about the world that way, but I'd like to encourage you to make the effort; you can, of course, continue refusing to do so, but how much will you learn that way?<br><br><a href=#c3732108306019300262 title="comment permalink">2/27/17, 11:39 AM</a><br><br>

It's partly that most people operate on the level of content rather than structure, but it's also that the mind-body duality, with the mind as the Mini-Me perched inside the head manipulating the machinery, is the only kind of self most people in contemporary western cultures can imagine, and a challenge to that makes them feel that they're losing the only self they have. That letting go of the Mini-Me might enable them to attain a sense of self that isn't utterly isolated from the rest of the cosmos is not something they grasp easily...<br><br>NomadicBeer, delighted to hear it. After you've reflected on this post, try glancing back over the other two and see if they make more sense. <br><br>Repent, no, that's not the point -- or more precisely, it's not my point. The mind-body problem doesn't have to be solved, because it's based on an arbitrary and incoherent understanding of the self. Get rid of that and it goes away instantly, like all the problems trying to make the solar system work with Earth in the middle...<br><br>Llmaiwi, Evola's "Knowledge of the Waters" essay is heavily influenced by Schopenhauer, so it's not surprising you noticed a similarity! The difference in tone between those and the Tao Te Ching is quite simple, but it's going to take some further discussion to get there. Stay tuned! <br><br>Brian, good. You're getting warm. <br><br>Patricia, you're quite right that the English word "will" does tend to get tangled up in questions of free will. In German <i>Wille</i> (will) and <i>Willkuer</i> (free will) are sufficiently distinct that confusion is less easy. That said, "will" remains the best translation in English for what Schopenhauer was trying to say. <br><br>Peter, good. Dreams are useful models, since the sense of agency or selfhood in dreams can be very mutable; the will-to-dream continues, while a sense of identity comes and goes. <br><br>Lucius, Augustine rejects the idea of the <i>moral</i> teachability of the soul, but that rejection is based on his belief that an outside factor -- the Fall and its consequences -- interferes with the soul's moral teachability. Thus it's an accidental disability rather than an inherent one, and this prevents broader conclusions from being drawn from it. <br><br>Rusty, interesting. Why a clown? <br><br>Sgage, thank you. <br><br>Graeme, it's not eliminative, because it discards the concept of matter as unnecessary, but it cheerfully admits that all the sensory properties we experience are actual experiences, and that there is actually something "out there" being experienced. An eliminative idealism would insist that there's nothing "out there" at all. <br><br>Matthias, thanks for the recommendation.<br><br><a href=#c1411748026852840265 title="comment permalink">2/27/17, 11:59 AM</a><br><br>

One place that reflection leads me in terms of looking at will in its purest form is the movement of air and water. In that situation there are no agents... just the movement itself, which is a result of will. You mentioned that we become aware of will only when it pushes against our own in some way... in the situation of air, we become aware of it when it pushes against us in the form of wind, waves, and currents.<br><br>Another concept that I am reminded of is your aliens in Stars Reach, for whom the concept of individual agents was as abstract, distant, and advanced concept, since their representations of reality were based around flows and continua.<br><br>There is another, further question that emerges from that reflection:<br><br>In all of this, there do seem to be different types of will. Going back to the finger exercise, there's a distinct difference in the direct experience of what is happening between someone else taking hold of my finger and wiggling it for me, my finger twitching on its own as a reflex response due to being pricked with a needle, moving my finger as a fluid, thoughtless part of some other action such as gripping an object or typing on a keyboard, and me consciously thinking about the act of moving my finger and then doing it. These are all various functions of will, but seem to be different (and, going back to your ecosystem metaphor, would be different parts of that ecosystem of will that informs the representation of the self.) So... is the apparent difference between those above listed types of finger movement a direct function of will, or a representation that emerges as the experience of will is processed? Since classification is definitely representation and saying "these two things are different" is a type of classification it seems like the latter would be the case... but I also can't seem to make the reflexive finger twitch and the intentional finger movement come down to the same basic experience. Is there a level of introspection at which the differences between those two experiences flatten out into a basic experience of pure will and that representation fades away? Or is that particular representation "the experience of a finger twitch is different from a finger movement" so basic that all other experiences are going to be colored and shaped by it?<br><br><a href=#c7934724040422414908 title="comment permalink">2/27/17, 12:48 PM</a><br><br>

Equally, since the only universe we can experience is one framed by our senses and minds, the structure of the universe we experience will necessarily echo our own structure. Either way Yggdrasil represents both the microcosm and the macrocosm. <br><br>Fudoshin, excellent! You're getting *really* warm. <br><br>Cathy, good. What psychologists and mystics call the ego is a very important concept to keep in mind here, because it's not the self -- it's a representation of the self. You're familiar with Jung, right? His distinction between ego and self is highly relevant here -- and the self in his sense is not a person but a force. More on this as we proceed! <br><br>Aslja, thanks for the reference. <br><br>Brett, I know. This is really heavy lifting for the neurons, but the exercise is good for them. ;-)<br><br>Fred, you know, I think Schopenhauer would approve of that. Another way of phrasing the same thing I got from an old book of hippie philosophy: "Why am I in a headspace where this is real?"<br><br>Mark, good. The will to enlightenment is also a manifestation of will. As for the distortion of will you got in books on willpower and the like, why, yes, we'll be getting to that also in good time. <br><br>Ozark, that's really a solid argument. Given that the complexity and interconnectedness of a single cubic yard of fertile soil is many orders of magnitude greater than the complexity and interconnectedness of a human brain, if consciousness is the product of complexity and interconnectedness in matter, then the soil should be thinking, too...<br><br>Tim, glad to hear it. Yes, the experience of internal conflict, of passions pulling one way and thoughts another way, of drives and motives competing with one another, is a constant human experience, and doesn't support the hierarchical model at all. More as we proceed! <br><br>Thijs, it may also be a cultural difference -- I keep on reminding myself that I can really only speak about the conventional wisdom on this side of the pond, north of the Rio Grande and south of the Canadian border.<br><br>Chrisroy, no, that's not the crux. As long as you're imposing a "who" on the will, you're missing my point. <br><br>Robin, a nice summary!

Thus you're going to have to do better than that if you want to make an argument for the habitual! <br><br>Karl, thank you. <br><br>Patricia, Confucian philosophy is the logical outgrowth of the whole Chinese philosophical tradition, with its focus on the relation between the individual and society. I tend to prefer the Taoist approach of standing apart from society, but then I'm a weirdo. ;-)<br><br>Robert, I'd say that all the political parties in both countries fall very, very far from the morality they claim to uphold. As for the Druids -- well, we're as human as everybody else, you know. <br><br>KL Cooke, I have a book in mind, for what it's worth. <br><br>Tony, there's an interesting distinction between deity-as-noun and deity-as-verb that we'll be exploring in due time. <br><br>Cherokee, the advantage to thinking that you're separate from the environment is that then you can convince yourself that you can have power over it. That's a drug a lot of people love to abuse...<br><br>Brian, got it in one. Freud was riffing off of a different aspect of Schopenhauer, one we haven't really discussed yet -- and yes, his thinking and the Mini-Me theory of mind and body don't really work together at all. <br><br>Marvin, that is to say, you're staying strictly within the conventional wisdom of our culture. That's fine, but you're going to miss a lot of interesting scenery -- and some even more interesting possibilities. <br><br>William, close. What I'm asking is for people to set aside their familiar maps for a while and take a close look at the landscape around them, to see if things might appear in a different light if approached from the perspective of a different map. I'm glad that some are willing to do so. <br><br>Mr. (witchy woo) R., keep in mind that from the Schopenhauerian perspective, "matter" and "mind" are both representations, and neither one is more real than the other.

Okay, I get that. So? <br><br>David, once you get into Heidegger, you're basically lost in a fog with no road signs showing the way out. "Being" is an abstract category -- that is, a conceptual model come up with by human beings to try to sort out the blooming, buzzing confusion of existence. It's inaccurate to say that will is a being, and just as inaccurate to say that will isn't a being -- the question is simply whether the abstract category "being" helps you make sense of will more than it hinders, or vice versa. <br><br>DaShui, it's the other way around. The occultists -- Eliphas Levi foremost among them -- borrowed his ideas from Schopenhauer. <br><br>Gralle, hmm. Your metaphor suggests more isolation than I think the facts merit. As we proceed, you might consider other options. <br><br>None, thank you. <br><br>David, exactly. We'll be talking at some length as we proceed about the way that people get imprisoned by their own abstractions. <br><br>Dammerung, funny. It's a perfectly valid and useful English word. <br><br>Lady H., that's the plan!<br><br>Gerald, and yet people in many spiritual traditions are taught to contemplate their own deaths. I think you may be overgeneralizing from a limited sample. <br><br>Iuval, you haven't yet grasped the implications of Schopenhauer's argument that everything other than the will is simply a representation. Time, space, and matter are representations (more precisely, abstract categories built out of representations). The universe is a representation. Will is the one reality -- and we'll get further into the question of one will vs. many wills as we proceed. <br><br>RogerCO, exactly. Thank you for getting it. <br><br>Unfrozen, of course words are representations. If you experience it, it's a representation -- that was Schopenhauer's point. <br><br>Robert, Schopenhauer is all about the experience of the red ball. You have the experience; that is, a representation of the kind we can label with words such as "red" and "ball" appears in your awareness. That experience is a reality. Everything else -- matter, light, all the stuff that physicists and physiologists talk about -- has to be inferred from that experience, and is simply a matter of piling up models to try to make sense of the fact of experience.<br><br><a href=#c1436299656549027656 title="comment permalink">2/27/17, 8:20 PM</a><br><br>

That's another way of approaching the same insight. <br><br>LifeSMyth, SandWyrm, and James, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Andrew, there I'd disagree. Schopenhauer is elegaic; much of the Nag Hammadi library to me reads like paranoid conspiracy theory, reinterpreting the events of the Book of Genesis the way that conspiracists reinterpret the events of 9/11 or the Kennedy assassination. <br><br>Beetleswamp, yes, this gives your brain a good hard workout! Glad to hear you're still in the gym pumping representations... ;-)<br><br>Vicky, nope -- I did think that once, but it was quite a bit more than a few years back. As for instincts, those would be particular expressions of will. <br><br>Phil, that sort of experience -- which Schopenhauer also had -- is one of the many things that feeds into his theory. <br><br>Daddy, oh my. That must be quite the experience. <br><br>Matthias, nah, it's just that awkward facts are beginning to seep through the mythology of progress...<br><br>Unknown, you pretty much have to buckle down and read the first volume of <i>The World as Will and Representation</i>. Take it a bit at a time. <br><br>Mike K, so-called "out of body experience" simply shows that representations don't have to involve the material senses, a point that could also be gotten from dreams. You're not thinking through the implications of the ideas I'm discussing. <br><br>Degringolade, thank you. <br><br>Nati, we'll be challenging his ethical theory as we proceed, since it's only one of many (not just two) options that can unfold from his philosophy. <br><br>Avery, thank you.

"Magic" is a complicated word to apply to that stage of Greek culture, since the ritual practices involved hadn't really distinguished themselves from certain phases of religion and philosophy. It's entirely possible, mind you, that Parmenides didn't intend his teachings the way that they were taken by later thinkers -- but of course it's the latter that matters in the long run. <br><br>Crow Hill, you're welcome and thank you. <br><br>Kevin, here again, you're assuming that the individual comes first and the will comes out of it, and Schopenhauer is saying exactly the opposite. Will is a blind force differentiating itself, and these things we call "individuals" -- who are in fact not in-dividual, that is, indivisible, at all -- are produced out of it.

One thing that learning about Peak Oil has done for me is to put a spotlight on the "will" in society and how it responds relatively predictably to it's environment at a much simpler level than our explanations tend to allow.<br><br>I think there is much in Spinoza that you would not like, his whole solution was reached via a very mind heavy effort, but I thought his interpretation to some aspects of reality (such as the mind/body problem) were elegant. For him God is the totality of nature (therefore infinite and all powerful - he seems to take these basic concepts of monotheism literally and then logically derives conclusions from this point that verge wildly with people before him), and God has infinite attributes, which are ways he can be known, we have access to two of these attributes, thought and extension. For Spinoza our knowledge of God must be incomplete but he felt our job was to try to know him better through the use of logic and reason. <br><br>Both Schopenhauer (of what I've read) and Spinoza solve the free will problem in similar ways (not sure if I agree entirely with either of them, but their insight is helpful certainly), that is to say that free will just means you will do what you most want to at any given time, so you ARE free to do that, but since you don't get to choose what you want that freedom is much more limited than it seems.<br><br>Spinoza's conclusions here were interesting to me also, his ethics is very close to a kind of stoicism, or maybe the writings of Lao Tzu, seemingly suggesting that people find simple ways to satisfy their desires. I found him worth reading even though so much of his writing is quite arrogant in it's dismissal of things I think are perfectly valid approaches to the same problems (it's very much "Reason or get the heck out!")<br><br>Probably my message here will get in too late for comment but I only just got to check this week's post as we've got a newborn over here now disrupting just about everything - among other things he's a great study so far in seeing human will at it's core.<br><br><a href=#c6991163727845895849 title="comment permalink">2/28/17, 3:11 AM</a><br><br>

As such it would suggest it probably emerges as a product of complexity in systems.<br><br>I should say - in addition to my Spinoza ramble above, that Spinoza believed there was some degree of thought in everything, which struck me as similar to the way Schopenhauer sees the Will in everything, although I think Schopenhauer's removal of the mind makes for a much more convincing argument. It's much easier, for instance, for me to see the Will in a rock (often the geological forces of it's formation are apparent within it's very structure) than for me to see it as a thinking agent. Schopenhauer would probably point out "what is thinking?" here though.<br><br>I think Spinoza's insight that thought and extension are two attributes of God, therefore two ways of coming to know Him (or reality), therefore two ways of knowing the same thing, is very valuable, but the insistence that these are the only two we can access seems like something he locks down definitively for no real reason (probably just accepting Decartes baggage) - Spinoza wanted to write philosophy that was as mathematically perfect as Euclid's work (so relevant again to your post) but for me that means that most of his basic steps I found rigid, dogmatic and unfounded, (and a bit frustrating to read honestly), even if I think those tools eventually get him to great places.<br><br><br><a href=#c3263197932237225095 title="comment permalink">2/28/17, 3:32 AM</a><br><br>

That doesn't mean that the human being consists of "mind" plus "body" without a line between them; it means that there may be other lines drawn in other places, and that there can be whole realms of human experience that aren't included in either of these two too-narrow categories. <br><br>Chrisroy, and if "matter" isn't on the far side of a wall raised by "mind," it becomes hard to justify treating, say, topsoil the way we do...<br><br>Jeanne, that's intriguing. Have you read Oliver Sacks' <i>A Leg to Stand On</i>? He discusses a psychological equivalent. <br><br>Crow Hill, the difference is that it's easy to slide into the notion of the mind ruling the body, and from there you're right back into the mind-body muddle I'm trying to break down.

As I said, you can get there by sheer introspection, and you've just demonstrated that.

I may have gotten some of this perspective from my Japanese stepfamily, who are Shingon Buddhists -- if I understand correctly, the Shingon-shu is tolerably closely related to Tendai/Tientai. <br><br>Stuart, what is this "matter" that you keep on talking about? All we have to go on are representations, and the abstractions we extract from them. "Matter" is such an abstraction. You seem to be arguing that this abstraction is somehow more basic to existence than the representations from which our minds derive it, which is odd from a Schopenhauerian perspective. <br><br>Phil, by all means relax. This is hard work. <br><br>Nancy, why do you insist that they're in competition? I'm suggesting that we try an alternative way of looking at the world, to see what we can see from that perspective. <br><br>Nati, as I noted early on, we don't make representations consciously -- not once we're past infancy, outside of a very few situations.

For the last two weeks, from my perspective, you've been trying every twist and turn you can think of to shove the real existence of personal agents down Schopenhauer's throat. <i><b>In his philosophy they do not exist except as representations</b></i>. You don't have to believe that; I'm not asking for belief. I'm asking my readers to consider looking at the cosmos that way for a little while, in order to see certain features that are obscured by our belief in conscious personal agents (and in "mind" and "matter," among other hippogriffs). <br><br>From a Schopenhauerian perspective, persons do not exist in reality. You do not exist. I do not exist. Donald Trump does not exist, except in the realm of representations. <i><b>In the real world there is only blind pressure</b></i> -- and if you try to twist that around yet again to find some way to insist that there have to be persons down there somewhere, so help me, I'm simply going to delete your comment. I'm trying to explain a way of looking at the world that's counterintuitive to most people in the modern western world. If you're not willing to try seeing the world that way, that's fine, but insisting on your intuitive take on what words like "will" mean isn't at all helpful in that context, you know. Again, you don't have to believe Schopenhauer's vision -- but please stop trying to browbeat me and the other commenters into turning it into something that it's not! <br><br>If you'd like to understand, let go of your map and pick up the one I'm trying to offer you. There is no experiencer. There are no persons. There is nothing but will, described tentatively by representations such as "blind pressure," and its modifications. Since it's blind, it collides with itself constantly, and the various grades of will are reactions to those collisions. As complexity mounts, you get loose tangles of will that act to preserve themselves: the will to live. Further up the same scale, you get tangles of will complex enough that they represent their surroundings to themselves, at first very simply, then with increasing intricacy: the will to experience. Still further, representations break loose from strict correspondence with the environment and become abstract concepts; the will to understand. Conscious personal agents are representations that a few really complex tangles of will use to try to make sense of other really complex tangles of will, and that's all they are. They aren't realities. The only reality is the one we represent by such abstractions as "blind pressure." <br><br>That's Schopenhauer's map. Again, you don't have to believe it; you don't have to like it; it doesn't have to make sense to you -- but that's his vision, and that's what I'm talking about. You've already made it clear that you disagree with it; so noted. Are you going to keep on hammering on a point already addressed, or can you set that aside for a bit and see if maybe, just maybe, there's a point to looking at the world from Schopenhauer's angle? <br><br>Johnny, congrats on the new arrival! We'll be talking about the profound muddle over free will a little later, but yes, Schopenhauer's approach is like Spinoza's, and cuts straight down the middle, avoiding the errors on either side. Your take on consciousness is very close to Schopenhauer's, and also to that of systems theorists such as Ervin Laszlo; more on this as we proceed. <br><br>Allen, then why didn't you respond to the actual point of the essay, which was that the entire division of the universe of human experience into the categories "mind" and "matter" is fundamentally flawed? <br><br><br><br><a href=#c8513061700116499056 title="comment permalink">2/28/17, 1:00 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you for replying to my comment. I am an avid reader of your blog, and I want to thank you for leading me back into philosophy. But I'm not so sure about Schoepenaur. I have some very general criticisms, but I will save most of them for until after I have read your next post. (I can hardly wait!) For now I will say that I do wonder if S really understood the German Idealism he was criticizing. <br><br>A red flag for me was your claim above that causality is ". . . a mode of interaction among representations." To this Old Kant would probably reply that causality is a mode of interaction among representations insofar as our experience of the world is intelligible. This is an important distinction. <br><br>How are categories such such as Time and Space abstracted from the field of representations if they aren't already given? (Are we back to David Hume?) <br><br>Then there is this metaphor of the window as a medium, which is used to introduce the concept of representation. How are we able to distinguish between the window and what is really going on outside if we don't already believe many other things? Most generally we must have already have made the epistemological distinction between appearance and reality. This epistemological distinction seems to require a (non-epistemic) understanding that there is a world and this world is present as an intelligible unity. <br><br>As for Heidegger, I will take your advice and be careful not to get lost. But I think that H would reply to your comment above by denying (with Kant)that that Being is a concept at all. He would wonder how Being could ever be abstracted from ". . . the blooming, buzzing confusion of existence" if it wasn't already there. <br> <br><br>Again, I want to reiterate that I have learned a lot from you and respect you greatly. <br><br> <br><br><br><a href=#c6364263938006028866 title="comment permalink">2/28/17, 7:28 PM</a><br><br>

From an interview of A. Jodorowsky<br><br>There was a Tibetan master who said, "Nothing is real, everything is an illusion." One day, his disciples come to him and tell him that his son, his only son, is dying, and he begins to scream. The disciples ask: "Master, why are you screaming like that? Your son is an illusion." And the master says, "Yes, but he was the most beautiful of all the illusions."<br><br><a href=#c3246718824351163496 title="comment permalink">3/1/17, 7:45 AM</a><br><br>

Very stimulating series of articles for me. The comments are stimulating too. I'm trying to map Schopenhauer's will and representation onto models I have arrived at myself through various sources/experiences/thought including Lao Tzu. The fit seems not bad so far though I am aware I do not know enough Schopenhauer be certain and am eager to read and learn more.<br><br>Thoughts: will as a monism - maybe you said this but I can't find it. Logically since the only real thing (=not a representation) I can directly experience is will (of various grades) and I experience representations then representations are a grade/form of will. I don't really trust syllogisms like this but it expresses the thought concisely. Would Schopenhauer agree (more or less) with this?<br><br>I am really curious to hear Schopenhauer's take on 'free will' and determinism and how it fits into his model of will and representation - and especially curious to hear your take. This seems critical to me and may be where Schopenhauer's model and mine part ways.<br><br>Also curious what Schopenhauer opines on the possibility/existence of immaterial 'beings'. It's one of those things hard to explain in theory but which reported observations say we shouldn't be quick to exclude. Does will offer a way?<br><br>Thanks again for this fantastic series.<br><br><a href=#c13554939386328418 title="comment permalink">3/1/17, 8:22 AM</a><br><br>

To get into more detail on our subconscious and other factors that really drive how we make decisions, Dave Cohen has written a few essays (the "Flatland" essays, his blog is here http://www.declineoftheempire.com/) that get into it pretty well I feel, and is supported by some of the science that shows in some cases we truly only are responsible for 2% or less of the actual 'decisions' we make every moment.<br><br><a href=#c4920822583898811522 title="comment permalink">3/1/17, 9:51 AM</a><br><br>

I was really disappointed to see that Trump is increasing military spending 10%.

It feels like he is doing what Hillary would have done in terms of spending. Once again it looks like there is no real choice between the two political parties.

Understandable that you seem to have deleted it upon your return. I'd hoped that the subtext would justify it -- my appreciation for your placing Jung in a more scientific context. I retain my interest in Jung and the Church, but I can't accept their mythologies, the church's received, Jung's created. Neither of their road maps to the psyche applied to the terrain I've traveled.<br><br>Chastened, I'll grapple farther with your ideas.
