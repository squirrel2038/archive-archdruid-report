<div class=MsoNormal>
It can be hard to remember these days that not much more than half a century ago, philosophy was something you read about in general-interest magazines and the better grade of newspapers. Existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre was an international celebrity; the posthumous publication of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s <i>Le Phenomenon Humaine</i> (the English translation, predictably, was titled <i>The Phenomenon of Man</i>) got significant flurries of media coverage; Random House’s Vintage Books label brought out cheap mass-market paperback editions of major philosophical writings from Plato straight through to Nietzsche and beyond, and made money off them. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Though philosophy was never really part of the cultural mainstream, it had the same kind of following as avant-garde jazz, say, or science fiction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At any reasonably large cocktail party you had a pretty fair chance of meeting someone who was into it, and if you knew where to look in any big city—or any college town with pretensions to intellectual culture, for that matter—you could find at least one bar or bookstore or all-night coffee joint where the philosophy geeks hung out, and talked earnestly into the small hours about Kant or Kierkegaard. What’s more, that level of interest in the subject had been pretty standard in the Western world for a very long time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We’ve come a long way since then, and not in a particularly useful direction. These days, if you hear somebody talk about philosophy in the media, it’s probably a scientific materialist like Neil deGrasse Tyson ranting about how all philosophy is nonsense. The occasional work of philosophical exegesis still gets a page or two in the <i>New York Review of Books</i> now and then, but popular interest in the subject has vanished, and more than vanished: the sort of truculent ignorance about philosophy displayed by Tyson and his many equivalents has become just as common among the chattering classes as a feigned interest in the subject was a half century in the past. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Like most human events, the decline of philosophy in modern times was overdetermined; like the victim in the murder-mystery paperback who was shot, strangled, stabbed, poisoned, whacked over the head with a lead pipe, and then shoved off a bridge to drown, there were more causes of death than the situation actually required. Part of the problem, certainly, was the explosive expansion of the academic industry in the US and elsewhere in the second half of the twentieth century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In an era when every state teacher’s college aspired to become a university and every state university dreamed of rivaling the Ivy League, a philosophy department was an essential status symbol. The resulting expansion of the field was not necessarily matched by an equivalent increase in genuine philosophers, but it was certainly followed by the transformation of university-employed philosophy professors into a professional caste which, as such castes generally do, defended its status by adopting an impenetrable jargon and ignoring or rebuffing attempts at participation from outside its increasingly airtight circle. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Another factor was the rise of the sort of belligerent scientific materialism exemplified, as noted earlier, by Neil deGrasse Tyson. Scientific inquiry itself is philosophically neutral—it’s possible to practice science from just about any philosophical standpoint you care to name—but the claim at the heart of scientific materialism, the dogmatic insistence that those things that can be investigated using scientific methods and explained by current scientific theory are the only things that can possibly exist, depends on arbitrary metaphysical postulates that were comprehensively disproved by philosophers more than two centuries ago. (We’ll get to those postulates and their problems later on.) Thus the ascendancy of scientific materialism in educated culture pretty much mandated the dismissal of philosophy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were plenty of other factors as well, most of them having no more to do with philosophy as such than the ones just cited. Philosophy itself, though, bears some of the responsibility for its own decline. Starting in the seventeenth century and reaching a crisis point in the nineteenth, western philosophy came to a parting of the ways—one that the philosophical traditions of other cultures reached long before it, with similar consequences—and by and large, philosophers and their audiences alike chose a route that led to its present eclipse. That choice isn’t irreparable, and there’s much to be gained by reversing it, but it’s going to take a fair amount of hard intellectual effort and a willingness to abandon some highly popular shibboleths to work back to the mistake that was made, and undo it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To help make sense of what follows, a concrete metaphor might be useful. If you’re in a place where there are windows nearby, especially if the windows aren’t particularly clean, go look out through a window at the view beyond it. Then, after you’ve done this for a minute or so, change your focus and look <i>at</i> the window rather than <i>through</i> it, so that you see the slight color of the glass and whatever dust or dirt is clinging to it. Repeat the process a few times, until you’re clear on the shift I mean: looking <i>through</i> the window, you see the world; looking <i>at </i>the window, you see the medium through which you see the world—and you might just discover that some of what you thought at first glance was out there in the world was actually on the window glass the whole time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That, in effect, was the great change that shook western philosophy to its foundations beginning in the seventeenth century. Up to that point, most philosophers in the western world started from a set of unexamined presuppositions about what was true, and used the tools of reasoning and evidence to proceed from those presuppositions to a more or less complete account of the world. They were into what philosophers call <i>metaphysics</i>: reasoned inquiry into the basic principles of existence. That’s the focus of every philosophical tradition in its early years, before the confusing results of metaphysical inquiry refocus attention from “What exists?” to “How do we know what exists?” Metaphysics then gives way to <i>epistemology</i>: reasoned inquiry into what human beings are capable of knowing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That refocusing happened in Greek philosophy around the fourth century BCE, in Indian philosophy around the tenth century BCE, and in Chinese philosophy a little earlier than in Greece. In each case, philosophers who had been busy constructing elegant explanations of the world on the basis of some set of unexamined cultural assumptions found themselves face to face with hard questions about the validity of those assumptions. In terms of the metaphor suggested above, they were making all kinds of statements about what they saw through the window, and then suddenly realized that the colors they’d attributed to the world were being contributed in part by the window glass and the dust on it, the vast dark shape that seemed to be moving purposefully across the sky was actually a beetle walking on the outside of the window, and so on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br>
The same refocusing began in the modern world with Rene Descartes, who famously attempted to start his philosophical explorations by doubting everything. That’s a good deal easier said than done, as it happens, and to a modern eye, Descartes’ writings are riddled with unexamined assumptions, but the first attempt had been made and others followed. A trio of epistemologists from the British Isles—John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume—rushed in where Descartes feared to tread, demonstrating that the view from the window had much more to do with the window glass than it did with the world outside. The final step in the process was taken by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, who subjected human sensory and rational knowledge to relentless scrutiny and showed that most of what we think of as “out there,” including such apparently hard realities as space and time, are actually<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>artifacts of the processes by which we perceive things. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Look at an object nearby: a coffee cup, let’s say. You experience the cup as something solid and real, outside yourself: seeing it, you know you can reach for it and pick it up; and to the extent that you notice the processes by which you perceive it, you experience these as wholly passive, a transparent window on an objective external reality. That’s normal, and there are good practical reasons why we usually experience the world that way, but it’s not actually what’s going on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s going on is that a thin stream of visual information is flowing into your mind in the form of brief fragmentary glimpses of color and shape. Your mind then assembles these together into the mental image of the coffee cup, using your memories of that and other coffee cups, and a range of other things as well, as a template onto which the glimpses can be arranged. Arthur Schopenhauer, about whom we’ll be talking a great deal as we proceed, gave the process we’re discussing the useful label of “representation;” when you look at the coffee cup, you’re not passively seeing the cup as it exists, you’re actively representing—literally re-presenting—an image of the cup in your mind.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are certain special situations in which you can watch representation at work. If you’ve ever woken up in an unfamiliar room at night, and had a few seconds pass before the dark unknown shapes around you finally turned into ordinary furniture, you’ve had one of those experiences. Another is provided by the kind of optical illusion that can be seen as two different things. With a little practice, you can flip from one way of seeing the illusion to another, and watch the process of representation as it happens. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes the realization just described so challenging is that it’s fairly easy to prove that the cup as we represent it has very little in common with the cup as it exists “out there.” You can prove this by means of science: the cup “out there,” according to the evidence collected painstakingly by physicists, consists of an intricate matrix of quantum probability fields and ripples in space-time, which our senses systematically misperceive as a solid object with a certain color, surface texture, and so on. You can also prove this, as it happens, by sheer sustained introspection—that’s how Indian philosophers got there in the age of the Upanishads—and you can prove it just as well by a sufficiently rigorous logical analysis of the basis of human knowledge, which is what Kant did. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty here, of course, is that once you’ve figured this out, you’ve basically scuttled any chance at pursuing the kind of metaphysics that’s traditional in the formative period of your philosophical tradition. Kant got this, which is why he titled the most relentless of his analyses <i>Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics</i>; what he meant by this was that anybody who wanted to try to talk about what actually exists had better be prepared to answer some extremely difficult questions first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When philosophical traditions hit their epistemological crises, accordingly, some philosophers accept the hard limits on human knowledge, ditch the metaphysics, and look for something more useful to do—a quest that typically leads to ethics, mysticism, or both. Other philosophers double down on the metaphysics and either try to find some way around the epistemological barrier, or simply ignore it, and this latter option is the one that most Western philosophers after Kant ended up choosing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Where that leads—well, we’ll get to that later on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For the moment, I want to focus a little more closely on the epistemological crisis itself, because there are certain very common ways to misunderstand it. One of them I remember with a certain amount of discomfort, because I made it myself in my first published book, <i>Paths of Wisdom</i>. This is the sort of argument that sees the sensory organs and the nervous system as the reason for the gap between the reality out there—the “thing in itself” (<i>Ding an Sich</i>), as Kant called it—and the representation as we experience it. It’s superficially very convincing: the eye receives light in certain patterns and turns those into a cascade of electrochemical bursts running up the optic nerve, and the visual centers in the brain then fold, spindle, and mutilate the results into the image we see. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty? When we look at light, an eye, an optic nerve, a brain, we’re not seeing things in themselves, we’re seeing another set of representations, constructed just as arbitrarily in our minds as any other representation. Nietzsche had fun with this one: “What? and others even go so far as to say that the external world is the work of our organs? But then our body, as a piece of this external world, would be the work of our organs! But then our organs themselves would be—the work of our organs!” That is to say, the body is also a representation—or, more precisely, the body as we perceive it is a representation. It has another aspect, but we’ll get to that in a future post. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Another common misunderstanding of the epistemological crisis is to think that it’s saying that your conscious mind assembles the world, and can do so in whatever way it wishes. Not so. Look at the coffee cup again. Can you, by any act of consciousness, make that coffee cup suddenly sprout wings and fly chirping around your computer desk? Of course not. (Those who disagree should be prepared to show their work.) The crucial point here is that representation is neither a conscious activity nor an arbitrary one. Much of it seems to be hardwired, and most of the rest is learned very early in life—each of us spent our first few years learning how to do it, and scientists such as Jean Piaget have chronicled in detail the processes by which children gradually learn how to assemble the world into the specific meaningful shape their culture expects them to get.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time you’re an adult, you do that instantly, with no more conscious effort than you’re using right now to extract meaning from the little squiggles on your computer screen we call “letters.” Much of the learning process, in turn, involves finding meaningful correlations between the bits of sensory data and weaving those into your representations—thus you’ve learned that when you get the bits of visual data that normally assemble into a coffee cup, you can reach for it and get the bits of tactile data that normally assemble into the feeling of picking up the cup, followed by certain sensations of movement, followed by certain sensations of taste, temperature, etc. corresponding to drinking the coffee. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s why Kant included the “thing in itself” in his account: there really does seem to be something out there that gives rise to the data we assemble into our representations. It’s just that the window we’re looking through might as well be a funhouse mirror:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>it imposes so much of itself on the data that trickles through it that it’s almost impossible to draw firm conclusions about what’s “out there” from our representations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The most we can do, most of the time, is to see what representations do the best job of allowing us to predict what the next series of fragmentary sensory images will include. That’s what science does, when its practitioners are honest with themselves about its limitations—and it’s possible to do perfectly good science on that basis, by the way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s possible to do quite a lot intellectually on that basis, in fact. From the golden age of ancient Greece straight through to the end of the Renaissance, in fact, a field of scholarship that’s almost completely forgotten today—topics—was an important part of a general education, the kind of thing you studied as a matter of course once you got past grammar school. Topics is the study of those things that can’t be proved logically, but are broadly accepted as more or less true, and so can be used as “places” (in Greek, <i>topoi</i>) on which you can ground a line of argument. The most important of these are the commonplaces (literally, the common places or <i>topoi</i>) that we all use all the time as a basis for our thinking and speaking; in modern terms, we can think of them as “things on which a general consensus exists.” They aren’t truths; they’re useful approximations of truths, things that have been found to work most of the time, things to be set aside only if you have good reason to do so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Science could have been seen as a way to expand the range of useful topoi. That’s what a scientific experiment does, after all: it answers the question, “If I do this, what happens?” As the results of experiments add up, you end up with a consensus—usually an approximate consensus, because it’s all but unheard of for repetitions of any experiment to get exactly the same result every time, but a consensus nonetheless—that’s accepted by the scientific community as a useful approximation of the truth, and can be set aside only if you have good reason to do so. To a significant extent, that’s the way science is actually practiced—well, when it hasn’t been hopelessly corrupted for economic or political gain—but that’s not the social role that science has come to fill in modern industrial society. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve written here several times already about the trap into which institutional science has backed itself in recent decades, with the enthusiastic assistance of the belligerent scientific materialists mentioned earlier in this post. Public figures in the scientific community routinely like to insist that the current consensus among scientists on any topic must be accepted by the lay public without question, even when scientific opinion has swung around like a weathercock in living memory, and even when unpleasantly detailed evidence of the deliberate falsification of scientific data is tolerably easy to find, especially but not only in the medical and pharmaceutical fields. That insistence isn’t wearing well; nor does it help when scientific materialists insist—as they very often do—that something can’t exist or something else can’t happen, simply because current theory doesn’t happen to provide a mechanism for it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Too obsessive a fixation on that claim to authority, and the political and financial baggage that comes with it, could very possibly result in the widespread rejection of science across the industrial world in the decades ahead. That’s not yet set in stone, and it’s still possible that scientists who aren’t too deeply enmeshed in the existing order of things could provide a balancing voice, and help see to it that a less doctrinaire understanding of science gets a voice and a public presence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Doing that, though, would require an attitude we might as well call <i>epistemic modesty</i>: the recognition that the human capacity to know has hard limits, and the unqualified absolute truth about most things is out of our reach. Socrates was called the wisest of the Greeks because he accepted the need for epistemic modesty, and recognized that he didn’t actually know much of anything for certain. That recognition didn’t keep him from being able to get up in the morning and go to work at his day job as a stonecutter, and it needn’t keep the rest of us from doing what we have to do as industrial civilization lurches down the trajectory toward a difficult future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
Taken seriously, though, epistemic modesty requires some serious second thoughts about certain very deeply ingrained presuppositions of the cultures of the West. Some of those second thoughts are fairly easy to reach, but one of the most challenging starts with a seemingly simple question: is there anything we experience that isn’t a representation? In the weeks ahead we’ll track that question all the way to its deeply troubling destination. </div>

I wonder if what we term "knowledge" is really an elaboration of our basic ability for storytelling. We connect events we observe by means of a story and use that story as a guide for the world we inhabit, whether the story involves predicting future events or explaining ancient ruins or justifying the present socioeconomic arrangement. The knowledge lost, then, is simply one version of story and the knowledge which survives will undoubtedly be transformed by the circumstances of the bottleneck into a slightly (or significantly) different version of what it was before. Seeing things this way makes the prospect less bleak somehow.<br><br>Two quick asides. I missed last week's comment cycle as I was off visiting family and took the opportunity to experiment with disconnecting from the 'net, but my experience re some political fora have led to a decision to abstain from further involvement in those fora -- in my case, PoliticalWire. I have had a number of good and worthwhile conversations there, but increasingly I have been labeled and derided as something I am not, largely because I do not conform to the liberal (establishment) consensus. Perhaps I am ceding ground, but a strategic withdrawal seemed appropriate and my energy is better invested in my city council campaign and my efforts to build/transform my community. In any event, I feel much better, which says a lot about the effect that the interactions were having on me.<br><br>Secondly, the campaign continues. I just made arrangements with one of the owners of a local coffeeshop (and family-owned dept store) to have some meet-and-greet events over the next two months before the election in April.

Trying to say what that is though, brings us right back to representation. This might be why mysticism and ethics become the late stage of philosophy. Ethics is fundamentally related to questions concerning will, and the fact that as soon as we start thinking about it we are in a tangle of especially untrained representations makes mysticism (understood here as a wariness toward representation and a lot beside) important.<br><br>Though we don't so much experience will, like we experience representations, so much as we are will... or willed... or willing. But, mysticism rises again, sorting our the different grammatical forms of will sprouts tangles of representations again.<br><br>The limits of representation are one of the best tells in this area. If we deny the limits, we thereby make them much more restrictive and illusive than they need to be. Once the limits have been accepted as being real, and part of our life and yet they are precisely not representations, we can move forward to developing helpful representations on our own nature. Therefore I think that the limits and preconditions of representation are very very closely related to will.<br><br><a href=#c2694244140038879101 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 4:18 PM</a><br><br>

Pragmatism since William James has in many ways been an attempt to get philosophers to turn away from traditional metaphysics to something—anything—more useful. To their critics, pragmatists want to give up on the project of securing a firm foundation for philosophy; to pragmatists, that's like saying we have to make sure the stack of turtles the Earth is resting on aren't going to topple over and take us with them.<br><br>By the way, I feel I should clarify something I said last week, when I said pragmatists and Kant share a suspicion of representationalist accounts of truth and knowledge. In that context, "representation" isn't quite the same as in what you're talking about. Pragmatists would generally agree—there are exceptions—with the representationalist account of experience that you've outlined here. That's a part of <i>why</i> we reject the representationalist account of truth and knowledge: those accounts both essentially suggest that some representations are more faithful to the thing-in-itself than others, and we don't think that makes any sense.<br><br>That said, I'd point out that the "thing-in-itself" idea does have one problem: it's a Wittgenstein's beetle.* Its nature is utterly irrelevant to anything we can actually know about the object. That makes me suspicious of just how useful a concept it is. It seems that its main purpose is to reiterate that the world is an independent causal factor. As Donald Davidson put it, "Causation, unlike explanation, is not under a description,"** and I wonder if that isn't sufficient to describe the situation.<br><br>* For those not familiar with this term, it comes from a thought experiment by Ludwig Wittgenstein: imagine everyone has a small box with a "beetle" inside, but nobody can look in anybody else's box or interact with anyone else's beetle in any way. Then, the word "beetle" does not refer to anything in particular. Wittgenstein suggests that someone's box can even be empty.<br><br>** Davidson thought it was fine for two accounts of the same phenomenon (such as folk psychology and neuroscience as explanations of a person's behavior) to use radically different terminology, assumptions, and methodology as long as they agreed on their causal predictions.<br><br><a href=#c7531475494858204802 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 4:25 PM</a><br><br>

If there is no real perceived outside of representation the human mind suffers very greatly indeed.

There is something poetic that the limits of what modest humans can ultimately know is what's going to shut the lid on the Religion of Progress. What I've always found funny about the current "Theory of everything" is that there are 14 people in the world who are credentialed to understand it. <br><br>So this morning, in a genetics class I'm taking, we talked about genetic engineering. And the professor talked about how at this point we could probably genetically engineer people with higher IQs. Somehow, I don't think that's going to help us overcome the limits of what humans can ultimately know just because we have smarter people. There is still going to be gunk on that window. It also creeps me out that there's a room filled with genetically engineered bunnies, meant for Australia, just down the hallway from me right now. These bunnies are meant to chlorinate the rabbits gene pool with nasty stuff to help control the bunny infestation on the down under continent. Like if human genetic engineering ever became a thing it could be used as a nasty, nasty, weapon. I'd add a subset to the limits of what humans can know, and that is what humans should be able to mess with. It seems like ethics must step in before the limit of knowing is reached. I hope the long decline is long enough to learn to brew good beer. Cheers :)<br><br><a href=#c4118999041052508163 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 4:33 PM</a><br><br>

As well, Scientific tools such as the fMRI can now detect if the responsible brain centers are active or inactive.<br><br>Turns out that two distinct brain areas have been mapped which correlate to the ego or lack thereof. These are called the Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Tasking Mode Network (TMN). For most everyone, the DMN is primarily active and is responsible for our sense of self and all those nagging thoughts about the past and future that fill our days. The TMN network activates when we move into problem solving mode with a significant reduction of DMN activity and the related brain chatter.<br><br>There are individuals that experience a significantly different world everyday because their DMN is all but permanently shut down. This is the state often labeled non-dual in the eastern mystical traditions such as Hinduism, Taoism, Buddhism and Zen.<br><br>One of the best living examples is a thoroughly Western man by the name of Gary Weber.

The "scientific" position on many unproven things seems to be "No" when it should be "Unknown." There seems to be an obsession with turning out a facile Yes or No conclusion when none such is warranted. The basic attitude of science should be skepticism, but the true sceptic will answer "I just don't know" when confronted with many questions instead of "Yes has not been proven, so the answer is a hard No." <br><br>Take for example, alien visitations. I highly doubt aliens have visited the earth, but I'm willing to say the issue hasn't been proven one way or another. Many people who style themselves as rational and objective, however, will say the answer is definitely no, which is actually the opposite of rational and objective.<br><br>Maybe this is due to the function of science in our society. They unconsciously feel that saying "I don't know" would diminish their authority. My wife, who is a doctor, is the same way. Ever since she became a doctor, I've noticed that she assumes knowledge that I know she does not have, about subjects both medical and not. I think that in her job it's her job to know things and provide answers, so she just gets used to this attitude. And so she falls into the trap of thinking she knows things she most definitely does not.<br><br><a href=#c3617698746159233768 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 5:00 PM</a><br><br>

He devoted his life to pointing out the difference between the nature of a thing (physis) and its representation, or custom (nomos). He was no doubt incredibly annoying to everyone who knew him as he pointed out the stupidity of most of societal 'norms'. I find his conclusions, and the conclusions of Stoic philosophy, which he inspired, to be oddly comforting - if we question everything, both society and value we place on things turn out to be an illusion. So why worry about anything? Reject society, live how you want and be happy.<br><br>Marcus Aurelius, also in the Stoic philosophy stable, had this to say about the slippery nature of 'truth':<br><br>Make for yourself a definition or description of the thing which is presented to you, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and tell yourself its proper name, and the names of the things of which it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved. For nothing is so productive of elevation of mind as to be able to examine methodically and truly every object that is presented to you in life, and always to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of universe this is, and what kind of use everything performs in it, and what value everything has with reference to the whole.<br><br>Marcus Aurelius Meditations iii.11<br><br><a href=#c7922144900134121960 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 5:22 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you, sincerely. I so appreciate what you do for me and the rest of your readers every week.<br><br>I don't usually comment but this week's essay really struck a chord. As a background, my first attempt at a degree was at a small liberal arts college in Minnesota where I studied...you guessed it, philosophy. I also say "attempt at a degree" because I failed my comprehensive exercise, "comps", spring of my senior year (which wasn't surprising) and then quit going to class. As such, I appreciate your nutshell coverage of western philosophy and am going to forward this essay on to a few close friends who don't quite understand what I talk about sometimes.<br><br>One of the main reasons I failed my comps was that I chose (foolishly, I should have been a Religion major like my then-future ex-wife) to take up the subject of Nonduality as the focus of my paper. For the sake of argument, I'm taking Nonduality to mean "a state of being absent subject and object". Funny thing though; language and its inbred cousin conscious thought are almost necessarily dual so you're pretty well up the proverbial creek if you try to communicate pure perception into anything other than allegory or metaphor or huge philosophical treatises more useful for doorstops or kindling than anything else.<br><br>I chose Nonduality as a topic because at some point during my junior year I found Zen Buddhism. I'd already been practicing Aikido and was becoming familiar with the spiritual tenets surrounding that martial art, so when I started learning about Zen and Buddhism as a whole, I was blown away. I may or may not have also been experimenting with cannabis, LSD and psilocybin in an attempt to "open my mind" and maybe find the answers to the philosophical questions I had. I'd like to think I found some. In any case, I attempted to present Nonduality to the philosophy folks and it went over like the Hindenburg. I stuck with the Zen and the Aikido, and maybe or maybe not some of the rest and went on to spend time as a live-in in a Zen center. <br> <br>So to answer your last question, "is there anything we experience that isn't a representation?", my answer is "maybe, but I can't tell you about it even if I've had it".<br><br>Or I can show you a flower or hit you with a stick.<br><br>- Bob Heyn<br><br><br><a href=#c5844495972367764209 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 6:15 PM</a><br><br>

Know your way around Indian and Chinese philosophy and the Classical and Western traditions take on a whole new shape. <br><br>Five8Charlie, for practical purposes, that's what we do all the time, and there's good reason to do so. Tolerably often, though, things happen for which our representations haven't prepared us, and that's when it's useful to be able to remember that they're just representations, not realities. More on this as we proceed! <br><br>Default Options, good. You're getting warm. <br><br>Daddy H., oh my. I have a couple of Knappertsbusch recordings, and they're among my favorite interpretations of Wagner. <br><br>Daniel, and yet historically it was precisely the dependence of classical Stoicism on untestable metaphysical assumptions that led to its eclipse. Neoplatonism, which became the last school standing in the long history of classical philosophy, offered something other than assumptions -- especially in its later forms, once Iamblichus and Proclus got to work on it, it offered the prospect of verification through religious and mystical experience. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Repent, so noted. That's not the direction I'll be exploring, though. <br><br>David, good! We'll be talking more about knowledge as a mode of storytelling as this proceeds. <br><br>Nick, we are now, and have always been, able to slip out of the bonds Plato mentioned and find our way up out of the cave into the sunlight. See you there! <br><br>Gepetto, of course they've got to shout down cyclical theories of history. Listen to those, and the Great God Progress topples from his throne once and for all. <br><br>Ray, shhh! We'll get to that. ;-)<br><br>James, and yet Schopenhauer makes a very strong case that we have access, in a certain sense, to the thing-in-itself: something that isn't a representation. So the box with the beetle in it arguably has a lid that can be opened. More on this as we proceed. I would agree with Davidson, by the way -- causation is storytelling, and different stories can point to the same moral. <br><br>Violet, understood -- but a good case can be made that we can actually perceive something that isn't a representation.

SF writer Gordon Dickson pointed up the absurdity of trying to use genetic engineering to advance human intelligence a long time ago. Let's imagine, they said, that a group of gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans got together a few million years ago and decided to create a super-primate. Would they have gone for genetic modifications that would make them more fitted to (and thus more dependent on) their existing environment? Or would they have grasped the possibilities open to a primate that was much <i>less</i> well suited to any one environment, in order to have the capacity to expand into almost any environment? All our ideas about intelligence focus on the first option; like the apes in Dickson's metaphor, we're unable even to consider what would be involved in giving up specialized capacities in order to universalize potential. <br><br>Ruben, excellent. Yes, that's one solid way to get to the same realization! <br><br>NomadsSoul, I confess that the thought of a human being who's made himself incapable of self-examination and emotion strikes me as almost uniquely horrible. <br><br>Tower 440, I can do better than that. I used to build paper models, many years ago, and I have a model of a German castle with a single large tower on one side sitting on top of one of my bookcases. Tower Prime now exists. As for entering from the west at symbolic sunset, that's very good indeed: <br><br>"Guard of the Tower, what is the time?"<br><br>"Chief Ruinman, it is the hour of sunset, when the shadows of the past stretch long and dark across a landscape of ruins." <br><br>Zachary, yep. I've watched this over and over again -- and unfortunately physicians seem to be trained to fall into that trap. (A common joke in the alternative health care scene: "What's the difference between God and a doctor?" "God doesn't think He's a doctor.") <br><br>Mouse, experimental scientists have been dealing with variable results as long as there have been scientific experiments. The increase in the ability to detect subtle variation has proceeded step by step with an increase in the ability to control confounding variables -- so the amount of wobble in experimental results seems to be pretty much the same all through the history of science. <br><br>Jo, the old Skeptics, Cynics, and Stoics are certainly worthwhile role models for this kind of project, no question. <br><br>Ian, yep. I do that all the time with the blades of ceiling fans. It really can be unnerving. <br><br>Graeme, good. I also appreciate the psychologists, and there were quite a few of them, who spent many decades insisting that mental imagery doesn't exist because it can't be measured. <br><br>Degringolade, I'll consider it, but Husserl to my mind is second only to Heidegger in the fine art of making trivial statements in terms so obscure it's easy for the incautious to mistake them for profundities. <br><br>Inohuri, funny.

He bought into science's claim to authority hook, line, and sinker, including the delusion that whatever cannot be explained by science cannot be real, or is at least a misinterpretation of reality. Not only did his status increase in lockstep with science's "authority," but he could timidly hide his insecurities and doubts within that cloak of infallibility. Drunk on the power of almighty science, he did not have to face his demons, but hypnotized himself into not seeing them any longer. Eventually, the requirements of writing grants, submitting reports, justifying expenses, and defending positions took the place of the demons he had never faced and left him distrusting the anchor he had tethered himself to. Unmoored, he drifted.<br><br>Rather than attracting bold, risk-taking independent thinkers, my experience is that what passes for science and medicine nowadays appeals more to conformists seeking easy answers, status, and protection from the inherent challenge of living in a complex, ever-changing world. A clockwork universe obeying scientific laws of human authorship promised to explain away superstition, dispel demons, and banish ignorance. Instead it unknowingly wove them into its very essence. Some of the most superstitious fools I know, with too many demons to hide, happen to be scientists and doctors.<br><br>That is in no way a criticism of the scientific method, one of the most useful codifications of one of the most useful habits of the human mind to make sense out of incoming data. However, science can only lay claim to the codification, not the habit. Observing a baby transition from wailing grief every time an object is hidden from view to determined searching once enough experiences have convinced her of the validity of object permanence should be a humbling experience for any seasoned practitioner of the scientific method.

I can see now, too, why I feel so totally inept at "philosophy" despite being brought up by a father who talked to me for hours on end about Zen and other eastern philosophies and my attempts with modest success to explain some of this to my mostly LDS classmates at school, where the thoughtful among them could start to accept my Buddhism as not some sort of Devil worship.<br><br>When I moved to Japan, the real reason was I wanted to look at the world through a completely different window (and your essay today helped me finally to verbalize this). To the average person that tries this, the first year is fascinating, like a kaleidoscope! The second year, you find it all increasingly offensive as you have more clashes with people who unreasonably cannot accept the way you see their world. (Gracious!) If you persist obstinately beyond this point, you slowly start to see things from their perspective. It took me a good decade, a good husband and the good luck to get trained in Shinto to really start appreciating Japan. Particularly difficult for me was that the ways I represented things to myself in English would not translate into Japanese without a complete academic thesis. Things I loved, they could not see why! Foreigners keep their sanity here by meeting regularly with other foreigners, listening intently to the newcomers' rhapsodizing, and placing bets on how many months before it turns into a wonderfully endearing heartfelt bashing. It's easy to stay in that sort of "womb." Over the 32 years I've been here, I've developed a second side to my persona, one that gets along nicely in Japan, has plenty of verbal and experiential tools for getting along and doesn't need the people here to see the view out my other window.<br><br>If I'd been less insecure, I may have made my adjustment to this different reality much sooner. Having done it once, though, makes it easier for me to accomplish it elsewhere, expecting and recognizing ostranenie, apologizing for my inevitable mistakes and realizing that a good thumping to the ego is normal.<br><br>But what I grasped today (and wonder if that is one thing you are leading with this) is that two completely different cultures have evolved in America, with entirely different views out their respective windows. Trying to get them to see eye-to-eye may prove to be impossible. But if we do not try, where is this going to lead?<br><br>Off-topic, but the February meeting of the Kanto Green Wizards went very well without me, I hear. Lots of new people, including a couple from Melbourne, where our other foreign priestess hails from, and they had a lot of fun.

I am probably missing something but the example that you use seem fallacious. I have seen it in very similar forms in many places (last I think it was a book by Richard Dawkins) but it never convinced me.<br>One criticism I have is that it seems a false dilemma. Yes, our representations of the external world can be mistaken, but the simple fact that we agree most of the time (due to common evolutionary pressures at the very least) suggests that representations are a very useful first approximations of the world. One of the great successes of 20th century science was to find where are the limits of this approximation.<br>A better metaphor is fuzzy logic. A chair is not perfectly defined (is a stump a chair?) but that does not make the label any less useful.<br><br>Another other criticism of your example is that I see no problem using multiple models of the world. A teacup is a "intricate matrix of quantum probability fields and ripples in space-time" but that model is much less useful than our day-to-day representation of the teacup. If we are talking about a proton, the quantum model works better obviously. More generally this fallacy could be described as "mixing of the levels". A human body works on many levels: quantum superposition, chemistry, mezoscale physics, mechanics, etc. I don't see a problem with multiple partial representations. <br><br>Please don't interpret these as personal criticisms. Like I said before, I tend to oversimplify things. Philosophy is a stumbling block for me because in my mind ideas can be approached from different directions. As long as the logical conclusions are compatible, what is the problem?<br><br><a href=#c6571267620216726906 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 7:06 PM</a><br><br>

The classic formulation of knowledge is justified true belief.* Something being true, and believing that it's true, strikes me as being possible under determinism. But the justification? Not so sure.<br><br>To put it crudely, believing something because the atoms in our brain swerve one way rather than the other seems hardly to be a justification, even if the belief is true and strongly felt. But now consider natural selection, which would presumably favor thought processes that promote survival. For example, fleeing from unfamiliar shadows on the assumption that they represent lurking predators may only be true some of the time, but is nevertheless a behavior that best guarantees surviving long enough to reproduce.<br><br>But brain processes that promote survival are not necessarily the same as brain processes that allowed Kant to write "The Critique of Pure Reason." So how did we evolve from jumping at shadows to learning not to jump to conclusions? If physical determinism is true, it seems that at best our thoughts will have survival value, but any underlying truth can't be known...only believed. In that sense, a materialistic worldview seems to be self refuting when it comes to knowledge. <br><br>*Gettier's Paradox casts doubt on whether we can really answer what would constitute a valid justification of a belief. If memory serves, Gettier's example goes something like this: For years, whenever Joe saw a purple van in his Boss's assigned space, his Boss was in the office. And sure enough, on a fine Monday morning, he sees the purple van in the assigned space and sure enough, the boss is in. Except, that this time the purple van is not the boss's. The van belongs to the boss's old college chum who's dropped by for a visit. The boss allowed him to use his space, since his own van is in the shop being serviced. That his pal has a purple van of the same make is a coincidence. So, was Joe's belief justified, or was it just a lucky guess? And what does it say about the beliefs we may hold? If we invoke probability and say that a belief is justified if there's a 99% chance that it's true, how do we know that it's 99%.<br><br><a href=#c3052078891071245846 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 8:01 PM</a><br><br>

In reading it, I get the concept of an "epistemological barrier" in trying to understand our universe though I wonder about where the limits of having epistemic modesty could lay. After all, part of being human is to question things that we aren't even built to understand even though a lot of the barriers that we have are actually cultural rather than biological.<br><br> The concept of Topics sounds familiar and I take it that things like justice, loyalty, trust, truth and the like could fall into this category. I guess the study of them waned when it became more important to get an Economics or Management degree than an Arts degree the past few decades. Trying to prove them can be the devil itself but as Antoine de Saint-Exupery once wrote "what is essential is invisible to the eye" which is something that I have never forgotten.<br><br> I did wonder about one reason that all this philosophical territory may not so thoroughly explored and it is this. Here you are actually playing with the concept of reality itself, as you were in this week's essay, and that can be an very uncomfortable place to be in. Sound unlikely? Robert Pirsig, who wrote "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values" was driven insane by his philosophical investigations which all began when he realized that in spite of all his education, that he could not come up with a definition of quality (Try it. Better? Better than what? And by whose standard?).<br><br><a href=#c7986062988774364819 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 8:23 PM</a><br><br>

Of course not. (Those who disagree should be prepared to show their work.)"<br><br>Yes, but as a consequence of my method there is no way to create a representation of my work.<br><br><br>Just before reading today's post I watched a movie I hadn't seen before by the man I figure to be the greatest living artist. Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo. Knowing that Greer isn't a movie lover, I won't insist on watching it too strongly, but I think there is a charming detail worth mentioning in the context of epistemic modesty. Like many of Miyazaki's movies which are directed to children, Ponyo follows a child, Sōsuke, living in a more or less modern world, who (as children are apt to do) encounters a realm of fantastic miracles, after meeting a magical gold fish who he names Ponyo. The story is clearly inspired by The Little Mermaid in some of the basic themes, but only in a very loose sense. What is relevant to epistemic modesty is the way that the adults in the world react. For a five year old child a talking fish that turns into a little girl and controls powerful magical forces is just another interesting surprise, but in American stories it is generally taken for granted that the adults will resist something so strange happening. Not adults from a Miyazaki world! A fish that turns into a magical child is just another inexplicable charm, and by the way would she like a sandwich? This interest me greatly in all his works, that adults in his stories treat the fantastic parts of a child's life as common matter of fact things, and basically carry about there day. This is, in the light of the topics here discussed, a great lionizing of epistemological modesty... besides can you prove that my coffee couldn't have flown away, or that a goldfish born of a wizard and a sea goddess couldn't fall in love with a little boy? How would such an experiment even be preformed!<br><br>Importantly, the modesty to accept the flabbergasting need not become an excuse to reject the inconvenient. Continuing to treat what we think we know, what has habitually, traditionally, or hereditarally worked as good enough until we have cause to doubt it is essential. Doubting every settled thing because a miracle might falsify it cheapens miracles. Besides there is a great depth of what has worked before (feel the will implied... worked) is needed to represent at all. Another poster already mentioned the massive filtering of data that ever makes it to the conscious mind; that filtering is deeply connected to representation, it is a massive rejection and pruning of data. Modesty is the willingness to let go of a filter if something happens, something wondrous, that suggests, hints, there may be data worth considering behind that representative filter. <br><br>A camera can represent the image by excluding all light from the film that is not on a perspective path way between the film surface and the represented surface... but many a find sensor has been developed by investigating a disturbance in another instruments readings.<br><br>On the other hand if we go sampling data pell-mell that we have receive guidance to ignore we are very unlikely to get anywhere particularly useful; the chinks in the representation are loose enough and numerous enough that there is room for anomalies, omens that is. If you follow omens that cannot be explained, but which shine with a significance there is a vastly better than random chance that an insight will be encountered.<br><br><a href=#c6329132112817712840 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 8:33 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you, JMG, for the courageous attempt to rejuvenate the essential timeless quest for truth.<br><br>I have had difficulty with two propositions appearing recently in this blog, however. 1) I understood you to say a couple of weeks ago that evolution is <i>nothing but</i> adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Essays by Stephen Jay Gould and others have led me to believe there's a lot more to evolution than that, much of it counterintuitive and deliciously mysterious. 2) I think you are asserting in this blog that awareness of "reality" can <i>only</i> be in terms of abstract representations that are created in our minds out of sensory inputs. The writings of Henri Bergson (<i>Creative Evolution</i>), C.G. Jung, and others have suggested to me that human perceptual and cognitive systems, as finely tuned products of billions of years of evolution, are in some ways intimately and directly involved in the "outside" world. <br><br>This brings to mind Alfred Korzybski's discipline of General Semantics, of which I have been a longtime student (and which I am glad to see reflected in your posts from time to time). Korzybski's book <i>Science and Sanity</i> prescribes greater awareness of different <i>levels</i> of mental representations, or abstractions as they shape our personal takes on reality. Highly abstract concepts can lead to a kind of language-induced insanity if they are not traceable to direct, verifiable experience when confusion or stress arise. <br><br>Plato wrestled with the same question of our essential connection with reality in his cave myth, which portrayed humans as prisoners in a cave that projects only shadowy reflections that they take for reality. If Korsybski had used a cave metaphor instead of the abstraction-ladder metaphor, he might have characterized the human condition in a more hopeful way, however. His correctives might have been tools for breaking our self- and culturally-imposed chains and begin taking steps toward the cave entrance--through which we catch occasional glimpses or intimations of the bright light of truth We never break out into the open of course, but we learn with each step that being happily "in touch with reality" is a lifelong process, a matter of degree that we have at least some control over.<br><br><a href=#c3716883237895150214 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 8:52 PM</a><br><br>

Epistemic modesty:<br>At some point in my graduate education I was required to attend a seminar on effective participation in academic exchanges. (Sigh; another 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back...) One of the presenter's points was that women tend to use more tentative language in presenting their ideas than men do, couching them with "I think" or "It seems to me", which is apparently bad since then their ideas are taken less seriously than if they had positioned their claims more aggressively as bold statements of fact. It occurred to me at the time that the former was in fact a more precise and scientific way of presenting ideas, acknowledging the embedded perspective. However, I kept my ideas to myself, wanting only to escape the room as quickly as possible. Or maybe that was just me being overly tentative. <br><br>I think the world today has far too many people making aggressive claims without considering the limits of what they actually know or can know. And the idea of different causal stories about a single effect simultaneously being true seems important too, with many people shouting different narratives at each other about how we got to where we are, and assuming differing narratives mean at least one party is wrong or lying. I'd love to see such philosophy in popular public discourse again, especially if it crowded out some of the other, er, content. I assume the Lakeland Republic's newspapers and radio programs have regular philosophy segments? Maybe lectures at the library, followed by refreshments and discussions?<br>--Heather in CA<br><br><a href=#c1389726399163123208 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 9:11 PM</a><br><br>

Change to learn something new, good!<br><br>On the sidenote: I met this couple from London, which is moving into Finland. The guy has same kind of background as myself: working class past, then studying into expert position. He has never read ADR, so your views are not distorting his lens of perception. He told me about build-up towards Brexit. According to him, it happened approximately like you described it here.<br><br>Influx of immigrants has eaten away almost all benefits from normal blue collar jobs. No more overtime pay, less bank holidays, less anything that helps you to rise your family with one or even two salaries. At the same time, wellfare class has become antagonistic towards working class. In London area, where everything costs too much, it's easier to meet your basic needs if you are "dependant", but then you have to live in pretty lawless areas. <br><br>Migrants also work long days, up tyo sixteen hours per day. They do that maybe four years, then go back to their homeland with all the savings and live oof it like royalty. English workers are forced to do the same, but of course they cannot save their money and live later carefree life. For them, it's long days year after year, and they get to see their families only during weekends.<br><br>There was much more, but you get the point. I talked with a person from blue collar background, and he proved with his words your presumption. UK working class was well aware about THEIR INTERESTS. They voted largely because they wanted no more to be violated. Mainstream media portrayed it as somekind "victory of nazism and xenophobia", but it was just groups of people fighting for their interests. That is largely what is behind rise of right-wing populism, and all these left-leaning liberals should remember that when shouting empty hate words like "racist! fascist!ignorant xenophobes!" into the face of other people, with other views.<br><br><a href=#c8197475896332514743 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 11:28 PM</a><br><br>

Of course our representations are a good working model of the world; our ancestors have had a couple of billion years to work out how to come up with models that improve their chances of survival, after all. Notice, though, that this implies that those models are useful...not true. For example, we screen out vastly more information than we process, because it wasn't the kind of thing that helped social primates survive on the African savannas. Watch a cat staring at something that you can't see, and it's hard to avoid the conclusion that there are whole realms of reality we never get around to noticing, because doing so didn't improve our ancestors' chances of survival. <br><br>As for multiple models, of course! We'll get further into the nature of those models, though, because they're much less independent than we seem.

Yes -- if the theory of evolution through natural selection is correct, as I believe it is, then the human mind evolved for the purpose of finding food and mates and dodging predators, not for the purpose of understanding the truth about the universe, and it's therefore <i>prima facie</i> more likely when we examine the universe that we're projecting mental habits suited to finding food and mates and dodging predators onto the inkblot patters of the cosmos, rather than actually finding out the truth about it. This is one of the many ways that scientific materialism is self-refuting. <br><br>Roboslob, <a href=https://collections.lacma.org/node/239578 rel=nofollow>this painting</a> comes to mind!<br><br>Kevin, topics can be considerably more subtle than that. Consider the following statement: "government derives its powers from the consent of the governed." That's not a statement capable of logical or scientific proof, but in a democratic (or would-be democratic) society, it's a topos, a statement of a consensus that's generally accepted and so can be used to ground discussion of political issues. With regard to Robert Pirsig, oh, granted -- you could have taken Nietzsche as another solid example. I'll be talking about that further on; for that matter, I've discussed it before, under the label "the barbarism of reflection." More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Chrisroy, the warm feeling -- and emotions generally -- are surprisingly complex. We'll get into that as we proceed. Step by step! <br><br>Bill, yep, and they were probably right. <br><br>Ray, good. One of the things to keep in mind is that part of the process of representation seems to be hardwired, but other parts are culturally specific and are picked up, like language, in the course of infancy and childhood. Our current habits of representation here in the US are very tense and brittle, and focus to a remarkable degree on rejecting the marvelous; I gather that in Japan, that's much less the case. <br><br>Nick, you're welcome and thank you! I'm glad to hear that the internet has helped philosophy geeks find each other and regroup. As for cyclical history, you'll hear no argument from me -- we've got another round of accurate predictions making themselves felt in every day's headlines, so now's the time to make the point again. <br><br>Mouse, since both are consequences of increasing technological complexity, yes, I'd say so. <br><br>JLouis, adaptation to changing conditions can take strange forms. There's no reason to assume that only the minimal, apparently rational adaptation will be the one that comes out of the intricate interplay of genetic variability and natural selection! The point I want to make is that it's a massive mistake to confuse evolution with progress, to assume that evolution is headed toward some goal, or to try to use evolutionary schemes to prop up fantasies of impending human godhood or the like. <br><br>With regard to representations, I think you may be missing my point, because it's not just a matter of abstractions. Your concrete sensory experience of a coffee cup is constructed by your mind out of the thin stream of fragmentary data you get from your senses, using a variety of inherited patterns and acquired memories as templates. Abstraction comes later in the process of cognition, after you've already formed your representations -- and I agree that Korzybski's work is extremely useful for reining in some of the common problems with abstractions.<br><br><a href=#c5223601740484520149 title="comment permalink">2/9/17, 12:00 AM</a><br><br>

Exactly; one of the major driving forces behind the blind rage and incomprehension we see across the political landscape today is the inability of most people on all sides to notice, in terms of my metaphor, that much of what they're yelling about is mud splattered in their own windows. I recall what Oliver Cromwell said when he was confronted with yet another bunch of religious fanatics convinced that they and they alone understood God's will: "I beseech you, gentlemen, by the bowels of Christ, consider that you may be wrong." Epistemic modesty can be one of the few alternatives to internecine hatred. As for the Lakeland Republic, it takes a bit for a philosophical culture to get rolling, but it's entirely possible that a first handful of philosophy clubs are springing up in Lakeland cities, meeting in library meeting rooms to talk about the subject. <br><br>Mgalimba, well, I haven't had the experience in question, but remember that your sensory experiences are also representations, assembled by your mind out of the fragmentary input of your senses.

I include the stuff that cannot be seen too. Are you suggesting that it should be a concern?<br><br>Since you are discussing representations of reality and the philosophical underpinnings for that point of view, just imagine for a brief moment (!) that you are discussing this concept with Conan the Barbarian who is having trouble understanding how a representation is any different to a story (or other accumulated human experience) of something that is "out there". Conan is confused and argues with you that if he were to strangle you - in a friendly way of course and that that action would definitely not be a representation despite your protestations to the contrary. What would you say to avoid that unpleasant representation?<br><br>And where do stories fit into the larger picture? I often see a logical failing in many of the comments here over the years where people demand specifics or cherry pick data thus avoiding the larger story which looks at the whole and is by its very nature a bit hazy on the specific details. I hear and understand the stories, but I'm not totally convinced that many people do, or the stories that those people do know are no longer functional given changed circumstances, where perhaps they were quite functional in the past.

They don't represent anything though they can be associated with certain form of sensory data. Joy, sadness, pleasure, pain are, full stop. They come in different modes for sure, but they are. <br><br>Concerning story telling that are useful but not true, it seems to me that science also is like that: it isn't necessarily true (it does not mean that it is false either!) but it is damn useful!

What I personally find interesting, is also exploring the gap between how steady-state societies, such as native Australians or some native American tribal societies, view the world surrounding them along with the narratives and memes they derive from this versus how civilization building, growth-oriented societies view the world. Which parts of philosophical traditions are grounded in a particular type of culture, which parts are recurring patterns of thought through-out human forms of society? I often wonder whether the difficulties and inability of modern western societies in steering away from a destructive impact on our natural environment are partly grounded herein. I also notice, that even if we develop an appetite to stray away from western narratives, we still seem to have a strong affinity for the philosophies of other civilization-building cultures such as those of the Indian subcontinent or ancient Greco-Roman cultures. For one, it is rather difficult to get a picture of non-civilized world-views since they seem mostly oral traditions, for the other secondary sources are scarce, maybe we believe they are unsophisticated, not worth our attention? I really would love to hear from members of such traditions what there philosophical traditions are and how they impact their societies. (PS. I use civilized/civilization in a more basic meaning: societies creating nation states and cities. Not as a judgment of value, etc.)<br><br><a href=#c1038262778352039172 title="comment permalink">2/9/17, 4:42 AM</a><br><br>

I am starting to think that one of the most important limits on representation is economic. I don't know the exact thermodynamics of information theory or anything like that, but I know that a sophisticated figuration can only exist by way of an immense amount of calibration and tweaking. <br><br>Sometimes I help my Dad with loading bullets, and trying to adjust the load for optimal accuracy. This is very enjoyable, because though I am not an excellent shot, when firing bullets which are more precisely calibrated, you can more quickly calibrate your own aim. A poorly loaded bullet might have about 1 arc of uncertainty on each shot, so you cannot determine what of your own actions are affecting the shot beyond the resolution, unless your mind can gather together the data set of a vast number of shots. If your bullets (and gun, scope, weather, etc) are all carefully calibrated a fraction of a bullet diameter at 100 yards can be felt as relating to ones own muscle tension, breath, or even level of tiredness in the eye. Factors which would be lost to the noise if the bullets themselves aren't predictable enough.<br><br>This is a experience I contemplate when considering the foundations of representation. For accuracy in representation, which we have strong reason to believe humans are capable of to a high degree in sufficiently contingent topics; five bullets one hole is persuasive in that light. But it requires a way to remove noise from getting into the representation. Every method of removing a particular source of noise from fiddling up a representation for a particular purpose is overwhelmingly loud in the context of countless other representations. The idea that life is overwhelmingly bright with evidence and that representation itself is away of, at its simplest, filtering out amongst that evidence evidence which is actionable, or at least interesting, and also (going deeper) of amplifying details of particular import, (in intensity, like an active radio does to the faint energy of radio signals, or in duration like various kinds of memory). <br><br>In this post I have been offering representations of representation, like the targets from the firing range where there are holes in the paper, and notes of which power load produced which grouping. There is an economy of representation, and when you have to load each bullet by hand, and need several shots just to narrow down noise from the scope to the barrel, or the bullet, before even getting to the details of the unique properties being tested that economics comes to mind.<br><br>This economic consideration is a major factor I think in the success of Eastern Mindfulness. Cool the self representing system down to decrease noise in the system, conserve that energy, and let it manifest in habits of presence and mindfulness. It is a very promising move. Similar of course to Western Meditation where the thoughts that aren't part of a particular purpose are quieted.<br><br>Some materialists mistake the limits of consciousness as being specifically the limits of what resolution can be attained by zooming in (oi, reductionisms) the limits are more profound than a fuzzy microscope image. The limits are also the challenge of comparing data to be able to reach conclusions about general things. Also the limits correspond to the intentions and the resources of the subject in ways that are hard to represent in a picture with any significant resolution.<br><br><a href=#c2847035890008999098 title="comment permalink">2/9/17, 7:31 AM</a><br><br>

My wife is currently studying for her masters degree in psychology and one of the subjects is the history of psychology, which starts with the Greek philosophers and moves forward. One of the earliest concepts she studied was around the nature of perception and how it is the brain/mind that provides its interpretation of the data that the senses provide - representation as you describe. The example that she provided was that we don't perceive colour, colour is a purely arbitrary concept applied by the mind as it creates its representation of the world. Hence when people have a disagreement over whether something is blue or green, both are simultaneously 100% truthful and 100% wrong. This was most classically demonstrated by "that dress" meme that was so huge on the internet a while back. Once you know how, then you can see it both as black/blue and white/gold by a effort of will and choosing which colour to look at first. Another example is hallucination. The eyes are sending the same signals back that they've always done, but the brains interpretation of those signals has changed.<br><br>Something that isn't representation? Are we back to where you started with Descartes and "I think therefore I am"? We can doubt everything that we perceive, but we cannot doubt that the perceiver exists. Well with the exception of those who wonder if we are all simulations in some cosmic computer. Or perhaps, Epictetus, and the fact that we only control/are responsible for our actions and our feelings?<br><br>RE: Scientists. I've always believed that true scientists should be open to possibilities. A great deal of scientific thought is classified as "Theories" for a reason. Too little is provable. Things once believed to be true are over-turned on a regular basis. Unfortunately it seems that my ideal of a scientist is as rare a beast as your ideal philosopher.<br><br><a href=#c9221165900261059825 title="comment permalink">2/9/17, 8:25 AM</a><br><br>

Other philosophers double down on the metaphysics and either try to find some way around the epistemological barrier, or simply ignore it, and this latter option is the one that most Western philosophers after Kant ended up choosing.”<br><br>This reminds me of a conversation I had with my mother the other day. I was calling her and checking up on her life, and she, rather out of nowhere asked me what metaphysics meant. I began going through the basic underpinnings of metaphysics in philosophy, gave her some brief overview of various ideas on metaphysics from Aristotle, Kant, Hume, and so on… and my explanation just confused her a bit more. When I asked for the context, and why she wanted to know, she said that in her book club, when she was talking about some hip pain she was suffering, one of the members told her that she should “try metaphysics,” by which that person obviously did not mean “do some deep thinking about the nature of reality.” She had later started going to a church she liked and was fitting in at that was branding itself as a “metaphysical church” (ever since my father’s death, she has started to venture out of her fairly sheltered Christian fundamentalist background into other avenues of thought outside her purview (including picking up some occult writing and your own Learning Ritual Magic and Paths of Wisdom), so she’s in a state of absorbing a bunch of new avenues of thought that she had simply not thought about in the past, and for her the word metaphysics was a new one that she was receiving in two starkly contrasting contexts.<br><br>The whole exchange brought to mind the fascinating habit in modern language of applying the word “metaphysics” not to the field of philosophy that it encompasses, but rather to a variety of mystical practices (or even simply unusual ones) ranging from alternative medicine to meditation to The Secret, and even trickles down somewhere into the world of bigfoot hunting. I believe you’ve mentioned that phenomena in your own books before (usually to draw a line between what someone sees when they go to the metaphysical section at a bookstore and what philosophers actually mean by the term), but I’ve thought very little about the process that brought about that linguistic transformation. Was that basically a result of that epistemological barrier carrying the terminology of philosophy away from philosophy and into mysticism?<br><br><br><a href=#c1689012092940756550 title="comment permalink">2/9/17, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

While a third, observational, me is expressing surprise at the fact that there are multiple "me"s and is fascinated by what is happening.

Where I live , more and more people are rejecting religion for the exact same reasons as the ones you described as causes which will cause rejection of science by people, i.e. many of the religious leaders and their supporters want everybody to accept their beliefs because they are an authority(no layman is permitted to challenge them on any matter) while more and more people are able to see that behavior of religious authorities is the complete oppositie of the vary principles they preach to the public and this is at a time when good old political and financial gain has corrupted religious institutions to the core. Of course , history probably have many similar examples already. However, the reason I am mentioning this is because many people in my society have repeatedly pointed out that under label of "religion" , the institutions which were functioning five or six decades ago and the one which is functioning now are completely different, having nothing in common except label.( I believe you have made a similar remark about political labels,viz., Conservative-Liberals.) And I believe same applies to the science. The institutions which is functioning under the "science" label is completely different from the institutions which was functioning in time of Newton and Einstein. ( As per my information , Newton was not even termed scientist but was considered "natural philosopher" in his time.) Current institutions ,which uses lable "science" , fulfills job of protecting interests of corporates much more than the the job of advancing science(atleast in front of general public). Hence , public will start to perceive them as political institutions under the label "science" and their rejection will be due to same reasons as those which lay behind rejection of political institutions. Institutions working under label "economics" is already under danger due to the same reasons.<br><br><a href=#c2429312404290342895 title="comment permalink">2/9/17, 10:15 AM</a><br><br>

Most of the people I knew owned guns, and most of the boys hunted with their fathers. Later I moved to the city for college. Most of my friends were very much on the political Left. I was too, at the time, and I mostly agreed with them (that is, with the Left) about issues like gun control. Over time, though, I noticed that the word "gun"-- not the physical object itself, but the word that represents the object-- had an entirely different meaning for people who grew up in upper middle class urban and suburban areas than it did for rural people. To the urbanites, the word "gun" was associated with urban violence, school shootings, and feelings of fear and danger. And also, I think, with rural people, and then by a chain of associations to traditional Christianity, which brings in a whole 'nother set of feelings-- persecution, repression, Pastor Bob preaching six days of creation, Ned Flanders... For the people I grew up with, "gun" has an altogether different set of associations-- family, fatherhood, tradition, recreation, dinner, liberty. And, of course, a caricature of urban liberals who despise rural people and their values. (In fairness, my experience is that this caricature is dead-on.)<br><br>When I realized this, a lot of things clicked into place. When people on opposite sides of America's political divide use the same words, they mean, feel, and understand altogether different things. Moreover, politicians know this, and deliberately use words with strong emotional associations in order to manipulate people. In a US context this becomes a strong argument for federalism-- We aren't all inhabiting the same mental world, so we ought to devolve power to a level which allows people to live according to their own values and perceptions. For whatever reason I've found that conservatives are much more receptive to that idea than liberals.<br><br>I am not sure if what I am describing is representation, or the next step removed from immediate representation-- the representation of a representation. But it follows that this would feed back upon immediate representation-- one's associations with the word "gun" must dramatically impact how one perceives and interacts with the actual object.<br><br><a href=#c9080663139779384868 title="comment permalink">2/9/17, 11:13 AM</a><br><br>

I don't understand this entirely, but I think part of the reason might be having only one set of representations, one model of reality to work with. You might or might not get to this, but my experience is that this is where 1. studying philosophy from more than one cultural tradition 2. practicing magic or 3. both of the above area very helpful. Studying another set of representations and then putting them into practice are probably the best antidote for the idea that useful=true, as you realize that there are more than one way to represent a given phenomenon, and that different representations can be useful under different circumstances.<br><br>Practicing qigong and studying Taoist philosophy, I find myself thinking and perceiving the phenomena I encounter in terms of yin/yang, jing-qi-shen, five elements, and other terms not found in sceintific materialism. There are times when I find this very useful, and other times when I don't find it useful at all. When I don't find it useful, I can shift gears, and use a different model of the world-- usually the model derived from the "Western Mystery Tradition," which is more or less my default. My experience suggests that any kind of spiritual or occult training amounts to learning to <i>represent</i> the world in a different way. It also suggests that practicing some kind of spiritual discipline can be a big step toward epistemic humility-- though often enough it leads to just a different kind of epistemic arrogance, as one discards one set of capital-T Truths for another just as useful and just as flawed.<br><br><a href=#c4383775901677730700 title="comment permalink">2/9/17, 11:14 AM</a><br><br>

When philosophical traditions hit their epistemological crises . . . .”<br><br>In 1925, responding to philosophic crisis provoked by conceptual anomalies found in both relativity and quantum physics, mathematician, logician and metaphysician Alfred North Whitehead published a startlingly new approach to thinking about actual experience in the world: Process and Reality. (Anyone lacking depth of philosophical background but curious about his concepts may want to begin with Process-Relational Philosophy: An Introduction to Alfred North Whitehead, by C. Robert Mesle, an excellent layman’s introduction to Whitehead’s ideas. For greater depth, at more challenging levels of effort, try Donald Sherbourne’s A Key to Whitehead’s Process and Reality.)<br><br>Whitehead’s view builds upon earlier efforts of Gottfried Wilhelm Liebniz, Charles Sanders Peirce (pronounced “purse”), William James, and Henri Bergson, among others (Plato, Aristotle, etc.) and generally is referred to as a philosophy of organism, or process-relational philosophy, or just process philosophy. Because Whitehead’s approach seeks to bring every conceivable topic into a single coherent mode of discussion and decision it also may be referenced as process metaphysics or even process theology.<br><br>Later philosophers, especially Charles Hartshorne (pronounced “harts horn”), have elaborated Whitehead’s initial effort into a comprehensive vision of human experience within the cosmos that rather than being haunted by the dualistic question of the “ghost in the machine”, dispels the notion of simple machine altogether by dispensing with any idea of inert matter.<br>In process philosophy, everything is at least minimally alive and thereby has at least some tiny degree of experience. In fact, all actual entities are of some level of vital complexity and are formed of combinations of simpler actualities of experience fostered by and among each constituent part. Each actual entity prehends or “includes” quality of feeling fostered by and among its constituents. Each entity also prehends, is partially formed out of its own prior moment as it changes — becomes — through each successive moment, accommodating to changes in its circumstances. Thus, even temporal change has a quality of quantization, successive moments, about it.<br><br>Actual entities become through successive moments of change, each of which emerges from and elaborates into the next state of its own actuality, freely elaborating its manifesting state, its next moment, in terms of the range of possibilities availed in its own particular circumstances. Successive states thus are only partially determined by actual circumstance; a degree of freedom, of self-actualization within the bounds of probability, avails as each successive moment enacts its own potentials out of the preceding moment. This freedom exists, at least minimally at every level of organization and levels of interaction become ever more complex via an organic scala natura that elaborates all the way to include the entire cosmos, where Divinity ultimately actualizes in a dipolar estate, in both the primordial nature of God and the consequent nature of God, an Alpha and an Omega. (Plato envisions such consequent nature of Divinity in his concept of World Soul. For more about Hartshorne see http://www.iep.utm.edu/hart-d-t/ ; for more detail see Charles Hartshorne’s Creative Experiencing, as well as his Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method.)<br><br><a href=#c1251656302422523998 title="comment permalink">2/9/17, 11:16 AM</a><br><br>

In France, for instance, philosophy still gets a fair degree of the pop culture treatment, and is incorporated into the standard secondary school education. I think a major reason for this is the devolution of most english-language philosophy into "analytic" philosophy, an institutionalized discourse that models itself on the sciences and limits itself to questions that can be "rigorously" expressed (where rigor is construed as expressible in the terms of formal logic). This has accomplished two things, primarily: 1) it has produced a false, overly narrow conception of truth as that which is logically demonstrable; and 2) it has ceased to be able to speak to almost everything that is actually <i>meaningful</i> in experience. In other places (and, to be fair, still at the margins of anglophone philosophy), the existentialist and phenomenological traditions continue to drive a philosophy that remains engaged with actual living experience - though god knows the continentals are not immune to the trappings of academese themselves...<br><br>On another note, may I make a modest suggestion? Instead of 'epistemic modesty,' how about referring to is as 'epistemic humility'? 'Humility' is etymologically related to humor, and also humus - soil, the stuff of the earth. Also 'low stature' - that which brings us down to earth. It seems to me that <i>a sense of earth</i> - that it is our home, is that from whence we come and that to which we will return - is precisely the sense that our age characteristically lacks.<br><br><a href=#c8223573657426499073 title="comment permalink">2/9/17, 12:47 PM</a><br><br>

Another thing to point out is that Americans have a fair obsession with news, and we seem to believe more and more that our destinies are determined by what the news tells us, rather than from philosophical underpinnings. When you go to any American airport, you'll find a store branded with the logos of news stations. America has no magazine like <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> that exists solely to <a href=http://avery.morrow.name/blog/2015/01/on-the-meaning-of-france/ rel=nofollow>mock our faith in narratives</a>; it has no tradition of current events series like Japanese <i>shinsho</i> or German <i>Taschenbücher</i> that serve as extended meditations and allow us to step back from the intensity of the moment and reorganize our thoughts. The raw facts, like Bible verses being read <i>sola scriptura</i>, speak for themselves and control our lives.<br><br>It's to be remembered that when Kant and Schopenhauer wrote their classics, it was not in order to persuade philosophy professors, as there were only a few at the time. It was to convince the reading public about the fundamental nature of the world. If the reading public of Europe had put their entire faith in newspapers and discarded everything else, then the greats of philosophy might have lost all hope before they got started.<br><br><a href=#c1538882693057795964 title="comment permalink">2/9/17, 5:31 PM</a><br><br>

I haven't spent much time on the Well of Galabes, but I was under the impression all this time that we were philosophical cousins. I'm a Thomist and therefore Aristotelian, so there was always common ground there that I could very often perceive in your writings.<br><br>The conundrum that developed from Descartes, until it found its fruition in Kant, was (in my view) adequately resolved by later philosophers. I think that Mortimer Adler, for instance, and Edward Feser, provide strong arguments against the Kantian conclusion that we can never know reality as such (noumena). <br><br>The most distinctive difference between the Cartesian and Aristotelian view is how ideas are held in the mind and how they are used to perceive the world. To the Cartesian/Kantian mind, ideas are <i>that which</i> we perceive when we think or observe. To the Aristotelian, however, ideas are that <i>by</i> which we perceive. The distinction isn't minor; the first leaves the mind in almost total isolation, while the second means that ideas really are the windows in your metaphor.<br><br>Think of the first case. If we accept, per your example, that the coffee cup is merely a representation (even of a reliable, if fragmentary, primordial perception), then these same qualities apply to the supposedly objective scientific realities you referred to when arguing our perception was flawed. After all, the experiments by which we've concluded that the cup is a product of quantum field interactions (or particles if you prefer that version) is itself a product of our perceptions. We have all manner of references, in other words, but no understanding whatsoever of the referent! We can never escape the "trap," because any attempt to move beyond representation or assess them for flaws is itself reliant on representations with the same flaw.<br><br>Moreover, the object in our mind (call it an idea or the form, or whatever you like) that is a "coffee cup" is most certainly NOT the same form that the real coffee cup holds, nor do we have any means by which to even begin to grasp or assess that form. This means knowledge of the cup is a literal impossibility - the objects of our mind bear little to no relation (we can't ever know which) to the objects "out there."<br><br>But if instead our idea of the coffee cup (or the form) is actually apprehended by us - that the form that exists in a coffee cup and the form of a coffee cup in our mind are literally one and the same - then we CAN have knowledge of it. There is no conundrum and the problem was merely a product of our false assumptions. <br><br>It also presents one of the two solutions to the problem of the "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics" issue. One solution is that the "world" we "perceive" is just a product of our ideas, and therefore there will of course be a connection between our ideas of the world and our "perceptions." The other solution, though, which is a necessary position for virtually any scientific inquiry to have any meaning, is that our ideas of the world really are the forms that we find instantiated in the world. The reason our math about gravity and the actual orbit of the earth are in perfect harmony is because the second is merely a manifestation of the form of the first. Otherwise this problem is insoluble.<br><br>If you can't tell from my rant, I have a feeling I'll enjoy this most recent series. :) I've lurked for quite some time, but now we're in one of my passions, so I had to come out of hiding!<br><br>Thoughts?

I read French, but I don't presume to write it! <br><br>Karim, "the common externality" is quite a good phrase. I've also heard it described as "intersubjective reality" -- the world that's common to more than one subject. As for a hint, the answer is just a week away... ;-)<br><br>Phitio, that's a very ancient and common way of thinking about things. I propose to challenge it in the weeks to come, but Kastrup's got a long tradition on his side, no question. <br><br>Jbarber, that's a really good question. I don't know what's currently available in terms of introductions to philosophy; if I were to write a book on the subject, which I've considered, it would probably raise hackles all over the place, as I'd portray the history of Western philosophy as the story of a brilliant, daring, wholly understandable, and ultimately disastrous mistake -- the conviction that thoughts about things must somehow be more real than the things themselves -- and how that played out down through the centuries from the time of Pythagoras to today. More about this as we proceed! <br><br>Robert, that Karl Rove quote ought to be engraved on the tombstone of America's global empire -- and may well be. As for science -- does it work? Sure. So did a lot of theories we now consider dead wrong. Remember that any sequence of events can be explained by an infinite number of theories! <br><br>Sven, heh heh heh...<br><br>Kio, interesting! That's not the answer I had in mind, but it's an interesting point and one I'll want to brood over a bit. <br><br>Daniel, I don't do a lot of Neopagan events these days -- my interests and those of your standard pop Neopaganism don't have much overlap -- but I proposed a talk on "Sovereignty in the age of entitlement" and they jumped for it, so I figured it was not going to be your common or garden variety event!<br><br>Koukos, that's a very deep and complex issue, made even more so by differences in the ways that civilized societies and steady-state societies express their ideas. What takes the form of formally developed philosophies in a civilization generally takes the form of mythological narratives in a tribal society, requiring very different habits of learning and understanding!

Exactly -- in the modern age of media, especially, people are constantly pushing representations on you that are meant to falsify and manipulate, e.g., "I'm loving it" as a slogan for tasteless mystery meat patties on a bland and mushy bun. The first line of defense is recognizing that you're experiencing representations and not realities, so that you avoid the trap of thinking that what's being pushed on you is the way things really are. <br><br>Fred, if your kids are getting into epistemological arguments, that speaks well of them, and of their father. With regard to Kant's ethics, though, we'll get to that -- but I'm sorry to say Kant will come out rather the worse for wear. <br><br>Econojames, quantification actually comes much later than representation; it's one of the ways we in western cultures force our representations into the straitjacket of abstraction. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Bill, maybe your experience is different, but back in those far-off days when I dabbled in psychoactive compounds, I didn't have any more luck telling hallucinations what to do than I did telling coffee cups what to do after the drugs wore off. Sure, the coffee cup would do <i>something</i> after I ingested a certain number of bits of blotter paper, or of the interesting fungi that grew all over the campus of the first university I attended, but could I make it sprout wings and chirp? No -- it might decide to turn into fanged peanut brittle instead... ;-)<br><br>As for the graffiti, yeah, it's been decades since I last saw "Nietzsche is pietzsche but Sartre is smartre" on a bathroom wall!<br><br>Steve, of course science isn't ontological. That doesn't keep quite a substantial number of its publicists and cheerleaders from insisting on the ontological reality of scientific abstractions, you know. <br><br>Helix, ding! We have a winner. They don't teach basic epistemology in US high schools for the same reason they don't teach classical logic there: it's too likely that the kids will look at the rest of the swill they're being taught by Federal mandate and say, "this is complete malarkey" (or whatever the latest slang term for malarkey is these days). <br><br>Kobo, that's a valid point, and it points up the uncertain nature of representation. Close your eyes and press gently on your eyeballs with your fingertips, and if you're like most people you'll see odd patterns of light. Those aren't light in the usual sense of the word, and yet your senses represent them to you as though they were light.

I recall with some amusement a self-described Metaphysical Library in the small Oregon town where I lived some years back, which got some books on actual metaphysics donated to it, and gamely stuck them on the shelves next to channeled messages and UFO books. <br><br>Macando, epistemic modesty is particularly important to Bruce, Bruce, and Sheila after the second bottle each, you know -- is that really a tap-dancing tyrannosaur, or is it just really bad D.T.s? ;-)<br><br>Hapibeli, stay tuned...<br><br>Mgalimba, a lot of living things have no specialized nervous system at all, and yet take deliberate action -- watch a vine climbing toward the sunlight and it's clear that there's purposive action going on. The evolution of the nervous system simply takes something that's common to all living tissue and specializes certain cells to take care of it, while other cells back off. The question that comes to my mind, though, is how on earth the scientist claims to know that the starfish doesn't experience a noumena-phenomena distinction -- did it say so? If its "brain" is coextensive with its entire body, it's still got to cope with the difference with the parts of its field of experience over which it has voluntary control, and the parts of its field of experience over which it doesn't.<br><br>Gavin, yep.

Thank you for the retinal image -- that's a very good teaching tool, and one I'll be using again. <br><br>Patricia, that would take a lot of unpacking.

I found his later investigations very useful. On the whole there were certain (beetle) boxes that he unproductively refused to open, but mixed in with these limits are a good handful of nice aphorisms and some of the more comprehensive falsifications of the project of positivism, which ironically his early work had some guilt in starting. A.J. Ayer wouldn't have gotten so screwed up as he did if not for Wittgenstein's book from prison.<br><br>I bring this up because the metaphor of the shooting range and the function of philosophy continue to inform each other as I read the comments and replies. To fire accurately at great distances the scopes representation of where the bullet will land (the cross hairs) need to be adjusted to account for several possible fowling factors. But really it is a stunningly simply representation compared to those that we use day to day, just in order to walk! A sophisticated (as in sophistry) society lives and act under to guide of representations many many orders more complicated. Representations are used as justifications for countless essential or silly things, as case may be. Language, experience, history, and conditions changing all the time as they are apt to do those representations are always shifting, like a poorly mounted scope. But being far more convoluted in their inner workings, and in the explanations of their workings, keeping a societies culturally contingent representations requires constant skills maintenance. And to more sophisticated (screwed up by sophistry) the society is, the more up keep and maintenance is needed. Philosophy done well is an important skill for this work to be done competently.<br><br>To make things slightly more hairy, a scope isn't motivated to fall out of focus, mere chaos is introducing imprecision into the targeting. But where a representation falls out of calibration a blind spot is likely to open, and in that blind spot a niche where life can make a living off of the consequences of the faulty representation. What lives in that niche is prone to defend that niche, and has much more than mere chaos available to that end.<br><br>Why is philosophy discouraged, and by whom?<br><br><a href=#c2319983286982964777 title="comment permalink">2/9/17, 8:19 PM</a><br><br>

Schopenhauer was a systematic philosopher, who happened to see the implications of a universal but generally unnoticed detail of human experience and built his system on that. Nietzsche, as I understand him, is a very different kettle of fish -- he's a critical philosopher, less interested in creating an account of things than in dissecting the process of philosophizing itself, showing where it got stupid, and suggesting how it might be dismantled and carried over to different foundations on which others could build. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Candace, Sacks is really interesting, since he's studied the ways that the human nervous system impacts our experience of the world. That's certainly relevant to the inquiry we're engaged in. <br><br>Ray, that last question of yours has many answers, of course. I'd add: and for what ends? <br><br>LL Pete, like most Druids, I don't believe in the supernatural -- that is, in anything beyond or outside of nature. I have reason to think that nature is rather more commodious than today's crop of scientific materialists want to believe, but I see no reason to doubt that the ordinary processes of nature affecting physical matter and energy are anything other than what we currently know them to be, and I see good reasons to think that natural limits also apply to things other than physical matter as currently understood. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Armata, I can see you grinning from ear to ear every time you type "President Donald Trump." As for Spengler, yep -- history's tossing up one clay skeet after another, and he's blowing them out of the air pop-pop-pop. <br><br>Jay, oh bright gods, yes. My wife is unfashionably plump due partly to heredity and partly to having been starved for the first eight years of her life -- long ugly story there -- and she keeps track of dietary idiocy as a form of self-defense against the legions of people who want to preach the One True Diet to her for her own supposed good. I've considered a post on the subject, though it'll get even more screams of outrage than I got by pointing out the role of class bigotry in current US politics...<br><br>Econojames, thanks for the clarification. That sensation of dissolving actually does point to something we'll be discussing at some length. <br><br>Donald, well, but you're assuming that the word "god" has something like its Judeo-Christian sense, and includes "godly powers" of the world-changing variety. There are deities worshipped by some polytheistic religions who can, or at least do, perform only one thing -- say, they cure you of scrofula, help with mother-in-law troubles, or what have you.

Chuang Tzu said, "The white fish are swimming at ease. This is the happiness of the fish."<br>"You are not a fish," said Hui Tzu. "How do you know its happiness?"<br>"You are not I," said Chuang Tzu. "How do you know that I do not know the happiness of the fish?"<br>Hui Tzu said, "Of course I do not know, since I am not you. But you are not the fish, and it is perfectly clear that you do not know the happiness of fish."<br>"Let us get at the bottom of the matter," said Chuang Tzu. "When you asked how I knew the happiness of the fish, you already knew that I knew the happiness of the fish but asked how. I knew it along the river."

They don't seem to have it here in Japan, except as an alpine plant--and no word there on its uses. I understand silica is in cucumbers as well, and each spring there is a type of horsetail the Japanese traditionally eat. There seem to be no toxicity issues with this species.<br>One of the big uses of eyebright seems to be against conjunctivitis, which becomes a problem in the dog days of summer for me. But now that I think of it, there is an "eye medicine tree" here, and I know the location of a grove nearby.<br>Regarding face exercizes, the Japanese TV has been wonderfully helpful. (I have such a mobile face, it terrifies small children here--make up would probably only make it worse.) Recently, they told us how to deal with "bulldog face" by regularly stretching the platysma band of muscles stretching from the chest to the jaw. It does seem to help.<br>When I went through menopause a few years back, I noticed an immediate difference in my skin quality. I looked into the possibilities of hormones for that, but they were quite frank, saying the equivalent of "Get over it, you bag! You're destined for wrinkles and nothing will help!" A little while after that I found cinnamon mentioned for boosting collagen in the skin. It was recommended to combine two parts turmeric with one part cinnamon in enough oil (I use coconut) to make a paste, and add a bit of salt or sugar to make a scrub and apply that once a week (careful--it stains).That seems to help.<br>A baby-faced senior police lieutenant in Thailand told me about a form of ginger called "plai" there that does wonders, so I'm adding that now too.<br><br><a href=#c1282649360423600640 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 1:59 AM</a><br><br>

I've never made it up to the retreat, for a variety of reasons—the distance between North Carolina and Connecticut being primary among them—but as a dedicant of the Morrígan I've been very interested in attending since I first heard about it several years back. Unfortunately, this year some more than unpleasant events have come up in my life (some, symptoms of some of the latest bout of Long Descent-related crises, some...less so) that make my ability to attend this year even more unlikely still. All the same, my appetite is whetted all the more when you say you intend to give a talk entitled "Sovereignty in the Age of Entitlement"! I've been thinking a lot about that very thing over the past year or three, as my political views have been kicked from the Left and Right into something utterly unrecognizeable in contemporary political [m]iscourse*. I'm well aware of the valuable separation between the spheres of politics and religion, and by and large I try to keep those things distinct. However, examining the concept of Sovereignty, as well as the role of the Morrígan (and the service of Herself) in political, civil, and social life is difficult to avoid, and it's something I've had a lot of difficulty coming to any kind of definite conclusions on. It's made a lot more difficult by the fact that virtually all of the prominent Morrígan devotees of which I'm aware are very firmly entrenched in Leftist activism (and frequently ground both concepts equally firmly in the defense of liberal identity politics, without expanding beyond that narrow band), and so dialogue and guidance can be hard to come by without winding up lost in a Puritanical echo chamber—an environment I find deeply uncomfortable even when I agree with the basic ethical premises of the people with whom I'm talking. Generally I've been finding myself called to be a stalwart and vehement defender of what might be inappropriately referred to as the middle ground (a territory that may in fact no longer exist, as denizens of both the Far Left and Far Right—themselves terms with rapidly diminishing referential relevance—claim to inhabit it); what I mean by it is civility, polite dissensus and exchange of ideas, and compassion and empathy for one's ideological opponents, contrasted with the demonization of them (honestly, I can't think of a more effective means of disarming and defeating an enemy; usually it either transforms them into an ally, or conjures such a flustered display of rage that they cease to be so much adversarial as they become a source of amusement). The middle ground thus defined seems to be far more besieged, endangered, and in need of defense than any other I know of.<br><br>I'd be deeply grateful to hear (or read) the contents of your talk, if it's possible to share with interested but impoverished parties. I'd be very nearly as interested to hear an account of its reception!<br><br>*By the by, I was greatly attracted the other week by your description of what you referred to as the alt-center (though I wonder about that name as well), and I greatly look forward to your post on the subject!<br><br><a href=#c2334828007952912529 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 4:07 AM</a><br><br>

It's a key point of many forms of Gnosticism (and of the Attraction Science practice, where it is taken to its logical extreme in A Course Of Miracles), was a major movement in many religions for many years (the Greeks had multiple versions of this) and the Christian version takes the story to an intriguing point by telling of a God who becomes a mason and/or woodworker, obeys his Mother and Adoptive father up to and including the starting point of his ministry, hangs out with thieves, fishers, tax collectors and former whores, and gets betrayed onto death by the most respectable of his disciples (Judas. Ponder that for a while.).<br><br>And as for "for kicks," The movie Dogma takes on that concept in a way that's actually quite frightening in that it implies that God (in the movie God is one, and is She when not slumming) could be neutralized to the point of being unable to stop the destruction of the earth. That (the) God(s) could destroy the world (or even allow the world to be destroyed, per <i>Der Ring des Nibelungen</i>) makes absolute sense, that the world could be destroyed with (The) God(s) unable to do anything to stop it...<br><br>(and do note that I call myself a Believing Agnostic.

I think it's safe to agree that our culture still expects men to be more certain of themselves and women to be less assertive. Male dominance games and female relationship-building and so on. That said, in considering my own acquaintances, I think I probably know a roughly equal number of male and female blowhards. In fact, the single most fact-independent arguer I've ever known was my own mother, in my childhood. It was universally acknowledged in my family that no one ever won an argument with her, regardless of their faultless evidence or perfect reasoning. She simply would not be convinced away from her own opinions, and would argue them beyond all reason, to the exhaustion of any opponents. Now she has greatly mellowed as she has aged, to the point where one can actually have a reasonable exchange of opinions with her, with listening on both sides and points acknowledged. I'm not sure of the cause of the transformation, since I moved away decades ago and didn't witness the day-by-day change, but it's probably something I should explore with the rest of the family, since that would be a valuable process to be able to replicate, or at least encourage! Perhaps it's simply a case of wisdom coming with age, in which case I can only hope for a similar gift for myself as the arthritis and crows-feet creep in. <br>--Heather in CA <br><br><br><a href=#c3938023174723389467 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 8:44 AM</a><br><br>

As she strides out to see what the world is doing and decide what she is going to do about that, it is evident that the source of her magic is her will, aided by her assiduous practice at keeping her world-viewing "window" (as per your own usage in this post) sparkling clean. <br><br>Whereas her fairy godmother sister is, perhaps an embodiment of Representation.

To him it was just a 'fashion' that came around now and then and was soon swished aside by real academic historians, who knew better. The cyclical theory or model of history was 'nonsense.'

We were traveling down a street that I have walked on, ridden a bicycle and driven on as long as I've been able to do those things. My wife was talking about something which I had turned all my attention, and so I paid little mind to the world outside of the car. As we came to a stop sign, I looked up to see where we were. I looked south down the the street, directly at a set of apartments that I have seen all my life (and for six months Maryann and I had lived in), and I couldn't piece together where we were. The buildings of the complex were just slabs of color illuminated by artificial light, and the road and houses that lead towards the complex appeared to be an unfamiliar, vaguely menacing dark tunnel. It took a few seconds for me to re-assemble the landscape into places and objects that I recognized. <br><br>Amusingly enough, while I distinctly remember that moment of confusion, I can't for the life of me remember what my wife and I had been discussing.<br><br><a href=#c2908358573021404770 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 9:55 AM</a><br><br>

I've written 4 novels (unpublished and alas probably unpublishable due to their militant insistence on thumbing their nose at any kind of cultural, moral, or genre norm) and I could pound out 12,000 words in a single session with those. One event sets up the next sets up the next. With fiction everything happens in order and makes sense. Trying to write a personal history of chan culture is striking me as borderline impossible; too many influences develop in parallel to disentangle them into any kind of sensible order. 500 words into why anime became so important gets derailed by the role of video games and vice versa.<br><br><a href=#c4460177031788599855 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 11:48 AM</a><br><br>

Suddenly people have to choose between drinking and washing dishes. Activists argue that taking a shower is a basic human right, and grumpy talk show hosts point out that in their day, parents taught their children not to waste water. A coalition promotes laws ensuring government-subsidized free water for poor families; a Fox News investigative report shows that some people receiving water on the government dime are taking long luxurious showers. Everyone gets really angry and there’s lots of talk about basic compassion and personal responsibility and whatever but all of this is secondary to why does water costs ten times what it used to?"<br><br>-------------------------------------------<br><br>And to make this comment not a complete waste, may I point out that this week's article is so unlike my highschool philosophy classes. What I recall is a bunch of crazy greeks making unknowable statements as if they were in a fashion contest. Then the wisest of they earn eternal fame by claiming to know nothing at all. The ones that came afterwards seemed bizarrely preocupied with categorizing things for the sake of it, then came 2 Christian saints masquerading as philosophers and everything gets even murkier after that, except for the fact that at least no one seems to be making the "everything is fire, no wait... everything is water" sketch anymore.<br><br>What I have learned today is that looking at the history of philosophy in chronological order seems like a pretty bad idea. In contrast with this work, it looks like the difference between grade school history (rote memorization of names, dates, and places) vs high school history (taking the time to analize the social forces that were driving historical events).

I can't recommend Feynman highly enough as a point of contact here. He agrees with everything JMG says above, and is <i>also</i> one of the most respected physicists in recent history, much beloved by people like Dawkins, deGrasse Tyson, and so on.<br><br>Avery has it right: the specific philosophers Feynman is taking potshots at are (as he sees them, at least) not at all like obstetricians, but more like men pontificating on the subject without having ever set foot in a delivery room. Probably someone familiar with the history of philosophy of science could name the philosophers or schools he's referring to.<br><br>Anyway, here are some quotes relevant to this week's post:<br><br>From Lectures <a href=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_08.html rel=nofollow>8</a> and <a href=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_12.html rel=nofollow>12</a>:<br><br>'Perhaps you say, “That’s a terrible thing—I learned that in science we have to define everything precisely.” We cannot define <i>anything</i> precisely!<br><br>Any simple idea is approximate; as an illustration, consider an object, … what is an object? Philosophers are always saying, “Well, just take a chair for example.” The moment they say that, you know that they do not know what they are talking about any more. What <i>is</i> a chair? Well, a chair is a certain thing over there … certain?, how certain? The atoms are evaporating from it from time to time—not many atoms, but a few—dirt falls on it and gets dissolved in the paint; so to define a chair precisely, to say exactly which atoms are chair, and which atoms are air, or which atoms are dirt, or which atoms are paint that belongs to the chair is impossible. So the mass of a chair can be defined only approximately. In the same way, to define the mass of a single object is impossible, because there are not any single, left-alone objects in the world—every object is a mixture of a lot of things, so we can deal with it only as a series of approximations and idealizations.'<br><br>Patricia's quote comes from Lecture <a href=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_02.html rel=nofollow>2</a>, where he explains what he means (lightly edited for length):<br><br>'Nature, as we understand it today, behaves in such a way that it is <i>fundamentally impossible</i> to make a precise prediction of <i>exactly what will happen</i> in a given experiment. This is a horrible thing; in fact, philosophers have said before that one of the fundamental requisites of science is that whenever you set up the same conditions, the same thing must happen. This is simply <i>not true</i>, it is not a fundamental condition of science. The fact is that the same thing does not happen, that we can find only an average, statistically, as to what happens. Nevertheless, science has not completely collapsed. <b>Philosophers, incidentally, say a great deal about what is absolutely necessary for science, and it is always, so far as one can see, rather naive, and probably wrong.</b> For example, some philosopher or other said it is fundamental to the scientific effort that if an experiment is performed in, say, Stockholm, and then the same experiment is done in, say, Quito, the same results must occur. That is quite false. For example, if one of the experiments is to look out at the sky and see the aurora borealis in Stockholm, you do not see it in Quito; that is a different phenomenon. If we take a pendulum on a universal joint, and pull it out and let go, then the pendulum will swing almost in a plane, but not quite. Slowly the plane keeps changing in Stockholm, but not in Quito. The fact that this happened does not bring on the destruction of science.'<br><br><a href=#c4723878745045915542 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 1:52 PM</a><br><br>

In the 1920s, the world was still reeling from Nietzsche and those consequences were seeping into the public consciousness. You pointed out at the end of this essay the role ignoring the limits of human knowledge had in backing scientific rationalism into its present corner, and you mentioned that one of the products of embracing those limits often involves embracing ethics or mysticism. The embracing of the philosophical language by a counter-movement that was by and large a reaction to the hubris of scientific rationalism may suggest that the appropriation of that language has a good deal more to do with the topics at hand than it seems on the surface.<br><br><a href=#c5214487487346730333 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 2:28 PM</a><br><br>

I wonder in what sense you mean that. This is an area of semantics I struggle with in addition to the word 'spiritual.'

Thus the idea that there are separate realms called spirit, which you either have faith in, experience of, or deny. <br><br>So I came to the conclusion that there is no such thing as supernatural. But that does not preclude me from believing in the primacy of consciousness, my own soul, or the divine. It's just that it's all one big reality system. Nothing outside of it. So the quest for knowledge, especially the philosophical and scientific quests, are to me searches for what nature, or existence, contains.<br> <br>Of course, there are different planes and maybe the divine mind is transcendent in the sense that physical matter need not always manifest - that could be cyclical - but all things arise from and out of the divine.<br><br><a href=#c6083839325675610822 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 3:06 PM</a><br><br>

With inspiration from Varela &amp; Maturana (autopoiesis); Donal D Hoffman (conscious agents); Bose, Darwin and Trewavas (plant intelligence); Suzanne Simard (mother trees); Lynn Margulis (bacterial intellugence); Barbara McCkintock, James Shapiro (DNA intelligence).<br><br>Hoffman defines a "conscious agent" as the entity which can experience/decide/act (this triad seems to touch on "representation" via the experience leg, and on "will" via both the deciding and acting legs. Hoffman reckons that the "world" for any conscious agent is a composite of all other conscious agents acting on different levels, which collectively presents resistance to the experiencing conscious agent's actions upon that world. Composites of two or more agents can act (for all intents and purposes) as a single conscious agent, and life is indeed full of examples. (Think bees &amp; hive). Our eucaryotic cells are bounded communities whose origins lie in various encounters and mergers of simpler agents, our multicellular bodies are communities of cells and tissues. We and other organisms are communities which may make up bigger conscious entities such as ecosystems. <br><br>It seems to me that *I* am a composite "conscious agent" , a sort of egregore arising from the (mostly) concerted actions of many conscious agents functioning at different levels of resolution. As such *I* am mostly aware of myself as a unit of purpose and action (agent) moving this human multicellular body. I am mostly NOT aware of the micro-level agents which consciously (to them) but unconsciously (to me) beaver away at the million and one tasks involved in digesting my food or processing my thoughts. I am mostly NOT aware of the macro-level agents of which I am a tiny part, which circulate wind and water, bend and stretch the earth and engage in concerns of which I can imagine little and know nothing. But if I get glimpses from either end of the resolution scale distant from that which *I* habituate, these may feel strange, supernatural, out of the ordinary. <br><br>And what a unit of purpose and action (or agent) must "represent" to themselves is the meaning of the resistance they encounter as they purposely move about the world. Other agents, other wills, at high or low resolution, make up everything - certainly everything that stops us or requires us to adapt and change our purposeful movements.<br><br>Not very good philosophese, but as best as I've worked out for myself so far.

I'd missed that, somehow. At least I know how I'll be spending the next few weeks! <br><br>Thank you for your response. You asked a question in it and I want to give you (and Cherokee) an answer.<br><br>"I could see a point to asking everyone to tone things down here, in the hope that the habit might spread. My question for you, though, is this -- are you willing to accept the same limits you're asking me to place on my alt-right readers? The comments page here has also seen denunciations of Trump and his supporters, you know, just as heated as the denunciations of liberals you've quoted. If I ask for, and enforce, a stricter level of civility than before, that'll fall on all sides, not just on the alt-right. Are you prepared to tolerate that?"<br><br>I am 100% willing to accept and tolerate a standard for all that takes us back to compliance with the posted policy, of which I am vociferous support. <br><br>Note I singled out Armata mostly because of his many egregious comments - that clearly violated posted policy - in one comments section. I have not seen anyone else on right or left engage in that sheer volume of violations. <br><br>(And BTW, I also find Dammerung's posts quite interesting and do not recall seeing his comments as bullying)<br><br>Now, it may interest you, and Cherokee (whose comments I've been reading and enjoying for years, and hold in high regard), that I am not the leftist activist type that's been assumed or asserted. I suppose that because I spoke up against bullying by the right, I'm presumed to be doing it from the left. <br><br>On some issues I agree with what we think of as the left (in particular, enviro-issues and issues of social and wealth inequality), albeit the non-establishment left (I'm a fan of Zinn and of Chomsky's critique of the imperialist nature of US foreign policy for example, not so much of some of his other positions), but I can tell you I've been vehemently opposed to political correctness since it began - and I'm old enough to recall that beginning. I have in my life been a registered Republican, but have never been a registered Democrat, and in fact I have never voted for a Democrat in my life. That said, I've voted for very few Republicans. My political philosophy simply does not fit into the neat little boxes offered by contemporary politics. I'm more likely to cite Illich, Ellul or Roszak than any of the contemporary left or right political thinkers. And I very much resonate with much of what has been said here about Burkean conservatism - in fact I suggested to you, JMG, that you take a look at Crawford's latest, which impresses me, because I believe you and he share considerable philosophical ground over toward the right.<br><br>So all of this to say: it's not leftist ideology that inspired me to make that comment. It was a reaction to seeing this bullying. And the most egregious example - IMHO - was Armata's machine gun set of blatantly bullying comments in a single blog post.<br><br>Now, JMG I do recall seeing multiple hysterical e-mails from the folks on the left here - but IIRC (and I could be wrong), most of those were actually directed at you, or at Trump, and not *directly* at other commenters, which is what caused me to call out Armata. <br><br>I think this makes a difference. <br><br>That said, and back to the main point, I think your standard of 'courteous comments' and 'polite discourse' are a large part of what has made this blog not only stand out, but also encourage the kind of deeply intelligent and thoughtful contributions we see here on a routine basis (scintillating is the word I would use), and I have sadly (IMO) seen less 'scintillance' in recent months due, IMO, to the degradation I outlined in the comment last week. <br><br>So, yes, absolutely, I'm for fair play and courteous commentary from all sides, and I for one would be immensely grateful to see you call for all sides to tone things down and eschew the name calling.<br><br><a href=#c6280322563785012692 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 3:58 PM</a><br><br>

When I finished the book I felt my world had shifted. I had always been a card-carrying optimist, never realizing optimism was blinding and paralyzing me. This perspective change allowed me to finally accept my psoriasis was going to continue getting worse unless I actually did something about it, and I did cure it after doing a few months of research. And also, now I am not optimistic about the future. I just heard of Green Wizardry last week and really liked the book and plan to practice it :)<br><br>I have become increasingly skeptical of science. I do like the scientific method but it will never be pure. It is more like a religion at this point, and it is a dark art. We are summoning demons that we won't be able to put back in the box. Recently, my friend who is an Atheist and Scientific Materialist was super excited about the news that they might be able to wipe out an entire species of mosquitos using genetic engineering. This is literally Genocide! He thought it was worth it. But who gets to decide which species are wiped out? I know I won't have a say.<br><br>I also find the increasing focus on all diseases being cured by genetic engineering disturbing. For one thing it increases how helpless people feel about their health. There are some literal genetic diseases, but that is a small percentage. Most health problems are from malnutrition, food toxins, environmental toxins, lack of sleep, disrupted circadian rhythm, addiction, etc. These things trigger epigenetic changes. I'm not going to begrudge someone with cancer seeking genetic intervention. But seriously, science is not researching the right stuff. I won't trust science much until money, big egos, and special interests are taken out the equation.<br><br>It is important to realize we are always looking though a lens and there is no way we can be truly objective and to have some humility. But I hope for a day when we value human intuition over computers, they are not smarter than us.<br><br><a href=#c8022916318776696187 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 4:15 PM</a><br><br>

Hammer it out at top speed with no editing, no second-guessing, no attempt to direct the flow, "Shadilay" playing at top volume in the background and kyphi incense rising before a statue of Kek next to the keyboard. Make it one long primal scream. Later -- days or weeks later -- take the file and go to town cutting and pasting, allowing your outline to emerge out of the process rather than trying to impose an order on it from above. The result may make Hunter S. Thompson's prose look like Jane Austen's, but that sounds appropriate given the subject matter, doesn't it? <br><br>Varun, good!

Thank you. <br><br>Raymond, that article's making a crucial point, of course -- and it's good to see people actually talking about, ahem, why medicine in the US costs so absurdly much. (Cough, cough, kleptocratic profiteering, cough, cough.) As for philosophy, the Greek philosophers are hideously misrepresented in most history of philosophy books -- one of the many ways we maltreat the past to make the present look good. The Presocratics were literally inventing the possibility of analytical thought from the ground up; of course their first attempts were just as clumsy as, say, Descartes' first attempt to doubt everything -- but see it in context and it becomes visible as the tremendous intellectual adventure it was. No, I don't know of a philosophy book to recommend -- I'll have to see if I can find something. <br><br>Grisom, thank you for this. Yes, I have a pretty good idea which philosophers he has in mind!<br><br>Eric, fascinating. You may well be right. <br><br>Onething, purely in the sense that I don't think there's anything that is over or above ("super") nature. In Shinto, there's a very useful habit of talking about the context of existence as Daishizen, "Great Nature," and to see this as surrounding and defining the existence of the kami (deities) as well as everything else. That's very much my take as well -- I see the order of nature as including all things, including those that our Western cultures label as "spiritual." More on this as we proceed! <br><br>Scotlyn, that's certainly one way to talk about it, starting from the viewpoint of the environmental sciences. <br><br>Gwizard, fair enough.

That's a very good book, and deserves much more attention than it's gotten so far. <br><br>Armata, thank you. <br><br>Caryn, one of the grubby little secrets of modern philosophy is that a good deal of its obscurity is deliberate. Heidegger is supposed to have said that clarity is the enemy of philosophy -- and of course that's true, when you really don't have anything significant to say, and still want to present yourself to the world as a Deep Thinker of Deep Thoughts. (Apologies to Heidegger fans, but that's my considered assessment of the man.) Have you ever seen the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta "Patience"? The character Bunthorne has a song where he explains the basic modality of too much contemporary philosophy: <br><br>"If you're anxious for to shine in the high aesthetic line<br>as a man of culture rare,<br>You must get up all the germs of the transcendental terms,<br>and plant them ev'rywhere.<br>You must lie upon the daisies and discourse in novel phrases<br>of your complicated state of mind,<br>The meaning doesn't matter if it's only idle chatter<br>of a transcendental kind.<br><br>And ev'ry one will say,<br>As you walk your mystic way,<br>'If this young man expresses himself in terms too deep for me,<br>Why, what a very singularly deep young man<br>this deep young man must be!'"<br><br>To my mind, Hegel's <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i> and Heidegger's <i>Being and Time</i>, to say nothing of any number of more recent tomes, can be sung very well to this tune. It's indicative, by contrast, that Schopenhauer's prose is considered a model of good clear scholarly German writing, and Nietzsche was one of the great prose stylists of any language, ever. Both were tremendously, even painfully clear, because they both had something to communicate and wanted to communicate it.<br><br><a href=#c2488658001034587465 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 7:03 PM</a><br><br>

If I recall correctly Nietzsche calls out Kant for making his ideas seem more stupid than they needed to be in order to fit a motley quilt of ideas onto one procrustean bed of a system. Further more Fritz alleged, and if my own past motives are a window into the soul of another I find this likely, that Kant did this for power; more precisely to give his ideas a certain kind of impact. Regularly Nietzsche observes the superiority of power in the stupid, and truly for a particular and common sense of 'power'.<br><br>Thoughts and insights as they come very rarely do so systematically. More common are glimmer glimpses. Schopenhauer is a worth while counter example, just as you have said of TADR that it started as an extended project to express a particular insight or idea, Arther claims that the entire 'The World as Will and Representation' existed to articulate a single thought.<br><br>Arther's system was a natural necessity to articulate clearly a perspective then quite strange in Western Imagination. Kant's Critique's by contrast we a system but together to fill a preexisting gap in western thought; and gifted though Kant's insights were, the Critiques as works or prose suffer by being forced to complete this receive philosophic project.<br><br>Nietzsche gift was just being marvelously observant of countless fey things, especially what makes people tick, and reflective enough to think out the context clearly, and they articulate and passionate as a writer. Socrates made a glib remark about being a midwife to ideas: to bad most are still born; Nietzsche birthed many ideas that have so far had exciting lives, too bad toward the end he had ideas too big for his hips.<br><br><a href=#c238766627499288254 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 8:58 PM</a><br><br>

Thought you might enjoy that one. It was pretty funny! I checked out what was meant by "thing in itself" and a brief summary was provided on the Interweb as "In the philosophy of Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) and those whom he influenced, a thing as it is independent of any conceptualization or perception by the human mind, postulated by practical reason but existing in a condition which is in principle unknowable and unexperienceable." Otherwise I don't really understand what was meant by that, but it sounds an awful lot like the whole: "If a tree falls in the forest..." And I that dispute claim, as trees (which are independent of humans by the way - as well as predating those creatures by a considerable time period) most certainly do make a noise if they fall, even if nobody is around and cares to listen to that noise. A rather silly argument that one. I suspect that Mr Kant is pointing out the obvious that there are things out there that exist beyond the human consciousness and perhaps even more importantly are indifferent to it? Or have I read that completely wrong? My personal philosophy is a bit closer to Conan's as I am all too aware of the trees and their benefits and threats and so I try not to over-intellectualise them and deal with them as they appear to me.<br><br>I recall reading a chance comment by you to someone else a week or two back that your wife's health is not good, although I may be incorrect in that understanding? Given that you also remarked that you are nearing the upper limits of your capacity for work, have you considered taking some time off blogging and/or replying to comments so as to free up some time to attend to your good wife? If I were in your circumstances, given that your blog is related to your income, I would most likely post blog essays, explain that for the next couple of months you were unable to reply, and then continue with the moderation policies for comments. No doubts that a lively conversation would continue for a while. Anyway, the above suggestion is intended as a friendly suggestion for you. <br><br>Life happens and it is rarely smooth. Incidentally blogging about diets would make for a most un-smooth week (imagine 1,000+ comments)!

So far as I can document, it began during the years that saw the beginnings of Christian Science and other forms of New Thought, and also the creation of the Theosophical Society, that is from about 1875 onward. In 1883 Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, actually chartered a college in Massachusetts to spread her own teachings about healing and the primacy of mind over matter. She named it the "Massachusetts Metaphysical College." Before that, it may have had some currency in Swedenborgian circles, but I haven't found documentation for that yet.<br><br>A decade ago Catherine Albanese put out a thick and dense book on the history of this sort of 19th-century avant-garde spirituality, and titled it, _A Republic of Mind and Spirit: A Cultural History of American Metaphysical Religion_.

Fortunately I had a prof who had been working the ground floor of a steel mill for quite a few years before he went back to school and fortunately kept a pretty broad horizon. <br><br>@Mario Incandenza <br><br>I second that impression. Particularly French society seems to put some emphasis on public philosophic discourse. It is quite interesting to see the philosophical (and history) magazines next to the pictures of naked people in the news stalls.<br><br>In Germany philosophic discourse tends to have a slightly different character I would say, but is still going pretty strong. Apart from being a school subject, I lived in the Kant street. One of my favorite night clubs was called the "Voltaire" (it was pretty seedy) and we would read e.g. Nietzsche to each other on our holidays (sometimes in funny voices). I would get some philosophical book as present quite often (even though I did not get much of a kick out of the modern stuff past Popper). We do have some "public intellectuals" who have some background in philosophy and get some air time, but mostly it is discussions with friends and family for me.<br><br>@Armata<br><br>Thanks for that last comment - I have to agree. I've recently come across an interesting episode in the series of "keeping in touch with the out of touch (elite)". Even though I'd probably still identify as liberal I think we'd both share a dislike in many points regarding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ignatieff#Notable_political_stances<br><br>Here is his take on "the counter-revolution". After reading more about his background I have to say I am much more at peace with certain currents of liberalism encountering stiff resistance. <br><br>Re Le Pen &amp; EURO<br>I don't want to derail things, but let me state that the EURO was indeed intended as a weapon (but against Germany, to protect France). If Germany has become successful in spite of the EURO, what would you propose to reign in Germany? Sure, protectionism is an option to which Germany is exposed - but try to think it through from all the different European (or Asian) perspectives. And what do you do then? Also, once you play that card, you can't threaten with it anymore. <br>It better be something more effective than the EU is. By the way are you aware that parts of the Polish, and the majority of Dutch land warfare forces are integrated into the German command? This is happening outside the EU and of course in mutual agreement.<br><br>As for Germany forcing things on countries through the EU: I'd like to point out that the entire EU budget is around 150 bn (1% of GNI). The US Superstate (which also has variation among its states) runs a yearly DEFICIT of 3 times that, and throws around 3250 bn!<br><br>How much leverage does that give the Gottkanzlerin Merkel (also note that the German population is significantly underrepresented politically in the EU compared to small countries)? What exactly are the EEuropean countries _forced_ to do? And how is that exclusively due to Germany? <br><br>I can agree with a lot of the things in your last paragraph, but neither do I currently see Le Pen with significant chances, nor do I see her being able to do anything direct and positive about the internal problems of France. Le Pen would not let the necessary jolt go through France that would be required to rekindle the _will_ to fundamentally address the situation. I live in a very multicultural spot in France, and most of the problems (of which _some_ are also connected to immigration or lack of assimilation/integration) won't be fixed. They have more to do with tolerance of inefficiency and failure in my opinion - particularly the economic and security aspects.<br><br><a href=#c5114244762545166268 title="comment permalink">2/11/17, 9:02 AM</a><br><br>

It is very hard to find a diiscussion on philosophy that is not a advertisement for any one "brand" and that is presented in a way that can be taken in by those of us who "don't speak the language', much. :) I am interested in seeing how your view as a moderate Burkean conservative, overlaps with your messages here and in your books, and particularly as a practicing Druid teacher of us all. I guess you will get there in time.<br><br>Finally, you mention that there are more than two different cultures and attendant philosophies in America. I just read Colin Woodard's American Nations and found it fascinating. He describes 11 "nations", or cultures really, with their attendant philosophies, laid out geographically across the U.S. and neighboring and continuous Canada and Mexico. I am wondering what your view of his take on the American cultures is, their longevity and how they are playing in the Transition and current politics. One note: As a native of WI, MN and MI (but living most of the last 40 years in OR and WA) I feel the upper Great Lakes states would rightly be Midland, not Yankeedom, and feel the recent election proves this as they can swing like any of the rest of the Midland "nation". It is also fascinating to see how he outlines each and shows that state boundaries are largely irrelevant to culture/philosophy. And that the cultures are persistent in the face of in migration over time. Best, Kate<br><br><a href=#c7570921958140947028 title="comment permalink">2/11/17, 10:03 AM</a><br><br>

Only humans, Descartes argued, partake of God to the extent that they have souls. Even animals, though they seem to feel pain, are soul-less machines...<br><br>"By splitting reality into human consciousness and an unfeeling, objective, "extensive" world that could be measured mathematically, Descartes paved the way for a scientific investigation of nature constructed according to the mathematical laws of God. <br><br>"'God sets up laws in nature just as a king sets up laws in his kingdom' wrote Descartes. A kind of Cartesian licence gave precedence to matter over form, body over soul, outward spatially extended nature over inner awareness. Matter, body and nature could - unlike thought or feeling - be quantified, examined, and ultimately understood by mathematical physics. <br><br>"This Cartesian license permitted the human intellect, through science, to enter a thousand different realms, from the very small to the very large, and even the invisible. The blueprint underlying the great mechanism of the cosmos was thought decipherable... <br><br>"Flashing the Cartesian permit to practice science did yield results. Investigators returned the Bible and the classic books to their dusty shelves. Instead, they read Nature, 'written' as Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) had put it (even before Descartes), 'in a great book which is always open before our eyes'...<br><br>"To this day, the Cartesian permit rallies scientists to study a universe that is wide open for investigation, but in the 'fine print' is found the exception *[the conscious human soul]* - which, in Descartes' time was unquestionably made in God's image. Moreover, the Cartesian permit contains in the fine print this assumption *[the universe is mechanical and set up according to immutable laws]*... <br><br>"At the heart of the Cartesian philosophy are thus metaphysical presuppositions, springing from the culture that gave rise to science.<br><br>"Ultimately - in our very abbreviated story - the Cartesian licence proves to be a kind of forgery. After three centuries of implicit renewal, the licence is still accepted even though the fine print, erased or ignored, is no longer visible at any magnification. Yet this fine print was not incidental. It was the raison d'être, the rational basis authorizing scientists following the spirit of Descartes to proceed with their work and to receive the blessings of society, if not always the Church. The Cartesian view of the cosmos as machine is at the very root of the practice of science."<br><br><a href=#c5373676499195052456 title="comment permalink">2/11/17, 2:06 PM</a><br><br>

One thing I never understood about your philosophy is that, on the one hand, peak oil and climate change (and the decline of civilization in general) presupposes an objective outside world which is indifferent to man, but on the other hand, you seem to like "subjectivist" philosophies according to which the world is a representation of consciousness, which in my mind is associated more with New Age people who claim that "if I believe it, it must be real" and since they believe in affluence, well... <br><br>My personal philosophy, or perhaps I should say instinctive philosophy, is a kind of combination of naive realism and naive Platonism, where both the material world and the "Forms" or "Ideas" are equally objectively real. I would even argue that, say, the color red is objectively real, at least in some sense. I mean, it´s *there*, right? If its there, how can it not be real? ;-) <br><br>Is the subjectivist part of your philosophy somehow connected to your magical practice? But aren´t the "gods" also objectively real? Unless I´m mistaken, you don´t see them as sheer projections of the human mind (archetypes and so on). It will be interesting to see where you belive the representations originally come from.

Our society and culture as a whole has not done so, and this is one reason why science and religion in general seem to be stuck in some very old patterns.<br><br>I do not pretend to understand Kant in any depth, but what seems to me to be the most promising, yet mostly neglected, response is the tradition of radical empiricism (William James. et al).<br><br>Nancy Frankenberry, in "Religion and Radical Empiricism": "...radical empiricism involves an important inversion of Kant’s philosophy…For Kant, the world emerged from the subject; for radical empiricism, the subject emerges from the world.”<br><br>Radical empiricist Bernard Meland said this in his book "Fallible Forms &amp; Symbols":<br>“Much of the meaning we appear to find in life, we bring to it, as Kant observed, through our own forms of sensibility and understanding. But, as James and Bergson were later to remark, countering the stance of Kant and Hume in one basic respect, the nexus of relationships that forms our existence is not projected, it is given. We do not create these relationships; we experience them, being given with existence." [the reason we can't make the coffee cup sprout wings and fly]<br><br>P.S.

I love the description of it as an overdetermined outcome. The professionalization of teaching philosophy definitely played a role. The post-modern ideas that all words are tools to exert power over others have had a serious chilling effect on philosophy. People don't hear ideas any more. They hear agendas. <br><br>And you are dancing some of the issues most interesting to me. Somehow, the human mind with all its distorted representations is able to make accounts of the world that provide breathtaking accuracy (easily 1 part in 10^7 in many areas of chemistry and atomic physics and sometimes billions of times better than this.) and allow us to understand when this kind of accuracy is to be expected and when we have a complex system for which prediction will be much harder. I think the interesting issue is not with philosophical questions about representation. The human mind is able to represent simple things with sufficient accuracy that the behavior of the thing as it is can be reliably predicted without practically important artifacts from distorted representations. The interesting issue is why most questions that actually matter (take human effects on our ecosystem for example) are far too complex to address using the simple accounts that science and observation provide. So our problem is not need for better philosophy. Instead we need to be able to appreciate the extreme complexity of any system involving a human and build our epistemological modesty on the foundation of chaotic unpredictability rather than on fundamental problems in representing simple systems.<br><br><a href=#c2767492832066096394 title="comment permalink">2/11/17, 7:38 PM</a><br><br>

It seems that countries around the world are entering into a period of electoral authoritarianism as a reaction to the shortcomings of the neoliberal agenda vis a vis the bottom 80% of every country where neoliberal policies have been tried.

As for the usefulness of epistemology, it's precisely because too many people have rushed past the hard questions of what we can know and hurried on to the business of trying to bully other people into doing what you want them to -- which is of course what moral philosophy has become these days -- that the arguments of moral philosophy and religion have lost so much of their force in the last century or so. <br><br>Ray, we'll be talking at quite some length about Nietzsche, power, and morality as we proceed. I suppose you could say that one of his problems is that he stopped being a midwife to ideas and tried to give birth to them himself, without getting anyone to assist him -- and then had one turn sideways on him. <br><br>Cherokee, oh, for most practical purposes Conan's philosophy is eminently sound. Its one weakness is that assuming that what you see is what there is can leave you unpleasantly vulnerable to illusions cast by Thoth-Amon and his modern Brooks Brothers-suited equivalents. Thank you for asking about Sara's health! My writing time comes second to her needs, though, so it's not an issue. <br><br>Onething, which of Nietzsche's books did you read? I recommend starting out with one of the earlier books of essays such as <i>Human, All Too Human</i>, and reading a little at a time -- while using the bathroom or waiting for the bus, for example. It can take a while to get into the flow of his thought. <br><br>Scotlyn, it's absolutely standard for professional castes to come up with an impenetrable jargon to keep outsiders at bay. Philosophers took longer to get around to it than others, because until fairly recently most philosophers made their livings as authors, selling to the general reading public, and so had to write in a way their audiences could follow. It's only since most of them became tenured academics that they've been freed from that burden and allowed to come up with a jargon of their own. <br><br>Robert, thanks for the correction! I haven't read that book of Albanese's, though her earlier book on nature religion is on my ecology bookshelf to this day. <br><br>MizBean, <i>Caudillo</i> is such a grand old word -- and it really does sum up the current head of state of our Republica de los Bananas quite well. Thank you. <br><br>Karen, I'm going to try to keep everything in plain English. If you have questions about any word I use, please post the question so I can answer it right here. <br><br>Kate, thank you. Yes, I'll get there, though it's going to take some time -- starting from what we can actually know, we're going to proceed to some of the things people think they know and don't, and in due time talk about the explosive political implications of limits to knowledge in a world where so many people insist that they know the unvarnished truth. It should be quite a ride. <br><br>I haven't read Woodard's book, but there have been books on that theme for a while, and it's a valid way of making sense of the country. This is why a federal system allowing each state to pursue its own social policies is so essential!<br><br><a href=#c4564906458767372178 title="comment permalink">2/11/17, 11:27 PM</a><br><br>

It's tolerably common for mental health issues to mess up the process of representation, and I can well imagine that having to grapple with those challenges would have given you a very close look at the process. <br><br>Hubertus, I believe you're misquoting me. I said that Tyson dismissed philosophy as useless. <a href=http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-neil-degrasse-tyson-returns-again/ rel=nofollow>Here's a podcast where he did so</a>. Next question? <br><br>Scotlyn, good. Yes, and they're quite right to point to the "Cartesian permit" as the foundation of modern science. It's exactly the exclusion of subjective experience from science that makes it so powerful -- and so limited. <br><br>Tidlösa, er, did you read the part of my post where I specifically critiqued the New Age claims you've attributed to me? It's really rather vexing, you know, when I write something in so many words and even an intelligent reader like you slides right on by it and pretends that I didn't say anything of the kind. <br><br>Phil, stay tuned! <br><br>Gottfried, if something's "given," who or what does the giving? <br><br>Maxine, understood! It's the one thing about Stoicism that doesn't interest me, either. Given a choice between a life full of pleasure and pain, and a life without either, I'd take the first without a moment's hesitation -- yes, even knowing that the choice means I've given up the right to whine about the pain. <br><br>Gel, fair enough. I don't find either radical empiricism or subjectivism convincing, because "the world" and "the subject" define each other; each is what the other isn't, and so both emerge out of the primal act of representation, the one each of us makes when we say the word "I." As for Ken Freeman's class, why, yes, I did -- "The Fly in the Flybottle" and "Awareness through the Body" both. <br><br>Unknown Warren, I'll see if I can make time for that. <br><br>Davidm58, okay, this is two people mentioning Fairhaven professor Ken Freeman on the same day, when I don't think I've encountered his name at any time in the last ten years. Jung would be turning down the volume on his synchronicity meter by now! The rhyme is most funny, though.<br><br>Ganv, if you don't find the issues I'm discussing interesting, why, nobody's forcing you to read them, you know. <br><br>Grebulocities, I don't know of a simple means of doing so. The best guess I've come up with so far is to learn as much as possible about the personalities of past dictators, and worry much more about the intense, ideologically obsessed Hitlers than the pompous and posturing Mussolinis. <br><br>John, fascinating.

(And in some schools of philosophy, it would appear that the mind is only remembering that which was always there.) <br><br>If you accept the premise underlying this question, it would follow that the human mind operates -- inasmuch as it is limited by -- accounting for the forms of reality that it "re-presents as given", however incomplete that may be. <br><br>To answer the original question succinctly, I do not have a definitive answer and may never have one.

But as you, JMG, comment, it is good to hear people talking about such a crucial point.<br> <br>I found the Alexander article riveting. The phenomenon is not confined to the USA, (Britain is pretty weird) but the USA looks like an outlier. There might be a connection with philosophy. Perhaps this and related phenomena emerge from Descartes’ world? What these days we call ‘information’ has ‘emergent’ outcomes – consequences indeed. Perhaps Americans have become uniquely ill-informed? One could guess that as ‘information’ inflates, so must the American mind become increasingly badly informed – positive feedback? We end up, for instance, with those rows of toothpastes? What happens when you recognise a particular brand? What distance does it put you from your fellow human being or from the original toothbrush? Is it just that America is further down the track than most other ‘advanced’ countries?<br><br>Did Descartes invent the basis of ‘Progress’? On the other hand, might this be old stuff in new guise. At the macro level it is as if we see a need for a new and better class of Pyramid, or perhaps if having judged we need a Totem then of course it would be better if we got 10 more just in case? (I have nothing inherently against a few Totems in the right time and place. Philosophically what are Pyramids and Totems; are they just ‘faith’ items? I shouldn’t ask; it’s a bit like asking what the Garden of Eden might be, or even the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.)<br><br>I am referring as usual these days to Alasdair MacIntyre’s <i>‘After Virtue’</i>. He takes apart the belief in managerial expertise (and social sciences) and puts up Nietzsche as ‘the’ guy who shows up Kant’s intellectually powerful yet inadequate rationality. (“… new secular rational foundations for morality…” aka the Enlightenment project - Kant failed). Then in the end though, Nietzsche goes down.

I would have thought that the homeless people would have better sleeping bags and boxes if they were, but beliefs may vary wildly. Anyway, I looked the guy up who made that claim and wow he's lead an elite life and I wondered if he'd ever left that bubble world that he lives in? If he had he might have had the unusual experience of being assaulted by a homeless person like I was one day a few months back. Unfortunately for the homeless dude he hadn't realised that I had done many years of karate and I clopped him hard in the sternum before the experience went any further. It was a satisfying experience to feel my knuckles hitting bone and also a good lesson for the homeless dude not to under estimate ones opponent. I was pretty grumpy about that, but I do like to nip problems in the bud before they escalate.<br><br>Anyway, my thinking is that the bubble politician has made the mistake of believing his own spells - a potentially fatal error for a mage.<br><br>Ha!

We do not create these relationships; we experience them, being given with existence. And from this matrix come resources of grace that can carry us beyond the meanings of our own making..."<br><br>I understand that the "resources of grace" is also an interpretation, but I do think it is a great point about "the nexus of relationships that forms our existence." I believe this nexus of relationships play a large part in influencing how we interpret, and that there is something "more" happening in this nexus of relationships and datum of experience than we are able to articulate via our socially mediated sign-systems.<br><br><a href=#c4063618170825904295 title="comment permalink">2/12/17, 1:55 PM</a><br><br>

Tonight's particular episode dealt with the rise of cosplay in China and its increasing market presence. I found myself wondering about the nature of cosplayers' worlds, the inner lives of the fans, and the nature of story in all of this.<br><br>Now, certainly, story fills a role in society. We've had legends for as long as we've had people. And there are always those whose role is to tell those tales and sing those songs. But there was also an element of something else in this modern equivalent, mirrored no doubt in our culture as well, of sliding away from this world of experience in order to reside wholly within the realm of story. Am I being over judgmental? I cannot tell. Part of me looks at online and cosplay and similar fandoms as modern equivalents of troubadours' tales; but there is another part of me that sees a hollowing out of ourselves as we "upload" our lives to the internet.<br><br>What is the nature of representation in this case?

Sure, your debt and its interest are now 10% less. But it also means that foreign companies trying to buy companies in your country get a 10% discount, foreign companies get a 10% discount on your labor, imports are 10% more expensive, and that includes imports for the raw materials or semi-finished goods that your local companies need.<br><br>Devalution is an opportunity to get a bit of breathing room, but not a substitute for long-term economic development. As it is, the ECB is finally allowed to do what any other central bank does - threatening creditors with devaluation if they get too speculative. That's enough to stabilize the debt payments. An increase of investment support will only happen through policies that aim for cooperative rather than adversarial relations.<br><br>Germany used to be the sick man of Europe until very recently, economically. It's not the euro that revived them, but the cuts in the wages of their own workforce. Every other European country had to compete with that regardless of the existence of the eurozone or not. So it's better to strive for an economic policy that prevents destructive competition like that and instead forms a unified front against the speculative market forces.<br><br><a href=#c4847899630983452419 title="comment permalink">2/12/17, 4:58 PM</a><br><br>

Hmm...<br><br>Tidlösa, but I'm not proposing a subjectivist metaphysics. I've made no metaphysical proposals at all -- that is, no proposals about what "really exists."

You're definitely sounding like a Robert E. Howard character now! ;-)<br><br>Glenn, fair enough; I'll put it on the get-to list.<br><br>Davidm58, to some extent I think it's a matter of emphasis; the model I'm borrowing from Schopenhauer et al. focuses on what has to exist in order for those relationships to be part of the world you experience, and to my mind that makes it easier to ask hard questions about how much of those relationships, and the value judgments that inevitably accompany them, are "out there," and how much are constituted by the experiencing mind. As we'll see, that's a matter of some importance. <br><br>Lewis and Inohuri, funny.

I think part of it's the simple fact that life in a modern industrial society is so miserably unsatisfying for so many people that they're desperate for anything that looks like an alternative -- thus the explosive growth in reenactment societies, cosplay, etc. <br><br>Onething, I suspect part of the difference is that the people who translate Asian philosophical classics know that it's part of their job to make the text as easy as possible to read and understand, while too many works of Western philosophy seem to have been translated by people who had the opposite ideal in mind. I'm surprised that you found <i>Beyond Good and Evil</i> opaque, though; that was the book that convinced me that what Nietzsche has to say really, seriously needs to be heard today. Some of the argument of this sequence of posts will derive from that book; I'll see if I can keep things as clear as possible -- and if you have trouble following me, let me know and we can try to find a clearer language in which to discuss the points Nietzsche makes.<br><br><a href=#c3606461777330699742 title="comment permalink">2/12/17, 7:31 PM</a><br><br>

I am guessing that everything, and I mean everything, that we experience in our lives is a representation in one form or another. What we see, hear, smell, taste and touch as well as any other sensory perceptions that there may be is still an abstracted representation. And with the same feeling of walking up a plank onto a ship that I have just realized that is not there, I think that I can see the next logical conclusion.<br><br> This must also apply then to what we perceive to be our own "inner" self. In fact how the damn hell do we really know what "we" really are? There must be something there to ask the question in the first place but I am beginning to realise that we are only really perceiving our true selves through the same sort of representations as we do the outer world. And that means that on a deep level, we can never really know what or who we are as we are still looking though that same window. This is starting to remind me of a passage from an old 1940 sci-fi story by Robert Heinlein and I quote:<br><br> "Man lives in a world of ideas. Any phenomenon is so complex that he cannot possibly grasp the whole of it. He abstracts certain certain characteristics of a given phenomenon as an idea, then represents that idea as a symbol, be it a word or a mathematical sign. Human reaction is almost entirely reaction to symbols, and only negligibly to phenomena. As a matter of fact, it can be demonstrated that the human mind can think only in terms of symbols.<br><br> When we think, we let symbols operate on other symbols in certain, set fashions - rules of logic, or rules of mathematics. If the symbols have been abstracted so that they are structurally similar to the phenomena they stand for, and if the symbol operations are similar in structure and order to the operations of phenomena in the real world, we think sanely. If our logic-mathematics, or our world-symbols have been poorly chosen, we think, not sanely."<br><br> My take on that all this is that perhaps using functionality to parse what we perceive may not be the worse that we can do. If I see coffee, I can enjoy it's taste. It may be "an intricate matrix of quantum probability fields and ripples in space-time" or it may be flavoured water but I still enjoy a good cuppa. On the same token, if I see a leopard in the wild I have the classic choice of fight or flight. Either way, the survival instinct kicks in and it has that name for a reason. In other words, if teach ourselves to have our perceptions match the real world as do our actions in relation to it, then it is a start. Not exactly ground-breaking but it has surprising utility. e.g. "I didn't get my way - this is a total disaster!" No, something happened that I did not expect. If I can't change it, I must learn to live with it.<br><br><a href=#c8322240933922778725 title="comment permalink">2/12/17, 8:32 PM</a><br><br>

Reading source books where a particular philosopher works on their feild of interest is, I think, a better approach. Philosophy has much in common with the occult. A book that tried to introduce you to, all the topics that could be labled 'occult' is going to suffer from ADHD. Similarly Philosophy is not an ology.<br><br>Nietzsche and Plato are to good places to start for virtue of their skillful prose at least. Professor Trelogan, when I was a schoolboy, told me that he dedicated all of his 100 and 200 level classes to teaching reading comprehension, because the vast majority of College students he received since the mid 90's did not have sufficient reading skills for studying most texts in philosophy.<br><br>Western philosophy is often a bit tweeked by our cultures emphasis on creeds, and "philosophies" are often read, and even written, as though they were creeds and the argumentation to defend that creed. It takes very cold reading to appreciate the jewels that shine regardless of the correctness of the 'philosophy'.<br><br>I think that the Death of Socrates arc by Plato is a great place to start, because the imagery and pathos of Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, and Phaedo is extremely deep in the culture of western philosophy. It is a myth that flows through western philosophy, and each book is filled with great and accessible thoughts to chew on. Very easy to start chewing, very hard to swallow... perfect starting material. I am most fond of Plato's Symposium, because it is about Socrates crashing a drinking party and starting conversation that was too deep for the wine, plus it has some of the thoughts from Plato that I have longest chewed. The Republic is the next text in the essential Plato I need to mention, but it is more difficult to read I think, and there are layers of irony going on that are easy to muddle - again it is a text to chew, but not to swallow - rubes dreaming of creating The Republic for reals are the runner ups to Hegelians for fracking up history. Finally from Plato I think that Ion and Meno are both good dialogues for beginners to chew on.. they quickly present very interesting ideas to chew over.<br><br>Spinoza's ethics is another top read. The style of writing is a bit tricky at first, but he writes with remarkable clarity, and his thought are as fresh as a parsley sprig. You have to become accustomed to learning to read a philosopher in accordance with their idiomatic ways of wording, and this is made particularly explicit by Spinoza, such that 'Ethics' will engender that skill nicely.<br><br>For Nietzsche, I am a fanboy for Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but unless you are generally familure with Nietzsche it is a hard road to hoe... though if you want the challenge then please just remember to read it as a work of fiction about a fictional philosopher / prophet Zarathustra who is most certainly not one Fredric Wilhelm Nietzsche, though they have both chewed on smiler matters. If you read it please consider how Zarathustra changes over the book as being at very least as important as any *creed* he seems to declare at any particular point in the plot of his transforming. Of Nietzsche's non-fiction I think 'Human all to Human' or 'The Gay Science' are both very interesting pieces to chew on... you can easily get your teeth around them, even if there are parts that you might be hesitant to swallow.<br><br><a href=#c3540378269734326205 title="comment permalink">2/12/17, 8:36 PM</a><br><br>

I haven't read this book, published in 1999. <br><br>I did however read "Bottleneck - Our human interface with reality: The disturbing and exciting implications of its true nature" by Richard Epworth, published sometime after 2010. Epworth has described the limits of the maximum rate we can learn completely new information as being no more that a few tens of bits per second. Its probably much less than 10 on average, given our longer term concentration and attention spans. Epworth is a clever and creative engineer, much interested in our visual systems, whose surface information inputs are something like a few 100 million times higher, than what we can record. All those high-def digital movies we may watch get reduced to a few tiny bits of a story board in our heads, with not as much definition as the original sketch story board! <br><br>My mature and detailed science grounding was in medicine. Biology and evolution have provided us with specializations of neurones for sense, and signalling to and from the body, and vast assemblies of them for mapping, transduction and reflection in the brain. These are always operating at a high metabolic rate. Their architecture for processing for the benefit of the animal is a life-long investment. Making or changing structure of connections and making new nuerones and connections is a slow, and costly process, compared to the rapidity at which reality may suddenly impact the survival of the organism.<br><br>The purpose of the input systems, is to filter out all the stuff we already recognize, that map to our pre-learned architectures, and register what is new, especially what might be important to survival. What is new maybe has direct hot-wiring to our attention and fear centers.<br><br>In terms of whole architectures of connected representation and imaginings, it is much easier to try and incorporate or re-jig existing setup, than to start again from scratch. We grow representations and belief systems in a lifetime, rather like evolution develops species. Multiple co-existing parallel paths and representations are physically difficult, hence so many optical illusions.<br><br><br><a href=#c5900786654938280542 title="comment permalink">2/12/17, 9:54 PM</a><br><br>

Or perhaps, a peculiarly Christian-flavoured heresy. <br><br>This helps make sense, to me, of, for example, the entirely religious sense of awe with which Dawkins glories in the "immortal" nature of the selfish gene.<br><br>What Christianity (in certain versions which led to Descartes, and creationism, at least) and rational materialism share is a belief in the mechanistic nature of the universe, and the reason rational materialism fails in arguments against creationism is that "mechanisms" are "made" - ie created. <br><br>What I think Margulis, McClintock, Shapiro, and even Darwin discover is the embeddedness of all living things into @Davidm58's "nexus of relationships" into which each is born.

However, he covers the main schools of Western philosophical thought from the ancient greeks to Nietszche and does an excellent job of explaining terms and unpacking complicated concepts. He also does a good job of weaving all of this into the historical context and tracing through how earlier philosophies influenced later ones. <br><br>Even better, it's available for free and it is very readable with little jokes and asides sprinkled through it. So, I would recommend it as a useful book to form the beginnings of a mental scaffold of Western philosophy.<br><br><br><a href=#c2561299858426642045 title="comment permalink">2/13/17, 8:16 AM</a><br><br>

Joe is an actor. He is highly in demand at the local theaters (which are volunteer organizations). He is the guy they call up at the last minute when another actor has caught the flu. I last saw him perform as the male lead in 'Sylvia'. Ninety percent of the time when I run into Joe, it's at the gas station he makes his income at (the other ten percent is at the theater we have season tickets for). But it would be stupid to say his career is 'gas station attendant', even though he's worked there for as long as I've known him. His career is 'actor.'<br><br>That is, if the desire is for philosophy, by all means study philosophy (though don't take on debt for it), make a career of it, but find another income source. I suggest as well that a local home school co-op might be well inclined to pay a philosopher to teach a class, though that would be more along the lines of pay for new tires money than all living expenses over the semester!<br><br><a href=#c1868916154132175372 title="comment permalink">2/13/17, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

(So it seems to me).<br><br>In more concrete terms, if Chris of Cimmeria encounters a beggar at the city gates, and perceives the beggar's intent to importune him, and if the Cimmerian reacts with a physical gesture intended to put a decisive end to such importunement, is this not a true account of the mutual engagement of these two experiencing agents, notwithstanding that the media of exchange were physical bodies which are representations?<br><br><a href=#c5714957460723449549 title="comment permalink">2/13/17, 10:06 AM</a><br><br>

Reading through a couple of chapters each month, using the exercises in the book, discussing what we can do in our own lives, share ideas, and then go home and do it and share what we are working on online. I was going to list it on Meetup.com to draw in the permaculturists, homesteaders and other eco-minded outside of my group of friends Meet-up.com charges $9.99 - $14.99 a month to host a meet-up so I'm going to have to charge people something to cover the cost of the group and cover any photocopies and other materials. Does this sound alright to you? Do you want me to email you off-list? I'd be happy to share what we are doing with others who would like to do the same, through a group conference call each month. <br><br>I'm calling it a class because it is focused on actions, not just the sharing of what is talked about here or in the books. I have a permaculture design certificate and every time I think about running a PDC course, I get discouraged. It's so conceptual and one can only use it if you have land to do things on. And it requires lots of sometimes back breaking work to do the land improvements. I've done them on my property and its disappointing when they don't work out the way they are said to work. <br><br>I feel that there is a momentum to working in-person with people that just can't be replicated online.

It was such a fun book. Mr Howard went through some dark times though and was also perhaps a difficult person. <br><br>Seriously though, the guy tried to grab me with both of his arms and he was clearly on something. As a quick story, I actually trained in karate for many years because I had to learn how to fight. I did my first two years of High School at a very hippy dippy alternative school and then because of disciplinary problems my mum then transferred me to a more English than the English all boys private school for the remainder of my High School. There was a little bit of culture shock involved with that! I can handle that, but what was interesting was just how aggressive that new culture was that I suddenly found myself in. And the kids organised fights after school, and let's put it this way, I was fresh meat. So, me being me, I spent a lot of my hard won paper round money on lessons for many years at the local dojo. And here is the weird thing, I won one of the organised fights and combined with the karate lessons, I must have carried myself differently and was suddenly no longer required to fight. Such a weird culture that one and I always laugh when people tell me how nice kids are. They're not nice, they're little animals and I would be hard to convince otherwise.<br><br>Anyway, the other thing that was not lost on me was that a person can learn to fight so that they don't have to fight. I've read that psychopaths can pick their victims just by the way that they carry themselves and I have no doubts that that is true.<br><br>Just an interesting side story.<br><br>I reckon philosophy is missing out not considering stories as most cultures tell stories. I wonder why stories have been largely ignored?<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c406449559740812009 title="comment permalink">2/13/17, 1:07 PM</a><br><br>

( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/massimo-pigliucci/neil-degrasse-tyson-and-the-value-of-philosophy_b_5330216.html ) That one was helpful. The podcast was too incomprehensible for me. Reading was better so. Also the message could sink in more deeply. The comment and explanatory of Massimo Pigliucci also added to my understanding.<br><br>Now I can reflect about some observations.<br><br>In his science shows Neil de Grasse is quite vividly explaining how things in the stars mechanic do function. Astonishingly he doesn’t pronounce clearly and distinctly in his diatribes towards present day science. He keeps being very vague. Uttering general disapprovals, which leave it up to the listeners fantasy, what he really might mean?<br><br>I suppose, that was the reason, why I, with me many times watching his presentations, didn’t get the critique of philosophy. Lacking precision and specification, that is contradictory to his usual presentation about his point of views.<br><br>That got me speculating! Why does he do so? I have got an idea!<br><br>There is Harald Lesch, a likewise public scientist here in Germany. But he is having a different approach to philosophy and religion. In particular at one point he is announcing of having pain about one scientific field. Due to its, lets say philosophical vagueness. Interestingly that field does happen to be quantum mechanics.<br><br>Harald Lesch is saying, that quantum mechanics has become speculative to such an extent, its been on the verge of not being scientific. Because the physicists, came up with many ideas, how the universe and everything is functioning, Its rather evolving mathematically only. Being so speculative, however its not any more empirically verifiable. Pure speculations quantum mechanics tends to become. No reality-check. No evaluation. What a phantasm-orgasm!<br><br>To close my point, in this of Neil de Grasse highly regarded field of science, his beloved quantum mechanics, there is such widespread use of speculation and vagueness. That does look to me just suspiciously, why he might so much despise of philosophy. He has entered the limits of his wisdom. Maybe, he is just subconsciously arguing against himself. Having outsourced his retrospective by painting a devil on the wall he is now shouting at. Scapegoating is a age old strategy to get rid on ones faults, by blaming others.<br><br><a href=#c8118385669580184956 title="comment permalink">2/13/17, 1:07 PM</a><br><br>

Our first bus would arrive at the central bus station in San Jose, Costa Rica, which was a busy place, and our path to the second bus traversed the Mercado Central - a huge bazaar type market with hundreds of stall holders(still one of my favourite places to poke around in). <br><br>Well, tolerably often, we being young, female and fair, some fella would loom in, wanting to "cop a feel" or have a grope. I learned quickly to deny satisfaction to any such importunants. It was a knack of being able to move lightly, step aside or duck more quickly than expected, or the strategic use of an elbow or knee, or umbrella or schoolbag, and of putting the face in "back off" mode. Keep in mind I was protecting myself and my sisters, and I effectively learned to do it. <br><br>I suppose I learned a way of projecting a sort of determined force field around us and it seemed to have real effects sometimes - you could see people doubletake or step back.<br><br>Another thing that helped, I think, was that when travelling on the buses, I liked to stand, and practice a way of establishing a link between my feet, through the bus's unsteady floor to the earth's force - hard to describe, but I was able to keep my feet however the bus lurched. (Possibly the closest I ever got to surfing).<br><br>It seems to me that I have lived a charmed life since, in that no one has ever lifted a hand to me since that time. Perhaps some of those childhood learnings stuck. However, I was doubly fortunate in that, at no time did anyone I cared about ever trespass on my trust in that way, before or since. <br><br>I did Aikido in my 20's and figured that the most important thing I learned there was to fall [and get up again, and again], and Tai Chi in my 40's and 50's which has helped me keep my balance and move from my centre. <br><br>I do try to teach the kids I know, especially the girls I know, some of this. "How to stand" - sounds easy, right? I am fairly certain that very few people know how to stand up as if their feet were really connecting to the floor. You can toss them with a finger.<br><br>A barbarian, especially of the female kind, is going to have to know how to carry her body through the world as if she were a tiger, and not to be messed with.

Considering that a character is roughly a byte (256 possibilities) and that a good typist can belt out 40 WPM, with an average (English) word length of 4.5 characters, that means that a good typist can spit out information faster than a person can really absorb it. It's true though, you can watch a movie in 1080p and be exposed to a megabyte per second of information but later sum an hour of TV up in a few sentences. Of course, most people would rather watch an hour of TV than hear a few sentences. There's something to be learned from that rather than mocked.<br><br>Marcus Aurelius said that wine is just grape juice, which is of course true, but it's also true that wine is soil, sun and culture and nice evenings with close friends. JMG is of course correct when he talks about TV, video games, etc as dancing pixels on glass screens, but the essential human needs that video games partially fulfill are worth talking about.

Like, say, if it comes out that the person's soul shall be required of them within a couple of months, then to be cured of scrofula may open them up to a more violent, uglier end when scrofula may lead them to a comfortable, well-cared end with the sufferer ready to go when their time comes. Would said God be a false God? Hardly, I would say, because in this case the freedom to withhold the cure would be for the best in this case.<br><br><a href=#c7825527838127827790 title="comment permalink">2/14/17, 11:53 PM</a><br><br>

I've been pondering differences between deities who "beget" the world and those who "make" it. I could use more high-faluting terms like "generating" v "fabricàting", but the phrase in the creed (oft repeated in my childhood) describing Christ as Son of the Father, "begotten not made" always resonated with me and is producing much insight for me just now. <br><br>It seems to me when you beget (includes giving birth, but not at all limited to it) you surrender or cede control of the future to whatever comes, including the actions of as yet unknown others (and it so happens that sometimes the children of a deity are that deity's nemesis). In a world begotten of such a deity there is great freedom of action. <br><br>Whereas when a deity "makes" a world, they cede nothing, the world is their artifact, their thing, and they can impose upon it whatever conditions and meanings they wish. <br><br>Reflecting back upon my evangelical born-again Christian<br>upbringing, I think this was the tension too far for me. That I had the "freedom" to choose my "maker" (even if your "maker" made *your* life a living hell - per Job) did not feel like freedom at all. Whereas a "father" is someone you can honour, or not, and how he has treated you will have a bearing on what you choose, but will not determine or constrain it. <br><br>As to human birth and human (chorionic) pregnancy it is an unusually demanding process, even compared to that of other mammals, who can more readily and safely interrupt their own pregnancies when conditions are not suitable. A human mother gives of her very blood, bone and breath to the necessary nine-month "finishing" of the human child begotten in an initial glorious fertilisation. (Has anyone else seen the photos showing the brief burst of light emitted by the fusing sperm and egg at that moment? If not, please do Google this!) <br><br>Still, I far prefer the relaxed mammalian ability to carry baby food and baby with you on the hoof, to the mama &amp; papa birds' ceaseless scramble to find and carry enough of it to the nest to satisfy that ravening infantile hunger. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c5551962460249684378 title="comment permalink">2/15/17, 12:10 AM</a><br><br>

That may be the interpretation of the horny-handed sons of toil that Juhana spoke to, but that's only their interpretation - it doesn't make it true. In the UK the tabloid media have been running decades-long campaigns of anti-immigrant rhetoric, so it should surprise us that some of the mud sticks. But to portray this as the root of all that has gone wrong is disingenuous, to say the least.<br><br>I can't help feeling I would like to say to these people: what did you do in the eighties and nineties, when there was still a chance to maintain a tradition of working-class politics and trade union organisation? Did you vote for the Tories, who undermined trade unionism at every step, and have sought to run the NHS into the ground?<br><br>I'm sure I sound a bit bitter, and I can't deny it.

But dialogue, if made to serve the cause of courtesy would obviate the whole point of this beautifully moderated and amazingly informative comment space. <br><br>Reflecting on the kinds of comments complained of, I thought about the many times my own most honest thoughts have come across as frustration, exaggeration, hyperbole, loud, uncaring and/or insulting. Somehow the things you care about saying often do not come out in a way others care to hear. Communication is hard, and can take persistence to achieve.<br><br>To me the vast majority of comments listed as objectionable seem to have that character. Passionate, emphatic, strongly worded, but, with that, a striving to communicate a deeply held truth. <br><br>What I found signally different in the exchange between Dammerung and Unknown Deborah Bender was that Dammerung said "we will not be able to reason together". That is to say, while failing neither in courtesy nor in honesty, Dammerung effectively put an end to any possibility of dialogue between himself and Deborah. <br><br>In that context, the "blood libel" comment served simply to explain the reason further dialogue between them would be pointless. I suppose few people would expect to be able to convince someone else that their extermination is necessary. Conversely, having accepted the necessity of the other's extermination, it is equally unlikely *they* will be able to persuade the first person of its non-necessity. Thus, the kind of existential impasse is reached that no dialogue can ever break. <br><br>To me Dammerung did not breach any of the "letter" of the comment policy. Yet he breached the entirety of its spirit, if that spirit is, as I suppose it to be, about fostoring dialogue.<br><br>In summary, I support dialogue remaining first and foremost. Courtesy is nice, but, so long as there is no danger of it suppressing dialogue. <br><br>Thanks for your patience.<br><br><a href=#c5153425992153515860 title="comment permalink">2/15/17, 10:37 AM</a><br><br>

Nor do I. Nor does Juhana actually based on everything he has ever posted here (he would almost certainly point the finger at liberalism, third wave feminism and the decline of Christianity). And I would bet large sums of the money that the English people he spoke to don't believe that either. <br><br>So where is your idea that people believe immigrants to be the cause of all problems coming from? It's a narrative that comes from the left. It's not reality either. It's a strawman. <br><br>If you asked many people who express the views that Juhana's English friends have about immigration the questions you pose, many of them will tell you that they voted for Labour and considered themselves to be on the left. Many people who currently consider themselves to be on the left, who are active in unions and politics, also oppose current immigration policies. As did Marx, by the way. <br><br>No doubt there are those on the far right who feign concern for the interests of the lower paid in order to promote policies that they support based on racism. But the fact that they exist doesn't in any way imply that everyone who discusses the impact of immigration on the working classes is doing so disingenuously. <br><br>Mallow.<br><br><a href=#c5625901855044559402 title="comment permalink">2/27/17, 4:34 AM</a><br><br>

You have confused two Greek words: ethos (starting with the letter epsilon), meaning habit, and ethos (starting with the letter eta), meaning character (I don't know how to do diacritical marks or Greek letters here). Although Aristotle does talk about habit in NE, the work is mainly about character and its relation to virtue/excellence (arete) and the good life/human flourishing (eudaemonia), and character, not habits or customs, is what the title refers to. It's very misleading to say the work is mainly about achieving "personal greatness".<br><br><a href=#c9053967315826687219 title="comment permalink">3/13/17, 1:22 PM</a><br><br>

Five years of carving a beautiful, nurturing and empowering off-grid home out of the woods is over, and the next chapter is waiting for us in the Missouri Ozarks.<br><br>If you know anything of our story, my family of 4 “went to ground” on May Day 2012, to live in a big wall tent in a hole in the forest without power and running water. It was a challenging but very special time for us, and we certainly have mixed emotions about seeing it come to an end. Especially considering what a lovely stand-alone sort of place we’ve built up since then. <br><br>We have never been grid-tied but, complementing the passive solar design, we now have enough PV solar power to cover the basics, including a chest freezer and small electric clothes washer. Anyone who has ever lived off-grid will understand the importance and luxury of those two items. All off-grid equipment comes with the home. There is also now pressurized cold and hot water to a sink in the kitchen (not shown in the listing). Hot pressurized water may be the most defining characteristic of the affluent life. It’s a real boon to our existence! There are established fruit trees – plums, peaches, apples, pears, and others – multiple varieties planted for climate change resilience, and all sorts of gourmet mushrooms, prized natives, and culinary and medicinal herbs blanketing the inner zone of the property.<br><br>Here’s the link to our MLS listing if anyone here is interested-<br><br>http://www.circlepix.com/tour/titan/?id=4208140&amp;_seoAddress=440-W-Teague-Rd-Talking-Rock-GA-265961#.WMlIIlXyvIU<br><br>Cheers, everyone, and our very best to you, Mr. Greer, during your hiatus.
