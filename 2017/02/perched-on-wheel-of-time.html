<div class=MsoNormal>
There's a curious predictability in the comments I field in response to posts here that talk about the likely shape of the future. The conventional wisdom of our era insists that modern industrial society can’t possibly undergo the same life cycle of rise and fall as every other civilization in history; no, no, there’s got to be some unique future awaiting us—uniquely splendid or uniquely horrible, it doesn’t even seem to matter that much, so long as it’s unique. Since I reject that conventional wisdom, my dissent routinely fields pushback from those of my readers who embrace it. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s not surprising in the least, of course. What’s surprising is that the pushback doesn’t surface when the conventional wisdom seems to be producing accurate predictions, as it does now and then. Rather, it shows up like clockwork whenever the conventional wisdom fails. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The present situation is as good an example as any. The basis of my dissident views is the theory of cyclical history—the theory, first proposed in the early 18th century by the Italian historian Giambattista Vico and later refined and developed by such scholars as Oswald Spengler and Arnold Toynbee, that civilizations rise and fall in a predictable life cycle, regardless of scale or technological level. That theory’s not just a vague generalization, either; each of the major writers on the subject set out specific stages that appear in order, showed that these have occurred in all past civilizations, and made detailed, falsifiable predictions about how those stages can be expected to occur in our civilization. Have those panned out? So far, a good deal more often than not. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the final chapters of his second volume, for example, Spengler noted that civilizations in the stage ours was about to reach always end up racked by conflicts that pit established hierarchies against upstart demagogues who rally the disaffected and transform them into a power base. Looking at the trends visible in his own time, he sketched out the most likely form those conflicts would take in the Winter phase of our civilization. Modern representative democracy, he pointed out, has no effective defenses against corruption by wealth, and so could be expected to evolve into corporate-bureaucratic plutocracies that benefit the affluent at the expense of everyone else. Those left out in the cold by these transformations, in turn, end up backing what Spengler called Caesarism—the rise of charismatic demagogues who challenge and eventually overturn the corporate-bureaucratic order. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These demagogues needn’t come from within the excluded classes, by the way. Julius Caesar, the obvious example, came from an old upper-class Roman family and parlayed his family connections into a successful political career. Watchers of the current political scene may be interested to know that Caesar during his lifetime wasn’t the imposing figure he became in retrospect; he had a high shrill voice, his morals were remarkably flexible even by Roman standards—the scurrilous gossip of his time called him “every man’s wife and every woman’s husband”—and he spent much of his career piling up huge debts and then wriggling out from under them. Yet he became the political standardbearer for the plebeian classes, and his assassination by a conspiracy of rich Senators launched the era of civil wars that ended the rule of the old elite once and for all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus those people watching the political scene last year who knew their way around Spengler, and noticed that a rich guy had suddenly broken with the corporate-bureaucratic consensus and called for changes that would benefit the excluded classes at the expense of the affluent, wouldn’t have had to wonder what was happening, or what the likely outcome would be. It was those who insisted on linear models of history—for example, the claim that the recent ascendancy of modern liberalism counted as the onward march of progress, and therefore was by definition irreversible—who found themselves flailing wildly as history took a turn they considered unthinkable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The rise of Caesarism, by the way, has other features I haven’t mentioned. As Spengler sketches out the process, it also represents the exhaustion of ideology and its replacement by personality. Those of my readers who watched the political scene over the last few years may have noticed the way that the issues have been sidelined by sweeping claims about the supposed personal qualities of candidates. The practically content-free campaign that swept Barack Obama into the presidency in 2008—“Hope,” “Change,” and “Yes We Can” aren’t statements about issues, you know—was typical of this stage, as was the emergence of competing personality cults around the candidates in the 2016 election.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the ordinary way of things, we can expect even more of this in elections to come, with messianic hopes clustering around competing politicians until the point of absurdity is well past. These will then implode, and the political process collapse into a raw scramble for power at any cost. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s plenty more in Spengler’s characterization of the politics of the Winter phase, and all of it’s well represented in today’s headlines, but the rest can be left to those of my readers interested enough to turn the pages of <i>The Decline of the West</i> for themselves. What I’d like to discuss here is the nature of the pushback I tend to field when I point out that yet again, predictions offered by Spengler and other students of cyclic history turned out to be correct and those who dismissed them turned out to be smoking their shorts. The responses I field are as predictable as—well, the arrival of charismatic demagogues at a certain point in the Winter phase, for example—and they reveal some useful flimpses into the value, or lack of it, of our society’s thinking about the future in this turn of the wheel. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Probably the most common response I get can best be characterized as simple incantation: that is to say, the repetition of some brief summary of the conventional wisdom, usually without a shred of evidence or argument backing it up, as though the mere utterance is enough to disprove all other ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>It’s a rare week when I don’t get at least one comment along these lines, and they divide up roughly evenly between those that insist that progress will inevitably triumph over all its obstacles, on the one hand, and those that insist that modern industrial civilization will inevitably crash to ruin in a sudden cataclysmic downfall on the other. I tend to think of this as a sort of futurological fundamentalism along the lines of “pop culture said it, I believe it, that settles it,” and it’s no more useful, or for that matter interesting, than fundamentalism of any other sort. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A little less common and a little more interesting are a second class of arguments, which insist that I can’t dismiss the possibility that something might pop up out of the blue to make things different this time around. As I pointed out <a href=../../2008/10/arguments-from-ignorance.html>very early on in the history of this blog</a>, these are examples of the classic logical fallacy of <i>argumentum ad ignorantiam</i>, the argument from ignorance. They bring in some factor whose existence and relevance is unknown, and use that claim to insist that since the conventional wisdom can’t be disproved, it must be true. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Arguments from ignorance are astonishingly common these days. My readers may have noticed, for example, that every few years some new version of nuclear power gets trotted out as the answer to our species’ energy needs. From thorium fission plants to Bussard fusion reactors to helium-3 from the Moon, they all have one thing in common: nobody’s actually built a working example, and so it’s possible for their proponents to insist that their pet technology will lack the galaxy of technical and economic problems that have made every existing form of nuclear power uneconomical without gargantuan government subsidies. That’s an argument from ignorance: since we haven’t built one yet, it’s impossible to be absolutely certain that they’ll have the usual cascading cost overruns and the rest of it, and therefore their proponents can insist that those won’t happen this time. Prove them wrong!</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
More generally, it’s impressive how many people can look at the landscape of dysfunctional technology and failed promises that surrounds us today and still insist that the future won’t be like that. Most of us have learned already that upgrades on average have fewer benefits and more bugs than the programs they replace, and that products labeled “new and improved” may be new but they’re rarely improved; it’s starting to sink in that most new technologies are simply more complicated and less satisfactory ways of doing things that older technologies did at least as well at a lower cost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Try suggesting this as a general principle, though, and I promise you that plenty of people will twist themselves mentally into pretzel shapes trying to avoid the implication that progress has passed its pull date. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even so, there’s a very simple answer to all such arguments, though in the nature of such things it’s an answer that only speaks to those who aren’t too obsessively wedded to the conventional wisdom. None of the arguments from ignorance I’ve mentioned are new; all of them have been tested repeatedly by events, and they’ve failed. I’ve lost track of the number of times I’ve been told, for example, that the economic crisis du jour could lead to the sudden collapse of the global economy, or that the fashionable energy technology du jour could lead to a new era of abundant energy. No doubt they could, at least in theory, but the fact remains that they don’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It so happens that there are good reasons why they don’t, varying from case to case, but that’s actually beside the point I want to make here. This particular version of the argument from ignorance is also an example of the fallacy the old logicians called <i>petitio principii</i>, better known as “begging the question.” Imagine, by way of counterexample, that someone were to post a comment saying, “Nobody knows what the future will be like, so the future you’ve predicted is as likely as any other.” That would be open to debate, since there’s some reason to think we can in fact predict some things about the future, but at least it would follow logically from the premise. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Still, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone make that claim. Nor have I ever seen anybody claim that since nobody knows what the future will be like, say, we can’t assume that progress is going to continue.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In practice, rather, the argument from ignorance is applied to discussions of the future in a distinctly one-sided manner. Predictions based on any point of view other than the conventional wisdom of modern popular culture are dismissed with claims that it might possibly be different this time, while predictions based on the conventional wisdom of modern popular culture are spared that treatment. That’s begging the question: covertly assuming that one side of an argument must be true unless it’s disproved, and that the other side can’t be true unless it’s proved. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now in fact, a case can be made that we can in fact know quite a bit about the shape of the future, at least in its broad outlines. The heart of that case, as already noted, is the fact that certain theories about the future do in fact make accurate predictions, while others don’t. This in itself shows that history isn’t random—that there’s some structure to the flow of historical events that can be figured out by learning from the past, and that similar causes at work in similar situations will have similar outcomes. Apply that reasoning to any other set of phenomena, and you’ve got the ordinary, uncontroversial basis for the sciences. It’s only when it’s applied to the future that people balk, because it doesn’t promise them the kind of future they want. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The argument by incantation and the argument from ignorance make up most of the pushback I get. I’m pleased to say, though, that every so often I get an argument that’s considerably more original than these. One of those came in last week—tip of the archdruidical hat to DoubtingThomas—and it’s interesting enough that it deserves a detailed discussion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
DoubtingThomas began with the standard argument from ignorance, claiming that it’s always possible that something might possibly happen to disrupt the cyclic patterns of history in any given case, and therefore the cyclic theory should be dismissed no matter how many accurate predictions it scored. As we’ve already seen, this is handwaving, but let’s move on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He went on from there to argue that much of the shape of history is defined by the actions of unique individuals such as Isaac Newton, whose work sends the world careening along entirely new and unpredicted paths. Such individuals have appeared over and over again in history, he pointed out, and was kind enough to suggest that my activities here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> were, in a small way, another example of the influence of an individual on history. Given that reality, he insisted, a theory of history that didn’t take the actions of unique individuals into account was invalid. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fair enough; let’s consider that argument. Does the cyclic theory of history fail to take the actions of unique individuals into account? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here again, Oswald Spengler’s <i>The Decline of the West </i>is the go-to source, because he’s dealt with the sciences and arts to a much greater extent than other researchers into historical cycles. What he shows, with a wealth of examples drawn from the rise and fall of many different civilizations, is that the phenomenon DoubtingThomas describes <i>is a predictable part of the cycles of history</i>. In every generation, in effect, a certain number of geniuses will be born, but their upbringing, the problems that confront them, and the resources they will have available to solve those problems, are not theirs to choose. All these things are produced by the labors of other creative minds of the past and present, and are profoundly influenced by the cycles of history. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s take Isaac Newton as an example. He happened to be born just as the scientific revolution was beginning to hit its stride, but before it had found its paradigm, the set of accomplishments on which all future scientific efforts would be directly or indirectly modeled. His impressive mathematical and scientific gifts thus fastened onto the biggest unsolved problem of the time—the relationship between the physics of moving bodies sketched out by Galileo and the laws of planetary motion discovered by Kepler—and resulted in the <i>Principia Mathematica</i>, which became the paradigm for the next three hundred years or so of scientific endeavor. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Had he been born a hundred years earlier, none of those preparations would have been in place, and the Principia Mathematica wouldn’t have been possible. Given the different cultural attitudes of the century before Newton’s time, in fact, he would almost certainly become a theologian rather than a mathematician and physicist—as it was, he spent much of his career engaged in theology, a detail usually left out by the more hagiographical of his biographers—and he would be remembered today only by students of theological history. Had he been born a century later, equally, some other great scientific achievement would have provided the paradigm for emerging science—my guess is that it would have been Edmund Halley’s successful prediction of the return of the comet that bears his name—and Newton would have had the same sort of reputation that Karl Friedrich Gauss has today: famous in his field, sure, but a household name? Not a chance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes the point even more precise is that every other civilization from which adequate records survive had its own paradigmatic thinker, the figure whose achievements provided a model for the dawning age of reason and for whatever form of rational thought became that age’s principal cultural expression. In the classical world, for example, it was Pythagoras, who invented the word “philosophy” and whose mathematical discoveries gave classical rationalism its central theme, the idea of an ideal mathematical order to which the hurly-burly of the world of appearances must somehow be reduced. (Like Newton, by the way, Pythagoras was more than half a theologian; it’s a common feature of figures who fill that role.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To take the same argument to a far more modest level, what about DoubtingThomas’ claim that <i>The Archdruid Report</i> represents the act of a unique individual influencing the course of history? Here again, a glance at history shows otherwise. I’m a figure of an easily recognizable type, which shows up reliably as each civilization’s Age of Reason wanes and it begins moving toward what Spengler called the Second Religiosity, the resurgence of religion that inevitably happens in the wake of rationalism’s failure to deliver on its promises. At such times you get intellectuals who can communicate fluently on both sides of the chasm between rationalism and religion, and who put together syntheses of various kinds that reframe the legacies of the Age of Reason so that they can be taken up by emergent religious movements and preserved for the future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the classical world, for example, you got Iamblichus of Chalcis, who stepped into the gap between Greek philosophical rationalism and the burgeoning Second Religiosity of late classical times, and figured out how to make philosophy, logic, and mathematics appealing to the increasingly religious temper of his time. He was one of many such figures, and it was largely because of their efforts that the religious traditions that ended up taking over the classical world—Christianity to the north of the Mediterranean, and Islam to the south—got over their early anti-intellectual streak so readily and ended up preserving so much of the intellectual heritage of the past.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sort of thing is a worthwhile task, and if I can contribute to it I’ll consider this life well spent. That said, there’s nothing unique about it. What’s more, it’s only possible and meaningful because I happen to be perched on this particular arc of the wheel of time, when our civilization’s Age of Reason is visibly crumbling and the Second Religiosity is only beginning to build up a head of steam. A century earlier or a century later, I’d have faced some different tasks. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All of this presupposes a relationship between the individual and human society that fits very poorly with the unthinking prejudices of our time. That’s something that Spengler grappled with in his book, too;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>it’s going to take a long sojourn in some very unfamiliar realms of thought to make sense of what he had to say, but that can’t be helped. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
We really are going to have to talk about philosophy, aren’t we? We’ll begin that stunningly unfashionable discussion next week. <br>

People will start showing up at 11:30 a.m. this time because of a concert later, but most come at about noon. The Kompira monthly picnic is potluck, so please bring something to share.<br>To get there, go to Takao Station on the JR or Keio line and exit through the south exit (which apparently means going through the Keio part of the station). The small mountain that Asakawa Kompira Shrine crowns is directly west of the station (in fact, the train tunnels under it). For a map, see: <br>http://teresamcguffey.com/greenwizards.org/?q=node/34926 .<br>I am told that the Google map is practically invisible on small, hand-held screens, so it would be best to confirm the location before coming out. But nearly everyone in town knows where the Kompira Shrine is, so if you get lost ask. (It's not the prominent golden UFO thing --that's to the south of the station.)<br>The forecast as of this morning is for snow in Yamanashi Prefecture, which I have to traverse to get there, so I probably won’t make it. Weather.com gives a 90% chance of rain in Hachioji, but because they are having the Setsubun Festival, I expect folks to show up anyway, especially since Ikeda-san will open the shrine. The TV Tokyo feature is also drawing lots of interest, and I expect lots of people to show up once the weather is warmer. It will be more like a family gathering this time, but dress for rain! I’ll update this in the TADR comments here and on the Green Wizards site if I get notice of cancellation.<br><br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c1313883501208646845 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 7:19 PM</a><br><br>

Using the example of Isaac Newton and the Scientific revolution, it is easy to imagine that if Newton hadn't defined the scientific paradigm someone else would have. Spengler has some great thought experiments in this regard; what if the French had the first Faustian empire rather than Spain or if Goethe hadn't been born? He concludes that the lifecycle of the civilization would be fulfilled through its inmates in some deeply mysterious way, independent of individuals. Perhaps it can be said that there is a certain notational space in a culture that will be explored with its own internal logic regardless of particular people.<br><br>If we take a figure, however, in the winter it appears to me to be meaningfully different kettle of fish. If, say, St Patrick hadn't been born it is easy to imagine all Classical literature being lost. There may simply not have been other historical actors primed to do what he did, especially given the utter contingency of his colorful life. Our knowledge of Classical literature is utterly dependent on him and in a way personally entwined with his character. In the preservation of culture it could be said that things will only be saved by people who care, and people may not care, in fact most don't, and the few who do can have enormously disproportionate effects on the future<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6945054726154914588 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 7:43 PM</a><br><br>

Just wanted to thank you for expanding my horizons quite a bit with your work...would never have known about Spengler et al or investigated the philosophical foundations of magic without you. I've been interested in philosophy as a result of becoming obsessed with Zhuangzi in college, and my question to you has to do with polytheism. Philosophers these days often treat the question of the existence of "God" (singular) but there is nary a peep about the existence of "gods," plural, and this seems to leave a gaping hole in most philosophical speculation. Since you obviously believe in a pantheon of gods, I have roughly a million questions about that works, exactly. What is a god "made of?" Do gods exist prior to human beings believing in them? I gather there's a sort of "spiritual ecosystem" parallel to the "natural" environment in which gods exist? Finally, is the "One" or "Godhead" precisely the same as YHWH? I've done a bit of research and apparently YHWH was originally a member of the "Divine Council" who got "promoted," and may have had a consort in Asherah? Sorry to spam you...feel free to answer as many or as few of those as strikes your fancy. And I'm aware you wrote a volume called "A World Full of Gods" which probably addresses some of these questions, but I haven't got my hands on it yet.<br><br>Cheers,<br>David<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c8507955493180600077 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 7:44 PM</a><br><br>

After all, a bird or a fish or a tree is always a perfect example of its species within the limitations imposed by its genetic and environmental situation. A human, not so much (unless free will is an illusion).<br><br>I find it interesting that many successful religions have a physical center. Mecca and Rome are the obvious ones, but I'm sure the Asian religions and many indigenous belief systems have a physical center. We often speak of a moral compass, and I wonder if that's because the brain structures that currently help us through moral dilemmas are built atop navigation systems - which explains why so many make pilgrimages to Rome or Mecca or Uluru. Some Norse pagans believed that they shouldn't even look at the mountains their dead lived in without washing their faces first.

Calculus was the next logical step in the development of European mathematics; it didn't have to take the precise form it did -- I'm told that Newton's and Leibniz' versions were somewhat different -- but a mathematical form that broke movement down into infinitesimals was going to happen, and Newton and Leibniz just happened to get there first. Similarly, Darwin and Wallace both independently hit on the theory of natural selection -- again, the next step. <br><br>And thanks for the link about Gilded Age politics. I should do a post sometime about the old theory that the history of the Western world did a hairpin turn sometime around 1950 and since then has been running with all the signs reversed (environmental protection a cause of the left rather than the right, and so on.) By that figure it's the equivalent of 1883 now, and so the Gilded Age should be roaring!<br><br>Violet, I'm not sure I agree. One problem is that we know so little about the process by which Ireland converted to Christianity that it's by no means certain that St. Patrick did it all himself -- he may have simply been the one who got remembered. Another is that much of classical culture was also preserved in Byzantium, and even more in the Muslim world, and came to Europe from both of these sources. <br><br>David, yes, you probably want to pick up <i>A World Full of Gods</i>! Most of your questions, though, presuppose knowledge about gods that human beings don't necessarily have. What we know for sure is that people routinely have the experience of interacting with the superhuman and apparently disembodied intelligent beings we call "gods" -- these events are one of the things usually called "religious experience" -- and can interact with these beings by way of traditional methods such as prayer, ritual, and ascetic or ecstatic practices. What are these beings? What are they made of? How do they relate to one another? All interesting questions, but it's worth remembering that we may have no more capacity to understand the answers than, say, the dust mites crawling on your clothing have of understanding your career prospects or your thoughts while reading this comment! <br><br>Justin, I'm far from sure birds and fish are any more perfect than we are. Certainly I've known some very imperfect cats, goats, and chickens. As for holy places, first, you're quite correct that they also exist in Asian cultures -- if I ever have the chance to visit Japan I want to go to Koyasan, the monastery-topped mountain where the founder of Shingon Buddhism (the sect to which my Japanese-American stepfamily belongs) established his teachings, and where according to tradition he remains in meditation waiting for the arrival of the future Buddha. (Think of Merlin in his crystal cave and you know the story.) Vine Deloria Jr. has written forcefully about the role of place as a spiritual theme in Native American religion, and it's very common in the religions of the world. Of course, since we're moving into the historical phase when new religions tend to spring up and take root, new holy places are a pretty safe bet...<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c3615579827145109783 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 8:04 PM</a><br><br>

For every Kip Thorne or Richard Feynman there seem to be several more minds who would have expressed the same idea, eventually.<br><br>Though he's not won the Nobel Prize as many of his contemporaries have, Freeman Dyson is an absolutely astonishingly smart guy, who said in one interview (Google the string and y'all will find it): "It's true of almost every great idea that you really don't know afterwards where it came from.

Fairy tails speak well enough about the utility of naming your imps. Like the logical fallacies, learning them boils down to learning names for especially notorious and busy imps who are apt to make weak arguments be misjudged as strong.<br><br>I know that Jordan Peterson has become known my a large subset of the commentary here recently, Spengler's observation about the fading power of ideology and the rising power of personality has some reliance to his thinking. Peterson is acutely horrified by the actions of the Ideological state, most especially in a Marxist forum, but to some degree in any form of material rationalist. Body counts from history more that fit this sense of horror. A degree of his politics currently has to do with opposition to the rise of ideology, specifically Utopian ideology especially Marxist, in the political fringes of our own era. There is some cause for this alarm, though I am less alarmed than he is and Spengler is why. I think that it is more likely that personality cults will be the basis for politics of raw power in the coming era than the cold faith in ideology, based on Spengler. Either way these are 'interesting' times, and I think that even Neo-Liberalism is a non-marxist Utopian political ideology, and if stressed sufficiently it has the potential to manifest as horrible a form as Marxism... indeed several times it has come with in sight of the mark. Still of the two the Neo-Liberalism, for its many short comings, I think is the less broken of the ill-born twins; aware of the chance that the trials of peak resources could reverse that judgment harshly.<br><br>More likely than Neo-Liberalism fully evolving into a Global Cultural Revolution, as it does in Glen Beck's nightmares and the dreams of the most past loathing of its supporters, is it dying short of that metamorphosis at the hands of the Orange Julius.<br><br>I make that aside referencing Mr. Peterson so as to advance another point. The folks most distressed by Orange Julius seem to be misusing cyclic history. Acting as though he were a repetition of a Fascist or Ideological dictator; therefore responding as though to the rise of a horrific ideology. Bannon is the fall guy for the 'this is an ideology of hate' argument. This is a false positive of one cycle which misses a different pattern. There is a distinct lack of ideology, and a distinctive lack of Jungvolk on Orange Julias' side.<br><br>"Brutus" would be a more likely final hurrah of Ideology before the age of personality takes definite hold, if such a think came to pass.<br><br>The Personal Era I don't think is likely to be safer than the Ideologue Era, but how might the errors of the eras differ in kind?<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c1962480897502083858 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 8:20 PM</a><br><br>

I think Spengler wrote that we should look to the religious forms of the Springtime, and that the coming religions would thus somehow resemble Gothic Christianity. But how? <br><br>The other day I met a young man from Minnesota who is a member of a Protestant ministry. His is an "end times" ministry, dedicated to preparing the world for the Rapture. He has regular spirit experiences, and, seeing that I was receptive, told me a great deal about them. He encounters angels of the Lord and demons who take on various shapes, and has more than once seen the throne of Christ. A very interesting and very nice young man, and I didn't see any reason to share my experience that what constitutes "truth" for spirits and gods isn't necessarily the same as "truth" in an objective sense, and visionary experiences shouldn't be treated as journalism. Regardless what struck me was his dedication and energy, and it occurred to me that, in the United States, I've mostly seen that level of religious creativity from the far end of the Nondenominational Protestant spectrum. These things hardly resemble the Christianity of the Gothic era, as far as I know. But on the other hand I have a sense that there might be a traditionalist movement picking up speed among both very liberal and very conservative Christian denominations. But on another other hand, here on the Left Coast the universal religion is a kind of self-worshipping liberalism, dressed variously in Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, Taoist, or abstract New Age drag.

These include broad and deeply rooted notions of value, beauty, and moral rectitude. And yet, s/he retains a certain reflexive capacity to "auto-program," to receive feedback and make adjustments to ideology, behavior, etc. This can occur within a variety of constellations of thought/behavior/relationship. One's perspicacity is a function of the ability to integrate signals-- to receive signals from varying sources within a variety of constellations (and to filter out noise), to cross-reference these multivariate signals, accept feedback relative to behavior, and to make necessary adjustments to align with one's "programmed" values. This process is, similar to "broader" processes such as the history of civilizations, cyclic. The life of individual itself is a microcosm of the broader process within which it is embedded. We similarly are an amalgamation of chemicals, "human" cells, bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and abiotic materials, all receiving signals, reacting, cycling. <br><br>In this winter phase of civilization, we are "old" before we breathe our first breath. We are tasked to function under the tremendous weight of accumulated cultural signals and apparently contradictory information. Under threat of competition for ever-scarcer resources, we are admonished to choose an exclusive model or ideology through which to interpret this expanse of (mostly) noise. The ability to cross-reference and integrate signals of varying types is thus suppressed and our collective insight (intuition) and wisdom (prudence) erodes.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c1427580124507353931 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 8:48 PM</a><br><br>

Remember this number is not a quantitative representation of anything, it is just used for demonstration purposes. <br><br>So the next state of the civilization, S', equals 6<br><br>Next we double 6 to get 12, but we reduce that to 2 (single digits only; there are limits)<br><br>From 2 we then get 4, then 8, then 6 again. And now we hit the cycle 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4,...<br><br>Sure its is a riduclously simple behavior, but this is the sort of process that creates cycles all over the universe.<br><br>So why does a deterministic model relate (kind of, approximately) to human societies? Probably because our brains evolve much much more slowly than our culture. So every generation, the brains that are responding to their circumstances and triggering the changes that will define the next stage of civilization, are pretty much the same brains every time. f(S) is defined by our inherent cognitive and emotional functioning, and it doesn't change very fast, 10,000s of years at a minimun, 100,000s of years for anything pretty big, millions of years for real overhall.<br><br>Just be sure you never hit 5... Game Over. <br><br><br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c5646036156251016534 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 8:57 PM</a><br><br>

I've also visited the first five temples on the Shikoku henro trail.

One of them is available for free online - Echoes of Incense by Don Weiss.<br><br>I've also hiked a section of the Pacific Crest Trail, and read a lot of books about it. One of the things which strikes me is that, in spite of the Shikoku henro trail and Pacific Crest Trail being so different (one is Japanese, one is American, one is religious, one is secular, etc.) there are a lot of similarities - for example, the practice of o-settai is just like the practice of 'trail magic' (as in, a lot of PCT people describe 'trail magic' in the very same terms that Shikokun henro people describe o-settai).

He gives it a 200-250 year lifespan, being approximately 10 generations. Of interest, he notes many similarities between empires at the end of their lives. As an example, he points out that both Rome and the Caliphate, towards the end, were in many ways ruled by women, while their capitals were infested with foreigners and other rent-seekers. His most useful illustration was that of the Caliphate in Baghdad. Towards the end of its power, women were filling posts such as in law and academia that were traditionally the strongholds of men. 50 years later, a woman couldn't walk the streets without a male escort without risk of being accosted. <br>This is not to say that there are issues with women gaining power, just that it is a symptom of an empire's age. Young empires are very masculine and dominated by masculine men. Old empires are not, and are far more friendly to women. Then, for various reasons, they pass from the scene (often conquered by younger, more vibrant empires.)<br>William Strauss and Neil Howe also plot out this scenario of the life of an empire in "The Fourth Turning", which shows a strong generational rhythm to history. They note that the Roman "saeculum", or a very long lifetime of some 80-100 years, is the normal span of 4 generations. Within this span, you have a Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, and a cycle of events happens like clockwork. I will point out that in the span of the "lifetime" of the United States, we have had three major "fourth turnings": The Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and the Depression/WWII. Needless to say, we're not only due for another one, but we're in the midst of it as we speak.<br>As an historian, I have long noted the rhythms of history, but with Glubb on the one hand, and Strauss and Howe on the other, it falls into place.<br>(I must admit a huge failing on my part though, of not reading Spengler yet. I shall blame my professors for not beating me over the head with volumes of his works!

As a kid in the pacific NW, native cultures were portrayed as wise managers of Eden living entirely in harmony until white men (proceeded by small pox) arrived. I'm looking now at maps of their settlements in the Bellingham area where I live currently and even with my healthy adult cynicism it's hard to discredit the vision. Villages consisted of a few communal houses each home to some 40 or so people. Bellingham is a city of 80,000 now. From information I can find it seems like the region may have housed 2-4 villages of a few hundred people at most. In a part of the world where food literally swims up stream to you, how did their population stay under control? How did their cycles play out. Was it appreciably different from western civilization. Is that due to agriculture or some other factor? Was there a cultural restraint or is the vision of the noble savage just part of our mythology? I recognize that the lack of written history makes it a difficult study, but it seems worthwhile to learn from people who managed to occupy the same area for hundreds of generations without turning it into a desert. I suppose the root of my question is if the cycles we're discussing are inevitable in any human culture, or if they are a direct consequence of agri-culture. If so, are other forms of culture more stable?<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c4867214089228971080 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 9:04 PM</a><br><br>

That is essential to the possibility of using language. Nietzsche observes that logic relies on the fact that we can treat separate incidents as functionally similar. Put another way the very possibility of rationality, at least in the form we know and love, relies on the fact that events in the universe are effectively repetitive. Like cows. A cow being born doesn't just happen once, it happens dozens of times, not exactly the same, but so similar that we can distinguish cows from non cows with nearly perfect consensus.<br><br>Also, those things that repeat, don't just repeat as having the same shape or form again and again. The repeat having the same 'unfolding' or plot... not precisely the same, but similar enough to trigger the same recognition.<br><br>Basically, if Civilizations are a 'thing', something worth talking about at all, it would be shockingly strange and unusual for them not to have a recognizable pattern of unfolding. Though there are two counters worth considering. The first, and by far most likely is abortion; that is to say that something disrupts the plot before it gets very far along so fundamentally that it never goes further. But, for something as large as global Civilization to be killed prematurely at this point, which certainly possible, would take an external disruption of abnormal scale. Something one in several million years. Which while possible, isn't likely enough to dwell on. The other case would be some kind of emergent behavior; which I think is what the progressives are faithing about. When I consider emergent behavior in my imagination (sorry that I have flown away from my more principled start) it doesn't emerge 'all horns and thorns, sprung out fully formed, knock-kneed and upright' but instead manifests repetitively and vaguely, almost tentatively, until such time that the pattern has established itself as something with staying power. No doubt our civilization, in its glorious oddity, has spat forth some emergent behavior, but an emergent behavior exceptional enough to phase shift the patter of Civilization to a difference of kind I don't see evidence of at this time. Some of our technology might have seemed arguable 60 years ago, but today the technologies which may very well distort the wave form of Civilization future are not, in my eyes, mature enough to change our civilizations general pattern.<br><br>I would argue that Writing was a technology which sufficiently distorted longterm human patterns to fundamentally distort the rhythm of human culturation, but even so significant a change still fell vastly short of making the shift to an immortal utopia. I suspect, for what it's worth, that radio, phonograph, rifle, and certain agricultural discoveries might, if they can evolve into a endurance form, joining writing as a phase shifter of long term human culture. But even if this guess is accurate, it is very very unlikely they would make a Culture or a Civilization immortal or utopia. Quite the contrary, for several cycles of the Year of Civilization they are more likely to be disruptive and invasive as cane toads in Oz.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c4713342975868540881 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 9:05 PM</a><br><br>

Philosophy is one of my (many) weak points. I am an extreme reductionist, which is useful in navigating modern life but can be a hindrance when digging through history and philosophy.<br><br>@Violet Cabra: I think your idea is important, and it make sense to me. Going up on the energy curve there is a lot of room for trial and error and a lot of discoveries will be made given time.<br>On the way down both energy and time are in short supply so being in the right place at the right time can make all the difference.<br><br>@Doc Tim: I think it depends on the timescale you are talking about. For example I have a car that is almost 30 years old and it runs with no problem. The engine is simple enough that it can be fixed with a couple of tools. Most of today's cars have so many moving pieces that they suffer minor failures all the time.<br>The other thing to keep in mind is that different technologies reach their peak at different times. For cars it was probably two or three decades ago. For computers ten years ago (my latest laptop from work already started to lose hardware components after three months). There might be technologies that are still on the positive side of the improvement but how many?

The first is, I have not seen the math done myself. You stated in a previous essay that in order for industrial civilization to exist, it must have an energy resource with an EROEI of at least 11, while the best wind can do is 7. So- all we have to do is get wind power up to 11? Or some combination of wind, solar, and hydro, to add up to an EROEI of 11? I can’t say that you are wrong to say that this is not possible. I just want to know where your numbers come from. It certainly makes sense to me that solar panels don’t make solar panels at the moment, nor is any other renewable resource produced without the use of fossil fuels, and that because of that reality, transitioning requires advanced investment. Many people I have argued with can be led up to acknowledging this much (well, not economists- they scream “Malthusian!” as if that settles the argument) but, having got that far, they are always sure there are still enough resources left for us to make that advanced investment. How can I demonstrate to them that this is not the case?<br>The second has to do with the historical theories from which you draw your ideas. The previous theories of cyclic history were all based in agricultural civilizations. I think it's fair to say we have no idea what cycles humanity went through during the hunter-gatherer phase, all though it's also fair to guess that that age did have cycles of its own. If the 'technic revolution' is indeed as big a deal for our species as the agricultural revolution, this throws a bit of a wrench into the certainty of cyclic history. This isn't to say that progress is going to fix everything, simply that we have no idea what a civilizational cycle in a technic society looks like.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6643909657419300007 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 10:04 PM</a><br><br>

Though it dates from the 80's it's still an insightful guide. In my view, Fussell identified two American classes that were intellectually vigorous: the "upper proles" of skilled craft workers and the "upper middles" of professionals. In Dmitry Orlov's terms, the upper middles of lawyers, high-level managers, digerati, etc. have allied themselves with the technosphere. The skilled craft workers, at least potentially, can be allied with the biosphere and would, at least potentially, be in a better position to survive the shrinking of the technosphere. So you have two competing "natural aristocracies" though the craft workers have, by and large been deprived of a proper education when it comes to politics, etc. In the 18th century there arose a group of self-described "mechanics" who, inspired by Newton, did their own experiments rather than rely on authority. Your blog is facilitating communication among the neo-mechanics who are doing their own personal experiments that are causing them to lok at this world with fresh eyes.<br>2) Perhaps Trump vs the establishment is, in the context of this century, the early stirrings of a "biosphere" party rebelling against a "technosphere" party?<br>3) Perhaps the next religious awakening will take consciousness seriously as something more than something reducible to phyiscal phenomena?

Their histories appear to me to be chequered with violence, intolerance and cultural vandalism (for instance, the systematic destruction of other cultures' religious and artistic artifacts) to a remarkable degree. Is this typical, according to your reading of history, or something of an exception? <br><br>The historical role you sketch out for yourself, modeled along the lines of Iamblichus, reminds me of a concept developed by Morris Berman which he calls the "New Monastic Individual" (NMI), meaning someone who quietly sets about to help conserve some aspect of their dying civilization that they value, typically at a modest scale, alone or in participation with like-minded others. <br><br>When young I wished to be one of a wave of artists in some new renaissance, a cultural transformation - maybe a transition to the kind of world we might have had if we hadn't blown our energy resources out our tailpipes. But as you and Berman seem to suggest - and I think that the observable evidence by and large supports your contentions - now it appears that the role of anyone desiring to do something creative or constructive is liable to be more like that of Iamblichus. This realization comes as something of a shock, and calls for serious recalibration.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c5804920592017833862 title="comment permalink">2/1/17, 11:39 PM</a><br><br>

Ad hominem, Ab Absurdo and the use of emotive prejudicial language are quite popular on the Internet. You are not immune to their allure yourself. Spengler has his critics. Your choice to ignore those critics doesn't automatically invalidate them. That's just your choice. Prejudicial motivational assumptions are not evidence. I find it intellectually dishonest to use such tactics to dismiss inconvenient details. I appreciate you want to stay on message but those tactics are quite obvious and do you a disservice. You are obviously a clever well read intelligent man, I don't see why you stoop to them.<br><br>You keep trying to deny the role/effect of innovation &amp; chance in our civilisations. Claim unspecified litanies of failures. As you have used in comments yourself before, "What makes you think that the universe will deliver innovation / chance on your schedule/lifetime/area?". <br><br>Funny thing is, Spangler overlooking innovation doesn't have to invalidate your pet theory, but ignoring the effect and attempting to use the tactics above does weaken your defence. Spengler defined money as being the dominant power in our age and considered blood as the only power strong enough to overthrow money. Personally I lean to a translation of "love" to the term blood rather than 'family, race, ethnicity'. A rise in consciousness provoking more love of our fellow man could change things for those carried along with it. Those who chose not to might just fade away. We ( inc you ) don't know. Spengler, some pal of Hitler until he fell from favour, had a theory and 30 years later Philosophers like Adorno critiqued Spengler. Decades later so do I.<br><br>I'm afraid that this weeks post doesn't shed any new light. I was looking forwards to a revelation.<br><br>You said last week your theory had some validation. Have you had those validations peer reviewed or is it just your personal score keeping? The effects of congnitive dissonance, confirmation &amp; selection bias strike us all.<br><br>It's ok, I'm not expecting an answer. I've decided to move along. Overlooking the unsubtle attempts to condescend is a chore. I learned while here so all is not lost. I understand we are post peak oil and that it will progressively cause changes to society. I also understand now why Trump won. So thank you.<br><br>Your preferred predictions are clear but I'll let the future unfold as it may and focus on futures with different attributes to those preferred by yourself. I'm not a follower. I even avoided reading your blog timeline in time order to prevent being carried along.

We've got a long strange trip ahead. <br><br>Bryan, Charles Fort used to say that it steam-engines when steam-engine time comes around. I suspect he knew what he was talking about. <br><br>Geographist, Caesarism did begin between the wars; I'm sure you can name some of the Caesars. It generally takes several rounds before it finishes overturning the corporate-bureaucratic state. This is round 2. <br><br>Raymond, good. Very good. <br><br>Ray, "the Orange Julius" is a keeper. The differences between the age of ideologies and the age of personalities -- that's a complex matter, and will need a post of its own in due time. <br><br>Ozark, I'd draw the distinction differently. Rome wasn't anything like as dependent on the exploitation of nonrenewable resources as we are. If we had an economy that could continue indefinitely without running out of raw materials and trashing the biosphere, the convulsions immediately ahead would lead to a plateau of uncertain length, or perhaps more than one such plateau broken by short dark ages and eras of recovery. Since our civilization chose a much faster track to ruin -- it's not the only example of the type, btw; the Mayans did the same, by exploiting their vulnerable soils to the point of collapse -- the stages pile up a bit on the Winter end of things. <br><br>Rat, the Second Religiosity doesn't always bring in repetitions of Springtime. Sometimes it brings in exotic new forms -- think Christianity in late Roman times; sometimes you get weird mutations of the local faith instead. It's anyone's guess whether Christianity in some new form will become the dominant faith of our Second Religiosity, or if some other emergent faith or group of faiths will do so.<br><br>Shaun, as we'll see shortly, it's even more complex than that. Each individual has some habits of representation that are hardwired in biology, some that are culturally inculcated, some that are the product of personal experience (especially in childhood), and these are automatic in nature. Under some circumstances an individual can learn to change the latter two here and there, and there are known ways to mediate such changes, but they're not easy. Since our understanding of the world depends utterly on how we represent it to ourselves, such changes amount to transformations of the world -- more on this soon!<br><br>SweaterMan, glad to year it. <br><br>Bill, nice. That's rather reminiscent of Stephen Wolfram's work, you know. <br><br>Notes, thanks for this. I have a short book by the American occultist Manly P. Hall on his trip to Koyasan -- he was a serious student of Shingon Buddhism, among many other things, and integrated its teachings into his philosophy in some intriguing ways. I'll consider finding some other books!<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c7034571829788408243 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 12:30 AM</a><br><br>

Spengler's dealing with cycles around a millennium in length, in which art, science, and culture are as important as politics. I definitely recommend reading him, and if at all possible the full two-volume version. He was a great favorite of the Beat poets, if that's any incentive.<br><br>Brian, the only Native American cultures that had the classic cyclic phenomena were the urban ones. All the urban Mesoamerican cultures -- Aztec, Toltec, Mayan, etc. -- followed the usual patterns, and there's evidence that the mound-building cultures in the Mississippi Valley did also, though we don't have as much evidence there. Non-urban cultures go through much gentler fluctuations, and don't have the sequence of long steady rise followed by decline and fall. Compare what's known about non-urban Native cultures with the Mayans, the best-documented (since we can read their writing) of the urban Native cultures, and you can see a lot about how that works. <br><br>Ray, the reason I don't worry too much about emergent behavior is that we've used our shiny new technology to make mistakes that were old before the Pyramids were built. Eventually some new mode of human society might emerge that has a different arc through time, but despite our machines, we're acting just like a bunch of Babylonians...<br><br>Patricia, by all means send it around! If it slows down the histrionics at bit, that would be welcome. I hope I do get to Japan someday; there are a lot of places I'd like to visit, and people, too. <br><br>Johnhavey, you figure that out by seeing how the cycles mesh. This cycle of economic ups and downs produces ordinary recessions, but when it combines with this other cycle, you get deep ones, and so on. <br><br>Ben, in that case we would probably have had political centralization a lot earlier, as happens in most but not all other civilizations. For that matter, if the industrial revolution had started in France rather than Britain, Europe would be a single French-speaking nation today with rural backwaters where people remember other languages. There's a lot of room for variation of detail within the cycles; something will fill this or that slot, but it needn't be the same shape as the one that did so before. More on this as we proceed! <br><br>Mark, if I put up a website and asked people to post examples of that sort of thing, it would crash due to sheer traffic. <br><br>Jay, oh, I'm not trying to chase people off. I'm just giving everyone a chance to draw in a deep breath. <br><br>Karl, if they do think of something, the things I've chosen to learn and teach still mean that I have, and will continue to have, a richer and fuller life than I'd have had if I'd embraced the frankly bleak lifestyle of the technology-dependent couch potato, or what have you. So I'm quite comfortable either way. <br><br>The EROEI requirement has been calculated several times; I'll have to chase down the sources, though. As for the differences between technic and agricultural civilizations, if we ever get a mature technic civilization -- one that doesn't depend on self-terminating cycles of resource extraction and pollution -- that may indeed be different. We don't have one of those, though, and so far our civilization is following the standard track.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6677316605724405663 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 12:47 AM</a><br><br>

History is a narrative form and needs characters to inhabit its stories if they are to be readable. Add to that an ideological preoccupation with individualism (characteristically American, but since spread to the rest of the west at least) and you're all set. Albert Einstein is the paradigmatic example: you need a flamboyant man with an interesting haircut* to be the leading man in your story of the new physics. It'd be an interesting meta-historical project to track the transformation of characters in historical writing from the exemplary individual (ie. secular saint) to the Promethean genius of high modernism. <br><br>*Ha!

Don't worry, I haven't dropped the alt-center concept. I'd encourage you to explore it on your own as well, though. <br><br>Greg, it's been a long time since I've read Fussell's book, and I don't know that I can comment on it on the basis of my very thin memory of it! As for the Second Religiosity, it won't care about philosophers; like other religious movements, it'll take its impetus from raw religious experience, and proclaim itself in the language of faith and salvation rather than that of reasoned discourse. That's why it has such power when reason has run itself into the ground. <br><br>Keith, nope. That depends very much on fine details of cultural style. <br><br>Brett, I won't argue about the no-solution solution. As for Caesar, there was plenty of propaganda on all sides, to be sure, but everybody I've ever met who had the kind of facial and neck tension you see on his statues had a high shrill voice, so I tend to take that much seriously. <br><br>Kevin, Christianity and Islam were mildly anti-intellectual in their very early phases, profoundly pro-intellectual in their middle phases, and took on their present opposition to rationalist materialism in the culture wars of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Remember that Christian monks and Muslim scholars were responsible for preserving nearly the entire corpus of classical science, logic, and mathematics! A lot depends on how effectively people like me succeed in bridging the gap between the fading age of reason and the rising tide of new religious movements, but it's absolutely standard for religion to be the main force for cultural and intellectual preservation in a dark age, and I don't see that changing. <br><br>RogerCO, I'll keep that in mind. It might be worth going through Spengler in detail in a series of posts, but we'll see. <br><br>DoubtingThomas, you keep on demanding that a single short essay should contain the kind of documentation normally found in a book; if you want the failures as well as the successes specified, you might read through the archives, where I've talked about them at length. You also keep insisting that I dismiss the role of innovation and chance in human history, which is really rather odd, in that I discussed at some length in this essay the role that innovation plays in history, and I've discussed chance at great length as well. That they're part of the cycle, rather than an exception to it, doesn't deny them a place. <br><br>Talking about motivations is not necessarily a fallacy, when arguments are repeatedly used to support an obvious preexisting agenda. For example, if it's possible, as you suggest, that some unexplained change in consciousness will provoke more love for our fellow man, isn't it just as possible that an equally unexplained change in consciousness will provoke less love for our fellow man? If not, why not? Of course we both know the reason: faith in progress demands one and not the other.<br><br>That said, if you don't find these essays of interest, then by all means find something more to your taste. The internet's a big place, and it's a lot easier to find people who support your point of view than mine, you know. <br><br>Les, a nice bit of German. I'm still trying to think of a way to talk about what I suppose should be called iFailure, the way that technologies that supposedly fill human needs actually fill abstract representations of human needs and leave the needs themselves untouched, but that's going to require quite a bit of discussion.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c9027664320636010655 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 1:08 AM</a><br><br>

Out of sheer curiosity: is this series of essays forming the core of any forthcoming books? <br><br>I'm reading Jason Heppenstall's (a commenter's here) excellent dystopian future fiction book: <a href=https://cluborlovpress.blogspot.com.au/p/default.html rel=nofollow>The Seat of Mars</a>. I'm quite enjoying the story which is a dark satire and am also learning much about Jason's part of the UK. I recommend the book. Then next up is your book "Retrotopia" which needs no introduction here, but I also recommend that book to all too. Then a book on manure by a contrarian farmer going by the name of Gene Logsdon, the title of which will not pass your blog moderation process - don't blame me, I didn't name it - he started it! Hehe! Then, I will begin reading about Song Lines. I really needed a break after reading Overshoot twice in rapid succession. There really does need to be some sort of initiation process by which a person can absorb the contents of a book like Overshoot and not be majorly bummed out by the content. I don't reckon many people are up for the implications of the contents though and it is quite a confronting tale which has profoundly changed my worldview. <br><br>I'd imagine philosophy has a similar effect on people? Maybe? Dunno. The thing I'm looking forward to about your essays is that acknowledging different understandings of the same world that we all inhabit can maybe provide a more flexible worldview? Dunno. But I do see many people stuck with a single narrative and when it doesn't work, they double down on the belief systems or the efforts to support that narrative, and well, to be honest, there are better and easier approaches. They might not like them though, is my gut feeling! Dunno.

But, I'm inclined to think that Steven King needs a good editor too! Your stuff does have an almost 19th century scale, scope and pace, which is good for real readers, but most of my students wouldn't get very far. Not your fault. It's the times. Inspired by you, and my young hipster friends, I've grown a long beard as well, which is much admired by the ladies.<br><br>You make lots of good points. The idea that the world is a big wheel and it rotates is linked to obervation. So much does go and come back again, repeating endlessly. Night follwed by day, the seasons, the movement of the Sun. This is, of course, linked to agrarian societies. Modern industrial societies broke the wheel of fortune and set us on a course towards the... stars. We're chained to that rocket I'm afraid. These are, obviously, the wheel and the great engine racing along a track towards a brighter and better future always just beyond the horizon, just models. You are correct, challenging the dogma of progess, gets some incredibly strong reactions from people. This I think has a lot to do with how successful industrial and tech society appears to be, almost 'magical.' What, could possibly go wrong?<br><br>Too long, sorry.<br><br>Newton was also an... alchymist, and was obssesed with the super-natural and had a lot of very strange views and attitudes, which isn't meant to detract from his genius or achievements.<br><br>Caesar seems to have outraged a lot of conservative aristocratic opinion in Rome. He was criticised for wearing his tunic too low and open, whatever that really means. I think he may have been playing a long game, creating a network that would prove useful in the future whilst at the same time diverting attention from what he was really doing because an open campaign was a very dangerous thing to do in Rome.<br><br>Essentially Caesar wanted to 're-connect' the people of Rome to the structure and ideology of the state once more. In many ways he was a... populist. Ordinary Romans saw him as their champion and friend, whilst the aristocrates saw a threat to their rule. Was Caesar a democrat? Probably not as we'd understand things. He was a very successful military commander, which shouldn't be over-looked. So he was very popular with the army and the common people, both of which he needed if his 'reform progamme' was going to be successful. In some ways he resembles a kind 'proto-fascist' leader, a bit like Cromwell or Bonaparte, and for some of the same reasons.<br><br>Caesar saw the growing chasm between the the aristocrats and the people, the 1% and the rest, as a threat to the effecacy of the army and the state, going forward. And I suppose he was right, after Caesar there was civil war and the Republic was replaced by monarchy and full-on aristocratic rule, which, arguably led towards the decline of the Roman Empire.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c3983434785028762085 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 3:04 AM</a><br><br>

With a sense of almost mystical apprehension I read his description of Cecil Rhodes as the forerunner of a new kind of Western man who would eventually be calling all the shots- in short, a businessman with an oversized ego- about a hundred years after Spengler's time.<br><br>Another neat thing is that although Spengler knew that a world-empire dominated by a single Western power was on the horizon, at the time of his writing (mid-WWI) it was still an open question whether that power would be German or American (he uses both as examples of the 'winter' or 'civilization' tendencies in a culture's late development).<br><br>I'm fascinated by his assertion that his philosophy (the morphology of history) would be THE LAST original development in Western philosophy- thereafter it would only be possible for Westerners to look at philosophical developments as symbols of developmental stages, rather than as pressing 'problems' to be solved. (Because by his lifetime the problems pertaining to Western thought had all been discovered). That's how I interpret this prediction at least, in light of the way the history of ideas was discussed in my undergraduate courses.<br><br>For me, at this moment, this feels like a thought that's too big to get outside of and have a look at.

For example, if we assume that there is a general niche that Civilizations oft have, shaped like Newton or Pythagoras as the case may be, the niche is also unique to the degree that only Nixon could go to China, Pythagoras and Newton if switched couldn't have filled each others rolls. Newton was so western he was even born of Christmas for Christ sake (we might suppose).<br><br>When the thing being grown is less manifest, like in dark ages, the individuals can be seed bearers, a common type, but what particular seeds are brought and the after-touch of the hand that plants the seed is projected on large. The same general patterns of Civilization apply, such that no seed bearer can just fluke up a seed stock that produced perennial Newton-niches, or some other unbred beast. But, when a forest is freshly burned, which keystone seeds arrive first can make a fundamental long term difference, like the difference between Newton and Pythagoras repeated on every tree crown. Not that these differences yet show any signs of being predictable, but considering how very few civilization we have observed and in what low resolution, we are many civilizations too early to have strong empirical grounds for knowing what aspects of the character of a civilization might be predictable; and that even assumes so herculean work in record preservation and epistomology for such questions to be explored beyond the hypothetical.<br><br>I can the concept, along with Seedbearers, and Green Wizards, Spengler's Greenhouse.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6603830987091866894 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 6:59 AM</a><br><br>

The name comes from the account that black swans where, well unthinkable, to Western Culture. Until they where found living in Australia.

Some being faster than others. So I wonder if Theory in Cyclical History takes into account the biologic-material reality of humans as animals that rely on the health of extended natural communities.<br><br>Oh, that reminds me I saw this super cool video of how wolfs shape rivers.

Note: I heartily recommend buying the book. Reading a physical book is a great pleasure and, more importantly, still possible once the rolling brown outs arrive. But if you are cash strapped, or just want to see if it is a book that you want, then check out the on line version.<br><br>I for one am happy with the move into philosophy, I was actually on archive.org earlier today researching the works of Hannah Arendt, following a BBC Radio 4 program discussing her life and works this morning.<br><br>Regarding the cyclicality of history and civilisations, those that attempt to deny those cycles and claim "its different this time" are fighting against fundamental human nature. Even those who say, "well if we're aware of it, surely we can change it" are going to fall before it. Several psychological studies have looked at the distribution of psychopathic personality in positions of power and they have regularly turned up the fact that prevalence of people who score highly on that scale increases as power increases. e.g. the percentage of politicians or of senior company executives who score highly on the psychopathic tests increases, often several times over the national average. Such people are attracted to wealth and power, are typically short term thinkers, in that they want to get that power as fast as possible, and they want to both retain and grow that power. They are also lacking in empathy with other people and tend to act to remove anyone competent enough to be a competitor. <br>i.e. over time the powerful gain more power and wealth, are blind to those who they deprive of it and remove those who would temper their activities. which is why they end up getting overthrown by the masses led by an equally psychopathic personality, in this case often one who is a demagogue.<br><br>As you argue, as history cycles it creates "roles" for people. As in your example, as we change from Rationality to Religiosity, we have a role for people who can make sense of that change and explain it to people - whether they want to listen or not. It doesn't matter which actor steps into that role, and they may be good or bad at it, the role exists because the change exists. Its going to be a matter of luck whether you get Laurence Olivier or Sylvester Stallone stepping forward. Given the breadth and size of any civilisation, I would expect several people to step into such roles. While efficiency would seem to indicate that someone who performs the role better will be more likely to succeed in that role, blind luck is probably a stronger influence. :)<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6171057172820535940 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 7:39 AM</a><br><br>

However, one factor in the equation of predictability would be what is unique to history, at least for the last seventy-five years, and that is the presence of tens of thousands of nuclear warheads and hundreds of nuclear power stations around the globe. If the probability is high that social or state instability will likely occur in it's various expressions (revolution, civil war, election of demagogues, etc.), I would argue that the probability would be pushed closer to the "uniquely horrible" position. Not to predict that it will happen, but that the threat is great enough that we should work to minimize it.<br> It seems to run parallel with the "bright future of progress" narrative, that many view the nuclear danger as over or at least under control. As Soviet archives have been opened, we have learned how close we may have come to that "uniquely horrible future" (search "Stanislav Petrov"). As NATO pushes to Russia's borders with troops and missiles, there is almost no discussion in western media or government hearings as to the wisdom of this bellicose saber-rattling; we hear only groupthink as to "Russian Aggression". Those who would like to see a more open debate on such a critical issue (e.g. Stephen Cohen) are rarely seen in the mainstream media.<br> I must say it was brilliant strategy by those with an interest in a new cold war ( fantastic levels of weapons, profits, and career security) to successfully bring into the fold many "liberals" and "progressives", exploiting the disgust with all things Trump, by ramping up unproven or truly bizarre claims about throwing the election for Trump.

Look for broad tendancies and repetition over time, preferably without neglecting context when discussing a specific culture or civilization. <br>As I'm sure you're aware, Spengler was roundly savaged, not only by philosophers like Heidegger and Popper, but also economists such as Hayek and von Mises. As I recall, the main accusations concerned his supposed over-reliance on (misuse of?) analogy, and, more generally, his unabashed historicism. However, in Greek, if memory serves, 'analogia' simply means 'proportion.'

Later, in the 1950's, Amaury de Riencourt turned Spengler's ideas toward a stimulating interpretation of the USA as focus of crisis during the latter phase wherein a thousand years of Western cultural ferment settles into decay of a now-aged civilization. I suggest de Riencourt's "The Coming Caesars" as introduction to such American focus of Spenglerian cycles. (By the way, I prefer the original by Amaury de Riencourt, not the so-called "co-authored" version someone recently put together because of a lapse in the original title's copyright.)<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c7893792292721011381 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 8:17 AM</a><br><br>

Words do still pass here. Nevertheless, I can't help but notice that none of the Kurds spend their time trying to argue the finer points of the Hadith while the Islamic State (so called) lays down covering fire for their retreats.<br><br>If there's going to be a mad scramble for power then there's simply going to be one. What's the point of casting heroes and villains in such an environment? If a lot of people are going to die in a competition for resources, then I have just as much right as anybody to define my own motivating values and fight for my own conception of what the future should look like. Antifa seems to want Nazis more than anybody, so let's give the people what they want and send them the invoice with postage due. Those who made straight white men into the villains of history should not now find themselves surprised that we intend to play the role to the hilt.<br><br>As for a Second Religiosity, I always felt I showed up a little early to that party, but I must admit that JMG has well beaten me to the punch. I wonder how much of it is upbringing and how much of it is innate. I've undergone spontaneous alterations in consciousness that convince me that there's more going on in life than the conventional paradigm wants to admit, and it seems to have happened in spite of my religious upbringing rather than because of it. What I would really like to see is the foundation of something like white Shinto. To re-enliven the natural world with spirits. Spirits of the mountain, spirits of the river, ancestor spirits, so many spirits you can't throw a rock without disturbing half a dozen. Combine that with the theological complexity and syncretism of Mahayana Buddhism, and you've got yourself a real religion on your hands. I'd really hate to see something as stodgy as Christianity retake its crown but maybe it can't be helped given its long history as the spiritual foundation of the West.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c7906222627439312960 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

Hall. <br><br>While these works do not explicitly discuss cyclic time/events/history in the sense being discussed here, they do draw from archaeology, history, old ceremonialism and comparisons among cultures to the extent that one can begin to grasp a sense of the diversity of cultures, and not only how they survived, but how they evolved and changed. While I agree that the urban cultures of Meso- and South America (and the Mississippian) did display more overt, sharp cycles of decline and fall, the non-urban cultures also went through cycles, and indeed, through periods of rise, decline and fall. The old peoples seemed to be very aware of this—again, intellectualized in the same way we might do, but fully taken account of in oral histories and ceremonies based on astrological movements of planets combined with a mythos-based, practical knowledge of the natural world. A common concept of time and change seems to have been of continuity threading through cycles nested within cycles. (How the arrival of the horse disrupted plains cultures is an interesting story in itself.)<br><br>Also, urban/non-urban seems to me to be too sharp a dichotomy, at least in North America, because of the way tribes and villages organized themselves, the way life was so entirely governed by the seasons and the way ceremonialism and ritual worked to draw groups together and then disperse them.<br><br>Also worthy of note and something I’ve mentioned before is the prophecy of the seven fires, which presents ages in human society, and how each age influences the next in ways that are not strictly cause and effect. Some say we are in the age of the Seventh Fire now.<br><br>I think that North American culture is deeply influenced by the histories of the cultures that were on this continent prior to the arrival of the Europeans (dragging along Africans). I suggest that a reading of Spengler should be tempered with a knowledge of American history (of the last 15,000 years) because Europe is partly a story of indigenous peoples developing and striving against each other, whereas, our story is that of invaders bringing a culture with them and it turning into something different. American culture is not necessarily synonymous with western culture (in the classic sense), in my view. Which of course does not obviate Spengler's larger idea of historical cycles being discussed here.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c632979561728342691 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 8:36 AM</a><br><br>

Ibn Khaldun is useful here, as well as some of the ideas that have been built upon him by Cliodynamics (without the relentless quantification of data, I should add. I do not find that useful.) This constant balance between cooperation/conflict, although able to create large, cohesive societies, can also just as easily destroy those societies. Works that look at the cycles of history provide in-depth examples of this (Vico, Spengler, Toynbee, etc.), which you have been writing about for over 10 years, so of course I do not need to mention them here. To the point, this precludes the idea that society is always going in one direction. <br><br>There are also hard limits on technological innovation due to the fact that any new innovation is limited by available energy inputs. At present, I think people too often mistake innovation with imagination. Though I can imagine a machine that can spirit me away to the furthest reaches of the universe, I can not in reality create a machine that can actually do this, and not because I lack the necessary skills to build one. There is most likely no physical way anything like this can ever be built because of resource and energy constraints. At present, current innovation of existing technology is generally just a more clever way of using existing principles to do something slightly different, and usually with a higher energy cost (the "smart" phone is a good example.)<br><br>Finally, with regards to thinking about reality, I think the scientific method is perhaps one of the greatest innovations of mankind, but of course even this has severe limitations. The scientific method is useful where appropriate, but does a poor job in many other aspects of human life, such as religious or spiritual thought. How can anyone realistically use the scientific method to explain the existence of a god or gods, who are completely beyond the scope of our limited perceptions? There are ways to bridge the gap, but science is definitely not one of them.<br><br>I feel like I am preaching to the choir here, and I don't really have the voice for it, but when someone claims innovation, I have to offer a retort.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c218265733135932800 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 8:58 AM</a><br><br>

Having buttered you up I shall now perpetrate criticism. I see two problems with your approach that, as far as I can tell, you have never addressed with care. <br><br>1. Spengler and Toynbee both propounded theories of history grounded in something like metaphysics. Spengler is deeply grounded in concepts out of German romanticism: the ineluctable personalities of civilizations, the mystery of historical appearances, and so on. Toynbee attempts a much more British-empiricist approach but despite his vast marshaling of historical data, he also grounds his historical cycles in the mysterious irreducible emergent qualities of large groups of humans acting over time, essentially a very sophisticated version of "what goes up must come down." I own and treasure the works of both these great writers, but Neither of their systems appears to have anything to do with resource depletion. Spengler says nothing about it, and Toynbee only mentions it in his last writings, in an "oh, that too" kind of a way. This seems to set up a situation in which you can't have it both ways: if the USA is failing because of resource depletion, that's just a technical problem and yeah, some smart person could come up with a solution, as many smart people are attempting to do. If the USA is failing due to the mysterious metaphysical forces of rise-and-fall, then oil and gas depletion don't have much to do with it, and this rather crimps much of what you've argued on your blog, though admittedly only tacitly in this essay. I've never seen you address that challenge: if you have, please let me know. <br><br>2. You never have clarified the time frame. In this essay you talk as though the current populist US President and some current political donnybrook can be mapped onto the history of the Roman Empire. If I remember right, when Julius Caesar was killed, the Roman Republic may have been effectively dead but Roman civilization still had several hundred years to run; its creative phase may have ended but by some accounts its great days of power were still a century in the future. But leaving that aside, I'd like to ask, if you had been living in 1932 -- well into the great depression and with populist movements on the rise -- and you had been reading Spengler, whose work had recently come out in English, would you have foreseen the next 50 years of US global dominance? How about if you had been living in 1865 in a nation wracked by recent civil war, not yet completely put back together, and with a president many considered a populist demagogue recently assassinated, would you have seen the massive economic growth of the coming decades? Despite your admirable and impressive grasp of history, your overall argument seems very much grounded in the historical period that happened to intersect with your own existence, especially in the years 1970-2005. Who would have guessed that those few decades would be the turning point of all human history? <br><br>Forgive me if I have missed it, but I haven't seen you address either of these, which don't seem to me to be fluff arguments to be dismissed with a wave. Best wishes and thanks for your engaging and inspiring efforts.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c5042751088877327145 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 9:48 AM</a><br><br>

It helped me realize that I've been subscribing to the belief in the historical trope that one person can make all the difference. From an ecological standpoint that is, of course, absurd. one population can make all the difference, and an individual is not separate from that. So St Patrick may be the symbolic person coming to us 1500 years later, but is clearly not the only historical actor who acted equivalently<br><br>Shifting my thinking on this matter is frightening, as it is clearly something inoculated in me, perhaps when my parents read A Wrinkle in Time out loud to me as a young child, but it is also enormously liberating. The Historical Figure has such an unreasonable amount of pressure; the pressure of the mythos of history. To eliminate that mythic pressure, to accept that there are others carrying equivalent seeds into the future, is to help personally balance my psyche and remove a terrible and dread burden from my inner life. My actions are still something I can regard as important and meaningful, but no longer have to be horribly stilted. I'm utterly grateful that you choose this subject for this week; if historical models are simply tools we use to apprehend the past I might as well choose one that allows me to be effective, still do the things I love, and be more inwardly balanced.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6622773550429941631 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 10:33 AM</a><br><br>

I am reminded of my old Philosophy prof who invited me into his discussion forum about the time I started reading and posting to The Oil Drum. I simply did not have enough time for both and declined, but now, (after 10 years) I am returning to my roots, I guess. I am quite excited about it, to be honest. Talk about full circle!!<br><br>This apparent Decline is similar to Dudley Warner's mis-attributed statement, "Everyone complains about the weather, but nobody does anything about it". I share the misgivings of many, I sense the disconnects, but will continue to make up my own mind. I might call it my version of 'critical thinking' with a dash of self-confidence tossed in, but I remain wary. It is a fine line between cynicism and 'going along', and I sometimes wonder if it even matters? So, just like the weather problem, I always ask myself, "What's next for me and mine"? Some answers might be, "go to a good place", "collapse ahead of the rush", or as my daughter used to say when she was 3, "Don't worry don't panic". <br><br>Last week I responded that the 'Serenity Prayer' might be a decent first step. In fact, it is probably one of my final solutions to this Decline. I have already done the relocation. I have rebuilt the energy efficient home. I have helped my children become established in their own lives. We have built up our gardens and work our woodlot. We have become more than debt-free and maintain our health. We are 'of community'. But the fact remains, I sense The Decline and see it unfolding, everyday. The Decline is as obvious to me as The Weather, and there isn't too much I can do about it beyond what we have already accomplished in our family.<br><br>Rather than Spengler, I choose Thoreau for understanding. In particular, I find these two sentences particularly meaningful. "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary."<br><br>To live in the moment, to live deliberately, and to be grateful, for as Thoreau said, "living is so dear". And I also do not wish to 'practise resignation' and do not believe it is necessary. Okay, The Decline is upon us. Our leaders are now coarse people and have been so for generations. Our leaders are now plundering kleptocrats. Our civilization is in obvious planet-destroying overreach. I can't fix it and to dwell on the situation without personal solutions at hand is to invite depression inside. It will ruin my life and take away my serenity. To lose my belief in gratitude is for me, sacrilige of the highest order.<br><br>I do not pretend to have the answers. However, I do know that it is wrong to accept what is unfolding as anything other than wrong and disgusting. Imagine, a President who once used a cigar to penetrate a young intern is lauded as succesful and trotted out to campaign for his wife as a 'positive'. Imagine, recent Presidents also caught lying, cheating, or protecting oligarch thieves and thought to be even better than the current newly-elected version. Now, we have the genital grabbing coarser version, whisking into events in a private jet with gold plated seat belts and toilet handles; a President who tells the desperate populace they are, "tremendous", "really great" and "wonderful". And of course all our common enemies are, "really bad dudes", "terrible people" and "really really bad people" conducting "carnage", "So Sad"!!!. Oh My God. Is there anything left we can do other than pray?<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c5782430658990862786 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 10:41 AM</a><br><br>

Crucially it completely omits any qualitative information about WHAT is being achieved by the energy expended. So while it's obvious that all renewable energy sources will have an EROEI much less than fossil carbon, our ability to achieve the same, or more, with less energy is improving all the time. While much of this efficiency gain is currently being wasted, the potential is there for us to run a recognisable civilisation on a tiny fraction of our current energy use, if and when we have to.<br><br>So far humanity has progressed through three major phases, the hunter-gatherer- clan phase, the agricultural city/state and now into the very early stages of an industrial-technic global civilisation. Each was and will be subject to cycles; notably accelerating and each growing shorter. The Romans managed a thousand years or more, the British Empire several centuries, the American version will barely manage 60 years. I predict there will be no great or enduring neo-Chinese Empire, the cycles are now too short to allow it to fully form. <br><br>In my view history does not so much repeat as rhyme. Rather than endless closed circles, it moves in fat lazy and open-ended spirals. As each loop overlaps in time we can recognise patterns from the previous cycle, but equally when viewed orthogonally the underlying shifts and displacement is plain. Trump's America is not the same as Ceasar's Rome, however tempting the pattern is. They may be in a similar phase, and there is much instruction in observing this, but they are not located in the same place.<br><br>Crucially, as suggested above, we are transitioning from an era of nation-states and empires into an era of planetary connectedness. I use this phrase to contrast with the usual notion of capitalist 'globalisation', free-trade and all the now familiar toxic consequences that fall from this. Yes the fall of the great fossil empires will be noisy, painful and protracted, but at the same time and in response to these changed circumstances ... we will evolve different modes of thinking and acting in order to survive. <br><br>Survival in this turbulent world will be about two things; using available resources effectively and remaining strongly connected both socially and politically. The isolated and inefficient will not endure. All the core problems we now face are global in nature, and demand global thinking, connections and actions to overcome them. There is nowhere 'safe' to retreat to, every family, community and nation jostles on a crowed planet throbbing with the constant movement of information, capital and people. Certainly much of this movement is grossly inefficient and will fade away, but the shifts it has wrought inside of our collective imagination is permanent. <br><br>Just as agricultural civilisation, despite one horrendous disaster after another, never fully reverted back to hunter-gathering and eventually fully supplanted it, equally it is reasonable to suggest that this global civilisation will inevitably overlay the one before it. Probably the process will be equally painful, but this time I expect it will be a whole lot quicker.<br><br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c3211287440448457610 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 10:46 AM</a><br><br>

We haven't got very much from the mycenaean bronze age, and much of what we know seems to have come via archaeology rather than history, or via Egypt which didn't fall so far.<br><br>Any ideas on how much of our knowledge of greece and roman ideas will survive the coming dark age?<br><br>I must admit that I find the idea of multiple layers of half-forgotten civilizations piled on top of each other ten thousand years from now fascinating and enthralling. What there is so far is pretty interesting, but I think humanity has a future beyond the end of industrial civilization.

You misunderstood his argument - he was talking about automobiles, not movies. As one who still repairs his own, I can vouch that a modern (say, post 2000) automobile lasts easily twice as long with far less maintenance than the late-1960s vehicles on which I learned the craft. That said, I feel there's an optimum and we're passing it; the new trend of an automobile as rolling entertainment center is profoundly misplaced. Someday soon a live update to an automotive system is going to lend a whole new meaning to the term "blue screen of death!"

Bustos Domeq</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Interesting post, as usual. I'm sympathetic to the cycles of history thesis, but I do have a few questions about it. Something I've often wondered about, especially with Vico, is if it would have been possible for someone to propose such a theory before enough history had accumulated to allow those cycles to be perceived? I understand that the Greeks thought time was cyclical, and St. Augustine had a kind of idea of historical cycles in City Of God, but Vico's theory was so much more, well, historical. Which indicates to me that the cycles in question are an example of our species learning from its own cultural past and refining its ideas based on that past. There are technologies around now that are unlike anything in the past - the printing press is a good example, or double-entry bookkeeping, or washing your hands - and don't require oil to work. And there is just more knowledge available in general. It's true the signal to noise ratio on the Internet tilts towards noise, but there is signal. And libraries. All this is just to say that the word 'progress' has come to mean something very specific since the 1960s, but we can reject the more facile neoliberal versions of progress without reject the whole idea that just the existence of more and more past inevitably changes the way the cycles will cycle in the future. More Hegel than Spengler, you could say, especially since philosophy is afoot. In any case, thanks for your work.

It <i>was</i> a struggle--it requires prior knowledge that I felt I had just barely enough of, as well as a will--and it was wholly worthwhile. <br>Much of your work, like Spengler's, is stuff I want to share with everyone but have learned not to. Every so often, though, I read something of yours and think, Ooh! <i>This</i> one I can share. Your pieces here about Nietzsche and Burke happen to be two like that, and sharing them has been productive. You really do have a way of synthesizing and communicating challenging ideas in ways that end up in people actually thinking a bit. So if you decide that a reading guide to Spengler is a good enough gamble to warrant your time, I for one will be looking forward to reading and sharing it.<br>(This idea brings to mind James K.A. Smith's <i>How (Not) To Be Secular: Reading Charles Taylor</i>, which Smith recently wrote after teaching Taylor's <i>A Secular Age</i> and realizing his students, 20-year-old undergrads, were resonating with unusual passion with this dense, 900-page tome. Whether people are similarly ripe for Spengler I don't dare guess.)<br>Thank you, as always, for all you do.<br>Jonathan.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c3034189674481390623 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 11:34 AM</a><br><br>

And expectations are indeed up for scrutiny.<br><br>If your expectation is your automobile should be easily repairable by your average shade tree mechanic then so-called progress is running in the opposite direction. Heaping lots of complexity on a mechanism that might make it more reliable and longer running, but which guarantees that when something does go wrong with it you are going to need a degree in writing code to diagnose it and specialized micro processors to repair it? Not so much an advancement, no. You could substitute any number of modern tools and appliances that have been "new and improved" to the point the complexity becomes a problem in and of itself. <br><br>When I was student, living hand to mouth, I had an 1980 Chevy (The infamous X car) that was less that 100% reliable, and I found many work-arounds to keep it on the road. I had an electric motor-driven radiator fan with a fusible link that cost something like $100 for a mechanic to replace...clearly a prohibitive amount. When it failed I hotwired the contacts by running some lamp cord through the firewall to the dash and mounted a toggle switch...VIOLA! Once had an old 70's model AMC...my gas gauge sender unit failed, and my gauge was thereafter a notched stick! Back when we still had vehicles with carburetors, I once fixed a sticky float valve with a piece of string tied around the intake throttle body. These kinds of appropriate technology hacks are less and less available for vehicles today, and so many of our other products follow suit.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c8849069758424439574 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 1:53 PM</a><br><br>

What will be the probable consequences (hordes of desperate liberal refugees streaming north seeking sanctuary)?<br>- When the next Financial crash comes, how bad will it be?

I know, JMG, that you did not like his books, and it may very well be that he is a bit over the top, nonetheless there are very important distinctions between a society that does not "lock up the food" versus ones in which you develop hierarchy. In my opinion, what civilization does is create hierarchy, authority, and accumulation of wealth, which is a fundamentally different way of relating to each other and to natural resources. And this is still true even if the people are not always good. In fact, another layer of questions I have in addition to the several that Brian Bundy brought out, is about what people are like when they are living tribally. I guess it sort of seems like the old canard that all Chinese people look alike - we tend to think of the various tribal people are being all of a type and interchangeable. But I'm sure that is ignorance. They must have had those who were smart and those who were creative and those who made thoughtful and wise decisions, as well as those who were fickle or promiscuous or easily offended and given to violence.<br><br>Of course, that does not mean that a tribal or horticultural people cannot overrun their resources. But they often do not. Perhaps they did, and learned their lesson.<br><br>At the least, those societies seem surely not to have had the kinds of cycles that Spengler writes about. What sorts of evolving they did have, I'd like to know.<br><br>I'm very, very ambivalent about civilization. It seems like a form of mental illness, or perhaps spiritual illness and yet I would like to have writing and the pursuit of knowledge and so on.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c2463037942641413874 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 3:08 PM</a><br><br>

More accurately he says the kwisatz haderach created a selfdom that brought about its end. Over and over the theme from that book is that to know the future is to be trapped by it, and that seems to be the position that we, your readers, are in. <br><br>By studying the cycles of history we’ve pretty much established there is no way to change the grand patterns or turns of the wheel, but by studying the details we know we can manipulate the arcs to a small degree. Take the end of the British Empire as an example. Toynbee figured out the grand pattern and was in a position where his superiors actually listened to what he had to say. Here was a great figure in the right place, with the right material, in the right political environment to redirect the course of the arc. The pattern fulfilled itself, but arced toward a softer end. <br><br>What struck me about the very lively discussion from two weeks ago is that there still seems to be a portion of your regular readership that seem to believe that knowledge equals power. Whereas the better way to put it is that knowledge points the road to power. <br><br>You have handed us the ability to change the course of arcs, and we are now trapped by the consequences of that knowledge. If we want to change the course of a major arc, then that would mean accepting the consequences of leadership and becoming a demagogue or even warlord. If we choose the path away from power, then we are trapped with the consequences of watching the arcs complete their course. <br><br>Ain’t pretty in either direction, and both are a trap in their own right. <br><br>Regards,<br><br>Varun<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6434070950064348689 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 3:43 PM</a><br><br>

The coming shift in our culture away from rationalism probably bothers me more than anything else I see ahead of us, and I'm not sure how we'll navigate that. I do think you do a play a role in helping some of us come to terms with it, and for that I'm grateful. <br>To me, the world does appear to be going a bit crazy, and if this is just the beginning, I guess we're all in for quite a wild ride! <br>I would also suggest that some of the resistance you face is a stale form of Romanticism, that very philosophical bent we will see rising to dominance and being renewed in some interesting ways. <br><br>I struggle with the frustration...all the challenges we're facing would be so much more manageable if we could just keep our heads!

One consequence of the scale and complexity of contemporary industrial civilization is that it's highly resilient against short term disruptions, because its industrial plant, resource base, and other basic systems are spread over most of the planet, and subject to a diversity of economic and political systems with an assortment of firewalls between them. That won't spare it the consequences of more gradual changes, to be sure, but it makes the fast-crash hypothesis very difficult to sustain. <br><br>Iuval, and yet we do repeat it, over and over again. That fact -- and I'd encourage you to study history if you doubt that it's a fact -- suggests that there's something amiss with your presuppositions. <br><br>Mustard, that's one possibility, but I don't think it's a large one. The guy's 70 years old, and he's just been elected to one of the most unforgiving jobs on the planet. My working guess for the most likely option at the moment is that he'll either die in office of natural causes sometime in his second term, or retire from sheer exhaustion at the end of that term. <br><br>Cherokee, I have no idea yet. Some sequences of posts are planned as books from the beginning; others just happen -- my forthcoming book <i>The Retro Future</i> was assembled after the fact. As for <i>Overshoot</i>, I get that -- it's very strong stuff. I didn't find it a bummer, but then I was already clear on the shape of the mess we were facing when I first read it back in 1982. <br><br>Phil, we arrived at it in the 1920s and 1930s, and then got a breathing space in which the corporate-bureaucratic plutocracy reentrenched itself. It may well be that Herr Schicklgruber's follies played a large role in making that breathing space happen; I've noted already that his most important impact on cultural history was that he made antisemitism unfashionable in most Western cultures for much of a century. <br><br>Bob, you're welcome -- and the misuse of the phrase grates on my ears too. <br><br>DiSc, historically, sudden catastrophes are actually good for societies in the long term. Look at the Black Death -- a third of the population of Europe dropped dead in a few ghastly years, and the result was the Renaissance and the Age of Exploration. A nuclear war would likely do the same thing, as you'd end up a generation down the road with a lot fewer people and nearly the same resource base. As for parallels with Roman history, it's important not to try to force too close a fit. Spengler's theory is that you have a fixed sequence of stages, followed by a "hang time" that can be decades, centuries, or millennia in length, depending on circumstances. The Roman world had about four centuries of hang time; ancient Egypt had thousands of years; our civilization, due to its waste of its resource base and disruption of the biosphere, has entered on the decline and fall process sooner than most (though there are comparable cases).<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c787342136661256918 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 5:21 PM</a><br><br>

Style reflects content; there are things you literally can't say, in any meaningful sense, in the kind of stilted journalistic prose that's popular these days. Since I want to say those things, and also to communicate the style of thinking that gives them their context and meaning, I need to use a style that corresponds to my subject. <br><br>Phil, if I'd been born 25 years earlier, in 1937, I'd likely have been a minor name in the ecological side of the Sixties movement and something of a mover and shaker in the appropriate tech scene of the 1970s, and would then have had to face the failure of my life's work when the Reagan-Thatcher counterrevolution swept into power in the early 1980s and foreclosed on our civilization's last real chance to avoid disaster. (For what it's worth, I'm glad to have been spared that.) I suppose it's just possible that one more voice might have made a difference, but that's in the realm of might-have-beens at this point. <br><br>Beetleswamp, I've got some enticing flavors of tea, too -- a good strong Schopenhauer black, a smoky Nietzsche, and a delicate Schumacher green, among others. ;-)<br><br>.Mallow, that's a politically astute move on Trump's part. For a very large number of Americans, UC Berkeley is the summary of everything that's wrong with American education and the cultural and political far left, and stripping it of federal funding would be met with resounding cheers in much of this country. <br><br>Dylan, we'll get to that, but it's going to take some time to reach the vantage point from which Spengler's comment makes sense. We'll be starting where Schopenhauer started, if that's any kind of a useful hint. <br><br>Jeff, why, yes -- at this stage in the historical process, someone always pops up to say that. ;-)<br><br>Robert, excellent! You get tonight's gold star for perspicacity. The US left these days is so busy being against things that it's forgotten to have any kind of positive agenda of its own, thus guaranteeing that it will never achieve more than a certain amount of drag on a process going the way it doesn't want. As for solar panels -- if you mean solar photovoltaics, almost certainly yes. Solar thermal technologies (water heaters, solar box ovens, passive solar heating, etc.) are quite another matter, but they require rethinking lifestyle issues, and of course nobody wants to do that nowadays. <br><br>Bob, other human societies have made themselves fatally dependent on nonrenewable resource bases that they proceeded to exhaust at a breakneck pace. That's what happened to the ancient Maya, for example: topsoil depletion and climate change caused by deforestation did to them what fossil fuel depletion and climate change caused by air pollution is doing to us. So our predicament is a known variation on the usual historical cycle, and can be modeled fairly readily by paying attention to what happened to other examples of that variation. <br><br>Chris, excellent! Yes, exactly -- and statistically, of course, there's likely to be a roughly equal number of chance events speeding up decline as there are slowing it down. <br><br>Ray, good. Spengler talks at some length about the interplay between the unique features of each great culture and its predictable features; its history unfolds in a familiar rhythm, but exactly what fills each of the standard niches depends on subtle factors not subject to prediction. Your example of ecological succession is germane: it's not always possible to figure out which pioneer plants will get to a burnt-over area first, but once they arrive, the usual processes of succession can be counted on to unfold in the usual way.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c1978537722858394734 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 5:42 PM</a><br><br>

Firstly, this very recent academic paper on the latest Solar EROEIs. There's quite a hot debate going on about this. <br>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516307066<br>This rebuts an earlier paper suggesting the EROEI of solar in higher latitudes was less than one! (But, I must admit, I believe even Charles Hall had issues with that study.) The authors of this paper claim instead 7-8 when taking into account extended system boundaries (as they must). Solar might be improving, but we're not there yet.<br><br>This still suggests a lean future and the problem of needing to be in a latitude closer to the equator for solar to work while having the conflicting problem of climate change most affecting the same area. And it's also worth noting that they exclude battery storage in their methodology! As soon as you add lithium storage, this value of 7-8 drops dramatically--possibly to about 2 from prior numbers I've seen (but that is my own speculation). <br><br>As well, since HSBC released their report suggesting the next energy crisis would start from late 2018, we've had OPEC and Russia cut back production to try to keep prices around $60. (Above $60 is about where academics suggest the price starts to significantly weigh on the global economy.) Some analysts have speculated whether OPEC is agreeing to cut back to cover declines in production--they don't usually stick to the plan so well! Trump is opening the oil taps but his related policies will effectively lead to a tax on gasoline for Americans and decreased demand. And the oil industry is scrambling to add automation to reduce costs. All of this means the next energy crisis might just be pushed back a year or so. Very difficult to say because none of the analysts agree! Many are 'bullish' on oil as if the rising price is a good thing rather than a symptom of our own decline. <br><br>And global oil supplies have dropped to an EROEI of about 15 now. The EROEI for fracking in the US is believed to be even lower: maybe 10-11. Any wonder that funding for the Arts is drying up given this as Charles Hall suggested it would when we reached 14?<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c5020864270792788247 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 5:44 PM</a><br><br>

The most popular TV show right now is Game of Thrones, based on George RR Martin’s "A Song of Fire and Ice" novels. The series portrays a pseudo-medieval world of rival warlords fighting tooth and nail for the throne after the previous imperial dynasty was overthrown. Very Spenglerian, if you ask me. The motto of the series is “Winter is Coming”, which also has very strong Spenglerian overtones. <br><br>Look at the popularity of the historical drama series Vikings (loosely based on the life and times of Ragnar Lodbrok), as well as shows like Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy, which portray the emerging barbarism rising from within our culture. Toynbee was right when he said that most other civilizations import the barbarians that do them in, while we breed our own as well.<br><br>Medieval fantasy films like Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings movies are still hugely popular, as are films set in the Classical World and Medieval Europe, such as 300, Troy, Alexander, Braveheart and any number of movies about King Arthur and Robin Hood. The local chapters of SCA and Amtgard in my area are thriving (you should see how many people turn out down at the local municipal park on Saturdays and Sundays for the weekly Amtgard events), while games like Magic The Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder and Warhammer are still a big hit with many young people.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c3332082108590035509 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 5:45 PM</a><br><br>

I just keep being frustrated and angry that they seem to think their not being aware of things means everyone wasn't aware of things. So I'm looking for ways to regain my equilibrium and continue doing my own local work (mostly micro journalism with a mini-newspaper on a 168-hour news cycle and homesteading) without using up a lot of my emotional energy being annoyed at Henny Pennies running around suddenly seeing the sky falling and being annoyed with me for not being surprised and panicked with them. <br><br>I know it's only been a couple of months since Trump's election, and both my formerly-complacent friends and I will adjust to the new dynamic.

I'd encourage you to read Spengler's at some point, because he discusses the interplay of chance events and historical cycles in quite some detail. As for sunshine, er, thank you, but we don't get much of that in the north central Appalachians in February! <br><br>Gavin, I'm far from sure I buy the psychopathy theory, but you're right about roles, of course. At each point along the historical cycle, the opportunities that exist for individuals are constrained by choices already made; the world is never a blank slate, and each of us grows up subject to powerful shaping forces from culture and history that make us what we are. Can we do something original nonetheless? Sure, but only within the constraints of our culture and our time. <br><br>Kabobyak, as I've written at length in previous posts, I think it's quite possible that some mushroom clouds and some reactor meltdowns will help punctuate the decline and fall of our civilization. Sudden events causing lots of deaths are a routine concomitant of decline, you know. I won't argue, though, that it's intriguing to watch people who claim to be liberal loudly calling for conflict with Russia and defending the integrity of the CIA -- a classic example of the dissolution of ideology in favor of personality, of the kind that usually happens at this point in the cycle. <br><br>J Gav, Spengler got savaged by almost everybody, because the future he portrayed flies in the face of all the fondest beliefs of our culture. I would argue that most of the criticism directed at him either unintentionally or deliberately set up straw men to belabor, and fixated on buzzwords such as "historicism" rather than grappling with the serious morphological thinking that underlies his project. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Johojo, I haven't read de Riencourt; clearly I'll have to remedy that at some point. <br><br>Dammerung, if you want to engage with the spirits of the land, there are plenty of ways to do so; given your political leanings, probably folkish Asatru would be the most congenial option for you, as a lot of the other options (including the kind of Druidry I practice, btw) welcome people of all skin colors. As for Christianity, well, classical Paganism had the same kind of presence in the ancient world, and where is it now? <br><br>Adrian, thanks for this. Of course other, non-urban Native American societies had their own less extreme cycles of rise and fall, which have been identified in other non-urban societies around the world; there seems to be something about the urban form that shifts the cyclic process into overdrive (I've suggested one mechanism for that in a three-part post <a href=../../2015/07/the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-one.html rel=nofollow>here</a>, <a href=../../2015/07/the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-two.html rel=nofollow>here</a>, and <a href=../../2015/07/the-cimmerian-hypothesis-part-three-end.html rel=nofollow>here</a>.) It's the cycle of civilized, urban societies I'm mostly discussing here, since that's the cycle we're caught up in; still, you're right that there are less drastic cycles, and a broader view might be useful in some contexts.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6181831288792971771 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 6:04 PM</a><br><br>

That's one of the things that's behind my dismissal of the handwaving about fracking. <br><br>Dan, excellent! A very solid summary. I hope my other readers are taking notes. <br><br>Jordan, trust me, some people are just as angered by my posts on the big picture as you are by some of my posts on politics. I try to be an equal opportunity offender!<br><br>Shark, hmm. It seems to me that you're pretty thoroughly misstating the basic arguments of both authors. Spengler doesn't ground his arguments in metaphysics; he engages in a certain amount of metaphysical speculation on top, but his argument is explicitly based on morphology, not metaphysics. He's doing exactly the kind of thinking that led to evolutionary theory: here are pervasive similarities, how can we construct a model that accounts for them? As for Toynbee, there you're frankly even further off base, because he defined, in vast detail, a specific cause for the failure of civilizations: leadership failure caused by predictable social transformations within the ruling minority of each civilization. I encourage you to read volumes IV, V, and VI of his unabridged <i>A Study of History</i>, where he deals with this specific theory of causation in encyclopedic detail. <br><br>You're quite correct, as it happens, that neither of them dealt with resource depletion, or for that matter with the disruption of the biosphere due to environmental pollution. That's a place where both models can be improved, and I've tried to do that with my model of catabolic collapse. What I've tried to show, though, is that resource depletion and environmental pollution fit neatly into the cyclic theory of history, providing an explanation for one thing neither Toynbee nor Spengler really managed to account for -- the varying survival times of civilizations once they pass through the roughly thousand-year process of emergence and stabilization. It's very common, as I'm sure you know, for successful theories to be refined and extended by the labors of later scholars, and that's what's going on in my discussions here. <br><br>With regard to your second point, I challenge you to quote me a single statement anywhere on this blog, or in my writings, that supports this claim of yours that I think the period from 1970 to 2005 is "the turning point of all human history." Hint: you won't find one. I've written at some length about that period because decisions made during it have had a significant impact on the period from 2006 to 2017 -- in other words, the period during which <i>The Archdruid Report</i> has been appearing. Obviously I can't know what I would have thought if I'd been born at some different time, so your rhetorical jabs are beside the point. When you claim I've never clarified the time frame of my predictions, by the way, here again you're falsifying my position; I've pointed out many a time that we're in the early phases of a long ragged decline lasting one to three centuries.

The notion that one person can transform the world is very deeply rooted in our culture, and it's not entirely untrue; like most damaging beliefs, it's a half-truth. Each of us can change the world, but how we can change it is determined by our cultural and historical context -- and of course it's also true that in a world in which everyone can change the world, no one person gets to change everything! It can be a real struggle, though, to break through the binary between "you can change everything" and "no one can change anything," and grasp the many ways in which we all, to use a New Age term, help co-create the future. <br><br>Paulo, and that's just it. Decline is like the weather. Specifically, it's like the weather in a temperate climate, where summer turns to stormy, blustery autumn, and then to the bitter cold and snow of winter, no matter what you do or don't do about it. You can take constructive action -- put in insulation, make sure you've got plenty of food and firewood, and the rest of it -- but that's not going to make winter go away any sooner than the cycle of the seasons permits. <br><br>Nancy, I'd encourage you to get the two volume Windham Press edition, not one of the abridged editions. Spengler deserves to be read slowly, at his full length, not chopped up as even the best abridgments do. <br><br>PhilipW, the argument that you're making is one of the standard flavors of the faith in progress I've anatomized and challenged so often here, right down to the three-part taxonomy -- hunter-gatherer society, agricultural society, industrial society -- filling the usual roles in the mythology of progress. (This taxonomy leaves out a couple of very widespread modes of human ecology, by the way, but we can let that pass for now.) Your claim that history is transitioning to a new state of "planetary connectedness" is unproven at best, and has uncomfortable parallels in the past; educated Romans in the second and third century CE, for example, were just as sure that the spread of the Empire meant the transition from the national consciousness of earlier periods to a new and enduring age of universal peace. History shows what happened instead. <br><br>By the way, hunter-gatherer societies thrived quite successfully alongside agricultural ones until the industrial-colonial system squeezed them out and left the handful of surviving groups we have now. (As industrial civilization finishes its decline and fall, I expect hunter-gatherer societies to reemerge in places that are unsuited to agriculture, village horticulture, or nomadic pastoralism.) It's also happened rather more often than once, especially in the New World, that urban agricultural societies have collapsed and given way to far simpler hunter-gatherer, village horticultural, or nomadic pastoral human ecologies. The insistence that progress is irreversible -- that Cthulhu always swims forward, if you like -- is a faith-based claim, not a reflection of historical fact. <br><br>SV Koho, "the Second Religiosity" isn't my term, it's Spengler's, and it refers specifically to the resurgence of religion at the twilight of the age of rationalism that every civilization goes through. I've read the Michael Grant book, btw -- a very solid piece of work.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c2993611365783106747 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 6:56 PM</a><br><br>

Today, yes they go longer without repairs, but once they need repairs all bets are off. Way off... Just ask anybody who's had to pay for one of those repairs. Back in the 1970's I had a 1971 VW Bus, there wasn't much on that I couldn't repair or maintain myself with very few tools and nothing in the way of electronics besides a basic voltmeter. I even re-built the engine myself, only sending the case out for boring, all the rest of the work done myself, in my apartment parking lot. I could pull the engine and transaxle out <b>by myself</b> in 1/2 hour using only basic hand tools and a simple cart. And parts were dirt cheap. Now I'll agree, <b>as long as it's working</b>, the modern vehicle seems better, however once you have problems, the picture changes very quickly. Do the work your self? Fat chance!<br><br>I knew a retired couple in the 1970's that took their VW Camper all over South America in the 1970's, nowhere were they ever stranded, unable to get repairs.<br><br>Today you need 100's of thousands of $ of equipment just to do repairs. Not to mention the cost of the parts. I won't detail the <b>one electronic module</b> failure that disabled the windows, wipers, interior lights, 4WD, AC and other functions on my 1997 Ford Pickup. ONE MODULE. And things have gotten lots worse since then.<br><br>Remember, the Ford Model T came with a basic set of tools to do most types of repairs needed, almost anywhere.<br><br>I'll make the same claim for Ham Radio equipment, I can still easily repair a receiver or transmitter from the 1940's, 1950's, 1960's or 1970's, even though parts haven't been made for decades. I can substitute a tube for one I can't get (billions were made that are still available) rewind a coil or transformer, etc. However if the specialized custom parts aren't available for a 1980's and on radio, you have a doorstop. Sometimes you can still find a junk radio with the part you need, but often that's the part that's also dead in the parts radio.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c7420430139313749594 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 7:06 PM</a><br><br>

It seems to me that the cyclic behavior of civilization as stated by Spengler and Toynbee is linear from an "evolution of the soul " perspective. As the masses of individuals don't really grow much out of feeding , fighting and fornicating; so go their civilizations. There seems to be some high point where the arts, philosophy, philanthropy gain some ground only to come crashing down again. Civilizations are as mad as a madman trying the same thing over and over expecting different results. There is some argument to paradigm shifts and 2nd religiosity , I do see both those phenomenon. If humanity keeps repeating the same cycle are they enough of a change, obviously not. When cornered, you chip away a piece as a token so that you may pass. But you never give it all up.<br>Different costumes same civilizations and this one is following the trajectory of the others, as I see it. Durga, the Hindu Goddess and her belt of skulls is about to get another notch.<br> The way I see it all is not lost when all still remains to be gained, if not for the civilization then for the individual within the civilization.As individuals we have many civilizations within ourselves, to name a few: the biological, mental, spiritual. if we continue to smoke two packs a day can one predict what will most probably happen to the biological? And so on with all the other civilizations within ourselves; where do we need to introduce a revolution? What possibilities have we disregarded day after day ?

I'd like to recommend Peter Turchin, who I know has also been mentioned, as having some interesting observations on this in his 2009 paper "Long-Term Population Cycles in Human Societies". <br><br>As Turchin notes, and is well known in system dynamics and engineering process control, systems which are dynamically unstable are prone to oscillation. Generally speaking, this happens when factors leading to positive feedback act on a shorter timescale than those providing negative feedback. Turchin notes second-order oscillatory responses in human populations in agrarian societies, but the same principles should apply to many aspects of human societies. This gets close to being an underlying mechanism explaining the cyclic appearance of history described by Spengler and others (I've tried reading Spengler but found it very hard going without a liberal arts background).<br><br>The key thing that seemed to enable this with civilisations was the development of agriculture, which increased human reproduction rate(1.) and made the positive feedback (population leading to population growth) faster than the natural negative feedbacks such as environmental limits. Periodic overshoot and recovery is the result. When this operates inside a system with hard limits, you can get limit cycles, which I think was what Bill was showing in a quite general way. <br><br>So if this is the case, no, hunter gatherer societies are not generally subject to these kinds of cycles because their rate of reproduction and cultural adaptation is so much slower than the balancing feedback they get from the systems they live within. It seems to be an issue with more complex civilisations based on farming (that would be all of them).<br><br>Cheers,<br>Graeme<br><br>1.

You seem to have gotten yourself caught in a binary or two, my friend. <br><br>The first, as I'm reading you, is an assumption that if you can't fix everything then you can't really fix anything. The arc of history is set, and even a kwizatz haderach who knows the future can't change that. The way out of that immobilizing trap is to shift your focus. Step outside and look around. The future will also play out in the little piece of the world you can see. That future has arcs that are much smaller and more subject to your own personal influence. In a hundred years, will that little piece of the world be a haven of contentment or a hive of scum and villainy?<br><br>The other binary is that, in order to affect change, one must accept the consequences of leadership. It's either that or choose a path away from power which, in this binary, is the way of helplessness. <br><br>I've seen the consequences of leadership and I get what you mean, but there are different levels of engagement and different modes of leadership. One can lead by example, for instance, or lead a food forest workshop. One could also recognize that (and I like this phrase of yours) "knowledge points the road to power", and take on the role of a mentat. There will always be consequences to your actions, but you can always take steps to manage your exposure to risk.<br><br>If the role of mentat appeals to you, I would recommended "Green Wizardry" by our esteemed host.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c1902775924814379421 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 9:09 PM</a><br><br>

I've no argument with your cyclical theme, JMG - it fits with what has become obvious to me over these many decades- human nature doesn't change much over the years - we seem to do the same things, have the same responses, although clothed in slightly different styles.<br> <br>One thing I am finding, though, as collapse/decline starts to hit harder, is that I'm becoming more focused on those suffering, and my philosophical interest takes a back seat. Life has become more difficult for me, for those around me, and for thousands that I read about, so I'm taking more time offline trying to do things locally to help. That, and write poems and stories that might help people look at these issues. Of course there is value in wondering what the patterns are, but I'm spending more time looking at the actual situations, to see if I can be of help. <br><br>I do think this new administration looks like it could precipitate rapid decline (not total, unless he hits the nukes in a tantrum, but serious and not as easily adjusted to) and I believe it's worth speaking out against the things they want to do. I know decline is inevitableSo is death. As I get older, I am really <i>experiencing</i> that fact - not a theory, but real - there's no negotiating my way out. So the only criteria, then, is how have I lived? Thus, I'm speaking out and working to relieve suffering, even when I know suffering and decline are not "solvable". It's keeping me hugely busy (that and the petite homestead)... so that's why I haven't been around, FWIW.

Classical civilization inherited a lot from Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Minoan Crete, put their own spin on it, added in a whole bunch of its own material, and handed on the result to us, after all. I admit I wish I could know what the civilizations after ours are going to make out of what they get from us. <br><br>RPC, thanks for the correction. I have no opinion about cars, since I don't own or drive one, and never have. <br><br>James, I'll be interested to see what you think of the upcoming posts, then. We're going to start with the British epistemologists and Kant, very briefly, to set the stage for the people I mostly want to talk about. <br><br>H. Bustos, the Greeks had ample history behind them to draw up a very detailed cyclical theory of history; you'll want to check out Polybius sometime. That aside, one of the things that can happen (though it doesn't always happen, not by a long shot) is that the legacies of one era can provide new possibilities for another. I've discussed some of the sustainable technologies of our time that might help the next cycle of civilization <a href=../../2014/01/seven-sustainable-technologies.html rel=nofollow>here</a>; you'll be pleased to know the printing press is among them. <br><br>Unknown, I'll certainly put some thought into it, though! <br><br>Lew, that was the first round of Caesarism in the western world -- it got much more intense in Europe, as I'm sure you're well aware. We're apparently moving into the second round now. <br><br>Userfriendlyyy, hmm! I wasn't even thinking about Carlyle. It simply struck me as one of the standard offshoots of the modern world's overdeveloped sense of entitlement. <br><br>Robert, I'm far from sure I'd agree with that. Mercantile networks as a partial replacement for governments go back a long ways -- China had them a very long time ago, and so did ancient Greece. They tend to thrive in periods of economic and political stability, and go to bits in a hurry once those end. My take is that we'll see another round of the going to bits as globalism ends over the decades ahead. <br><br>Philip, sudden crises of the sort you're describing generally are very common in history. With very few exceptions, they're hiccups. Think of the Black Death hitting medieval Europe, or the equivalent pandemics in 2nd and 3rd century CE Rome -- vast body counts, and a generation later things were chugging ahead smoothly. The thing to do, whenever you want to figure out what an event is likely to do, is look for historical parallels and see what happened the last time around! <br><br>Renaissance, where on earth do you work? The We Actually Have A Clue Corporation, or what? <br><br>Mustard, that's pretty good, barring Sagan's inevitable spin on words like "true." I wonder if he ever quite realized that when he wrote that, astrology was in the middle of one of its more recent golden ages...<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c664102547452493412 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 11:23 PM</a><br><br>

My experience with animals is that they're just as cantankerous, error-prone, and idiosyncratic as you and I. <br><br>Armata, I'll do the Wagner sequence if I need a break and can handle maybe twenty comments a week. Not that that isn't tempting sometimes! ;-) Seriously, it's on the list, and some of the philosophy we're discussing actually makes a decent lead-in to it. As for deindustrial warfare, that's probably going to be one focus of a future series getting further into dark age conditions in future North America. <br><br>Tyler, well, I'm pretty sure posts on philosophy won't field me 500 comments a week, so that's potentially a consideration! <br><br>Varun, nah, you're drawing things far too narrowly. Demagogues and warlords actually have very little power to change things -- they are creatures respectively of the movements they lead and the warbands they command, and have to keep giving their followers what the latter want and expect or down they go. The real source of power at this point in the game is the ability to shape thinking, to dynamite unquestioned presuppositions, to walk away from a losing game and do something less useless -- and all these are things each of us can do, and model for others. More on this in a later post. <br><br>Lilith, the shift away from rationalism is driven, in our civilization as in every other, by the failures of rationalism itself -- and those in turn derive from the awkward fact that no logical system can prove its own axioms. The rational always rests on unproven and irrational presuppositions, and "Garbage In, Garbage Out" is a good guide to the results! After the initial burst of craziness, the more useful achievements of each Age of Reason are absorbed into the traditions that come after; just as classical logic ended up being taught in medieval monasteries and universities, it's pretty much a given that the scientific method will be taught in the religious schools of the future, whatever form those happen to take. Granted, getting there is a rough road...<br><br>Asher, many thanks for this. As the EROEI on petroleum slides, expect a lot of "alternative" energy resources that are propped up on the energy surpluses from fossil fuels to go away, too -- while technologies that actually pay for themselves, such as homescale solar thermal, may yet come into their own. <br><br>Armata, the last time I hung out with any significant number of fans of medieval fantasy et al., they were as fixated on the myth of progress as everyone else -- it was because they believed devoutly in progress that they were able to play at being knights and ladies. If you have a chance, ask around and see if that's changed. If it has, then -- well in the immortal words of Ghan-buri-Ghan, "Wind is changing!"<br><br>Tideshift, oh, I know. You might try a weary look and words to the effect of, "Yeah, this is what I've been trying to tell you about for the last decade." It may not get a clue through the concrete, but those doing the decapitated chicken routine may avoid your presence while doing so, which is something. <br><br>Unknown, ahem. I was trying to be polite. ;-)<br><br>Jim, for heaven's sake, I've written repeatedly and extensively about climate change. Do a search in the archive for terms such as "methane," "Greenland," and "anthropogenic" and see what you find. <br><br>August_Moon, thanks for this.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c1929145099500647497 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 11:42 PM</a><br><br>

Moreover, it is, writ large, a nice analogue for what you envisage as a likely outcome for industrial civilization--and all of the "externalities" that are part and parcel to the treatment of the ultimately fatal issue. <br><br> A few years before her death she was diagnosed with a form of lung cancer one does not survive. Contemporary methods of treating the disease being what they are she limped along for a good five years or so in graduate, albeit accelerating, stages of decline. First it was the nausea from the chemo, then the radiation burns, the the to COPD and emphysema, then the necrotic tooth decay as a result of the radiation, then the spontaneous hemothorax that led to the talc surgery, that led to the weeping lungs, that led to chronic infections, that led to to the insertion of a plastic stint to widen her airway, which eventually led to that stint deteriorating, disintegrating, and severing a major blood vessel. The end.<br> <br> Concomitantly, as time went on, her friends and siblings (all much older, wiser, smarter, or whatever than I) repeated vacuous mantras--"miracles happen every day", you get the idea-- and any observation that things were getting obviously worse was met with, at best, a glowering look, and, at worst, a full on temper tantrum-- again, all coming from people fond of declaring how certain they were she was going to get better.<br><br> It was a truly interesting case of mass dissonance. It was as if I had happened across a house fire, and encountered the home owners on the front lawn frantically running in circles with a weak streamed garden hose, and saying "it looks like your house is really on fire." Meanwhile they shout at me that all at the same time, 1) it was impossible that their house is on fire, 2) the garden hose would put out the fire, and 3) that the universe was going to put out the fire anyway on account of they being specially favored. <br><br>How is this relevant? If I had to guess as a civilization we are somewhere between the nausea of the chemo, and the radiation burns. There's a whole lot of flailing attempts at treatment, and their attendant externalities to deal with, along the corridor to the civilizational morgue. Not that there is anything wrong or unnatural about personal or civilizational death--some can be prevented, all are inevitable. <br><br>--Anonymous Millenial<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c7993724028199748043 title="comment permalink">2/2/17, 11:43 PM</a><br><br>

Bashing Berkeley is a very astute move on the part of the Orange Julius.<br><br>Blue Sun, considering who owns most of the guns in this country, and which side the police and military enlisted personnel almost unanimously support, if anything like that does happen to Trump, I'm worried that people on the left may face mass beatings and killings, with a death toll in the thousands or higher. I hope to the gods that doesn't happen, as there are a lot of people I care about who would likely get caught up in it. <br><br>Alfredo, the Druid teachings I follow hold that this world, the world of human beings experiencing greed and hunger and a distinct lack of the brotherhood of man, is a necessary stage or mode of consciousness through which every soul must pass in due time. When we outgrow it, we move to a different stage or mode of consciousness, and the world stays the way it is so that it can provide the same experience to those who need it. Thus there's only so much change you can make in the world -- though there's some, and making such changes are an important part of grappling with this mode of being. The changes that matter are those you make to yourself. <br><br>Stephen, thank you. Exactly; despite the claims of the mythology of progress, nobody promised us a free ride to something better. <br><br>Caelan, okay, you pulled a comment of mine out of context and tossed it somewhere where a troll could yell at it. So? <br><br>Graeme, good. You can get the same results by applying standard systems theory to human societies and noting the relationship between the generational cycle and the pace of change. I may just do a post on that down the road a bit. <br><br>Unknown, "hubris" is a gentle way of putting it. As I noted in <a href=../../2016/12/the-fifth-side-of-triangle.html rel=nofollow>an earlier post</a>, Hegelian philosophy applied to history seems to be a guaranteed ticket to bad predictions. <br><br>Cathy, Zen masters like to say "talk doesn't cook the rice."

They can not be reliably explained by cause-effect phenomena like classic systems, because the parts of the system develop relationships among themselves that escape our knowledge and sometimes our understanding. A whole new body of mathematics is being developed to grasp complex systems but we are really nowhere near close to be able to make useful predictions of complex system behavior.<br> I am not sure if the global nature of the system makes it more resilient. The system is optimized to generate money (in short term) for only one small part of humanity, resilience is not a goal not by far. As a consequence most to the heavy equipment used by electric generation is produced in very few countries. The same goes for grain, and many other essential utilities and raw materials. A failure in one of this critical supply chains can have a cascade of disastrous consequences where no one is expecting. The pressure is high - seven billion of us - and the risks are pilling up - climate change, social unrest, geopolitical changes, resource depletion.You are right, I can not offer a reason for a fast collapse, that is the nature of complex systems. But I offer good reason to knock globalization down a few levels, a return to a more local economies.<br>Another reason is that diverse communities are far more agile and creative finding solutions for different challenges. I find it hard to understand the fascinations with empires, monolithic political entities devoted to maintain the status quo. There was incomparable more technological, scientific and social innovation in the dozens of competing small nations and free city states of the Middle Age Europe, than in 3000 years or so of the Egyptian empire, not to mention the Romans that did little more than aqueducts.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c8962138429233556704 title="comment permalink">2/3/17, 2:12 AM</a><br><br>

I believe Plato made a similar remark about "corruption by wealth " as a flaw of democracy, though he said that all democracies are subject to it not only modern democracies. Further based on your remark about assassination of Caesar , I believe U.S. would have went down similar path in 1930s itself if "Business Plot" had been executed (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot). Further , I predicted that this discussion was eventually going to come down to discussion on philosophy.<br> <br>Here, I would like to share an observation(or I should say experience) which I believe will be helpful to you, although you probably know it already. When I first read about peak oil and its aftermath on this blog , I was convinced almost immediately about its viability. I even wondered why many were outrightly rejecting it. After reading a good number of comments on several different posts , I realized that prime reason many were rejecting ideas presented on this blog is because they were not used to "Systems Thinking". To be more specific, unlike other ,I was able to envision how whole of infrastructure of industrial society is based on fossile fuels because of "system thinking". I realized that food I consume everyday, my smartphone and other eletronics , water which is being pumped to my house everyday and most of other things are essentially based on fossil fuels . Even when very few of things are directly consuming fossil fuel , everything indirectly consumes fossile fuel. Many of the other readers were not able to see this despite being obvious (can be even called "comman sense") , cause of which I believe that they are not unaware of "systems theory". Hence , I believe that if you write posts on systems theory(if you haven't already) , then many more readers will be able to understand ideas posed on your blog much more easily. They help be able to how different parts of the society interact with one other and failure of even one part can have drastic consequences for whole society. Hence, if you do a series of posts on "systems thinking" before posts on philosophy than readers will better able to understand the ideas you present.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c7215758148103226343 title="comment permalink">2/3/17, 3:29 AM</a><br><br>

I've just heard it used incorrectly along with "free energy" to describe mythical machines that produce energy without fuel, and somehow defy the laws of thermodynamics. <br>Speaking of which, I think the Gibbs free energy equation is a good expression of what I'm trying to say. I call it the "no free lunch, except from the sun" equation. <br>deltaG = deltaH - t deltaS . If you put aside the change in enthalpy (which I think is reasonable, in terms of the point I am making, but am open to arguments) it basically means that the entropy of any system will either stay the same (in the case of no reactions) or increase unless energy is added from another system.<br>In our case, the sun is that other system. So it could be said that use of energy on earth, beyond that which comes from the sun, will increase entropy. I consider life to be negentropy, or order. <br>As for PV, the reason I question its viability is its dependence on batteries and the rest of its "technological suite", as JMG puts it. Maybe use of mechanical storage, such as water towers with hydroelectric generators would be viable.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c7295069226655342307></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/07593620523101022936 rel=nofollow>gwizard43</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I'm looking at a statement that reads:<br><br>"Courteous, concise comments relevant to the topic of the current week's post are welcome, whether or not they agree with the views expressed here, and I try to respond to each comment as time permits. Long screeds proclaiming the infallibility of some ideology or other, however, will be deleted; so will repeated attempts to hammer on a point already addressed; so will comments containing profanity, abusive language, flamebaiting and the like -- I filled up my supply of Troll Bingo cards years ago and have no interest in adding any more to my collection; and so will sales spam and offers of "guest posts" pitching products. I'm quite aware that the concept of polite discourse is hopelessly dowdy and out of date, but then so are a good many other things we will have to preserve, or laboriously reinvent, on the long road down from Hubbert's peak."<br><br>And in fact as a follower of this blog since 2009, and a weekly follower since the 'Merlin's Time' post in mid-2010, I can attest that it *used* to be like that. Polite discourse, indeed, where flame-baiters were kept in check - this was the hallmark of this blog's comment sections. And that made for a truly scintillating read, which encouraged participation.<br><br>And yet when I look through this week's comment sections - I see the following comments, interestingly, all from the same source - the same source that's been posting similar comments since he showed up a few months back - and if this isn't flamebaiting, then I don't know the meaning of the word:<br><br>"At this point, it looks to me like you are trolling. You and your fellow-travelers on the far Left can believe whatever you wish to believe. Lie to yourselves all you want. The rest of us who haven’t drunk the Kool-Aid or have liberated ourselves from the lies of the Cult of Progress are the ones who are going to win this war. Praise Kek!"<br><br>"These people never learn, do they? Maybe a clue-by-four upside the head. Assuming their skulls aren't so thick even that won't do the trick, which seems pretty likely judging from what I have seen so far."<br><br>"As a Donald Trump supporter and a working class white who identifies as a paleoconservative and a right-wing patriot, I am having a ball watching these idiots self-destruct."<br><br>"To the activist Left: Keep it up fools. You're playing right into our hands and giving up [sic] exactly what we want."<br><br>This sort of thing has sadly become routine here, and as far as I can tell it began when the proclaimed alt-righters showed up.<br><br>So, JMG, my comment this week isn't on the topic you wrote about, as interesting as that is, but rather a direct question in regard to the above observation:<br><br>The comments I've quoted above are clearly not courteous, and do not constitute "polite discourse" - but they and many others like them in recent months have made it through the filter. What gives? <br><br>Do you disagree? If not, then why must we slog through such jeering, mocking comments that are coming to comprise an ever larger proportion of what was once a shining example of how polite and intelligent and engaging a blog comment section could be?<br><br>One thing I can state for certain: this sort of behavior, which has been permitted to occur over and over, now makes this a much less welcome forum - and not just for those on the left. I suspect there are a fair number of commenters (myself included) who now think twice before posting because they simply don't want to deal with these alt-righters - who ironically seem just as sensitive to any comments that may be interpreted in such a way as to include some fugitive strand of dreaded/hated Leftist thought as any PC professor they despise is to comments that may manifest emanations of Right or White thinking.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c7295069226655342307 title="comment permalink">2/3/17, 12:27 PM</a><br><br>

I don't know that I fully agree with him on everything, but this strikes me as the sort of sober, clear-eyed analysis of what's going on today that is going to be necessary for the left to engage in if we want to regain power and work to make the world a better place, rather than continue to flail around in pure reactionary mode and risk setting the stage for even worse counter-reactions than have already occurred.<br><br>I had to put in my email to get to the full article, but I believe you can just put in a fake address if you really want to.

Via Kant and Schopenhauer, and that yearning harmonic suspension? May I book my ticket now, please?<br><br>Could be topical. My meagre understanding is that Wagner turned to myth and epic after his disillusioning experience of radical politics. Specifically, the failed liberal-radical revolution in Germany in 1848-49, when he took to the barricades in Dresden alongside Bakunin, and the suppression of the second French republic by the conservative revolution of that would-be Caesar, Louis Napoleon.<br><br>Don't think you would get only twenty comments a week, though. Did you imagine, when you began your 'Druid reflections' eleven years ago, that you would soon enough be fielding 500? There are many of us who are delighted to enter this space where our hunger for myth is not dismissed as escapist fantasy nor indulged and exploited commercially, but treated with intellectual seriousness and rigour.<br><br>When I was learning German back in the 80s, Wagner was an object of suspicion. Germans were preoccupied with 'overcoming the past' and, quite rightly, with decontaminating their culture from anything tainted with National Socialism, and Wagner was dangerously close to the toxic ground zero from which it all sprang. Hence, I suppose, those deconstructionist opera productions we heard about in which Alberich or some other character in the Ring was depicted carrying a plastic bag from the Aldi supermarket. I don't think the Nazi catastrophe can ever be 'overcome' - we Europeans live in a humbled post-Enlightenment culture and in that sense are perhaps more prepared than some for the End of Progress - but I for one certainly feel ready to engage seriously with Wagner.<br><br>Alan<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6700689475881238727 title="comment permalink">2/3/17, 2:01 PM</a><br><br>

We have also seen the use of speech codes and rhetoric about "microagressions", "safe spaces" and the like used to silence dissent on college campuses. In many cases, we have seen left wing extremists use violence to silence and intimidate those they don't agree with and all too often, university administrations not only failed to take action but expressed support for the leftist thugs who were responsible.

For if one were to imagine that the quite incalculable sum of energy which has been expended on behalf of this tendency in the world had not been placed at the service of understanding, but applied instead to the practical, i.e. egotistical goals of individuals and nations, then man's instinctive lust for life would probably have been so weakened amidst general wars of extinction and unceasing migrations that, with suicide having become habitual, the individual would be bound to feel the last remnant of a sense of duty when, like some inhabitant of the Fijian islands, he throttles his parents as their son, and his friend as a friend - a practical pessimism which could generate a horrifying ethic of genocide out of pity…"<br><br>"From Socrates onwards, the mechanism of concepts, judgments and conclusions was prized, above all other abilities, as the highest activity and most admirable gift of nature..<br>At present, however, Science, spurred on by its powerful delusion, is hurrying unstoppably to its limits, where the optimism hidden in the essence of logic will founder and break up…"<br><br>"Only when the spirit of Science has been carried to its limits and its claim to universal validity negated by the demonstration of these limits might one hope for a rebirth of tragedy…"<br><br>"what I understand by the Spirit of Science is the belief, which first came to light in the person of Socrates, that the depths of nature can be fathomed and that knowledge can heal all ills…"<br><br>Nietzsche, long before Gödell or Planck ("quanta world") knows the "limits of science", and the childish claim that science "it can heal all the ills" you call this now "the religion of progress"<br><br>What Nietzsche calls back with the "Old Tragedy" or the "The Dyonisiac" is the return to Nature, to the sense of "oneness" or "re-union" with the others fellow men and nature a strong and re-new feeling to be alive; for example when he said:<br><br>"Not only is the bond between human beings renewed by the magic of the Dionysiac, but Nature, alienated, inimical, or subjugated, celebrates once more her festival of reconciliation with her lost son, Humankind<br><br>Now the slave is a freeman, now all the rigid, hostile barriers, which necessity, caprice, or 'impudent fashion' have established between human beings, break asunder. Now, hearing this gospel of universal harmony, each person feels himself to be not simply united, reconciled or merged with his neighbour, but quite literally one with him, as if the Veil of Maya had been torn apart, so that mere shreds of it flutter before the mysterious primordial unity (das Ur-Eine)"<br><br>So, Science as the real "Veil of Maya"<br><br><br>"...festival of reconciliation with her lost son, Humankind", what beautiful words!<br><br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c1364191949815351937 title="comment permalink">2/3/17, 2:26 PM</a><br><br>

That is bad enough. However, it is starting to get annoying when you hear of people trying to equate every tiny event with a major facet of history. Thus you hear of how Trump sends out a mean tweet and people jump on it and say "This proves that America is now a proto Fascist-state!" Uhhh, no! Time to get your hand off of it. That is why it is a relief to come to this site. You get a chance to hear about aspects of the Big Picture. At the same time, this can give you unexpected feelings though.<br> <br> In the thoughtful 1951 novel "Day of the Triffids" the main character is standing in an abandoned London and reflecting, thinks: "When I was by myself in the country I could recall the pleasantness of the former life; among the scabrous, slowly perishing buildings I seemed able to recall only the muddle, the frustration, the unaimed drive, the all-pervading clangour of empty vessels, and I became uncertain how much we had lost.." and I have to admit that 75 years later I have the same feelings sometimes. Seriously, take out the pure sciences and the useful technologies from our modern culture and how much of it is really worth saving? Our modern arts? Our political philosophies? Our environmnetal behaviors? Our economic and financial systems? Our social culture with how we treat other people? Our modern culture is not exactly covering itself with glory here. For a long time, I have thought that in terms of maturity of a culture, we are still stuck in our teenage years.<br><br> There is one thing that I also began to wonder about tonight and it is this. JMG has made no secret of the fact that he believes that industrial civilisation is going away due to the running down of affordable supplies of oil. All our eggs are in that particular basket here. OK, fair enough. In this one can say that this time it WILL be different in that for a geological age, any future civilisation will not have access to large supplies of oil to power itself with. I am beginning to wonder, however, how many people read the words "industrial civilisation is going away" but are hearing in their minds the words "civilisation is going away". The important qualification here is the word "industrial". I have no idea what the next civilisation will look like (which is why I could not come up with a feasible entry in the last Space Bats competition) but there will be some shape or form of civilisation after this era is over. We just won't recognize it is all. Certainly they will think radically differently to us - I hope.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c8347375042889103360 title="comment permalink">2/3/17, 7:00 PM</a><br><br>

I'd encourage you to read Clive Ponting's <i>A Green History of the World</i> or one of the other, more recent surveys of the role of environmental degradation in the fall of civilizations, to get a sense of just how normal our stupidity is. <br><br>Tony, the abandonment of efforts toward sustainability in the early 1980s is one of several significant turning points in the history of modern industrial civilization, sure. I've cited others -- for example, 1914 as the beginning of the end of European global dominance -- and we quite possibly have another coming up in the next decade or so, depending on just how far the current populist wave gets before it breaks and flows back out to sea. The fact remains that we're talking about one turning point in the history of one civilization, not "the turning point of all human history" -- and the difference between those is not a small one, you know. That's why I was objecting to Seaweed Shark's rhetorical distortion. <br><br>Crow Hill, only in terms of total body count. <br><br>LunarApprentice, that's a huge question, of course, and one that would take a couple of posts at least to sort out! I hope to get into those issues as we proceed. The core issue, though, is simple enough to state. The core claim of rationalism is that this ramshackle set of mental activities we call "reasoning" provides the only valid key to the real nature of things -- and that claim can't be proved. If you try to use reasoning to prove it, after all, you're assuming the validity of reasoning, which is what you're claiming to prove... <br><br>Gabriela, I'm certainly not going to argue against the idea of dismantling the globalized economy and downshifting to less technologically and organizationally complex social and economic forms! That's been a central theme of this blog from the start, and for good reason. My only quibble was with your earlier argument's focus on catastrophe. May I offer a constructive suggestion? People have been proclaiming the imminent end of the world for so long that it no longer gets the reaction it once did; if you want to encourage people to support relocalization, talk about the positive benefits that would bring them -- there's no shortage of those, after all.<br><br>I do have to challenge your comments about the ancient Egyptians and Romans, though -- those were extremely complex and creative societies, as much so as medieval Europe, though they expressed their creativity in different ways. I'd encourage you to read some good books about both societies and broaden your awareness of their achievements. <br><br>Vedant, you're certainly right that I need to talk about systems theory! As I see it, though, it'll actually be more useful to start from philosophy and move to the study of whole systems from there -- since systems theory itself can trace its philosophical roots to some of the ideas I'll be discussing.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c7960567244251081887 title="comment permalink">2/3/17, 8:57 PM</a><br><br>

Specifically that, paraphrased from memory, 'the organisms in a sere modify their environment that prepares the way for the next sere' In some cases this results in a climax community, where the organisms are ideally adapted for the environment that they help to create, but not often.<br><br> I think with humans there are two modes. Long term stable tribal mode, and inherently unstable civilization mode. Inherently unstable mode could be called rock-paper-scissors mode or anacyclosis mode, where each sere of civilization creates an environment that it is less well adapted to than its successor sere is.<br><br> This raises the intriguing possibility that there could be an adaptation that results in a climax community sere of civilization that is stable. Alas, this isn't it though. This hypothetical adaptation wouldn't look like one of the phases of civilization that we know and today's world looks very much like the winter that Spengler describes. I imagine that if it ever happens we will only be able to recognize it in hindsight.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6133473480109434559 title="comment permalink">2/3/17, 9:10 PM</a><br><br>

In the present section he's talking about capitalism and that the credit that can be extended by banks is dependent on people believing that the future will be better than the present - an important component to the myth of progress. So I'm wondering if some of the push back on your statements that our society is in decline comes from a fear that people not believing in progress will mean that capitalists will no longer be able to "grow"<br>Businesses or be able to maintain what we think of as "Capitalism". <br><br>Ok I'm worried that this is a "well, duh" statement. I have actually read "wealth of nature" and know you talked about finance as the tertiary economy. But I can't remember if there was any discussion of whether that sector will "seize up" if people well and truly loose faith in progress. I've tended to think of progress in terms of social justice discussions, technology, medicine. And the ability to feed billions of people, but did really from the idea that when people don't have faith in the future they don't lend money.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c5146911310483287671 title="comment permalink">2/3/17, 11:04 PM</a><br><br>

Jacobs ended up closing in the 1950's, because of the Rural Electrification Administration subsidized expansion<br>of the grid out into the countryside - a subsidy to the fossil fuel industry, and anti-subsidy to renewables.<br><br>Some history:<br>http://www.windcharger.org/Wind_Charger/Welcome.html<br><br>My point is that people were using batteries a fairly long time ago - horse and buggy era still.<br>Volta invented his primary battery in 1800 - things were pretty low tech then.<br>Lead-acid rechargeable were invented in 1859, Nickel-Cadmium and Nickel-Iron around 1900.<br><br>Now, most people have a view of "got-to-have-it-24x7x365", yet the old farmers/ranchers were fine with running lights and radio off the battery, and doing ironing/washing/water pumping... while the wind was blowing (and with PV, "while the sun is shining").<br>A little behavioral change can save a lot of battery.<br><br>Lead-acid and Nickel-Iron are both sturdy chemistries, Nickel-Iron in particular.<br>The early wind battery chargers were very simple electromagnetic relay things,<br>(people were talking about early autos - same thing there)<br>PV charging has been done just by hooking up panels to the battery!<br>This is in contrast to Lithium chemistries, which require fairly sophisticated electronics to avoid overcharge.<br><br>Small scale pumped hydro could work in certain locations, but in general it needs massive scale to be economic.<br>1 cubic meter of water at 100 m elevation is only something like .27 kWh potential energy, and that's before the penstock and turbine take a loss.<br>A 12 volt battery only needs to hold 22.5 amp-hrs to match that, most small deep cycle batteries are several times that, in a nice little package one can keep locked up inside.<br>Efficiency at small scales for pumps/turbines is also an issue.<br><br>There are other ways to store useful energy.<br>You want hot water? Pump it while the sun is shining (or wind is blowing) to a low-tech tank type water heater, such as the Climax, popular in California and Florida around 1900 (before natural gas and cheap electricity).<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_water_heating#History<br>Pump cold water up high for gravity flow.<br><br>You want cold? Make ice in heavily insulated freezers/refrigerators (Jacobs sold these too) while the sun shines/wind blows.<br><br>Grind your grain, saw your wood, etc. these tasks were all historically done with wind/water mills, which are intermittant.<br><br>It depends on the scale of industry in general that ends up being supported, if people only know bits of iron and copper, then you can forget about solar heating too. If float or rolled plate or trough/fusion glass become unknown, PV gets a bit problematic - still works, but is much more fragile.<br><br>JMG has used the analogy of the Roman pottery industry, they had mass-produced, well made pottery that found its way to the farthest reaches of the empire. But after collapse, even kings were lucky to have crude pottery. Perhaps that is how it will be with PV, kings and leading "monasteries" will have PV for electric lights and such, but commoners will have candles/oil lamps/nothing.<br><br>So, we'll see.<br><br>Have you read one of JMG's recommendations: John Perlin's Let It Shine: The 6,000-Year Story of Solar Energy<br>Except for the confusion or name dropping of Einstein and the photoELECTRIC effect which discussing photoVOLTAICS,<br>I highly recommend the book as a great compendium of the long history of solar energy use.<br><br><br><br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c4565941222256431546 title="comment permalink">2/3/17, 11:26 PM</a><br><br>

I didn't find the book to be so much as a "bummer" but more of a shock to realise where we are actually at, especially when compared to the time that it was written - which was 37 years ago now. The shock has taken a little time to be absorbed into my worldview, and I have to say that I am looking at some things a little bit differently now and that is a mild concern.<br><br>Anyway, as to the "bummer", I've never really been one to feel those sorts of feelings as I have not ever indulged them in the first place. The thing is and I thought that you may be interested to know that when I was a very young kid I used to amuse myself for a short period of time as a passenger in a vehicle by tapping my foot in time with the little white posts that are on the side of the roads. After only a couple of weeks of that activity (I didn't get to be a passenger in a vehicle much because we never drove anywhere much!) I thought to myself that this was a very bad thing to do as it could lead to mildly obsessive behaviour. And so I just stopped doing that tapping with my foot and never did it again. Wherever I got the warning in my head that such dysfunctional, but mostly harmless behaviour, could lead to serious mental health issues is well beyond me, but I did indeed heed the warning and have avoided such behaviours that can lead to many addictions and other mental health issues ever since. For example, all of my mates smoked and I never took it up in any way shape or form.<br><br>But the thing is, the greater insight that repetitive behaviour (or some may call that by another name: ritual) can be a very powerful force in peoples lives and that was not lost on me as a small kid. In fact, I see that all over the place and people rely really heavily on ritual to ensure that tomorrow is much like today, even when their rituals are dysfunctional and putting their futures in peril. They just don't see it and so they keep on tapping their feet and hoping for the best and I for one don't know at what point people can turn their backs on dysfunctional rituals, and to be brutally honest the book Overshoot said just how far out of whack things were then. And that was 37 years ago…<br><br>Far out! Sometimes the world as it is today looks very strange to me.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6821327629434437673 title="comment permalink">2/4/17, 3:05 AM</a><br><br>

World War II was such a situation - if Hitler had been smarter, or Stalin even more stupid, Hitler could have won the war, creating a *very* unpleasant post-war world. Other examples might be Napoleon´s decision to attack Russia, or Alexander´s decision to conquer Persia. Of course, individuals still play the role they do in your scenario - given other circumstances, Hitler would have been a modestly succesful painter, Napoleon would have been an ordinary officer, and Stalin, well, I suppose he could have been a very vile and succesful Orthodox patriarch!<br><br>There are also some situations in which it doesn´t matter who "wins", the wheels of time can´t be changed. It may be controversial, but I suspect that the American Revolution was such a situation. Britain was a parliamentary democracy and was on track to abolish slavery at the time of the Revolution. The Federalists were moderates. What would have happened if the Revolution had been defeated? After a brief period of Tory reaction, the Thirteen colonies would probably have continued evolving pretty much as before, although perhaps with a slightly more "Canadian" and Federalist tint. Eventually, the United States would have been formed anyway, and here we are...<br><br>I believe it was Marx who said that men make their own history, but not in circumstances of their own choosing.<br><br>As for sudden mutations of the kind you´re polemicizing against, I think they "only" happen on the level of ideas, and take centuries or millennia to work themselves out, or "work themselves down" into the crude material matrix of history. For instance, Zoroaster´s monotheism seems to have been a genuine mutation. I also think Christianity might have been another one. However, their *immidiate* impact on the consciousness of their times was probably close to zero! Today is another matter -yes, I´ve read "Apocalypse Not".

In particular, Murray's character "Phil" finds himself trapped in some inexplicable way to awaken every morning to the same world he awoke in the previous day: the same music and banter on the radio, the same weather, the same agenda for his day. He soon concludes that this is his "new normal" and that nothing he does during that day will have lasting consequences. Thrown in jail at the end of one day, he awakens (as always) back in his hotel room. Even his suicides are temporary.<br><br>So, he is trapped and free. Each day starts with the same conditions as the previous day, but he is free to keep the changes he makes to himself from the previous day's experiences. He progresses from hedonism through nihilism, but ends up only satisfied with altruism. The main relevance for this blog post, in my opinion, is that he eventually discovers and learns to live within his constraints yet plan and act out each day with greater humanitarianism.<br><br>(One aspect of the story that troubles me, though, is that Phil is uniquely able to make progress, while everyone around him is reliving the same script day after day, except for the changes Phil makes during his iteration of the day.

I think it's worth considering the different forms of cyclic phenomena. <br> Some cycles are purely geometric, like the rotation of the earth: perfectly predictable. <br> Others depend on outside factors for their period, like the rotation of a wheel, which depends on the speed of a vehicle. <br> Even less predictable is a "relaxation oscillator" (see Wikipedia for details), in which some quantity accumulates over time until a threshold is crossed, at which time the accumulation is reset and begins again. Both the rate of accumulation and the threshold affect the behavior of the system. <br> We also see cyclic phenomena in predator/prey models, described by the Lotka-Volterra equations (Wikipedia, again), in which increases in prey population eventually lead to increases in predator populations, which reduce the population of prey by hunting, which reduces the population of predators by hunger, and so it repeats. <br> The least predictable (that comes to my mind) is the behavior of a sand pile. As a small amount of sand is added at the summit, the pile may simply build higher, or it may slump in greater or lesser amounts. Even if you know the rate at which sand is added, the likelihood and magnitude of sand-slides is a matter of probability. You know that it's going to happen, eventually, but not when, where, or how much.<br> Which model applies to life? All of them, of course.<br><br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6845771372719920386 title="comment permalink">2/4/17, 7:20 AM</a><br><br>

I especially remember their "<a href=https://www.amazon.com/Shell-Answer-Book-Mile-help/dp/B01K98K82M rel=nofollow title="Yes, I found this on Amazon.com. Couldn't find anything of this item that WASN'T being sold and was still up on the web.">"The One Hundred Thousand Mile Book</a>," a book about making your car last one hundred thousand miles. Consider today, when the only way a dedicated person can't put 100,000 miles is to either be dedicated to letting the car fall apart or to total the car in an accident. Further back (into the fifties), it was accepted that cars had a limited lifespan and that you had to be darn sure the vehicle could last a long trip if you decided to drive to Florida for your yearly vacation. So I'd say that vehicles are better built today than historically, even with all the doodads that threaten to short-circuit them things.<br><br>That doesn't make them any easier to fix up. Heck, nowadays I feel the need to specifically take my car to the dealer whenever I need an oil change, partly because everything's so tightly packed that to replace the front lights requires disassembling the front end. Add to it all the sensors, computers and various creature comforts (does anyone have a manual window crank anymore? and how much you want to bet that all the newest vehicles have stealth self-driving capabilities within them, waiting for a signal from a centralized point to suddenly become self-driving?) and you're edging into the realm of vehicles that, once something is broke, you're stuck with replacing the whole thing.<br><br>Never mind the cost. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that one could build a mid-seventies car today with the same specs as back then and make it at half the price as today's cars...and make them with today's quality of build without the extra stuff, computers or other items that push up costs.<br><br>(and yes, I know there are cars from the fifties still running, especially in Cuba. I'm talking generally, complete with personal experience.)<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c3350519831774180048 title="comment permalink">2/4/17, 7:39 AM</a><br><br>

I agree with gwizard, I think the tenor and tone in the comments has changed - for me - a most negative aspect of this is that reflection and further elucidation of the essay issue gets drowned out; So in spite of feeling a lot of retorts to certain comments, I'm ignoring. Hand up as in - "talk to the hand, 'cause the face ain't listenin'".<br><br>Ahem - <br><br>Thank You, JMG, great essay, although not earth shatteringly revelatory for me, only because I am a fairly long term follower of your blog, thoughts and theories. I think I'm too much a part of the choir. I agree. As some other on-topic commenters have said: I do think this time it IS or WILL BE different, if only because of the sheer scale and size of current civilization. I think I see - you are saying there are two collapses happening in concurrence: 1) The collapse of the American 'Empire', which is following a well worn path; and 2) the slower, more on-going collapse of industrial fossil-fuel driven global civilization which is and will increasingly affect all Earthlings, No - OK - 3) Climate change which will also upset the global apple cart for centuries to come, making a 'normal' dark-age recovery period erratic and less on track. Yes, it will be cyclical, but a big chink on the wheel. The 3 are hard to separate because they affect each other, (fossil-fuel global collapse &amp; climate change being the biggest biggies in the long run. And then of course there's, (as a few other on-topic commenters have also said): nuclear warheads to throw more monkey wrenches into the works! <br><br>For example, in one reply you said, no doubt certain peoples will go back to being hunter-gatherers, but what will be left of the game? Of the healthy forests, flora and fauna such societies need to survive? Will that be possible? <br><br>No wonder people have gone utterly bat-shakes crazy. <br><br>I look forward to next week's discussion on philosophy, although I will probably stick to being a fly on the wall, unschooled in that discipline. It should be fascinating to read with one tab open to googling definitions, one tab here! <br><br>AND, for a purely selfish need, I'm still eager to read your and my fellow commenters thoughts on Education and the education system. I'm neck deep in this fray right now with one graduating HS Senior who doesn't want any college education, one HS Junior who is working like crazy to get to an Ivy, and as a preschool teacher blindly groping my way through an obviously very broken pedagogic system. UGH! I need some sound philosophy on THAT!<br><br>Lastly: Welcome back Bill Pulliam - I too always value your input; <br><br>and heartfelt best wishes to Violet. I also enjoy and value your 'Winter's Trickter' blog and details. I hope you find relief and comfort from the chemical assault you've been suffering. I've not experienced such debilitation, but after living outside the USA for 2 decades, (I have no idea why, there are fewer regulations in China...) but upon returning, I have gotten sick and am experiencing much more sensitivity to the strong chemicals around a 'normal', USA household. Wow! The chemicals we use here are really strong! And we do use SO MANY!! Weird.

I am re-reading The Blood of the Earth, and it occurred to me that the response of the liberal wing of the American political establishment seems to be enacting a program which has the features of a revitalization movement. They offer a thorough critique of the existing order of the political establishment (in which they are completely out of power at the moment); a vision of the Utopian future which will arrive immediately after Trump is ejected from office and they are restored to power, preferably this week or next week at the latest; and a straightforward plan of action to get to this goal: massive protests, general strikes, civil disobedience, etc.<br><br>This straightforward plan seems highly unlikely to be successful, in no small part because pretty much none of the people who voted for Trump are on board, so all this action is political theater that only appeals to those already convinced. Parenthetically, many of the proponents of this plan are exhibiting an appalling disregard for the Constitution, so if it is successful, it will likely be because Trump was removed via extra-Constitutional means, and the ramifications of that are pretty dire.<br><br>The painful irony is that this is using up all the energy that could be directed towards quite useful tasks that could be done, such as forming a leftist program that would actually appeal to Trump's base (not a hard thing to do, in my mind, if the political will existed to do so) and winning the next few elections. But this would require accepting that the Republicans control all of Congress for the next two years and the Presidency for the next four years, and this possibility seems to be quite literally unthinkable to the liberal world.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c7094824539513400997 title="comment permalink">2/4/17, 9:39 AM</a><br><br>

That is the late question that we all are wrestling with. Blaming others doesn’t help. Doubling down on our worst impulses won’t help. Being honest about the impact that our civilizations (they are still multiple civilizations at play, the American model being only one) are having on the stability and viability of the environment might help. In fact, I’m pretty sure that will be an essential skill if our civilization does fall. Which really might not be such a bad thing overall. Still, one does worry about such degenerate phenomenon as the Neo-nazi war-bands mentioned here lately. But in my experience there are a lot of good, decent, courageous, responsible people - who are not ideologically intoxicated in either direction and who take the measure of a person’s heart, first and foremost - who won’t stand for such nonsense.

There have, I believe, been some universities which denied Milo a right to appear at all, but UCB was not one. What puzzles me is that Milo's rhetoric doesn't seem any more hateful than that of Ann Coulter, who is IMO, a despicable intellectual toady of the extreme right. However I don't recall her being criticized as much. Is Milo considered worse just because he is a white male (note lack of usual 'straight' modifier, as he is gay).

Given large enough numbers, you can predict things such as the number of traffic deaths in the USA in 2017 with reasonable accuracy. You can't predict a specific death nor does the certainty of some fixed number of deaths relieve individuals from moral responsibility for their actions. Still, the likely range is fairly determined.<br><br>Lower or raise the speed limit and one can predict with fair accuracy the change in the number of deaths. Nonetheless, one can also factor (with less accuracy) the likelihood of such changes and one is back to a pretty well determined number/range.<br><br>The behaviour and life of civilizations follow a reasonably predictable trajectory given such are the consequence of uncountable individual human decisions and humans haven't changed much over the centuries. Each arc is a large number statistical phenomena and so predetermined within broad ranges. <br><br>The same idea holds for say matter. Given a large enough assembly of elemental particles, it doesn't matter that their individual existence is not determined. On the macro scale, the object in one's hand is still very determined. It exists.<br><br>Though I understand your sources based their historical analysis mostly on morphology (i.e. "this is the observed form these changes take") as opposed to root reasons such as resource deletion; this doesn't invalidate their findings. <br><br>Nonetheless, adding in the issue of resource depletion fine tunes the timing and gives strength to the argument that the overall arc is in fact largely predetermined.<br><br>And as you have taken pains to stress in you responses to me and others. None of this lets us, individually, off the hook morally for "bad driving". Nor does it mitigate the likely consequence of individual "bad driving". This moral issue and the issue of personal consequences though, I believe, are very separate from the fact that we can know, in broad terms, what is going to happen pretty much from the start. Indeed the first two issues may well be separate from each other.

In particular, your statement that "The most popular TV show right now is Game of Thrones, based on George RR Martin’s 'A Song of Fire and Ice' novels" requires closer examination. "<a href=https://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/search/label/Game%20of%20Thrones rel=nofollow>Game of Thrones</a>" may be the most <i>award-winning</i> drama on American television today with <a href=https://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2016/09/game-of-thrones-and-orphan-black-win.html rel=nofollow>a record 39 Emmy Awards</a> over its run, but if by "most popular" you meant "most watched," it most assuredly is not. According to <a href=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/05/most-watched-tv-show-2015-2016-season-game-of-thrones-the-walking-dead-football-1201682396/ rel=nofollow>Indiewire</a>, it came in 38th among viewers of all ages and sixth among TV watchers aged 18-49 during the 2015-2016 season, the most recent in which the series aired. The more popular show exemplifying Americans' anxiety about the end of progress is "<a href=https://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/search/label/zombies rel=nofollow>The Walking Dead</a>," which came in fourth among all viewers and first among those aged 18-49, making it, not "Game of Thrones," the most watched show on cable with nearly twice as many viewers. That's a fast-collapse show, but the series is now in its seventh season and has finally reached the stage where most of the rubble has stopped bouncing, so the conflict driving the drama has become a struggle for power among groups of survivors, including a barbarian warband that ironically (or maybe not) sees itself as the "Saviors of Civilization," instead of a fight for survival against the undead. That written, "Game of Thrones" makes your point that "Winter is coming" and people are aware it may be approaching in the real world as well. It's just not as salient an example as you made it out to be.<br><br>On another note, I'm a member of several "liberal prepper" groups on Facebook. I'll ask the members if any of them participate in the SCA and, if so, whether their historical reenacting has given them any survival skills. Coincidentally enough, one of the communities of survivors in "The Walking Dead" grew up around a park where Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century crafts were recreated for visitors. In the series, that was an intentional choice for those survivors, not an accident.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c8071094464415001827 title="comment permalink">2/4/17, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>

You have made a real treasure out of this blog, and I have spent two evenings this week lying in front of my woodstove catching up on the comments (and drinking stout, as is only fitting).<br><br>A comment from Bill (I'm glad you came back, Bill, but I didn't think you could stay away :)) has had me thinking this week about the parallels between our societies and our own individual consciousnesses. We are all born and live and die, and we react to what happens to us, and experience both good fortune and tragedy, but eventually we are extinguished. Some of us may pass on bits of ourselves - both good and bad bits - to offspring who can then lead lives that are delicately connected to our own. <br><br>In the same way, our society reacts to what happens to it, on a much longer scale, and is indifferent to who or what causes those things to happen. It is not a stretch, to me, to think that any human endeavor, such as a society, would, consciously or unconsciously, follow the "rise and fall" pattern of our own lives, complete with poor choices on some days (eras/periods) and dwindling of health (resources) in later years. Death, and a rebirth of something related, is, well, pretty normal-seeming.<br><br>Our planet is even a larger, and slower, example of this same thing, with societies having the same relation to it as individuals do to societies. And on to the universe, which is made of matter that...dies. <br><br>These are just thoughts that have been bouncing around in my head, but they seem relevant, and I find them somewhat comforting. Maybe anthropomorphizing the society and planet like this gives me empathy toward their predicaments so that I try to be gentle toward them. <br><br>JMG, you also said something in a response that reminded me of an idea I read in a book by Keith Farnish, whose title I cannot recall. He was talking about the hubris of science and how, unless you speak in the language of science, you are dismissed from the conversation, as if there is nothing that science does not know. I have spent far too little time on your other blog, but I doubt that "science" would discuss anything there. That does not make it "unreal", just "not officially sanctioned".<br><br>As an aside: I do a lot of my thinking (at least that's what I call it) while walking around on errands or just for the walking. That seems to me to be the pace of the human mind. It happened again today: a friend stopped while driving by me and asked if I needed a ride somewhere. I know you walk almost exclusively, and I wondered if you, too, had lost count of the number of times this has happened. :)<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c3347651279984539802 title="comment permalink">2/4/17, 8:07 PM</a><br><br>

That being the case, I don't see any reason why capitalism should be exempt. ;-)<br><br>Blue Sun, I could see that all too easily. <br><br>Iuval, I'd say that not all human cultures choose what you're calling "Empire," but all civilizations do -- if you want to have big urban centers and the resource flows needed to support them, you basically have to play the empire game. The thing is, you do choose whether or not you support the empire game; every day you rely on your share of benefits from it, you support it and encourage the people who run it to keep on playing. <br><br>Nastarana, er, I like Copeland's music, and I've been a Wagner fan since my teens. Both composers were wildly popular in their day, too. <br><br>Nati, that's actually quite common. In the last century or so of the Roman Empire, for example, it was all the rage for kids and 20-somethings in the Roman upper classes to dress like barbarians and imitate bits of barbarian culture, and of course you also had the steady drain of talented people turning their backs on society to go become Christian hermits for the sake of their souls. So what we're seeing is a standard phenomenon of decline.<br><br>Donald, that may be part of it. <br><br>Stu, thanks for this! Yes, those are about the figures I remember. <br><br>Jim, it's profoundly simplistic to claim that warming climate equals improved conditions for mammals; you really ought to read up on paleoclimatology before making claims like that. As for the anthropogenic nature of the current round of climate change, I have yet to see any convincing argument that dumping gigatons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere isn't going to have the effects we're seeing right now -- and the evidence for the anthropogenic nature of climate change seems very convincing to me. <br><br>William, hmm! That's a good point.<br><br>Brent, can you point me to a readily accessible book on the subject? <br><br>Wbricex, thank you. <br><br>MichaelK, I wasn't offended. I was simply explaining why I write the way I do. <br><br>Fred, well, you could pick up a copy of my book <i>Green Wizardry</i>, which has a lot of material in one place, you know! ;-)<br><br>Bryant, I don't mention Kek as such in that book, but it does have a lot to say about polytheist spirituality that you may find useful. <br><br>Varun, that's part of it. The leaders aren't just managing masses, they're being managed by them -- the masses choose to respond to this slogan and not to that one, to rally around one cause and not another, and that sharply constrains the options for leaders, who after all want people to follow them. Those of us who don't care whether people follow us or not don't suffer from the same constraint, and so can lay the groundwork for the slogans and causes of the future.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c4775119941727149457 title="comment permalink">2/4/17, 11:46 PM</a><br><br>

I don't see the connection between those and the ones that Bill pointed out, or the ones possible in Conway's Game of Life. The only connection I see is that they are all cycles. In both these toy models, there are other possible behaviors such as chaos and equilibria, but you wouldn't say that civilizations must reach equilibria because these models have them as possible behaviors. The underlying mechanisms are not the same.<br><br>JMG, I agree that if we want something different, we must figure it out, it won't happen while we are supporting the fruits of empire. However, there is no logical fallacy in using those fruits as tools to figure something else out. Or in the words of some black panthers, we can use the tools of the prison to get out of it (diverging from Gandhi and the Possibility Alliance). The interesting thing to me, from a game theoretic perspective, is how to play a different game while being confronted by empire? I think you would claim that we can't, we have to wait till it dies and only in that time interval between the last empire and the next one do we have any chance to do something different? I would say the Jesus figured out another game and a strategy to play that game while within Empire, and had Christianity not chosen to align itself with the Roman empire, it might have worked.

Some to a smaller degree some to a larger degree. Think of it as a standard deviation around your activities if you are mathematically inclined. Sure there can be a few "butterfly effects" (like some authors use for time travel stories), but not everything is susceptible to same degree to such a reduction in certainty. <br><br>To me is appears plausible (of course does not mean it needs to be true) that especially things people feel strongly about and are ready to act on will be more stable - particularly as you move away from the day-to-day perspective. In fact it is likely that such issues generate structures, which are intended to stabilize support for activities (educational systems, proud parents, religions, songs, steering committees, retirements, ritualized prestige, etc.). Barring certain events such as major military defeat, or a drastically out of alignment representative, such support systems work nicely compared to what is in collective memory and "progress" is made. <br><br>As time goes on, the fraction of support systems that are at odds with one another (or are largely parasitic) increases. Their overall power of mimesis wanes, and you start to get fracturing and in-fighting. I would assume this typically comes in waves, which initially leave the system stronger than before and can continue for quite some time in that way fending off internal and external contestants. At the same time careerism and other internal dynamics tend to slowly dissolve their original substance, and people become a tad less willing to go the extra mile, or get out of bed that extra hour earlier. The standard deviation around actions that are relevant for their continuation widens and the social mores allow for that (creeping reduction of mimesis). Much of this determines the acceptable degrees of efficiency and effectiveness in society. The US military spending and procurement system is perhaps instructive in this regard. If you are bored of the F35 bashing have a look at the ZBD2000 in comparison to the AAV-P7.<br><br>Once such precarious convictions are faced even with even a partial (moral) defeat (e.g. Clintons &amp; Trump saying similar things re Mexicans, flag burning or crookedness) they cannot marshal the will of their believers to nearly the same degree. A military defeat in comparison is much less damaging for ideologies that do not rely on "might is right" rhetoric. <br>Such developments quickly take the dominant narrative into self reinforcing decline, particularly if collective memory does not serve as a backstop (Brexit: How bad can it get?!, Alt-right: We have the guns.). <br>External influences become more relevant Can a transition to an existing stable or vigorous school of thought be made? Can outside belief systems stabilize themselves by attacking the weakened narrative?<br><br>Interestingly the prominent factors in this function are: time, will, collective memory, social dynamics - with very little direct influence of resources or technology. Perhaps the most influential of these are through demographics (unusually many old people), which seems to be a factor in Trump and Brexit.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c3679559415901573711 title="comment permalink">2/5/17, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

With respect to Copeland, however, I tend to think he was wildly popular with critics, and with that portion of audiences who take their opinions from the pages of major metropolitan newspapers and of conductors who take care to program works which are in fashion with audiences and critics. They and musicians do have to make a living, after all. For a truly great mid-century American composer, allow me to recommend the music of William Grant Still.<br><br>I have read both the Saga of the Volsungs and the Neibelungenleid, granted it was a few decades ago, and, IMHO, for my money, Wagner's retelling is no improvement. Literary epics have been a fertile source for opera librettists; my own favorite is Berlioz' Les Troyens, which was performed, recorded and filmed at the Met in the early 80s, featuring the much anticipated Met debut of a young, and phenomenal as she then was in voice and presence, Jessye Norman, and the incomparable Tatiana Troyanos singing the role of Dido. The young Norman and Troyanos in the same recording with Levine at the height of his powers conducting the Met orchestra. Opera recoding doesn't get much better than that.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c18929223254652772 title="comment permalink">2/5/17, 9:28 AM</a><br><br>

Even though they know perfectly well that they're going to turn up and do what they always do. That's because many of the peaceful types have sympathy for the violent ones and have no intention of doing anything effective to stop them from engaging in violence in front of them. This is a pattern that has existed for a long time. <br><br>The university, in turn, knows all this perfectly well too because this is quite normal. They fail to prevent the perfectly predictable violence not because they're incapable of it or don't know it's going to happen but because many of them are sympathetic to the violent types in their fight 'against fascism'. So they ban the event on the basis of the 'health and safety' issue that they themselves knowingly permitted to develop. <br><br>This kind of bait and switch game goes back a long, long way. Frederick Douglass actually described an event he was due to speak at, at which white supremacists appeared and threatened violence. So the public authorities cancelled his talk - again ostensibly to protect the public. Preventing riot and affray is another way they used to describe it. I think the English used to use that to ban suffragetes and Irish nationalists from meeting. <br><br>Anyway Douglass wrote a blistering piece condemning the cowardice of the public authorities - whose job it should have been to simply ensure his safety while exercising his right to freedom of speech. Because otherwise what you're actually doing in practice is permitting anyone who can create a sufficiently serious 'public safety issue' to determine the limits of freedom of speech. <br><br>I don't know why Milo is particularly hated. I have seen far right women get the same treatment so I don't think it's particularly a gender thing. Women at the pro-Milo protest were assaulted equally by the 'antifascists'. <br><br>And yes, the reason no one will talk about where the appropriate limits on immigration should be is because they can't bring themselves to say no to anyone who wants to migrate from a poorer part of the world to the rich world. It makes them feel vaguely guilty... <br><br>Mallow.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c8207089490638751923 title="comment permalink">2/5/17, 11:53 AM</a><br><br>

I think a case can be made that commentary on this blog has gotten somewhat harsher than it used to be, and with the embarrassingly overheated rhetoric coming out of all sides of the ongoing tantrum that used to be the US political system, I could see a point to asking everyone to tone things down here, in the hope that the habit might spread. My question for you, though, is this -- are you willing to accept the same limits you're asking me to place on my alt-right readers? The comments page here has also seen denunciations of Trump and his supporters, you know, just as heated as the denunciations of liberals you've quoted. If I ask for, and enforce, a stricter level of civility than before, that'll fall on all sides, not just on the alt-right. Are you prepared to tolerate that? <br><br>Joel, interesting. Thanks for the link. <br><br>Daddy Hardup, your tickets are waiting for you at the station, and we'll be boarding all seats Wednesday afternoon, with the <i>Vorspiel</i> from Parsifal played by our station orchestra. ;-) <br><br>Armata, er, a comparison to the Red Guards is a bit of an overstatement, don't you think, given the lack of a significant body count so far? If what I've read is correct, Mao's bullies racked up a very impressive death toll even by the standards of the twentieth century. Could things go that way here? No doubt, but they're not there yet. <br><br>111DFC, I enjoy "The Birth of Tragedy" as a work of literature, but Socrates as the turning point of world history? Only from a very narrowly Hellenocentric perspective. You're right, though, that the language is gorgeous. <br><br>Hhawhee, no doubt! "The 18th Brumaire" is to my mind Marx at his best: crisp, irreverent, and interesting. He didn't always, or often, achieve that. <br><br>Sylvia, that's a very difficult question to answer, and of course there's a huge personal factor. Myself, when I'm reading something that claims to predict the future, I want to see how its previous predictions have played out, but that's a personal choice, of course. <br><br>August, so noted, and I'll look forward to its arrival. I'll ask you the same thing I asked Gwizard, though. You've had some harsh things to say about Trump et al., and that's been fine because it's been in keeping with the way things have been handled here. Are you willing to tone down your comments as part of a general tightening of courtesy standards? <br><br>James, so noted! <br><br>Doomerdoc, you know, there's something very enticing in the idea that the Nazis and the Bolsheviks were the civilizational equivalent of fifty-year-old guys who are doing combovers and stuffing themselves into corsets to try to hit on twenty-year-old women at the corner bar...<br><br>Kevin, nicely put.

Cycles.<br><br>Dear sandy, I meant the kind of cycles that civilizations go through. I don't see the connection between those and the ones that Bill pointed out, or the ones possible in Conway's Game of Life. The only connection I see is that they are all cycles. <br><br>*cycles of civilization start simple and add layers of complexity to solve emergent problems. Collections of cellular automata start simple but can demonstrate rather complex Behavior.<br><br>In both these toy models, there are other possible behaviors such as chaos and equilibria, but you wouldn't say that civilizations must reach equilibria because these models have them as possible behaviors. The underlying mechanisms are not the same.<br><br>* I would claim a state of chaos is merely very complex Behavior where we cannot discover the underlying equation. If a complex Empires supporting institutions fail close together in time the result might well appear chaotic. We may be unfortunate enough to witness this in the next 10 years haha.<br><br>I think a civilization might reach equilibrium if that is what it chose to do. For example the (Most Serene) Republic of Venice existed from 697–1797, 1100 yrs. by not trying to expand but maintain.<br><br>These analogies while not exact have helped me to get a handle on the idea of civilization Cycles.

For once, this might be a bit long.<br><br>I have to say I completely agree with Gwizard943: I feel the comments section of this blog has degenerated to a point where it is no longer pleasant to read. It has become a mere extension of the overly divisive playground that is politics.<br>Let me elaborate: I've been reading this blog since 2009, when, after the subprime crash, I realized the traditional media couldn't provide me with a satisfactory answer as to what was going on. They simply had no explanation. <br><br>So I went looking for answers, and extremes had plenty in store for me. For a few months, I read far-left thinkers and zealots, but also proponents of the Austrian school of economics who mixed their creed with a profoundly deep-rooted hatred of everything that wasn't white. I learned a lot, realized that it was necessary for one's intellectual well-being to tackle ideologies which are at odds with one's personal beliefs, but was ultimately unconvinced: in the end, the far right and the far left, despite having more thought-provoking things to say than the mainstream media, were only interested in pointing fingers and professing, in a religious manner, the absolute nature of their dogma.<br><br>Then I learned about The Oil Drum, Hubbert's Peak, and, eventually, this stellar blog. I had found a place where most of my questions would be answered in a provocative but always courteous way, where partisan bickering would be discarded in favor of tactful debate.<br>And, I believe this blog maintained such amazing standards until Donal Trump and the amazingly powerful reactions he triggers came into play. I've watched other contributors of the Peakosphere I used to respect devolve into parodies of themselves : Gail Tverberg now hoping for divine intervention, Dmitry Orlov now a pro-Russian zealot and conspiracy theorist, Guy McPherson having created a Doomsday Cult claiming human extinction would take place in 2026...<br><br>I feel sanity has left the building. People bicker and point fingers, feel smug about themselves, hold absolutist views they rub in each other's faces. They no longer engage in conversation, but shout, and not even at each other. It doesn't matter if the other party listens to them or not: only their views count, and reaching consensus it not even a distant possibility.<br>Nothing good can come out of this. <br><br>This blog always was about advocating constructive action for the not-so-bright future ahead. Please let it be the case again.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c2703448572568428337 title="comment permalink">2/6/17, 1:54 AM</a><br><br>

I highly respect your opinions and viewpoints and want to make clear where I'm coming from.<br><br>If you look back at my comments, you'll find I have not made one nasty comment about Trump, or Clinton, <i>voters</i>. Only about the total unsuitability of both candidates. And yes, I do have strong opinions there. No collectively calling the voters the names others have. No directed comments about a particular voter. But others have made some rather nasty comments and name calling about the other side, both sides, both collectively and individually. At most I've said things like "I think that these Trump supporters/excusers are going to find things don't turn out like they expected." And there has been a lot of people making excuses for what Trump has done. A lot of "The ends justify the means."<br><br>If Clinton had been elected, I'd be saying the same about her voters. But she wasn't... It's amazing to see how, even this far past the election, the standard excuse for any Trump statement/action is "But, Clinton..." Excusing an inappropriate/bad action by saying that your opponent did it is like a little kid saying "But Mommy, Johnny did it!"<br><br>I am working here with mostly Trump supporters, a couple very vocal, I have nothing but respect for them. They are by no means stupid. I keep my mouth shut about my opinion of their political preferences. We are all working together. We spent yesterday, in the rain, working on what will be our Ham Radio clubhouse/workshop. We're planning a big Field Day event this year.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c769692073531098311 title="comment permalink">2/6/17, 6:58 AM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c8407433244321947326></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/09144323081887894238 rel=nofollow>Eric S.</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I was moving over the weekend so am fairly late to the conversation, but hopefully not too late to contribute. One thought that I have looking at the cyclical arcs of history and perceptions of its shape is the degree to which one’s perception of it can be determined by both individual circumstances, and by the place along that arc that one lives. To someone who was born in a certain social class in Rome in the early years of the first century CE, it may be very easy to go through one’s whole life believing in something very like progress. The old men would have told stories about the civil wars following the reign of Nero, they would have been coming to an awareness of broader political and social issues during Hadrian’s abandonment of the outer territories, and their adulthood would have been marked by the relative stability and prosperity of the Antonine dynasty, the last of their old age in the early years of Marcus Aurelius’ reign offering a hope of the outer barbarian tribes coming under the order of Roman law once and for all. They wouldn’t live to see the political assassinations and civil wars of the coming years. Meanwhile, to someone of that same social class watching Attila’s oncoming hoards centuries later, it might as well be the unique and complete end of the world regardless of what may be happening in some distant future or in some other far off place. The same can be applied to our own time and our own region of the world. For many people living in the West, especially among the privileged social classes, the number of people who remember a time when there has been anything but continuous progress is steadily decreasing… meanwhile, to someone who was elderly or middle aged during the first half of the twentieth century, especially if they were living in Europe, it once more may as well have been apocalypse, to those who don’t survive, the possibility of an eventual recovery is a temporal version of the nearby campsite in To Build a Fire, it may be close, but that isn’t going to help them much. This is why in so much late Roman and early Medieval Christianity, it made perfect sense to believe that those were the end times, because functionally they were and were going to continue to be for the lifetimes of anyone involved, and the only way to get out of that eternal tribulation was to die. I think for many people the question isn’t even so much “is progress going to continue forever,” so much as “is progress going to continue long enough that I can die safe and content,” to people looking towards a future cataclysm, it’s a similar thought. To someone with certain health problems, in certain areas vulnerable to particularly high levels of violence or environmental catastrophe, or of a certain age, the question of recovery doesn’t matter too much… and if a period of unrest lasts decades rather than a few years or months before something resembling a “new normal” is restored, then even a person who has youth, health, and skill on their side may be spending the rest of their lives in a world that bears an uncomfortable resemblance to apocalyptic fiction they may have read or seen in cinema (there are some places in the world that look that way already and have for a while now). If they’re not likely to see the period of recovery, then the existence of the recovery is something of an irrelevance to them, and to someone preparing for such an interruption, the reality of an interruption that includes a slight recovery and a descent into a dark age, an interruption that continues forever as humanity gaps one long dying breath, and an interruption that is followed by a recovery and a resumption of onward, upward progress is going to look much the same. It takes a special type of mind to be able to detach oneself from the way history feels and take a long view of it, and even when a mind can do that, it is even more difficult to transform that abstraction into something useful (which is, of course, something that is this blog’s central goal).<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c8407433244321947326 title="comment permalink">2/6/17, 8:14 AM</a><br><br>

I learned as a teenager that the country we lived in was the United States of <i>America</i>, not just the United States. This was when I was living in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico. The people there were proud to live in a country known as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico rel=nofollow>Estados Unidos Mexicanos</a>, or the <i>Mexican</i> United States. It was not polite for me to refer to the USA as the United States.<br><br>I saw people living in poverty that those of us in the USA have a very hard time even imagining, yet these people were proud of their country and kept their dignity. We knew several who were employed at the institutes where my father worked who lived in 1 or 2 room Adobe homes with dirt floors and no plumbing. These were wonderful people and something that really gripes me about Trump is his constant insulting and degrading of Mexico. When someone insults my friends, I can't help but take it personally. I'm still in contact today with some of the people I met in Mexico in the mid-1970's.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c5259097974059136042 title="comment permalink">2/6/17, 8:17 AM</a><br><br>

Those hard words were much needed. Both sides are equally capable of the most horrific acts of violence. The alt right seems to me more capable of throwing the first punch, mostly due to their cultivated cynism and sense of detachment... but the other side would response with even greater ferocity when they feel their backs agains the wall.<br><br>@Scotly, please don't expell Dammerung and his kind just yet. Some of us have interest to hear what they have to say. I have learned about both my and their strenghts and weaknesses during our first exchange a couple of weeks ago.<br><br>@Gwizard43, August, I miss the cozier atmosphere too, but it does not mean the current tone of discurse is inherently bad. I will repeat what I said before, you need to hear this words so that you are prepared. The kekist are not going to just quit talking like that because you censor them, they will just go back and keep doing their thing behind closed doors. <br><br>I am going to share something personal. I suffered an extortion attempt about a year ago. Someone claiming to be from the Cartels, said that they had aprehended a low brow criminal who had information about my family. He claimed that the Cartel do not have any business in messing with the lives of people of good will like myself, and that this vermin needed to be put down. He offered to have the criminal "go away" in exchange for protection money. I hang up and disconnected the phone.<br><br>This is routine this side of the border. The Cartels are too busy making cash hand over fist to even bother with small fish like me. What happens is that there is a swarm of con artist that have learned to take advantage of the state of insecurity to prey on the people. There are fake kidnappings and real kidnappings, extortions by organized crime and extortions by convicted criminals that smugle mobile phones and go threatening people, just to have their wives and children collect the ransom money.<br><br>This is common knowledge this side of the border. Many friends and family have been targeted by one of these attempts. And even knowing that, it was a very hard decision to hang up. But at the end, I decided that I would not panic unless and until I see armed men knocking on my door. The gamble payed off, no one has come after me or my family, yet.<br><br>The thing is, if you are going to break if some meanacing guy comes and tell you horrible things, you are not going to survive the ordeal ahead. Dammerung has been unknowingly providing a valuable service here. You need to hear this things in the relative security of the Internet, because later you are going to hear them directly spoken to you, and even later you may get to see some of those things carried out in real life. You must know beforehand, so that you will not freeze.<br><br>So, please JMG, do not make this a "safe space" to be. Your readership may not appreciate the tone, but they need to hear it nonetheless.<br><br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c9069489825273523404 title="comment permalink">2/6/17, 8:18 AM</a><br><br>

The dieoff and the associated natural selection for tolerances for European diseases (and maybe some American clades of those diseases would form and be nasty for Europeans). In 300 years, the disease resistant genes would still have a much higher frequency than they did before the initial pandemic event (10% of Europeans still have genes that protect them from plague today, for example) and because the Indians would be pushing up against ecological limits and competing with each other they would likely be more territorial and militant. Ultimately there is no escaping the logic that violence is the ultimate authority - invasion is never off the table, it's just often not a great idea. Which is why we use violence to establish more humane systems of hierarchy and authority.<br><br>As far as 'natural locomotion', well, it's a mess. For instance global inequality is such that a welfare recipient in northern Europe gets many times the wages of an African worker, for doing essentially nothing. So it makes sense that given the opportunity, Africans try to go to northern Europe to collect welfare. I don't blame the African, I blame the idiotic northern Europeans (and the subversive elements in those societies) for allowing this. Of course, one can't say anything about these problems in northern Europe and expect to keep ones job or even avoid a visit to jail these days.<br><br>Of course, I'm required to lie about a lot of things (at least by omission). Until recently I worked for a company which is developing an unnecessary and unsustainable product (the new job isn't much better, but it's natural-resource related so at least it's actually useful). In all the various meetings etc about the utterly pointless product we were making, at no point was I permitted to point out the basic reality of the situation - I'd lose my job - and then, in a while, when my chequing account ran out - I'd lose my privilege to live indoors. So I lied, and probably so did others. It really is something.<br><br>Douglass was speaking and writing in the context of an America that had a frontier. When there is no more frontier, then people who have settled in a place have just as much right to natural defense as would-be immigrants do to attempt a forcible invasion. To quote the Australians, "frack off, we're full". Pentti Linkola certainly would agree: <br><br>"What to do, when a ship carrying a hundred passengers suddenly capsizes and only one lifeboat, with room for only ten people, has been launched? When the lifeboat is full, those who hate life will try to load it with more people and sink the lot.

So listen and its the same old, same old - too much private and public debt, the money printing, etc. Then he said something I hadn't heard - labor productivity has been going down ever since the Baby Boomers starting retiring and each year as they leave the workforce, productivity gets worse. Huh? I'm intrigued.<br><br>I googled the BLS and found this report which doesn't show the stair step down he is referring to, but it show a 1% productivity growth the last nine years. https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-6/below-trend-the-us-productivity-slowdown-since-the-great-recession.htm One percent growth to me looks like a rounding error.<br><br>The funny part about that chart btw is that is violates the first rule of chart making - make sure your measures are equal across the axis.

It should totally be a thing - I realized it's because we are fooled into thinking that work in office places happens because of the tools we use, not the people. People who began working before computers became ubiquitous know that to get anything done requires a conversation one-on-one with a person using your influence or negotiation skills. Now when people go to work in office buildings they spend all day in group meetings and sending email back and forth. No one gets work done based on emails. Emails just spur more questions. And no one works when they are sitting around a table talking about what to do. The emails and meetings are all about cya (cover your a**) so people can hide from responsibility and real work.<br><br>The Podesta emails shocked me not only for the content, but the for the sheer volume.

A certain subset of those commenters may even need, desparately need, a safe space for that support and community. I hope that subset is small, for my own sake.

Long overdue thanks on that count. <br><br>Recent comment threads have also provided a vivid case study for how a fairly self-restraining community can rapidly descend into bickering gridlock in times of stress, leading it to beg a benevolent dictator to reassert control. Hail, Archdruid! Spengler seems to have hit another home run.<br><br>Please do re-impose upon all of us the standards of courtesy that so noticeably distinguish this blog from its peers. Please also continue to post and to respond to polite comments containing all sorts of divergent opinions. The quality of the dialogue in this comment section is cultured by exposing each essay to analysis from as many viewpoints as you have civil commenters. In a world of assiduously purged echo-chambers, that is rare indeed.<br><br>Reading the thoughtful and extensive deliberation you had with DoubtingThomas last month gave me a glimpse into the unusual level of respect necessary on both sides if any rapprochement is to occur. I certainly hope that DoubtingThomas took your responding to his comment publicly in this post as an honoring, not ridiculing of his considerable contribution -- few have stood so unflinchingly in the Archdruid's gaze. <br><br>The acrid tauntings that Gwizard43 highlighted in an earlier comment do seem to fall quite short of civility or common courtesy. Their contribution to the conversation could surely be increased by requiring more thoughtful composition. I imagine demanding more polite discourse will lead to a higher signal to noise ratio and fewer weekly comments to respond to -- a deserved break for our esteemed host.<br><br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c3824381023640266664 title="comment permalink">2/6/17, 6:44 PM</a><br><br>

The thing that I find fascinating, though, is that someone with ideas so far from the bipartisan consensus is now advising the most powerful human being on the planet. Strange days! <br><br>Tim, excellent! That bit of ecological comparison earns you tonight's gold star. It's entirely possible, as I suggested back a ways in <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>, that industrial civilization is the first, most wasteful, and most short-lived sere in the process of succession that will eventually lead to technic civilizations capable of very long term stability; your suggestion that this might be true of civilizations more generally deserves, I think, serious consideration. <br><br>As for the pornographization of the hierarchy of needs -- hmm. That may indeed be the metaphor I need. Hmm again...<br><br>Candace, that's a complex and hugely important issue. I discussed it to some extent in the sequence of posts that turned into <i>The Wealth of Nature</i>, but it could use considerable expansion; I'll consider further posts on the subject down the road a bit. <br><br>MichaelK, er, I take it you don't remember the days when the Reagan administration was packed with fundamentalist Christians who insisted, among other things, that we didn't have to protect the environment because Jesus was coming soon and would fix everything for us. Apocalyptic fantasists have been getting access to political power here in the US for a very long time. <br><br>Cherokee, and that same ability to turn your back on dysfunctional behavior is probably a good bit of why you're comfortably ensconced in an off-grid homestead, too! It's a good thing to cultivate. <br><br>Bob, if the far future doesn't concern you, this blog is going to bore you fairly often. The far future interests me, even though I won't be around to see it, and so we'll be talking about it at length here. <br><br>Mojoglo, I'd encourage you to be suspicious when anyone tries to use buzzwords like "fascism" and "the wrong side of history" to goad you into political activity. Those are demagogues' tactics, and very often conceal unstated agendas. If you feel that politics are relevant to your life right now, I'd encourage you to choose your own style of involvement and activity -- and in any case, deepening your spiritual roots and changing the way you relate to the biosphere and your bioregion is to my mind some of the most useful things anybody can do right now. <br><br>Tidlösa, no matter how the Second World War ended, there was going to be a totalitarian state ruling eastern Europe for a while thereafter -- and it's a matter of historical record that Stalin was responsible for significantly more mass killings than Hitler, so I'm not even sure how great the difference would have been. (Robert Harris' novel <i>Fatherland</i>, to my mind, scored a direct hit by portraying life in a victorious German Reich in 1964 in terms very closely modeled on life in the Soviet Union in that same year.

The American Petroleum Institute apparently felt it worth five million dollars plus video production costs to inform the public that oil is great stuff, especially for non-fuel uses such as paints, makeup, and plastics. (The latter are represented in the ad by advanced-looking artificial hands and hearts rather than, say, piles of discarded soda bottles or the inventory of a dollar store.)<br><br>I'm usually pretty good at figuring out the industry motivations behind such "whole industry" ads. Usually they has far more to do with investor perceptions (and thus, ultimately, stock prices) than motivating consumer purchases. I haven't worked this one out fully, though. Is the American Petroleum Institute worried that investors will mistakenly perceive a few electric cars on the road as a sign that petroleum is passé? Are they trying to muddle understanding of oil's role in climate change by pointing to the small percentage of it that isn't burned as fuel? Are they actually afraid the public will, against all plausibility, deliberately reduce their use of petroleum products any time soon? Does the ad relate to some proposed or pending change in government policies? Or are they positioning (way too early, it would seem to me) for oil's eventual role as a feedstock for luxury products once it's no longer affordable as fuel?<br><br>The 30-second ad can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EaUkZdrvvw<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c3021677225904538464 title="comment permalink">2/6/17, 7:14 PM</a><br><br>

The thing that makes historical cycles endlessly intriguing, at least to me, is that it's always different music playing, and a different hotel room, and a different person waking up -- but the same broad set of events follows step by step anyway. Certainly, the progression from hedonism through nihilism to altruism is one option in response...<br><br>Avery, yes, I'd read that. <br><br>LatheChuck, and it would be an intriguing project, for those sufficiently familiar with the various models, to compare them to historical cycles and see which one(s) produce the best fit. <br><br>Caryn, it's always different each time, and the differences don't change the fact that the same cycle repeats itself. As for the hunter-gatherers, they're not going to emerge until the biosphere recovers, of course. I thought I'd made it adequately clear that we're not talking about overnight transformations...<br><br>Roy, if someone were to start preaching a bona fide messianic revitalization movement right now in terms that appealed to the anti-Trump coalition, I'm quite convinced that it would become a huge mass movement in no time flat. The strategy of bringing down constitutional government in order to overturn Trump's election, on the other hand, strikes me as rather too familiar -- we've seen this one play out how many times in foreign countries? Follow the money, and my guess is some familiar names will turn out to be behind it. <br><br>Chris, I'm also an astrologer, and I think you're being profoundly simplistic in your analysis. <br><br>Scotlyn, thanks for the correction. I really don't know how they'll fare. As for philosophy and medicine, duly noted -- I'm doing research right now into the current state of antibiotic resistance among pathogens, which bids fair to have an immense impact on health care everywhere. <br><br>Mgalimba, I certainly hope you're right. <br><br>Sunseekernv, nope -- thanks for the pointer! <br><br>Agent, exactly. It's possible to predict the trajectory of a civilization for much the same reason that it's possible to predict the behavior of a gas under specific conditions of temperature and pressure: the unpredictable behavior of individuals is more or less cancelled out in mass quantities. <br><br>Hubertus, yes, but that's not something we're going to discuss here. The people out there who are calling for that to happen have apparently forgotten that advocating the commission of a crime is a crime under federal law, and in this particular case, there may be hard time involved. <br><br>Myriad, hah!

Statements of the same kind have been made about Iran repeatedly by the last two US presidential administrations, you know. <br><br>Econojames, they're very much relevant -- and yes, I also find it comforting to reflect on the broader context of deep time. As for science and what's real, why, we'll be talking about that shortly! <br><br>Hubertus, that's why I've said over and over again that if we're going to keep some of those technologies going through the coming dark age, people here and now are going to have to roll up their sleeves and get to work. <br><br>Hubertus, yeah, I got to see the same sort of thing now and again, too. Those are the times I wonder if "sapiens" really ought to be the name of our species. <br><br>Onething, I think it's quite possible that an attempt is under way to organize one. <br><br>Caelan, that's pretty typical, all things considered. <br><br>Crow Hill, the difficulties with that thesis are that, first, there's extensive evidence for deforestation in the Lowland Maya heartland from the terminal classic period, and second, there's also extensive evidence for severe malnutrition and a 95% population decline during the terminal classic period. I'd want to see any alternative theory explain that body of evidence. <br><br>Matt, the Lardbucket really is the gift that just keeps on giving! <br><br>Iuval, in every generation there are people who claim they can use the fruits of the system without being coopted by it. In every generation, they end up faced with a choice between letting themselves be coopted or being deprived of the fruits of the system. That is to say, if you think you can remain dependent on empire and still oppose it, you're kidding yourself. <br><br>Latefall, good. As a summary, that works quite well. <br><br>Lordberia3, that's one of the problems with political groupthink: when somebody does something genuinely different, the response involves a lot of screeching and waving of hands, and not always much else. <br><br>Nastarana, I don't read critics or major newspapers, but I play Copeland pieces quite often and enjoy them; so do other people I know. As for Wagner, who said an opera has to be an improvement over an epic poem? I've also read the source material, and enjoy those, Wagner's operas, and Tolkien's <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, another creative project drawing on much of the same material. If you don't -- why, then, you don't, and that's no concern of mine.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c4599894658470321593 title="comment permalink">2/6/17, 8:05 PM</a><br><br>

The rules were that we kids—and he—had to refrain from insults, keep our tempers, and put forth sound reasons for our views. “’Cause I think so, so I know it’s true” was derided as simple opinion, not worth spending time on unless backed up with some kind of thoughtful analysis, evidence, or provable facts. Over time we each moderated. When he retired, he devoted his life to helping those less fortunate than himself in a variety of hands-on ways, while I turned to finding productive, life and ecosystem enhancing things to work <i>for</i>, rather than only standing in opposition.<br><br>Thus from this background do I say: It is one thing to insult the other side within the safety of a group of the likeminded. However, in a public forum in which radically different views are being put forth, the talk, in my opinion, should center on the ideas and the discussion of same. There is a huge difference between ideas and viewpoints on the one hand, and the language used to express them, on the other. Language used to intimidate--whether from left, right, alt-right, or any other ideological or religious perspective—is not being used to actually advance discussion, persuade or examine ideas. It is being used to express hostility, in varying shades and intensities.<br><br>This is clearly not helpful to anyone, not even the speakers, though they may gain some kind of pleasure from it. So, to all, please make an argument; do not use short-hand jargon or slurs, call names or fling insults. Put ideas out there and explain why you think that way, don’t just use a variant of the sentence “those x?%$s are wrong because they’re &amp;#@?*s.” There are plenty of forums—mostly not worth the bother of visiting-- where that is the norm already.<br><br>This forum is unique, remarkable, precious—and precarious. I would hate to see it devolve into simply another place on the internet where people express hostility and conflicting views in an unproductive manner, without coming to terms, finding solutions, learning from one another, or any of the other valuable things to be gained from a truly productive exchange of opinions—backed by thoughtful analysis, evidence, or provable facts.<br><br><br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c8026612714801749354 title="comment permalink">2/7/17, 7:08 AM</a><br><br>

So let's snap that the other way again. Pretty much everyone who actually has thought about this stuff has agreed that, as resource scarcity gradually grows, suburbia is doomed. It is way too dependent on expensive infrastructure, and produces next to nothing. <br><br>Our current overhyped "red blue divide" is really a suburban urban divide. People like to characterize the red voters as rural, but they really are on average suburban. True rural residents remain as voiceless and powerless as ever. Nor are the "Reds" mostly poor; they still as of the 2016 election had incomes that were on average solidly middle class. The growth of Red America has mostly been a story of the growth of Suburban America. No point in countering with "well, *I* am not like that!" You read and comment on The Archdruid Report. This means you are not an average American voter on any spectrum. <br><br>So what happens over the coming century as suburbia slowly crumbles? The illusion of the self-reliant nuclear family collapses under the weight of unmaintained roads, decaying schools, and expensive energy for all that transportation, heating, lawn care, etc. I am not even going to hazard a guess at what the political movement is that will grow out of this, other than to say I am pretty sure it does not look very much like either of the major parties right now, nor like any of the "alt" versions of them presently in vogue. <br><br>The internet may be overwhelmed now with talk of Trumpistas and SJW Snowflakes, but I expect few will even remember those terms in another generation or two. And those across the landscape who are ferociously arguing the merits and demerits of the current political entities are not the voices of the future. They are echoes of the past that have not yet faded.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c8236249727008865592 title="comment permalink">2/7/17, 9:06 AM</a><br><br>

Most suburban households have plenty of space for extended families due to excessive home size, and more growing space than is available to most city dwellers--a suburban lot managed with intensive organic gardening and/or permaculture can be very productive. Lack of proximity to necessities is an issue, but honestly about all one needs is a grocery and general store, the addition of which does not strike me as prohibitive if circumstances began trending against commuter culture. Lack of proximity to jobs is more intractable, but many rural communities have few jobs and manage to hobble along with a combination of cottage economy, subsistence activity, and seasonal or sporadic work, plus maybe a person or two in the family with a "real" job, and I don't see any real reason that sort of retrenchment is out of the question for suburbanites.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c4855246322485425155 title="comment permalink">2/7/17, 12:17 PM</a><br><br>

The uniquely splendid part is the Happy Mortoring![TM] lifestyle of American suburbanity which has spread far and wide across almost all the nations of the Earth as economically and culturally possible. It's quite the testament to its splendidness that only Cuba--so far--and North Korea and scattered indigenous peoples seem to be able to resist it. It's also a testament to its uniqueness that humanity has never seen anything quite like it before.<br><br>Oh, I know, I know, Rome had something similar: the Augustan History of Septimus Severus makes mentions of highways leading to suburban estates from the city. But Rome at its largest contained only somewhat over a million people and occupied a space of about twenty square miles, both small by today's standards, the highways were only narrow though superbly-engineered country ways, and the suburbs were open only to the top 1% of the day: the equestrians and senators. What's the difference and what makes today's industrial civilisation automotive lifestyle unique?<br><br>The extraction and burning of fossil fuels, that's what. The resultant <b><i>rate</i></b> of increase of Carbon Dioxide in Earth's Atmossphere is utterly unprecedented in all of Earth's [human and deep] history. This same extraction is going to make the coming bad years uniquely horrible and different from everything else in the course of human history: global warming of at least 6 degrees C in the course of a thousand years, above the heights of the present interglacial. To find something similar you have to go back to the Permian ExSTINKtion which was caused by the burning of way too much Coal by vulacanism during the icy depths or interglacial heights of the glaciation of its time. And from that "uttah disastuh" which made the planet "smell like New Joisey," it'll probably pan out to be no different this time.<br><br><i>n.b.</i> when I was a little kid, my family went by car between Maryland and Massachusetts a few times, and we always went by the Jersey Turnpike.

Go find the latest research on what happened to the weather at the end of the Eemian which was about 2 deg C warmer than today (ca 1950).

If the metropolis still produces a good or service that bring in money - I assume many of the urban areas will consume their suburban population readily. I think that is one of the defining features of urban areas: they are population sinks. <br><br>If the metropolis is not viable, I assume the question becomes what the next best option is. Probably in many cases it will remain drawing in population with (unrealistic) opportunities, and then keeping the people docile with minimal expenses. A look at Russian monotowns is perhaps worthwhile: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotown#Problems<br><br>Urban centers that remain viable and have trade would likely see their suburban belt converge around the connecting trade routes. Also former communist countries actually saw moderate population density areas being fairly resilient due to gardening, though I can't say how much that will be paralleled in the USA. I'd say unless there is (and perhaps even with) drastic change in what kind of future people plan and strive for drugs will play a major role. Depending on the drug there are a significant variation in the details of the outcome. <br><br>The other big factor is probably going to be sanitation infrastructure, diseases, and (more relevant towards the end of that century) child mortality. <br><br>If cities can't eat people fast enough, I assume the violent conflicts are another option. If there still is a government, those conflicts can probably be arranged to happen outside the USA, but ideally in regions that are not too inhospitable to make recruitment difficult, are easy to get to, and not particularly threatening (or covered by serious alliances).<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c7628868307905195043 title="comment permalink">2/7/17, 1:49 PM</a><br><br>

It's clear that liberal progressives seem to have a lot more energy than traditional conservatives, and even the populists. For example, they're much more motivated to hold demonstrations, proselytise, climb their way to the top of the bureaucratic/academic/media career ladder etc. I think this is really why they have conquered almost the entire cultural arena.<br><br>In turn, I think their energy derives from the religious nature of progressivism. It is clearly a creed which holds certain ideas as sacred.<br><br>What Trump/Bannon/Miller etc. appear to be doing is not attempting to counter the progressives' energy by reducing it, or matching it with their own, but instead they are encouraging the progressives to expend their energy at an excessive rate. Their method of doing this is basically by trolling the progressives by simultaneously attacking a number of their sacred values. The rights of refugees (who are living angels in progressive thought) and womens' reproductive rights (considered to be a non-negotiable done deal) are useful targets precisely because they generate such an incendiary response.<br><br>In energy conservation terms, think how little energy Trump expends in a five-second Tweet.

I would consider it a significant hardship to be forced to choose between Californian and US citizenship, both for civic and for bureaucratic reasons. I consider both renunciation of citizenship and naturalization solemn acts that should be taken cautiously and after full discernment, not under duress. For these reasons alone, I'm pretty confident that a Calexit referendum would be defeated; it will be very easy to convince voters of the bureaucratic nightmare of secession, not to mention questions of American patriotism and what the federal government would do to militarily suppress a secession. <br><br>Second, I agree with the argument that Calexit is an attempt to keep California's slaves, i.e., its shadow workforce of illegal immigrants and other exploitable foreigners. H-1B and L-1 visa abuse is a huge problem in high tech, and the exploitation of farm workers has been an intractable problem for California's entire history as a polity, going back to the early Spanish missions. Comparisons to Antebellum slavery are hyperbolic, but barely so: there's a glaring racial and cultural angle divide distracting from an underlying class problem that no one has the courage to address, exacerbated by a linuistic divide that didn't exist in most parts of the Antebellum South. If the feds can force a humane, equitable solution to this mess, more power to them. A federal system that licentiously allowed states to make their own laws on chattel slavery by racial attainder set the stage for the Civil War, and a federalism that allows states to make their own decisions about the toleration of a peasant underclass living in the shadows with limited civil rights and liberties isn't all that much better. I really wish affluent Americans weren't so smug about this, and so willfully ignorant of our own national history. <br><br>I have similar, but less strenuous, objections to the State of Jefferson and Six Californias. The latter is a revolt of a few shady Silicon Valley elites who are offended that they're expected to contribute to public services in rural parts of the state that send them food, water, oil, and other necessities. The former annoys me because it provides a rallying point for whiny rural grandstanding, much of it by back-to-the-land types who try too hard to be country good old boys and girls. For better and (mostly) worse, I have Ashland connections, and SoJ agitprop is inescapable in the Rogue Valley. I can't stand listening to country bumpkins and city slickers acrimoniously compete for victimhood points while simultaneously trying to divert entire state and federal treasuries into their own troughs. I'm tempted to silence State of Jefferson liberals with reminders that Jefferson had slaves, but I don't want to come away feeling sleazy.<br><br>We lost a whole lot of fellow feeling somewhere along the way.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c5348910408133548174 title="comment permalink">2/7/17, 9:55 PM</a><br><br>

But violence is also stupid, in the following sense.<br><br>If you have a goal that requires another's labour, stuff, compliance or absence, it takes study and attention and time to elicit their co-operation. (Also, you will probably have to reciprocate with a contribution in return). <br><br>Violence requires no study, no attention, no time - threaten it, or actually demonstrate it, and co-operation will be instant.<br><br>How do these differ? Well, study, time and attention are costly, violence is cheap. But on the other side of the balance sheet, the cooperation you obtain in the first way may last a lifetime (or even longer), whereas the cooperation you achieve the second way lasts as long as you can stay awake and never have to turn your back.<br><br>The difficulty I have with Dammerung's proposal is not the prospect that there will be violence or conflict. Conflict is already rife and violence is sometimes the only remaining way to settle unavoidable conflict.<br><br>But, among other things, he proposes a long-term controlled human breeding project (in order that his descendents may enjoy the gift of his blue eyes and white skin). Such breeding projects always turn on the control of daughters and their mate choices, and daughters naturally always object to having their mates chosen for them. Therefore, a determined long term human controlled breeding program ultimately requires the locking up of daughters, and the severe punishment of those who resist or escape, embedding chronic and continuous relations of violence into the heart of every family. <br><br>Is that the best use of violence you can think of?<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c5258206920069019653 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 3:36 AM</a><br><br>

If one is born in America, one is American, ipso facto. I think the point is that for 99% of us, our ancestors came from somewhere else--they immigrated here at some point in the last roughly 400 years, some more recently than others, and together have made our country what it is. That process is continuing.<br><br>In the very diverse part of America where I live, plenty of people were born here, but many were not.

Virtually anyone can find themselves having a racist thought or expressing a racist view; racism and xenophobia are clearly part of the human constitution otherwise they would hardly be so ubiquitous in society. That does not make the person "A Racist" as a fundamental defining part of their character and decision making. But even if you are a raving lunatic racist, that does not mean that any argument you put forward is by default wrong. Raving lunatic racists can still make logical and consistent statements. And someone who is staunchly anti-racist in their beliefs can also make a coherent argument from the point of view of a raving lunatic racist. So it is irrelevant to the discussion and serves only as a personal insult. If someone wants to attack a "raving lunatic racist" statement they believe you made or an action you say you have taken, that is done by disecting and debunking the logic and morality of what you said or did, not by criticising your personal character. <br><br>Kind of amusing that argumentum ad hominem is simultaneously one of the easiest of logical falacies to spot and debunk, AND one of the most common (ubiquitous) logical fallacies in day to day dialogue.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6783068766415123256 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 8:39 AM</a><br><br>

However, I know that I probably would care less if I could have been left alone to live a more conservative life. That such has been denied to me, and basically that my dreams have been severely disrupted due to new liberal mores is extremely upsetting. In short, I was raised and followed traditional mores and expectations, I also was hoping to participate in a "societal game" that made sense to me. When the world changed, as far as I'm concerned, I felt betrayed and couldn't even seem to escape to where I could still fit in. <br><br>I do not believe that leftist movements can avoid the weakness which I mentioned. I believe its fundamental to it - any movement that seeks inclusion, by definition, will largely drift toward including a large number of hanger-ons and toxic elements. The same philosophy for inclusion usually makes it difficult for such elements to ever be removed. <br><br>@Adrian Ayres Fisher <br><br>I'm careful not to dox myself. In short, though, I was working for a much more reactionary organization that was organized against hierarchial lines. Times have changed, but recently I've gained an advisory role in another one as well. I hope to bring my experience to leverage for the cause.<br><br>As for what I believe in and wanted to work for - it meant living in a world where the ancient mores of social conduct, honor and tribe could still be honored. I grew up reading of great men: of Robert E. Lee and Hannibal, of amibition sought and desperate bloody struggles, of beauty and ideals and sacrifice. I fell in love. <br><br>Atomized individuality destroyed so much of them. For example, I would want to take pride in my identity as a man, with the implicit assumptions of being a warrior, a protector, and provider. Naturally, this would boundary that women wouldn't be able to do what I was doing. I'm quite happy with set roles. It provides me with a sense of safety, allows me to focus only on what I am best at and few things give me more serenity than a steady hierarchy. <br><br>Liberalism denies me that. I equate liberalism with maddening, insane individuality with an added slice of carebear. From a perspective of self-interest, it serves to either make it either more difficult, or to deny me of what I want. From the perspective of beauty, it choses to insult the entire tradition that I had come to love for its own modern intreptations. And from the perspective of my community, liberalism not only insults the notion of a tribe, but wants to deny that there are any tribes, boundaries, or identity except that which is self-created.<br><br>I, of course, cannot exist in such a world. Thus I would rather work with people who may even want to kill me later, than to "live" in the ugliness of a world that liberals would want to bring about. A vapid, inspid world of self-defined units where nothing is sacred, and everyone is as inoffensive, harmless, and medicated animal as your average domesticated cow.<br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c1792059410686959633 title="comment permalink">2/8/17, 2:55 PM</a><br><br>

I mean obviously it's hypothetically possible to breed humans to improve fitness (for a particular definition of fitness) and for some particular appearance (which is just a type of fitness anyway). Of course, people, especially women who can choose their mates, practice eugenics all the time anyway. I don't think the 1930's eugenicists did anything wrong anyway, maybe some of the things they wanted to eliminate didn't need eliminating, but if we had an ever increasing resource base forever it would stand to reason that there would be no natural check on human quality.<br><br>Regarding violence, no, violence isn't easy although guns make it much simpler. You have to have the equipment and skill and willingness to risk injury and death to do violence. And there's two sides to violence: You can be violent on behalf of a community of generally non-violent people or you can be violent against a community of generally non-violent people. If order collapses, the criminal element will likely play the role of the police, for better or for worse. And of course, what is government, really, but an exquisitely sophisticated and (usually) gentle protection racket? You don't pay your taxes and the government takes away your livelihood. You don't pay the mob every Friday, your windows get smashed. But you don't need to be capable of or ready for violence at all times.

I remember discussing the topic as a teen, in the mid-1970s. (See Wikipedia entry on the topic.) One way to sidestep the predicament is to arrange your circumstances so as to not find yourself on a ship with a totally inadequate number of lifeboats for the number of passengers. The scenario (too many swimmers for the lifeboat capacity) is merely the end-stage of a disaster that began when the ship sailed with too many passengers for the lifeboat(s).<br><br>If we have the foresight not to get on the boat, then the ethical problems will be someone else's. However, if Earth itself is the lifeboat, then this isn't an option. On the other hand, a metropolitan area or island might be considered a lifeboat, and then we do have choices.<br><br>If we have the foresight to build more lifeboat capacity, or take on fewer passengers, then there may be no crisis.<br><br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c7154064517807737741 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 3:20 AM</a><br><br>

For every "civilization" going through a cycle there are dozens of others going through cycles as well. So what? If America were to collapse tomorrow or slowly decay something else would take its place and that would be fine. As an individual, I will adapt just as Germans who were born in the 30s and survived the war simply changed their identity. It just isn't interesting to say that a particular institution or government has a finite lifespan. It's almost too mundane and obvious to be of interest. The reason we don't make a bigger deal about it is because nobody wants to live life as a complete pessimist. We know the country will die some day. Maybe tomorrow, maybe in 400 years, but if we dwell on it we speed up its happening. And btw, after Caesar the average Roman citizen probably did not think his country was in decline. Oh sure, from one year to the next he would think it was falling a part or was the best thing ever. It would have depended on where he lived in the empire and what his station was. And after the fall, if he lived in Constantinople vs Rome his belief would have differed as well. Meanwhile, while Rome was dying the folks on the steps, or in India, or in China or in the Americas would have had a completely different outlook. People all over the world simultaneously believed that the world was both on the upswing and falling apart. Heck, even in the US at this moment people hold widely differing views. In October some people thought we sucked and we needed to m"make America Great again". Then in November they thought it was all great and on the upswing. The other half had the mirror opposite beliefs. <br><br><br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c6095985297777110300 title="comment permalink">2/10/17, 6:27 AM</a><br><br>

So then we have representations looking for meaning ,which is something more than mere representation.Maybe just being representations was what the existentialist were getting at when they asked whether they exist or not. Deep inside they felt something was missing and so they began scratching the existential itch.Their discourse began and ended with the idea, yes idea, that they are the body and that they are the intellect. That whatever is going on around this construct of body/intellect out there, will be conceived from this perspective.<br> The eastern philosophies delve more into answering the question ;" what is it that we are a representation of?" When they ask this question they put everything on the philosophical chopping block: the ego, the intellect, the everyday mundane mind, in fact even the body.The only reason they were able to do this is because thay had unraveled the body/intellect/ego knot. Here in the west , in most cases , the philosophies seem to hold the intellect up as the pillar upon which reality will be revealed. Maybe it would behoove us to familiarize ourselves with some of the philosophical texts; this way we will hold more than one philosophical context.This way we won't fall into the trap that Goethe was pointing out, that you need to know more than one language to know language at all.<br> I suggest, ,"The Pratyabhijna-hrdayam", which translates to "The Splendor of Recognition". It is one of the main texts of Kashmir Shaivism , written in the 11th century. Swami Shantananda does a great job at interpretation.It organizes reality into 36 levels ensconced within each other like Russian dolls. Also ,'The Yoga Vasistha", which through short stories presents the make up of reality from the Vedantic perspective.There are others, these are two of my favorites.<br><br><br><a href=perched-on-wheel-of-time.html#c7064282288941491232 title="comment permalink">2/14/17, 1:49 PM</a><br><br>
