<div class=MsoNormal>
Regular readers of this blog will be aware that I’ve spent most of the last year discussing the place of religion in the troubled future ahead of us. This holiday season, in which millions of Americans have just engaged in an all-out orgy of conspicuous consumption and mindless waste to celebrate the birth of a poor carpenter’s son in a stable in Bethlehem, also has me thinking about religious matters, and it occurs to me that there’s an issue along these lines that my blog posts haven’t yet explored. It may not have much to do with the future of the modern industrial world, but it may just explain a thing or two about the present and the recent past here in the United States.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m sorry to say that the issue I have in mind has a distinct partisan dimension, which marks a break from my usual policy in this blog. One of the more common criticisms I field from irate readers, in fact, is the insistence that I treat politicians of both major US parties as though they’re interchangeable. It’s a valid criticism, since I do indeed do this, and the only justification I can offer is that, by and large, that’s the way they behave. For exhibit A, it’s hard to beat the current inmate of the White House, who won the presidency just over five years ago in a flurry of sound bites about “hope” and “change,” and then turned around and gave us a truly inspired imitation of the third and fourth terms of George W. Bush, complete with all the drone strikes and violations of civil liberties that his chorus of sycophants in the media used to insist he was sure to abolish once he got into office. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, the criticism has some merit, since there’s one significant difference between the two major US parties. Most Democratic politicians, like the example just cited, will say and do whatever it takes to get elected, and then conveniently forget all about their alleged ideals in order to proceed with, and profit from, the ordinary business of politics once they land in office. A fair number of Republican politicians do exactly the same thing, to be sure, but there’s also a large number of Republicans who have convictions regarding important social issues, and cling firmly to those convictions even when they’re not popular.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That’s a distinction worth noting, but a certain amount of confusion enters the picture when the Republicans in question—as nearly all of them do—insist that their convictions follow from their Christian faith. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course the Christian faith does have quite a bit to say about social issues. Theologies differ from church to church, but friends of mine in several different denominations assure me that the words of Jesus quoted in the four gospels of the New Testament are considered definitive guides to faith and morals, so I sat down a few days ago with a copy of the King James version and spent an afternoon reading the gospels—not, by the way, for the first time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here are the passages I found in which Jesus tells his followers that they have a duty to take care of children, the poor, and other vulnerable people: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Matthew 18:6, 18:10, 19:21, 23:14, and 25:31-46; Mark 9:36-37, 10:21, and 12:40; and Luke 10:30-37, 11:41, 12:33, 14:12-14, 18:22, and 20:47. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here are the passages in which Jesus tells his followers to pay their taxes without complaining: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Matthew 5:42, 17:24-27, and 22:19-21; Mark 12:14-17; and Luke 6:30 and 20:21-25.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here are the passages in which Jesus tells his followers that they aren’t supposed to obsess about other people’s sins, but should leave that to God, and attend to their own moral failings instead: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Matthew 7:1-5 and 9:10-13; Mark 2:15-17; Luke 6:37, 6:41-42, 7:44-48, 15:2, 18:10-14, and 19:7; and John 8:2-11.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And here are the passages in which Jesus tells his followers to blame the poor and vulnerable for their plight, direct benefits toward the already well-to-do at the expense of everyone else, refuse to pay their fair share of taxes, and obsessively denounce and punish the sins of people they don’t like while finding every opportunity to excuse their own sins and those of their friends: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yet these latter are the things that a great many Republicans, and in particular a great many of those Republicans who claim to be motivated by their Christian faith, have been pursuing in practice, if not always advocating in theory. If they’re deriving their commitments from a religion, it’s pretty clearly not the one taught by Jesus. Many people have made this same point in recent years, but it doesn’t seem to have occurred to any of them that another religion that’s active in today’s America does teach all the things the GOP supports. That religion, of course, is Satanism, and more specifically the version of it taught in Anton Szandor LaVey’s
<i>The Satanic Bible</i>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those who were around during LaVey’s glory days in the 1970s, when he appeared regularly on talk shows and had a coterie of Hollywood stars in his Church of Satan, will doubtless remember <i>The Satanic Bible</i>. For those who weren’t, it’s a book-length screed denouncing Christian morality and upholding an ethic of raw selfishness and might-makes-right. It’s still very much in copyright, so I’m not going to quote it here, but any reader who turns its pages will find the present social policy of the GOP precisely reflected in LaVey’s dismissal of two thousand years of Christian teaching about our duty to care for one another, his shrill denunciations of the vulnerable and needy as “parasites” and “vampires,” and his insistence that the successful owe nothing to anybody else. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
An interesting coincidence, or perhaps an ironic one? Maybe so, but I find myself wondering if there’s more to it than that. It happens fairly often that the repeated failure of a belief system causes many former believers to swing all the way to the opposite extreme, and embrace the antithesis of their former faith. The neoconservatives who briefly and disastrously shaped the direction of US foreign policy in the first years of this century are a case in point:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>many of the leaders of that movement were doctrinaire Marxists during their college years, and responded to the abject failure of Marxism by doing their level best to become the wicked capitalists they had once so fervently denounced. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The evangelical revival of the late 1970s and 1980s, in turn, was pervaded by hopes at least as extreme and unrealistic as anything the Marxists envisioned in their heyday. Wildly popular books such as Hal Lindsey’s
<i>The Late Great Planet Earth</i> convinced millions of newly “Born Again” Christians that the Second Coming was due any minute, and the repeated failure of Jesus to show up on cue must have put immense psychological strains on a great many people who cut their ties to the secular world in the imminent expectation of Armageddon. All through those same years, in turn, copies of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>The Satanic Bible</i> could be found in cheap mass market editions on the shelves of chain bookstores all over America. It’s not hard to imagine how, after each loudly proclaimed date for the Rapture waltzed serenely by without incident, a trickle of not-quite-former fundamentalists could well have responded to their feelings of humiliation and despair by walking away from the Bible section in those same bookstores and seeing if the opposing side had something better on offer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those who found solace of one sort or another in LaVey’s evocation of diabolical values would have had several good reasons not to make their change of heart public, to be sure. On the one hand (or horn, or cloven hoof), a public confession of devil worship would have been difficult to explain to one’s employer in those somewhat more innocent times, and the reactions of one’s presumably Christian friends and family would also have been an issue for many. On the other, one of the classic titles given Satan by Christian theologians is “the father of lies,” and it’s easy to see how the thought of remaining ostensibly Christian while practicing devil worship in private, and perhaps leading others down the Left Hand Path, might have seemed like the most delectable option available to these new Satanic converts. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor would active membership in most of today’s Christian churches have been any impediment to the enthusiastic worship of Satan. According to Matthew 7:21, it’s not enough to say “Lord, Lord,” to qualify as a Christian; it’s also necessary to do the will of God—a requirement that, as noted above, involves among other things some highly specific commitments to help the poor and vulnerable. Thus covert devil worshippers could shout “Jesus is Lord” at the top of their lungs every Sunday, and so long as they carefully refrained from following the teachings of the gospels, they would have had no difficulty maintaining their status as Satanists in good standing. This, it seems, they accordingly did. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the number of devil worshippers in evangelical churches and the Christian end of the Republican Party increased, though, their most pressing need would have been some surreptitious way to signal their involvement to those who shared their convictions, without believers in the Christian gospel being any the wiser. Coming up with a Satanic shibboleth that would be instantly recognizable to other devil worshippers, but completely opaque to devout Christians, might seem like a tall order, but it’s one that seems to have been met with aplomb. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, this is where we discuss Ayn Rand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All things considered, Rand’s cult status in those circles that call themselves conservative these days is hard to explain, because Rand was not a conservative. By that I don’t simply mean that she rejected the term and savagely denounced conservative ideas and politicians, though this is true; nor that the conservative movement in her time rejected her ideas with at least as much energy as she did theirs, and generally with better logic than hers, though this was also the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Far more important here is that she was a radical ideologue of exactly the sort against which the founders of conservatism directed their most barbed and thoughtful critiques. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As discussed in Russell Kirk’s brilliant study <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, classical conservatism has at its core an enduring and wholly justified suspicion of claims that some abstract ideology or other can bring about heaven on earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“The pretended rights of these theorists,” wrote Edmund Burke, “are all extremes; and in proportion as they are metaphysically true, they are morally and politically false.” He was talking about the Jacobins, but he could just as well have been talking about Rand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, there’s another point that is worth making here, which is that Ayn Rand was a violent opponent of Christianity and Christian morality, a <a href=http://rebirthofreason.com/Articles/Parille/Ayn_Rand,_Objectivism,_and_Religion_(Part_1_of_4).shtml>committed atheist</a> who considered selfishness <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virtue_of_Selfishness>a central moral virtue</a>, and who also <a href=http://michaelprescott.freeservers.com/romancing-the-stone-cold.html>idolized one of the most disgusting child murderers</a> of the twentieth century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Her present role as intellectual pin-up girl for people who call themselves Christian conservatives is thus a little odd, since claiming to be a Christian and a believer in Rand’s teachings at the same time is right up there with claiming to be a vegetarian carnivore or a celibate harlot. It’s not just that one of these things is not like the other; Rand’s teachings are flatly, openly, and deliberately opposed to every part of the gospel of Jesus. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Rand’s anticommunism made her turgid novels popular on the less thoughtful end of the American right in the 1950s and 1960s, though, and that accident of history prepared her for what might just be her core role in contemporary culture: a covert way for devil worshippers to identify themselves to one another in the supposedly Christian (and just as supposedly conservative) GOP of today. Closet Satanists attending fundamentalist church services or Republican party get-togethers can’t exactly sport upside-down pentagrams on their shirts or greet other attendees with a hearty “Hail Satan,” but a casual reference to one of Rand’s novels or pseudophilosophical screeds is the next best thing: once someone else responds enthusiastically to the mention of Rand’s name, a few other seemingly casual comments and perhaps a covert devil sign or two would be enough to settle the matter.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this may suggest some sobering reflections as we approach the beginning of another US election year, in which most races will pit a candidate from a party that puts its faith in Lucifer against a candidate from a party that for all practical purposes believes in nothing at all. Still, when supposedly Christian politicians start waxing rhapsodic about the alleged intellectual or literary virtues of Ayn Rand, I trust my readers will remember that what they’re saying actually works out to “I worship the Prince of Darkness, and you should too!” Any of my readers who happen to be devil worshippers themselves can proceed to welcome them as friends and brothers, while those of other faiths can cast their votes as their own ethical views suggest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the off chance that any Republican Satanists are reading these lines, though, I’d like to offer a helpful suggestion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The long charade of pretending to be Christian conservatives has no doubt been great fun, and it’s certainly succeeded in getting Satanic ideas widely accepted all through those parts of American society that might have been expected to resist them most forcefully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Only one of the seven deadly sins has gotten by without extravagant praise from so-called Christian conservatives in recent years—it’s hard to glorify an economic system that depends on avarice, gluttony, envy and sloth, and a foreign policy defined by pride and wrath, in any other way—and no doubt they’ll find a way to fit lust in there somewhere one of these days, and finish collecting the whole set. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At this point, though, it’s hard to see any reason why the Satanists in the GOP need to keep the pretense going any longer. In an era when most discussions of the Christmas season in the mass media fixate on whether retailers are making a big enough profit to keep the economy stumbling blindly onward for one more year, I think a strong case can be made that America is ready to shake off the last of its qualms and openly embrace a Satanic political agenda. Among its other benefits, putting public devil worship at the heart of the GOP, where it so evidently belongs, can’t help but improve the flagging ratings of Republican national conventions; the otherwise tedious proceedings of the 2016 GOP convention, for example, would be enlivened no end by a Black Mass celebrated by the GOP nominee, perhaps with Ann Coulter’s nude form draped over the altar and a chorus of delegates chanting “Evil, be thou my good!” from the bleachers. </div>

Christmas Eve, my father was watching Fox news. Eric Bolling was celebrating a young entrepreneur, as a "maker, not a taker." Then he was celebrating $10,000 tips to servers for dinner (on bills around $500-600), "Tips For Jesus". I turned to my born-again Christian mother and said, "It's Jesus birthday, let's celebrate money making and rich people!" She gave me as close to an evil eye as I have ever seen from her.<br><br>Then my father turned it to CNN. They were wailing about South Sudan. I turned to my mother and said, "See, CNN is just as bad. Here, look in this 3-page paid advertisement that reads like an article, in this Dec 30, 2013 Time magazine. It's about all the great investment opportunities in South Sudan. How much do you think this is trouble stirred up by multinational corporations, for the benefit of multinational corporations?" Who owns CNN? Time Warner. My mother says to me, but those evil Muslims are killing Christians! I said, "you all come from the same Abraham, I don't see why you can't get along." "My," she said. "you are far gone." LOL<br><br>She's no Satanist, but she'll believe just about anyone who claims to be Christian.

I'm not the least bit surprised you brought the two together, as Anton LaVay himself called what he offered Rand with trappings. In fact, you pointed out the Satanic nature of the GOP's beliefs in an entry from August of 2011, "The Twilight of Meaning." I don't think many Republicans have noticed, so the message definitely bore repeating.<br><br>As for the current crop of Christianists AKA Dominionists being willing, active Satanists, I think they are a bunch of easy dupes for the Devil or some other equally evil diety pretending to speak for the Holy Trinity. A friend of mine has gone so far as to propose that that while the Dominionists think they're worshiping Yahweh, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, they've been hoodwinked, and Huitzilopochtli and a couple of his buddies from the Aztec pantheon are receiving the Dominionists' devotion instead.<br><br>As for why they're such willing dupes, it's because they think they're making American Christian in preparation for the return of the vengeful Jesus of the Left Behind books and movies. Instead, they're making Christianity more American (actually more Southern) and then trying to convert America to that vision. Few ideas are more American in that view than anti-Communism, so slipping Satanism in via Ayn Rand was child's play.<br><br>Finally, you noted that Lust was not getting its due in the current Satanic/Objectivist vision, despite its central position in the life and fiction of Ayn Rand. That's because the American Right has tried to make two works of science fiction into reality simultaneously, "Atlas Shrugged" and "The Handmaid's Tale." The only way that combination works is if one is working for a bunch of religious fanatics in service to a kleptocracy. That's definitely Satanic.<br><br><a href=#c1498044390241263400 title="comment permalink">12/25/13, 9:14 PM</a><br><br>

I've been pondering this problem for a while and came up with a perhaps more complex explanation, yet similar. In my version, the Satan worshipers have been duped by Satan himself into substituting evil teachings and a mediocre and wicked God for the One of pure goodness taught by Jesus and James and John.<br>Although Jesus taught that God forgives magnanimously and limitlessly, they teach that God won't forgive without payment. (Which is technically not forgiveness).<br>Although Jesus taught that God does not want sacrifice, they teach that God required a human sacrifice.<br><br>Although Jesus taught that natural, unbidden compassion is the requirement to enter heaven, they teach that you will be happy in heaven despite knowing, and even witnessing, the hopeless and endless suffering of others.<br>Although the love of God is frequently mentioned, the reality of their doctrine is shown by the little religious tracts and calling cards which always amount to "Believe, or else."<br>So I began to play a mental game. Suppose we remove all the preconceived ideas and names, and just ask: If there were a being that people feared as the author of an unimaginable threat, would that be a good being or a wicked being?<br><br>If a being created people in a state of confusion and subject to bad impulses, and he then refused to forgive them forever if they didn't get the story right or weren't convinced by another human being of this story's correctness, or were born where the story was never told, would this be a good or an admirable being? Would you want the universe to be run by such a character?<br><br>Well, if people can be inspired by the Spirit of God, then cannot they also be inspired by the spirit of Satan? And if Satan is the father of lies and rumored to be clever, wouldn't his greatest challenge and triumph be to inspire theologians of negative bent to poison the theology taught by Jesus, twisting it to its opposite? And though you may call on the name of "God", if the characteristics of this God are satanic, then to whom is your heart really calling?<br><br><br><a href=#c3664271299330231745 title="comment permalink">12/25/13, 9:40 PM</a><br><br>

A lot of Christian fundamentalists are more obsessed with Satan than God, and in my experience quite a few actually are converting to Satanism (especially the theistic variety). When you throw in all the "sins" that liberal culture promotes (sex, drugs, rock &amp; roll, etc.), it's not hard to conclude that the U.S. is the closest thing the world has yet seen to a Satanic civilization. I believe Anton LaVey declared 1965 to be "year one" of the Satanic Age, which sounds about right.

Their behavior suggests disorder, confusion, inertia and a touch of hedonism mixed<br>in with occasional demonstrations that they do indeed have a genuine conscience.<br><br>They are driven primarily by habit and urges to feel pleasure. When they are done for<br>the day doing their best to make a living they either lapse into a passive, vegetative<br>state typically in front of a television or else seek activities which allow a temporary escape from <br>unpleasant circumstances at work or at home. They are pestered by a sense of obligation to wives, <br>husbands, children, neighbors, peers and to a jumbled collection of expectations of themselves.<br><br>The absence of any coherent ideology is in practice similar to nihilism.<br><br>Humanity as a whole seems to be practising nihilism today. There is no sensible ideology<br>that recommends overpopulating the planet, destroying the habitat for many of earth's<br>creatures, persisting in unsustainable energy-intensive lifestyles or pretending that the natural world has a virtually infinite capacity to absorb and process the waste from the activities of<br>modern industrial economies.<br><br>With regard to Christian right-wingers, I'm afraid that the suggestion that they are indeed<br>Satanists wouldn't go over very well. In fact, you might be taking your life in your hands with many of them. Part of the modus operandi of right-wing self-described Christians is a complete failure to maintain any semblance of an objective view of themselves or of the world around them. Many were genuinely in shock when Mitt Romney was soundly defeated by Obama. They had convinced themselves that <br>their characterization of Obama was the truth rather than a cynical and fanciful fabrication. They also convinced themselves that the general public was mostly in agreement with them. Obama may be an appropriate mascot for the bankruptcy of the liberal class, as Chris Hedges mentioned, but he's much <br>closer to being a Rockefeller Republican, as Noam Chomsky mentioned, than to being a socialist.<br><br>Anyway, bravo for your partisan views! Chris Hitchens would probably be laughing heartily were he still alive and in good health.

While I realize this was satire, I would have no doubt that some so-called Christians are unknowingly falling in line with the Randian/Satanist/Objectivist belief system; unknowingly because evangelicals wouldn’t touch The Satanic Bible with the proverbial 10-foot pole, much less read it, and thus do not understand what it’s really about. They still think Satanists actually worship The Dark Lord, most likely with child sacrifice. Anton LaVey was an atheist, and a former carny worker, and knew how to pitch a product. I wonder if he realized he could sway so many in the Christian Church to his viewpoint. And atheists are usually seen (in America, anyway) as being connected to socialism/communism, rather than the ideologies of the extreme right, which is another reason that the evangelical Christians do not see where they are waltzing. They are too busy listening to the music lyrics for proper doctrine to see who their dancing partner is and in what direction they are being lead. <br><br>Also—I was at the thrift store a while back, and found a copy of the book you referred to in your post, The Conservative Mind, by Kirk. I thought at the time this looked like a good book to read in order to get a grip on what conservatism encompasses. It's original copyright date was in 1953, so I thought it wouldn’t be tarnished by the Tea Party crack-pottery of today’s conservatism. Glad to see I made a good decision.

As noted in an earlier comment, Moloch would seem to be a most appropriate Satanic incarnation. Throughout the course of the long slouch to Bethlehem that began early in the 20th century, Americans have continuously sacrificed their lives and treasure to appease the limitless demands of that rough beast, receiving little in return but a "gaze pitiless and blank as the sun".<br><br><br><a href=#c5078924676365734859 title="comment permalink">12/26/13, 9:06 AM</a><br><br>

I’ve believed, for many decades, that the Abrahamic religions have been hijacked by a malevolent spirit. From the “sacrifice your child, Abraham -ha-ha, just kidding” story of the OT, though the “kill anyone who worships differently to you”, human sacrifice has been at the core of “revealed” religions. Human self-sacrifice (martyrdom) apparently gets one a special merit badge!<br> <br>The Davidic line of kings listed in the OT was used for many centuries to justify Feudalism and the divine right of kings to rule. Today, Prosperity Gospel reintroduces that idea, with the ultra-wealthy somehow “Blessed by God” and deserving of riches, while the poor are responsible for their suffering. By being Rich, the wealthy are blessed by God to rule over us. <br><br>When I visualize the heaven and Hell of Christians, I see two poles of what modern fiction has labeled “The Matrix” – the use of humans as batteries to power something. Fiction put it in a futuristic world, but the model applies to the spiritual. Those that believe, and believe they are good, go to heaven, where existence consists of paying attention to the God at the center of the heavenly spheres. Those that believe, and believe they are bad, have their attention focused on the absence of God, except though eternal torture. Two extremes, with an attempt to Sheppard humanity between them.<br><br>Abrahamic religions also strive to be monopolies which I have issue with. I see the revealed religions as “Factory Farms” on a spiritual level. They have no appeal to me, I prefer a more personal relationship with Deity, and the freedom to label it as I want.<br><br>A week ago I asked on Facebook, “Is it wrong to file ‘Atlas Shrugged’ under horror?” It resulted in far more social grooming than I expected, more than if I’d asked the same question about the bible! I have to wonder if Rand’s writing have superseded the bible as the #1 source of inspirational reading in the US of A.<br><br><br><a href=#c6289397785377742002 title="comment permalink">12/26/13, 9:25 AM</a><br><br>

The cult of evil and devil worship is well established, recent folk history says that both the Oklahoma city bombing and the Waco fire incident occurred on April 19th. April 19th being the day for 'sacrifice of women and children to the beast' in the calendar of the church of Satan.<br><br>Alex Jones put out a video presentation in 2004 called JFK II where he directly linked George H. W. Bush as an accomplice before the fact to the Kennedy assassination, and that every president since Kennedy has been a puppet of a shadow new world order government.<br><br>Even if he is only partially correct, this is scary stuff. That Larry Silverstein bought two white elephant real estate properties in New York and insured them for $1 billion in the event of a terrorist attack immediately prior to 9/11, suggesting foreknowledge and his direct involvement in the scheme. The mere fact that he has received payments of $2 billion dollars, plus he sued the airline companies for compensation this year and they paid, suggests widespread involvement and corruption of the 'elites' of our society in this charade. <br><br>Architect's and engineers for 9/11 truth, have proved beyond any doubt that the twin towers could not have collapsed due to structural failure, and that the only reason they collapsed was per-planned controlled demolition. The basis for starting two major wars has failed the test of time, and yet the majority of the population still believe the racist official story of Arab's hijacking aircraft and a perpetual war on terror.<br><br>I'm quite cynical about our future as a civilization. I'll focus on my own faults and sins, and try to change myself rather that focusing on the sins of others. Most people get so hung up on the Birth of Jesus and his later murder that they forget or ignore his teachings and his message. I'm quite fond of his message.

Throw in some opinions on the Red Sox and you could really rattle some people! <br><br>Since both US political parties are perpetuating big government/corporate welfare/interventionist foreign policies, they both need a narrative that works for that. As you say, democrats can make anything work, since they don't really believe in too terribly much. For republicans, though, the old fashioned Burkean conservativism that Kirk would have been comfortable with (and that I probably would vote for) clearly wasn't going to work, so it had to go.<br><br>I've always thought that a key part of the glue that holds the new Republican coalition together is an appeal to cold-eyed certainty and a rejection of nuance: so we get aggressive foreign policy, corporations are always right, fundamentalist religion, strict moral values, american exceptionalism, etc, etc. Anything that is detailed and invites doubt is rejected. Perhaps they are aiming for the Jungian judgemental/extravert/thinking demographic? I hadn't considered that it might also be informed by an active satanist message, although I'm guessing satanists don't tend to be terribly nuanced people either, so it wouldn't be incompatible! Also republican political consultants would probably throw anything into the mix that worked - Good, evil, whatever. I don't exactly know where this places political consultants on the ethical spectrum, but probably not in a good place.<br><br><a href=#c8156885399226472705 title="comment permalink">12/26/13, 9:42 AM</a><br><br>

In a way, industrial American society, and its extension around the world, is about taking all the sins and trying to make them "good." <br><br>To put it in metaphorical terms, and at the risk of taking satire too seriously, since we're in the Faustian age, the whole culture is basically in a contract with the devil who provides us with the black semen of the earth, and is about to call in that debt.<br><br>In terms of the intellectual consistency of the Republican party: JMG, you've done well I think to show that "rationality" is really not all that often very operative. At the root of the relation of the Republican party to essentially (if not intentionally) Satanic "ideology" is their traditional association with "big business and banks", the party's opposition to the New Deal, and then importantly, during the efforts of the 60's to extend the New Deal to blacks and women, as well as the important Roe v Wade decision.<br><br>So I don't think it is entirely correct to pin the Satanism on the Republicans, even though that is the result of their governmental policy. To give the party of the Beast a fairer shake, you might say, they just don't want the government to do the giving...<br><br>But I'm a little surprised you would step into the rather polluted waters of partisan politics in America at present: there is so much binary thinking here, and so many emotions, that by and large it's difficult to get any real thinking done here. It's like a salted and razed field, national politics.<br><br>Incidentally, this commentary hits home, as my father - a Vietnam veteran who was raised in a military family that was moved all over the world and that essentially imitated warfare in their family life - is ironically also a Randian, who tried and continues to try to convince me that Rand's is the only correct belief system.<br><br><a href=#c2412902545706200894 title="comment permalink">12/26/13, 9:48 AM</a><br><br>

The true identity of Redbeard has been a subject of speculation, but since it was public domain, LaVey just stole it and published it as "The Satanic Bible."

The wealthy plutocrats of the U.S. were alarmed that their power was being threatened by thirty years of declining income inequality, business regulations, and progressive legislation (e.g. environmental regulations). They saw the Christian Right as a bottomless pool of "useful idiots" for their goal of untaxing themselves, rolling back regulations and eliminating the New Deal. They very intentionally wooed these people to become the shock troops for their movement, seducing them to vote against their economic well-being with "social issues" that the wealthy themselves cared little to nothing about (the rich can purchase whatever social arrangements they need, after all). In my experience (and I've had a lot, trust me) the key attribute of fundamentalists is authoritarianism, that is, the unquestioned belief in a leader (they are not called a flock for nothing).

The vocals in this genre, at least these days, can almost be considered part of the rhythm section, as they're mainly aggressive growls and screams; but I'm drawn to it because of the complex, high tempo guitar melodies.

Permit me to point out that Goethe's Mephisto owes his role - particularly in Faust II - to his creator's day job as a minister of finance in Weimar. Goethe knew his Adam Smith. Incidentally, this is the first time I've come across the phrase "Weimar America". Odd phrase. To German speakers, Weimar has far more associations than the Weimarer Republik. Such as the Weimarer Klassik which we all learn about in high school. Arguably the age of the best Dichter und Denker the Germans were so proud of. I'm not German, but I love Goethe every bit as much as Shakespeare, and I would recommend Faust to anyone at all interested in what you're writing about.

The heroes are vampires not the bad guys. Probably why Dracula was written when it was, during the heyday of the gilded age in the West. One had to, as today, get the feel of control over one's own life as fairness was not accceptable under conditions of extreme social turbulence due to technological change (as today with computers and growth in Asian markets ,etc.)<br><br>I suspect it is easier if you believe you belong to a relgious or social (like a nation) group to sanction almost any otherwise amoral behaviour if the group condones it(like mass murder of civilians by bombing or almost anything). What is really hard I would presume is to do really evil things oneself. Here are hard human limits. One can be cynical generally but lying and stealing and deception take social learning and torture and killing are only done under specific conditions in military or mafia or independent psychopathic behaviour. I am reading a Khruschev biography and all the top leader's post-stalin feared Beria, the NKVD chief, even Stalin feared him, so they had him executed. The other guys who lost the fight for power just got bad jobs in Mongolia, or internal exile. Beria was shot by a 3 star general. He was considered evil because he could kill and torture and rape with his own hands, not just as a normal soldier in battle would kill, en passant, but with pleasure. So horror films have their place in society, trying to understand evil in oneself and others, to get past a middling Walter Mittyism in life. <br><br>If Ayn Rand, and most modern Americans and others, have problem accepting the reality of Buddha or Jesus as possibilities, as an ideological and an emotional role model due to pure modern cynicism and have gone over to "social darwinism" to save their own skins then I cannot blame them all too much for being realists in everyday life. As they say " a sucker is born every minute" and we have to be careful. Opening our heart to every stranger makes us prey to advertising and salespeople which floods every minute of our lives where we shop or observe media channels. However this has been turned into an aggressive winner gets all mentality where the rules are being constantly changed against the weaker parties due to technological change (e.g. identity theft on internet, NSA spying of every word we write, etc.) so one might want to be on the side of the strong and that is the people with money and power. The king was anointed by God and his rules in our case is "free market rules". A strong alternative social conscience party would be good with workable minimum wages where people don't have to go on welfare plus food banks to get by while working full time or find some scam to get money to survive. Essentially the rule of the jungle is getting to be the norm and that was clearly not satanic but kill or be killed. Watch nature programs. Humans are predators not grazing animals. Christianity propagates "the lion lies down with the lamb" and that is not biologically correct.AS Peak oil proceedds apace and population increases along with consumerism as God in China and elsewhere then less and less per person will make "Greed is good" and "do unto others, then split" remarkably workable creeds. <br><br>A Christmas Carol was written at about the worst ofpossible soicial times in British history as a social commentary on exactly this theme. But all this is cyclical, perhaps times will get better again due to anti greed backlash.

It was not always the case. In fact Rand did not see eye to eye with the Libertarian Party on many issues. <br><br>Back in the 70s the libertarians seemed to care about more issues than just the unfettered right to make and keep money. They opposed regulation of private sexuality, such as laws against prostitution, homosexuality, etc. They also opposed the drug laws and other victimless crimes. These positions may still be in the platform, but they receive little promotion. <br><br>One of the attractions of the philosophy, for me, was a professed belief in the ordinary citizen's ability to find solutions to problems rather than having to wait for experts. The idea was that privately run charity, for instance, would be more effective than government aid because the private sector has limited funds and would be motivated to do things that would move people away from dependency, such as training, creating jobs, food coops, etc., while the government official is rewarded for adding clients and keeping them.<br><br>Any situation in which the particulars of a local situation is overruled by regulations created by a far off bureaucracy is grist for the mill of this type of libertarian. An example local to me is the ongoing struggle of California environmentalists to protect the remaining riparian forest from the Army Corp of Engineers rule that levees must be kept clear of trees. It might be a good regulation in some areas, but here it would destroy habitat for many endangered species without materially improving flood safety. Stupidity such as requiring a wheelchair accessible bathroom at the top of mountain is more of this sort of ammunition in the "govt. is stupid" meme.<br> <br>A major problem I saw with the libertarian concern for property rights was a lack of examination of how those rights came into being. At point do you choose the status quo that must be defended? Conveniently, it always seems to be the point at which one's own class got possession. The govt. shouldn't take my land for a park--never mind that whoever I got it from benefited from the govt. killing the Native Americans who controlled it earlier. <br><br>Eventually, it seemed that "the free market will find a solution" became an article of faith rather than an argument. The question of how a particular problem would be solved by the free market was never answered. We can't know until it happens because govt. action distorts everything now. Very like "real communism" can't be compared to what actually happened in soviet nations because their situation was distorted by the opposition of the capitalists. Maybe in the world of Platonic ideals the ideal libertarian man and the ideal communist man dwell in peace. ;)<br><br><a href=#c5996714886489939919 title="comment permalink">12/27/13, 11:03 AM</a><br><br>

Liberalism believes above all in the power of reason; Burke believes in tradition, habit and "prejudice". Liberalism stresses universal principles; Burke stresses fact and circumstance.

I read with appalled interest of her admiration of William Hickman (following your link to Michael Prescott’s blog), which rounds out my opinion of her considerably. <br>However, the author of this analysis seems to make a very routine and uncritical link between Rand and Nietzsche, apparently assuming that anyone espousing the latter’s ideas would necessarily come to sociopathic conclusions. What I have learned of Nietzsche, in great part from this blog of yours, is that the man deserves much more credit than that, and efforts to distance him from the likes of Rand are of the imperative.

Certainly both parties are progressive-utopianists today in their core tenets, but so corrupt that they do very little to enact them. The hypocrisy of the GOP is certainly more glaring and gratin, in terms of their claims to be Christians.<br><br>But I do think it's important to note a few particulars here, particularly in regards to applying Christ's teachings. Obviously various sects have their own views on what Christ meant and the rest, but you haven't here made the distinction between individual and state duties. In many places Christ says I must care for the poor. Nowhere in the Bible do I see it say that the state must do so.<br><br>If the state is viewed as an instrument of violence (a view which GK Chesterton, among others, eloquently defended), then its powers should only be enacted where violence/coercion are justified. Violence is justified to prevent men from stealing from each other or murdering each other, etc. Is it justified to make others be charitable? I'd think not.<br><br>The problem is, essentially, that statism has rendered almost all other institutions impotent. Caring for the poor was once a monumental undertaking by the Church, and one of its essential functions; now it is done by the state. <i>This</i> is the reason that most churches say little to nothing about caring for the poor, and seem rather unconcerned with it - in the US, most poor people with a little savvy and a few forms can have their every need taken care of. Why should they give money to the church to help poor people? They already did that. They paid their taxes. It's a somewhat inaccurate generalization, but it's certainly the perception.<br><br>We can all agree, at least, that the state has bitten off far, far more than it can chew based upon the presumption of infinite future growth, and so its myriad entitlement programs simply aren't going to work. Cuts or (much more likely) inflation will whittle them down to nothing, regardless of what's fair or unfair. Meanwhile the crony capitalists will make off like bandits if they run soon enough (if not, they'll be hanging from lamp posts instead). They won't get footed with the bill. The entitlement state (and the poor) will bear the entire cost.<br><br>Herein, I think, lies true conservatism, and the people with which you can make a common cause. The state today is a behemoth that has corrupted all it has touched. It gutted the Left of any actual ambition for change; it gutted the right of any actual Christian sentiment. It turned the churches hostile to the poor, the Marxists into Obamas, the Moderates into the Apathetics and the thinkers into radicals.<br><br>So what happens? Does the state shrivel up and die through catabolic collapse? If so, then this post is rather short-sighted I think, because the dissonance of the modern GOP will sort itself out. The satanic will show their true colors and run while the Christians will have to get back to the jobs they're meant to do. It won't be easy to blame the poor for their lot when "the poor" is 95% of us.<br><br><a href=#c3226843104932543260 title="comment permalink">12/28/13, 1:01 AM</a><br><br>

A. Rand is an interesting thinker who clearly saw some things, but just as clearly (one can see) that her metaphysics are anything but conservative OR traditional. What has happened (and there is no doubt that there is a counter-illumination group dabbling in this, since Ideas aren't neutral and don't just "happen") is that the brand name of both liberal and conservative have been perverted and co-opted for certain ends. In a real sense, it wouldn't have mattered who won the election - both candidates are vetted (which is why Huckabee was squelched and why Ron Paul was sidelined). Have you seen the study that demonstrated that on average, conspiracy theorists are more objective and do a better job at assimilating data, psychologically, than "normal" people? Personally, I also believe that there are extra-human entities that influence group thinking, but some of our leadership likes to consciously cooperate with them. Some readers may be interested in Elder Thaddeus' work called Our Thoughts Determine Our Lives, he has some teaching on the reality of mental abstractions, as well as the origin of some of them. I am not sure how to phrase that in a rhetorically acceptable manner, but perhaps we could just say that group Minds exist outside human beings, and are capable of amplifying things, much like Hegel's Zeitgeist. Sort of a Freudian sub-conscious that masquerades as Jungian "archetype".<br><br><a href=#c749691306769033796 title="comment permalink">12/28/13, 1:20 AM</a><br><br>

I agree with the general sentiment of what you write but am wondering whether the “assurances from friends of mine in several different denominations that the words of Jesus quoted in the four gospels of the New Testament are definitive guides to faith and morals” really amounts to much.<br><br>In his book “Who Wrote the New Testament?”, Burton L. Mack states:<br><br>“Scholars locate the various writings of the New Testament at different times and places over a period of one hundred years, from the letters of Paul in the 50s of the first century, through the writing of the gospels of Mark and Matthew in the 70s and 80s, the gospels of John and Luke around the turn of the second century, and on to the acts, letters, and other writings during the first half of the second century, some as late as 140 to 150 C.E. “<br><br>“Over the course of the second and third centuries, centrist Christians were able to create the impression of a singular, monolinear history of the Christian church. They did so by carefully selecting, collecting, and arranging anonymous and pseudonymous writings assigned to figures at the beginning of the Christian time. As they imagined it, this history was foretold by the prophets of the Old Testament, inaugurated by Jesus and his sacrifice for the sins of the world, established by the apostles in their missions, and confirmed by the bishops in their loyalty to the teachings of that illustrious tradition. “<br><br>“Because all the New Testament writings were now regarded as written by apostles and their associates, the differences among their views of Christian beginnings were effectively erased. “<br><br>It seems that the personality and teachings of Jesus are kind of unreliable, even fictional, and to quote his “words” in support of a particular guide to faith and morals is not a great idea.<br><br><br><a href=#c6100172893096935055 title="comment permalink">12/28/13, 2:31 AM</a><br><br>

You covered the reasons for the restricted ability to act in last year's posts. Mr. Obama is a prisoner in most senses of the term: he is for all practical purposes locked in a jail due to the extreme security measures required to keep him safe from potential harm.

The existence of biological drives doesn't equal the omnipotence of those drives, and history's crammed to the bursting point with examples not merely of individuals but of communities and whole nations doing the right thing rather than the pleasant one. <br><br>DaShui, sure, but look what happened to Faust. The Devil is not exactly known for being merciful to his dupes...<br><br>Alan, of course human beings have mixed motivations. The question is one of what they actually do. When the Sierra Club shills for corporate interests, as it so often does, "mixed motives" doesn't cover it; I tend to prefer the term "hypocrisy." <br><br>Avery, as far as I can see, neither the GOP nor its opponents have offered more than token resistance to what we could call Satanism. You'll notice that I spared some room, in a satire mostly making fun of the GOP, to point out that the Democrats have no cause to preen themselves either!<br><br>Shtove, thank you. <br><br>Kyoto, Nietzsche's a very mixed bag. It's unfair to equate him with Rand, if only because he was a competent thinker and writer and she was neither; still, there's plenty in Nietzsche (especially when he's raging against the Christianity of his childhood) that could be used to justify a might-makes-right attitude. What doesn't make it into Rand at all is Nietzsche's insistence that the essence of the path to the Overman is self-overcoming; the ego isn't to be glorified, it's to be overcome, and what rises in its place is to be overcome in its turn, and so on forever. That's got flaws of its own, but it's not a Randian doctrine of selfishness as virtue.<br><br><a href=#c4404735622354070025 title="comment permalink">12/28/13, 9:39 AM</a><br><br>

(By the way, you might want to make the acquaintance of some poor people, and find out just how difficult it is to make ends meet in the US, even with what's left of the welfare state; having been very poor myself, I can tell you that it's nothing like as easy as you've made it sound.)<br><br>Matthew, I'd encourage you to reflect on the possibility that the statement "Ideas are not neutral, and don't just 'happen'" can be true without justifying conspiracy theories freighted with a strident moral dualism that would make a third-century Gnostic blush.

This gives 'conservative' 'Christians' a lot of wiggle-room---my argument to them would be that you should want the State to do it if it appears to be necessary to it having been done, and that in fact paying your taxers for the State to assure that people don't starve shows greater humility than getting the feeling of superiority or of false (in Christian terms) goodness people can feel when giving to charity.

If someone has a small piece of land, or even a small apartment, that is owned free and clear, and (this is the important point) is not ALLOWED to be sold (at least permanently), then they always have a little castle or garrison, to fall back on. Hence the laws in the Old Testament about land reversion. The enclosure movement in England (as JMG points out) was crucial to the Industrial Revolution. It wasn't the factory work, per se, that was inherently evil (although it was certainly for the most part degrading), but the fact that these people literally had no choice at all. The same thing applies to most poor people today: between property taxes, rezoning, condemnation, etc., not to mention the destruction of small communities and neighborhoods for the sake of business or progress (which occurred after WWII to make way for Interstates), they have no social fabric or safety networks left. I think the best thing that many of your readership could do for the Church (which will survive in some form or other) would be help propagate some of the Belloc-Chesterton ideas on private property being more important for poor people than rich people. In ancient Rome, you could own property, but had no monopoly absolute on the produce of the land. In other societies, you couldn't own the property, but you could own the produce. The Middle Ages was an interesting amalgam of both. Only in our wonderful modern world (which does have many blessings) are we increasingly not allowed to have either.<br><br><a href=#c4194889537149693450 title="comment permalink">12/28/13, 8:38 PM</a><br><br>

That's what I was talking about, you know. <br><br>Matthew (as Esther), I think you've misunderstood me. I'm not arguing against the idea that there are deeper, transhuman forces at work in situations like this one; I'm arguing against the idea that the complexity of the transcendent realm can be flattened out into a simplistic dualism of tradition vs. counter-tradition, initiation vs. counter-initiation. Go back and read the <i>Iliad</i> sometime, or for that matter the <i>Mahabharata</i>; the older vision makes it clear that there are a great diversity of equally valid, equally transcendent spiritual principles, the human representatives and vehicles of which can and do come into mortal conflict. When Arjuna faces the Kaurava army at Kurukshetra, a core lesson he learns from Krishna is that having to fight does not mean having to hate; it's a lesson I don't think Guenon, Evola et al. ever learned. All sides in the present situation -- and there are a good many more than two of them -- have their own proper role, their dharma if you will, in the struggles ahead; each has a necessary and positive part to play in the natural process by which civilizations are born, rise, fall, die, and leave their legacies for the future.

Sex is special amongst the seven, because the other six are sins of excess of necessity, not merely commission. Sex, Bill Clinton notwithstanding, is easy to define and no one really needs sex to survive. Food, shelter, warmth... those are necessary and there is also a very strong proscription against giving them up., but the others are excesses of activities we do to survive and therefore subject to redefinition.<br>Greed is moving from needs to wants to wanting more, but even King Lear observed 'even our basest beggars are in the meanest things superfluous.' At what point does need become want become excess? People can survive, albeit miserably, on the cold stone floor of a hovel. Everything else then becomes a desire for comfort and yet charity is about providing those very comforts to those who lack them.<br>Sloth? Does feeling exhausted and treating yourself to an occasional sleep-in count? Illness? Does one never get to sit down when tired, or must one always work till you drop? At what point does relaxing in the chair become indolence?<br>Gluttony? Does having a full meal count? Two? How many? My full breakfast might count as gluttony to a monk, but it's just fuel for the start of my day.<br>Wrath? Anger and fear keeps us alive when our lives are threatened and gives us the power to fight to survive. As a martial artist you know well how much training is required to cease fighting at the appropriate moment, but even so, it's quite a shock to find out just how much damage one can deal out in an unbelievably short time, without even realizing it, when faced with dire need. You did an excellent post discussing the idea of appropriate deterrence.<br>&amp;c.<br>It's taken, what? Almost two hundred years of concerted effort by economic theorists, tame intellectuals, and industrialists eager to push product to redefine the other six into inversion and make them so officially acceptable to the populace that they are policy of the politicos. The de Medicis did a lot of the ground-work in the 1500s by getting the Church to accept wealth and luxury so they could build their palaces. The sumptuous Vatican was not built on goodwill and prayers and, even earlier, the vikings didn't drop in on Lindisfarne because they were jealous of their piety or to admire their skill with pens. But despite Cardinals having mistresses and bastard children, they never <i>openly</i> repudiated sex-as-sin-and-source-of-shame.<br>Freud only came along a hundred years ago to give people full permission to be sexual, and remember that the churches -- as liberal as they ever were -- never embraced the "sexual revolution" of the 1960s. So that last sin may never be overturned.<br><br><a href=#c2845686050869755405 title="comment permalink">12/29/13, 9:06 AM</a><br><br>

It is not that the membership of the christian right engage in all of the seven deadly sins, even rampantly. Humans do this. All humans. Democrats and Republicans. Medieval monasteries were probably rife with all of them. The point is that those medieval monks considered them to be BAD, and believed that they were failings, weaknesses, and they needed to be penitent and regretful of having committed them. Whereas the christian right in present day America glorifies them, redefines them as virtues, and openly encourages people to practice them. That is at the very heart of your post here, and missing that distinction might lead to missing the whole point. When one of these Randians or the pastor of a megachurch announces the opening of a brothel, calls himself a job creator, and declares it is a great way for women to lift themselves out of poverty and to generate cash to promote god's work, then you can count them as promoting all seven of the deadly sins, not just six!

I've voted for a lot of Democratic politicians since the 1968 Democratic convention, but I've never registered as a Democrat.<br><br>One may fairly call a person a hypocrite for saying one thing and doing another. I don't think it's fair to call someone a hypocrite for claiming to be a Christian while living in a way that Jesus condemned or for showing no care for the poor. There's more to Christianity than doing what Jesus says. This is probably true to a degree for any religion with an identifiable founder, but particularly true of Christianity, because Jesus's project does not seem to have been intended to guide any kind of normal society.<br><br>Christianity has always had a radical problem. If one takes Jesus's recorded words literally and as a whole, it is impossible to do everything he says while raising a family and providing for them decently. How could one follow to the letter the sayings about giving no thought for the morrow, letting the dead bury the dead, leaving one's parents and selling all one's possessions and distributing the proceeds to the poor, without becoming entirely destitute and cut off from help? Once the charismatic leader is gone, such a course is not viable without some social support. <br><br>One may of course interpret these injunctions figuratively, and many do. Taken literally, they could work if the followers of Jesus were a small minority whose holy poverty is supported from the surplus produced by people participating in the normal economy. Or if the end times are so near that farmers can leave the crops standing in the fields and not worry that their children will starve, because the Messiah will provide.<br><br>Neither of those things happened, so Paul and the other Christian leaders had to make adjustments to what Christianity would expect of ordinary people. In doing so, they necessarily departed from Jesus's teachings and his example.<br><br>This problem doesn't exist in the early version of Torah Judaism, that Jesus was brought up in.<br>Torah Judaism has undergone major developments since Jesus's death, but one thing that hasn't changed is a basic viewpoint that living as God wishes is usually completely compatible with working for a living, raising a family, acquiring some property, participating in society, and obeying its laws. Normative Judaism has no monastic tradition. Two of the Ten Commandments concern property rights, one concerns court testimony and one commands people to honor their parents. The poor, resident aliens, farm animals and other groups with little power have legal rights and a moral right to decent treatment, but an end to class differences is not to be expected until the end of days and there is no suggestion that possession of wealth is inherently distancing from God. <br><br>This sort of religious viewpoint becomes less appealing in times when social solidarity breaks down; it wasn't adequate for Jesus and some of his contemporaries.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c4416505934127722822 title="comment permalink">12/29/13, 5:27 PM</a><br><br>

For the sake of brevity, though my thoughts on it are not so clear, I'll just begin.<br><br>First, the accounts of our civilization and virtually all those major ones of which I am aware, depict a very hierarchical organization. The pyramid on the dollar bill is perhaps an apt symbol. Perhaps it is in the nature of language that societies will become hierarchical: language helps form thought, thought in turn reality - or at least what we will see of it; and those who dispense and teach the language therefore have a founding role in societies. <br><br>Interestingly, those at the top of the hierarchy in America at this late stage- at least the legislative component of the hierarchy - the Democrats and Republicans, are, aside from rhetoric virtually indistinguishable when it comes to actions, or the policies they set. Mostly this is probably because at this late stage, democratic politics serves as theatrics to keep the masses obedient and in line. But the two ostensibly warring camps, the reds and the blues (even though their policies in reality hardly differ), focus everyone's political energy into that conflict. This, I think, does function as an effective means of maintaining the hierarchy and the whole system that supports those at the top.<br><br>In this regard, it should be worth noting that the virtues and vices of the vast majority of people are nothing like the virtues and vices of those at the top of the pyramid. At the top, the virtues are more Machiavellian: ruthlessness, cunning, tirelessness, lack of sympathy or empathy - what psychology would dub "sociopathic" behaviors, are all that's necessary, and rewarded. In turn, to some extent, those at the top rely on the maintenance of the common virtues among the common people.<br><br>With industrial society, a lot of that changes because the virtues necessary to maintain social order and lift the kings, pharaohs, robber barons, CEO's to the top of the pyramid, at least for a time, seem less necessary: we can all live like kings (as long as we're Americans) - if, in short, we are ruthless and cunning enough to make that happen. The need for cooperation, or for the maintenance of good personal habits, becomes less needful when the pressurized fossil remains of millions of years of life are doing all the providing for our basic needs, and our extravagant wants.<br><br>Whether that sheds much light on what to do about it, I am doubtful.<br><br><a href=#c7853017278479248610 title="comment permalink">12/30/13, 4:47 PM</a><br><br>

According to Wikipedia's article on the Roman Empire, the empire taxed its subjects at between 2 and 5%, with the proceeds primarily supporting the military. Public works were supported by wealthy patrons. In modern Western countries, support for the poor, orphan, ill, and elderly has become an additional function of government, and is a large fraction of government spending. Though Jesus instructed us to share our wealth with the less fortunate, he didn't tell us to rise up against the wealthy and sieze their goods to be shared. (Democratic decision-making doesn't seem to factor in at all, which makes sense in a backwater province of the Empire.)<br><br>Nietzsche wrote (Geneology of Morals) that Judeo-Christianity is inspired by the experience of slaves. It makes sense to me, not so much as a moral ideal, but as useful advice on how to stay alive and in community without attracting the interference of the masters, while patiently waiting for the masters' civilization to collapse.

And it's useful to "cut with the grain", so to speak; that is, in the West, since Christianity is the "vehicle" Providentially, it might be easier to "work" with it as opposed to digging in foreign fields. Of course I agree that American Christianity is far, far removed from its historical roots.

As for Evola, I'm not a fan at all, and not just because of Evola's little stiff-arm problem; his entire "traditional" ideology was a pastiche of the pop culture of his time -- take one part mostly misunderstood Nietzsche, one part JJ Bachofen, one part Otto Weininger, and one part watered-down thirdhand Theosophy, and you've got Evola in a nutshell. I'm far from sympathetic with the lot of them, but at least Guenon had something moderately original to say now and then. <br><br>Jennifer, good for you. <br><br>Chris, one of the complexities here is that "virtues" have been defined in modern times almost entirely in terms of the passive, "soft" virtues -- what Nietzsche, in his usual in-your-face manner, called the slave virtues. Go back half a dozen centuries or more, and "hard" virtues such as courage and self-mastery played a much larger role in moral thought and practice. The popularization of the soft virtues and the restriction of the hard virtues to narrow specializations (soldiers, gladiators, rulers) is a standard feature of late civilizations, and gets reversed in a hurry in the hard years that follow their decline and fall.<br><br><a href=#c4692310568033590270 title="comment permalink">12/30/13, 8:31 PM</a><br><br>

Yet Presidential power is more restricted than we like to acknowledge in our country, where we are so fully invested in the cult of individuality. We often praise or blame the President for actions over which he has relatively little power.<br><br>That said, again, it does matter who you vote for. Here is just one example:<br><br>If you believe that global population is an issue to be addressed (there are those who don't)consider the trails of the United Nations Population Fund. Under Reagan, NGOs could not receive funding if they even mentioned abortion to women (even if the money were not used for that); Clinton rescinded the policy, it was reinstated by Bush II, and rescinded again by Obama. Bush II actually pulled all funding from UNFPA; Obama reinstated $50 million, though Congress keeps cutting that amount.<br><br>This is just one small example of how national politicians are NOT all the same; an important example if you believe that population (along with its fraternal twin, consumption) is a major problem for our planet as a whole. That our current President seems unconcerned with addressing the issue of consumption should not detract from his support of addressing at least half of the issue. I agree with Voltaire's warning that the perfect can become the enemy of the good.<br><br>Trish<br>(Hmm, when I hit publish, blogger seems to want me to try again.

Oh, and if you're interested in seeing what a paid shill's post looks like, pay close attention to the comment by "Calm Center of Tranquility" below; it's a good example of the type. <br><br>Sunseeker, I'd encourage you to start with Gregory Shaw's <i>Theurgy and the Soul</i> -- the best modern interpreter of Iamblichus -- and follow that up with Iamblichus' <i>On the Mysteries</i>. <br><br>Center, a nicely deployed set of talking points; please tell whoever's paying you to post this that you deserve a raise. Still, it won't wash. Of course you can cherrypick Obama's record to find a few ways in which his policies differ from those of his feckless predecessor, but it would be just as easy to go over his record and find ways in which he's exceeded Dubya's score in following the GOP playbook -- for example, his administration has been far more lavish in the use of drones to commit war crimes overseas, the violations of civil liberties committed under his watch are by many measures worse, and the amount of money he's sluiced into the pockets of the financial industry is much greater. <br><br>More generally, people are starting to notice that the only thing the Democrats have to say these days is "But the scary Republicans would be even worse!" -- and then, when they get into office, they do their level best to copy the scary Republicans. It's not a strategy with an indefinite shelf life, and hiring shills to debate the issue online is not going to extend that indefinitely. <br><br>Joseph, granted, it might be satire.

Oh, they do if it's a very, very small company and the organization is flat, but as soon as it gets even a little large, it breaks into "departments" -- I call them satrapies -- headed by people with much more actual power over that department than the CEO has. And they rule over local governors who have still more power over what actually happens in the company. When you get to a large corporation, the CEO has very little power at all, other than the power of persuasion over his/her various satraps.<br><br>The exception to this is the power to break an organization. Any fool in a position of power can do that, given enough time. Carly Fiorina (former CEO of HP) comes to mind as a classic example.<br><br>So I wonder how much credit or blame any President actually deserves.<br><br>Bush gets all the credit/blame for the Cheney administration.<br><br>The Cheney administration was as effective as it was at driving us into a ditch because it started a Neocon loyalty purge throughout the bureaucracy. I remember reading about it as early as 2002. It hit the media circus fan in 2006 with the DOJ scandal, but by then, the work was done.<br><br>Obama inherited a Neocon bureaucracy, filled with Neocon satraps, Neocon governors, and Neocon employees. Satraps of the NSA have been revealed as lying outright to Congress -- there's no reason to believe they were any more truthful with the President. So his choice after the fact is to pretend he knew about it and approved, or complain that he didn't: to be roasted as a DINO, or roasted as an incompetent who doesn't know what his own spymasters are up to. The third route, of vowing to "break the NSA into a thousand little pieces" to misquote a certain late President, has consequences, too.<br><br>To be clear: I'm not defending Obama, nor claiming he isn't entirely fungible.<br><br>But I'm curious if the office even needs to be occupied at all.

I also appreciate your further analysis.<br><br>If you could perhaps indulge me in a little critique on the matter (shills) at hand? It is a little bit off topic (sorry).<br><br>I've been wondering whether the shills are following some sort of template for introducing discussion points. This would be an inevitable outcome as they by necessity have to avoid a narrative. My thinking on this is that the current narrative is unexplainable in their terms, so they stick to discussion points.<br><br>My gut feel says that somehow the people involved have honed their skills in the debating world. The comment smells to me of that world which follows its own unique law of etiquette.<br><br>It was also interesting that the commenter began the comment with flattery as I've seen this same technique on the permaculture news website.<br><br>The next paragraphs follow a standard argumentative essay format with a super nifty conclusion. Nice work.<br><br>It sort of tells a story in and of itself about the exclusivity and education of the background of the person making the comment. Their repetition and lack of creativity may eventually put themselves out of a job?<br><br>I'm mildly embarrassed to admit that I've tuned out to domestic politics here because somehow the discussions between politicians became a point scoring exercise. I find it to be disturbing to watch and listen too. Binary thinking has led them down the path of the boxing ring where they believe there may be only one winner. In fact, they may be quite surprised one day to find that there are two losers in that boxing ring (or possibly three in Australia if you throw in the Greens).<br><br>They fail abysmally to tell a coherent narrative and it will be their undoing.<br><br>I'll tell you a funny story. A long time ago, a mate of mine worked for a company. I get what my mate did for a living. The thing I didn’t understand was how that company itself made money. It is not like I didn't asked him to explain it all on several occasions either! It was just weird.<br><br>This is basically what politicians fail to understand. If the processes become so esoteric that the majority of people fail to understand it, then come any crunch, they will simply discard those politicians for the next straight talking person, despite the message. Dunno, but I hope I'm wrong. It is just a gut feeling kind of thing.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c7058249969251559930 title="comment permalink">1/1/14, 12:29 AM</a><br><br>

I believe the oath taken by naturalized citizens is also to the Constitution. To the Constitution, and only the Constitution, not the flag, the President, the Homeland, the God in whom we claim to trust or anything else.<br><br>In this sense, the Constitution _is_ the United States. Other symbols of our country are venerated by this person or that group, but I believe the Constitution is the most widely venerated. It's older than most of our national symbols and it is more than an emblem or an idea; it's active and working. <br><br>It's capitalized, not a constitution or our constitution but the Constitution. It's venerated by people who I suspect have not read it (although it's short and a good deal more readable than the constitutions of some countries). Americans of most political viewpoints venerate the Constitution, even if they don't agree on what it means.<br><br>A country like Britain can get along with an unwritten constitution, but the United States of America cannot, because the United States is an artificial construction.<br><br>The Constitution is by design difficult to amend. Some major changes in our system of government can be made without amending it (for example, Congress's surrender of the power to make war), but the changes required to turn the U.S. into a parliamentary system would require a constitutional convention writing an entirely new one or a tyrant imposing one. I believe only catastrophe or assimilation into some larger political unit would bring that about.<br><br><br><a href=#c60260395290039955 title="comment permalink">1/1/14, 7:04 PM</a><br><br>
