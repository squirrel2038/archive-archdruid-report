Man, the conqueror of Nature, died Monday night of a petroleum overdose, the medical examiner’s office confirmed this morning. The abstract representation of the human race was 408 years old. The official announcement has done nothing to quell the rumors of suicide and substance abuse that have swirled around the death scene since the first announcement yesterday morning, adding new legal wrinkles to the struggle already under way over Man’s inheritance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Man’s closest associates disagree about what happened. His longtime friend and confidant Technology thinks it was suicide. “Sure, Man liked to have a good time,” he said at a press conference Tuesday evening, “and he was a pretty heavy user, but it wasn’t like he was out of control or anything. No, I’m sure he did it on purpose. Just a couple of weeks ago we were hanging out at his place, looking up at the moon and talking about the trips we made out there, and he turned to me and said, ‘You know, Tech, that was a good time—a really good time. I wonder if I’ll ever do anything like that again.’ He got into moods like that more and more often in the last few years. I tried to cheer him up, talking about going to Mars or what have you, and he’d go along with it but you could tell his heart wasn’t in it.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Other witnesses told a different story. “It was terrifying,” said a housekeeper who requested that her name not be given. “He was using more and more of the stuff every day, shooting it up morning, noon and night, and when his connections couldn’t get him as much as he wanted, he’d go nuts. You’d hear him screaming at the top of his lungs and pounding his fists on the walls. Everybody on the staff would hide whenever that happened, and it happened more and more often—the amount he was using was just unbelievable. Some of his friends tried to talk him into getting help, or even just cutting back a little on his petroleum habit, but he wouldn’t listen.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The medical examiner’s office and the police are investigating Man’s death right now. Until their report comes out, the tragic end of humanity’s late self-image remains shrouded in mystery and speculation. </div>
<h4 class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<b>A Tumultuous Family Saga</b></h4>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“He was always a rebel,” said Clio, the muse of history, in an exclusive interview in her office on Parnassus this morning. “That was partly his early environment, of course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>He was born in the household of Sir Francis Bacon, remember, and brought up by some of the best minds of seventeenth-century Europe; an abstract image of humanity raised by people like that wasn’t likely to sit back and leave things as they were, you know. Still, I think there were strong family influences too. His father was quite the original figure himself, back in the day.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Though almost forgotten nowadays, Man’s father Everyman, the abstract representation of medieval humanity, was as mediagenic in his own time as his son became later on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The star of a wildly popular morality play and the subject of countless biographies, Everyman was born in extreme poverty in a hovel in post-Roman Europe, worked his way up to become a wealthy and influential figure in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, then stepped aside from his financial and political affairs to devote his last years to religious concerns. Savage quarrels between father and son kept the broadsheet and pamphlet press fed with juicy stories all through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and eventually led to their final breach over Darwin’s theory of evolution in 1859.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By that time Man was already having problems with substance abuse. “He was just using coal at first,” Technology reminisced. “Well, let’s be fair, we both were.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was the hot new drug in those days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was cheap, you could get it without too much hassle, and everybody on the cutting edge was using it. I remember one trip we took together—it was on one of the early railroads, at thirty miles an hour. We thought that was really fast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Were we innocent back then, or what?” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Clio agreed with that assessment. “I don’t think Man had any idea what he was getting into, when he started abusing coal,” she said. “It was an easy habit to fall into, very popular in avant-garde circles just then, and nobody yet knew much about the long term consequences of fossil fuel abuse. Then, of course, he started his campaign to conquer Nature, and he found out very quickly that he couldn’t keep up the pace he’d set for himself without artificial help. That was when the real tragedy began.” </div>
<h4 class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<b>The Conquest of Nature</b></h4>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s an open question when Man first decided to conquer Nature. “The biographers all have their own opinions on that,” Clio explained, gesturing at a shelf loaded with books on Man’s dramatic and controversial career.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Some trace it back to the influence of his foster-father Francis Bacon, or the other mentors and teachers he had in his early days. Others say that the inspiration came from the crowd he ran with when he was coming of age in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He used to tell interviewers that it was a family thing, that everyone in his family all the way back to the Stone Age had been trying to conquer Nature and he was just the one who finally succeeded, but that won’t stand up to any kind of scrutiny. Examine the career of Everyman, for example, and you’ll find that he wasn’t interested in conquering Nature; he wanted to conquer himself.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The business about conquering Nature?” Technology said. “He got into that back when we were running around being young and crazy. I think he got the idea originally from his foster-father or one of the other old guys who taught him when he was a kid, but as far as I know it wasn’t a big deal to him until later. Now I could be wrong, you know. I didn’t know him that well in those days; I was mostly just doing my thing then, digging mines, building water mills, stuff like that. We didn’t get really close until we both got involved in this complicated coal deal; we were both using, but I was dealing, too, and I could get it cheaper than anybody else—I was using steam, and none of the other dealers knew how to do that. So we got to be friends and we had some really wild times together, and now and then when we were good and ripped, he’d get to talking about how Nature ought to belong to him and one of these days he was going to hire some soldiers and just take it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Me, I couldn’t have cared less, except that Man kept on bringing me these great technical problems, really sweet little puzzles, and I’ve always been a sucker for those. He figured out how I was getting the coal for him so cheap, you see, and guessed that I could take those same tricks and use them for his war against Nature. For me, it was just a game, for Nature, against Nature, I couldn’t care less.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Just give me a problem and let me get to work on it, and I’m happy.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“But it wasn’t just a game for him. I think it was 1774 when he really put me to work on it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He’d hired some mercenaries by then, and was raising money and getting all kind of stuff ready for the war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He wanted steam engines so, like the man said, it was steam engine time—I got working on factories, railroads, steamships, all the rest. He already had some of his people crossing the border into Nature to seize bits of territory before then, but the eighteenth century, that’s when the invasion started for real. I used to stand next to him at the big rallies he liked to hold in those days, with all the soldiers standing in long lines, and he’d go into these wild rants about the glorious future we were going to see once Nature was conquered. The soldiers loved it; they’d cheer and grab their scientific instruments and lab coats and go conquer another province of Nature.” </div>
<h4 class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<b>The Triumphant Years</b></h4>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was in 1859, Technology recalled, that Man first started using petroleum. “He’d just had the big spat with his dad over this Darwin dude: the worst fight they ever had, and in fact Man never spoke to the old man again. Man was still steaming about the fight for days afterwards, and then we heard that this guy named Edwin Drake over in Pennsylvania could get you something that was an even bigger rush than coal. Of course Man had to have some, and I said to myself, hey, I’ll give it a try—and that was all she wrote, baby. Oh, we kept using coal, and a fair bit of it, but there’s nothing like petroleum. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“What’s more, Man figured out that that’s what he needed to finish his conquest of Nature. His mercs had a good chunk of Nature by then, but not all of it, not even half, and Man was having trouble holding some of the territory he’d taken—there were guerrillas behind his lines, that sort of thing. He’d pace around at headquarters, snapping at his staff, trying to figure out how to get the edge he needed to beat Nature once and for all. ‘I’ve gotta have it all, Tech,’ he’d say sometimes, when we were flopped on the couch in his private quarters with a couple of needles and a barrel of petroleum, getting really buzzed. ‘I’ve conquered distance, the land, the surface of the sea—it’s not enough. I want it <i>all</i>.’ And you know, he got pretty close.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Petroleum was the key, Clio explained. “It wasn’t just that Man used petroleum, all his soldiers and his support staff were using it too, and over the short term it’s an incredibly powerful drug; it gives users a rush of energy that has to be seen to be believed. Whole provinces of Nature that resisted every attack in the first part of the war were overrun once Man started shipping petroleum to his forces. By the 1950s, as a result, the conquest of Nature was all but complete. Nature still had a few divisions holed up in isolated corners where they couldn’t be gotten at by Man’s forces, and partisan units were all over the conquered zone, but those were minor irritations at that point. It was easy enough for Man and his followers to convince themselves that in a little while the last holdouts would be defeated and Nature would be conquered once and for all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“That’s when reality intervened, though, because all those years of abusing coal, petroleum, and other substances started to catch up with Man. He was in bad shape, and didn’t know it—and then he started having problems feeding his addiction.” </div>
<h4 class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<b>On and Off the Wagon</b></h4>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I forget exactly how it happened,” Technology recounted. “It was some kind of disagreement with his suppliers—he was getting a lot of his stuff from some Arab guys at that point, and he got into a fight with them over something, and they said, ‘Screw you, man, if you’re going to be like that we’re just not going to do business with you any more.’ So he tried to get the stuff from somebody else, and it turned out the guy from Pennsylvania was out of the business, and the connections he had in Texas and California couldn’t get enough. The Arab guys had a pretty fair corner on the market. So Man went into withdrawal, big time. We got him to the hospital, and the doctor took one look at him and said, ‘You gotta get into rehab, now.’ So me and some of his other friends talked him into it.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“The records of his stays in rehab are heartbreaking,” Clio said, pulling down a tell-all biography from her shelf. “He’d start getting the drug out of his system, convince himself that he was fine, check himself out, and start using again almost immediately. Then, after a little while, he’d have problems getting a fix, end up in withdrawal, and find his way back into rehab. Meanwhile the war against Nature was going badly as the other side learned how to fight back effectively. There were rumors of ceasefire negotiations, even a peace treaty between him and Nature.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“I went to see him in rehab one day,” said Technology. “He looked awful. He looked <i>old</i>—like his old man Everyman. He was depressed, too, talking all the time about this malaise thing. The thing is, I think if he’d stuck with it then he could have gotten off the stuff and straightened his life out. I really think he could have done it, and I tried to help. I brought him some solar panels, earth-sheltered housing, neat stuff like that, to try to get him interested in something besides the war on Nature and his petroleum habit. That seemed to cheer him up, and I think all his friends had high hopes for a while. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Then the next thing I heard, he was out of rehab. He just couldn’t hack it any longer. I went to his place, and there he was, laughing and slapping everybody’s back and full of big ideas and bigger plans, just like before. That’s what it looked like at first, but the magic was gone. He tried to do a comeback career, but he just couldn’t get it back together, and things went downhill from there.” </div>
<h4 class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<b>The Final Years</b></h4>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The last years of Man’s career as representation of the human race were troubled. “The war against Nature wasn’t going well by then,” Clio explained. “Man’s forces were holding onto the most important provinces and cities, but insurgencies were springing up all over—drug-resistant microbes here, herbicide-tolerant weeds there. Morale was faltering, and a growing fraction of Man’s forces in the struggle against Nature no longer believed in what they were doing. They were in it for the money, nothing more, and the money was running out. Between the costs of the war, the costs of Man’s lavish lifestyle, and the rising burden of his substance abuse problem, Man was in deep financial trouble; there’s reason to believe that he may have been engaged in outright fraud to pay his bills during the last few years of his life.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, Man was becoming increasingly isolated. “He’d turned his back on most of his friends,” said the anonymous housekeeper quoted earlier. “Art, Literature, Philosophy—he stopped talking to any of them, because they kept telling him to get off the stuff and straighten out his life. I remember the last time Science came to visit—she wanted to talk to Man about the state of the atmosphere, and Man literally threw her out of the house and slammed the door in her face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I was working downstairs in the laundry, where you usually can’t hear much, but I could hear Man screaming, ‘I own the atmosphere! I own the planet! I own the solar system! I own the goddam <i>stars</i>! They’re mine, mine,
<i>mine</i>—how dare you tell me what to do with my property?’ He went on like that for a while, then collapsed right there in the entry. A couple of us went up, carried him into his bedroom, and got him cleaned up and put to bed. We had to do that pretty often, the last year or so.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
His longtime friend Technology was apparently the last person to see Man alive. “I went over to his place Monday afternoon,” Technology recalled. “I went there pretty often, and we’d do some stuff and hang out, and I’d start rapping about all kinds of crazy stuff, omniscient supercomputers, immortal robot bodies, stuff like that. I told him, ‘Look, Man, if you want to get into stuff like omniscience and immortality, go talk to Religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s her bag, not mine.’ But he didn’t want to do that; he had some kind of falling out with her a while back, you know, and he wanted to hear it from me, so I talked it up. It got him to mellow out and unwind, and that’s what mattered to me.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Monday, though, we get to talking, and it turns out that the petroleum he had was from this really dirty underground source in North Dakota. I said to him, ‘Man, what the frack were you thinking?’ He just looked at me and said, ‘I’ve gotta have the stuff, Tech. I’ve gotta have the stuff.’ Then he started blubbering, and I reached out to, like, pat his shoulder—and he just blew up at me. He started yelling about how it was my fault he was hooked on petroleum, my fault the war against Nature wasn’t going well, my fault this and that and blah blah blah. Then he got up and stormed out of the room and slammed the door behind him. I should have gone after him, I know I should have, but instead I just shook my head and left. Maybe if I’d gone and tried to talk him down, he wouldn’t have done it.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Everything was quiet,” the housekeeper said. “Too quiet. Usually we’d hear Man walking around, or he’d put some music on or something, but Monday night, the place might as well have been empty. Around ten o’ clock, we were really starting to wonder if something was wrong, and two of us from the housekeeping staff decided that we really had to go check on Man and make sure he was all right. We found him in the bathroom, lying on the floor. It was horrible—the room stank of crude oil, and there was the needle and all his other gear scattered around him on the floor. We tried to find a pulse, but he was already cold and stiff; I went and called for an ambulance anyway, and—well, you know the rest.”</div>
<h4 class=MsoNormal style="text-align: left">
<b>The Troubled Aftermath</b></h4>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Man’s death leaves a great many questions unanswered. “By the time Everyman died,” Clio explained, “everyone knew who his heir would be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Man had already taken over his father’s role as humanity’s idealized self-image. That hasn’t happened this time, as you know. Man didn’t leave a will, and his estate is a mess—it may be years before the lawyers and the accountants finish going through his affairs and figure out whether there’s going to be anything at all for potential heirs to claim. Meanwhile there are at least half a dozen contenders for the role of abstract representation of the human race, and none of them is a clear favorite. It may be a long time before all the consequences are sorted out.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style='font-family: Times; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>Meanwhile, one of the most important voices in the debate has already registered an opinion. Following her invariable habit, Gaia refused to grant any personal interviews, but a written statement to the media was delivered by a spokesrabbit on Tuesday evening. “Please accept My sympathy for the tragic demise of Man, the would-be conqueror of Nature,” it read. “I hope it will not be out of place, though, to suggest that whomever My human children select as their new self-image might consider being a little less self-centered—not to mention a little less self-destructive.” </span></div>

If we have gotten ourselves into a situation where people who fetishize the so-called free market economy are saying that the only way to keep living the lives we have become accustomed to is to look towards the stars I think that is one indication of the magnitude of our predicament.<br><br>I wanted to ask you how do you account for people who claim to be Christian but also say that man’s destiny lies in colonizing other planets?

The environmental damage continues but without economic prosperity for most. Yet the people I deal with on a regular basis still seem to think we're just in some kind of business cycle lull. I'm guessing it will be with the younger generations that the death of this image of Man will really occur.

Although man was different than the other animals, he lived in balance with nature because he did not have the power to do anything else, just like all the other animals. To be sure, there has always been the occasional situation in which some animal has at least the power to overpopulate their area, or even destroy other species, but they are rare, and get corrected by nature's larger overall system, after which the little wound scabs over and is healed. When those situations arise, the animals, predictably, go for it. We cannot call them evil, because they were not capable of analyzing and seeing the bigger picture.<br><br>What if they could though? Suppose a fox could understand that by raiding the hen house repeatedly he is going to make the humans upset enough that they will make it a point to hunt him down and kill him? Suppose he could say to himself, no, I will just take a chicken now and again when I'm really hard up. So far as I can tell, nature really doesn't work that way and it is always the correct strategy to exploit resources.<br><br>Ah, but then, suppose you have such an intellect that you can really interfere and make an impact on the natural system.

But modernity was supposed to free us from these cloistered shackles of kinship. Indeed, modernity, wrote Ernest Gellner, the late British-Czech social anthropologist, means the rise of centralized authority and the consequent decline of tribalism. But the opposite is presently occurring: The crumbling of central authority throughout much of North Africa and the Near East (as well as the rebirth of lumpen nationalism in parts of Europe) indicates that modernity is but a passing phase. Today, tribes with four-wheel-drive vehicles, satellite phones, plastic explosives, and shoulder-fired missiles help close the distance between Late Antiquity and the early 21st century. <br><br>St. Augustine's North Africa, now with its degraded urban conurbations of cracked brick and sheet metal, will see its population increase from 208 million to 316 million by 2050, putting severe pressure on both natural and man-made resources, from water to government. As these millions move to the cities in search of jobs and connections, the political order will assuredly shift. Whatever arises by then may not be the states as they appear on today's map. Indeed, what we consider modernity itself may already be behind us. The headlines between now and then will be loud and hysterical -- as they are today in Syria -- even as the fundamental shifts will at first be obscure. For history is not only about convulsions, but about the ground shifting slowly under our feet. <br><br>In The City of God, St. Augustine revealed that it is the devout -- those in search of grace -- who have no reason to fear the future. And as the tribes of old now slowly come undone in the unstoppable meat grinder of developing-world urbanization, religion will be more necessary than ever as a replacement. Alas, extremist Islam (as well as evangelical Christianity and Orthodox Judaism in the West) may make perfect sense for our age, even as its nemesis may not be democracy but new forms of military authority. Late Antiquity is useful to the degree that it makes us humble about what awaits us. But whatever comes next, the charmed circle of Western elites is decidedly not in control.</i><br><br><a href=#c4439636514824724364 title="comment permalink">12/5/13, 2:43 PM</a><br><br>

How is it that so many “Christian conservatives”, especially in the USA, are followers of Ayn Rand, a militant atheist whose teachings are the polar opposite of what the Rabbi of Nazareth taught? I am also reminded of a passage from Aldous Huxley’s “The Perennial Philosophy” where he pointed out that a great many people who claim to be followers of Jesus are actually worshippers of Mammon, Priapus or Mars. Quite a few seem to be avid worshippers of all three.<br><br>As for parallel between the foaming piles of hog manure that seem to explode on a regular basis these days and the financial markets, well said. The same thought came to me as I read the article…<br><br>“BTW, the word "fracking" is hereby exempt from this blog's prohibition against profanity; as it refers to a penetrative act performed with no thought of anything but immediate gratification, it makes a good expletive, and I encourage you and my other readers to start using it as such in public settings.”<br><br>Already do. Like many people, I got in the habit from watching the remake of the Battlestar Galactica TV series, which was a lot darker but much more intelligent than the original. The original was little more than “Bonanza in Space”, with Lorne Greene reprising his original role in what everyone thought would be the New Frontier. Funny how so much of the Jetson’s future we were promised turned out to either be stillborn or a nightmare of mass consumer/mass media excess, stupidity and greed. I watch very little television and I can't stand 99 percent of what's on the boob tube these days, but I do make an occasional exception for intelligent programming like the remake of Battlestar Galactica.<br><br>Anyways, thanks for sharing these brilliant insights of yours every week. I have read several of your books, starting with “Monsters” and most recently “Not the Future We Ordered”.

In last week’s post you referred to it as “the barbarism of reflection.” While I agree, and know from personal experience, that reflection can lead to nihilism, I would suggest that humanity suffers from a lack of reflection rather than an excess. Here, I would agree with Jacques Ellul. Enslaved by machines, surrounded by concrete, and living on machine time, we have become severed from nature and the natural rhythms that world implies. The un-natural noise (cars, airplanes, more machines) and the distractions (television, “smart” phones) of modern life frustrate man’s ability to reflect.<br><br>In the current essay, I would say you have it backwards: technology is no longer the servant of man, but his master. Every new technology is immediately put to use. We frack, drone, and spy because we can. Even a little reflection would expose these technologies as dangerous, counterproductive, or illegal. But we are not asked to reflect. We must listen to the experts, the technicians and scientists, the high priests of the religion of progress. We are told our problems are too complex. So, we have the technicians at the Federal Reserve, not our elected representatives, “running” the US economy, and lobbyists and bureaucrats (technicians) putting meat onto the bones of Dodd/Frank. Even our politicians cannot be trusted.<br><br>Nihilism is certainly a problem (I think you promised to say more about it in the future), but I believe the footholds I am finding to climb from the abyss are the result of reflection. Are we not most “human” when we synthesize our senses, education, and experience in quiet reflection? Man is a part of nature; technology is the conqueror. At some point in this abstract, scientific journey man handed the reins to technology, and technology has conditioned the son of Everyman to be passive, unreflecting passengers. Once on this road, I’m not sure it could have ended any other way.<br><br>Anyway, I do enjoy and benefit from your essays.<br><br><br><a href=#c2436565482952718316 title="comment permalink">12/5/13, 6:51 PM</a><br><br>

Of course reflection is valuable, and in some situations necessary; the problem is that it can spin out of control into nihilism under some circumstances. The phrase "barbarism of reflection" doesn't mean that all reflection is barbaric, it means that under the wrong conditions, reflection can give rise to barbarities. Every human capacity can be abused; just as you don't actually know how to use a tool until you can describe three ways to break it and three things it can't do, understanding the limits on human capacities, and the ways in which they're commonly abused, is essential to using them well. <br><br>Richard, excellent; that gets you tonight's gold star.

It would great if that word could be emptied of its bio-phobic connotations of attack, rape and nastiness, and turned (returned?) to a strong biophilic term for the sexual acts it supposedly denotes. After all, I do find currently acceptable terms like “making love” to be rather insipid.<br><br>I have mulling the f-word thing around for a while, since I have gotten very tired of seeing sexual acts (especially ones often still considered deviant) used as metaphors to describe the very destructive financial actions by our self-described “Masters of the Universe” Wall Street denizens. You don’t find this in the MSM, but it certainly appears often in the blogosphere. I was coming to the conclusion that it would be great if things like selling mortgage-backed securities could become the reference point for basing obscenities instead of sexual acts.<br><br>However I think that fracking makes an even better reference point since it still has emotional connection to the concept of violation that selling bad paper will never have. It also helps that the reality of inserting the business end of an active fracking drill into a living being would result in its death. So if the current f-word could be drained of the bad connotations like rape then we could have the bad guy saying “I’m going to frack you, you female dog.” You would definitely know that that this bad guy needs to spend a long time in the big house, where…<br><br><br><a href=#c2647293248409316479 title="comment permalink">12/6/13, 6:30 PM</a><br><br>

I'm trying to synthesize the ideas discussed in this blog over the past few months, so let me see if I got this bit right: Marxism is a civil religion parasitical on Christianity, in that Marxism does away with the Christian deity (and angels, etc.), but "steals" the imagery and emotional content of Christianity by, for instance, substituting the proletariat for God, dictatorship of the proletariat for heaven, etc. Ayn Rand's Objectivism is the anti-religion of Marxism: it's essentially the same thing, but with signs reversed (thus, in Marxism, the masses are Good and greedy capitalists are Bad, whereas in Objectivism, it's exactly the other way around). Does this sound about right? <br><br>Further, one of the commentators here linked to an article about Ayn Rand's sympathies for a notorious child killer, and in that context, I've been pondering the question of the extent to which Ayn Rand's personality traits should be taken into consideration when evaluating her philosophy. Saying that somebody's ideas are wrong simply because that somebody was a nasty person constitutes an ad hominem fallacy. But it seems to me that there is more to it than that. Moral philosophy (which is essentially what Ayn Rand was concerned with) deals with values at least as much as it deals with facts and logic, and values are never "true" or "false" (in the way that a statement such as "it rained this morning in Berlin" is either true or false). Thus, while the fact that somebody was a nasty human being should have no bearing on the evaluation of his work in (say) algebraic geometry (which deals with logic only), it should be kept in mind when approaching his moral philosophy. Essentially, if someone was a nasty human being, it makes it likely that he had some pretty twisted values, and so one should not adopt his ideas without having scrutinized them very carefully (more carefully than one typically scrutinizes ideas). This is not so much a question of logic as of practical wisdom. If I'm going to read moral philosophy in search of guidance for living a good life, then it seems reasonable to approach with an open mind the writings of a person who dedicated his life to (say) rescuing abandoned puppies, while approaching the writings of a convicted embezzler or serial rapist with heightened skepticism. <br><br>So in that sense, it seems to me that keeping in mind that Ayn Rand held in high esteem (and even largely based a hero of her first - unpublished - novel on) a man who kidnapped, killed, and eviscerated a 12-year-old girl, then threw the girl's upper body in front of her horrified father, and then proceeded to scatter the girl's limbs and entrails around L.A., should heighten one's skepticism in approaching Ayn Rand's writings (and it should certainly be enough to prevent a person from idolizing Ayn Rand as a human being, whatever the merits of her writing may be). Just my 2c. <br><br>In any case, I certainly look forward to the Archdruid's more in depth discussion of Ayn Rand!<br><br><a href=#c7752107201176710949 title="comment permalink">12/7/13, 5:12 AM</a><br><br>

What we found was that it was a terrible way of getting people to think about oil policy. Not because it's particularly misleading, but because it makes people profoundly pessimistic about finding solutions - least of all policy solutions. For most Americans - except those directly involved with substance abuse - the addiction narrative plays out pretty much as you lay it out here - in a downward spiral that friends and relatives struggle and fail to stop.

You don't see much discussion of war in the peak oil blogosphere for exactly the reason you've suggested: a great deal of peak oil discussion takes its lead from the US, which has not had a war on its own soil since 1865. That allows a lot of Americans to pretend that war can't possibly be anything but a nuisance affecting some other country, somewhere else in the world. One of the few advantages of living in a frequently invaded country, as you do, is that you're less likely to fall into that delusion! <br><br>Kevin, nice. Many thanks for the link. <br><br>Iuval, good. It was intended to hit the thin line between those reactions. <br><br>Rhisiart, thank you! I've had a spike in hits, which was partly your doing -- somebody else seems to have posted <a href=../../2013/09/the-next-ten-billion-years.html rel=nofollow>The Next Ten Billion Years</a> somewhere, and that also got a substantial uptick. <br><br>Clarence, thank you. Remember, though, that you can't actually affect the system by rebelling against it in the ways that the system expects...<br><br>Doctor W., exactly! You get tonight's gold star. I'd like to suggest the word "stripmine" as another good bit of belligerent speech, as in, "You motherfracker, I'm gonna stripmine your frackin' face!" or "Yeah, we all got stripmined by that latest policy change." Since the word means "devastate, ravage, lay waste to," it gets the point across. <br><br>Seriously, folks -- this is a subtle but effective way to shift the collective imagination. Start using terms like "frack" and "stripmine" as obscenities in ordinary conversation, and watch your own awareness and that of the people around you start to change...<br><br>Nick, no argument there. The feminist thinkers who've pointed out the severe problems with gender essentialism -- in less complex English, the notion that certain human qualities "naturally" belong to one gender only -- are to my mind square on target. That's one of the reasons why I've suggested that it might be useful to replace Man with people -- lower case, plural, and including the whole range of genders and other human characteristics. (Not, please note, The People -- that's another capitalized abstraction, even more murderous than most.) <br><br>Tom, there you go.<br><br>Cherokee, it's "canning" here -- "preserving" in American means all ways of making food last, freezing, drying, pickling, you name it.

In a world powered by sunlight alone, we have plenty of advantages to be sure, but there is no way we could possibly live the way we do today in developed countries.<br><br>Man, that conqueror of nature as it stands now, even today, is certainly having a bad case of the hacking cough, which is in itself a prelude to a death rattle!<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c7555511112153268925 title="comment permalink">12/7/13, 9:30 PM</a><br><br>

Hopefully the motherfrackers in the American oil and gas scene, and the bursting of their financial bubble along with their environmental mayhem, help to give it the necessary boost it needs to become a swear word in its own right. But I'm afraid that, even with their help, it may still exist only as a toned-down f-word.<br><br>I think "stripmine" could work much better though - I think it effectively conveys the meaning you suggest, and it would probably be understood even now to mean something like "to lay waste to."<br><br>By the way, is your prohibition of profanity in your comments mostly for the purpose of encouraging a higher level of discourse, or do you have a problem with the use of profanity per se? The ban on profanity you enforce seems strange until one compares your blog's comments to comments on Kunstler's blog. Part of the reason this is my favorite blog is that the comments are as thought-provoking as your post, which is itself as reliably mind-blowing as a good psychedelic drug, without as many side effects. I doubt the comments would have the same quality without your moderation, despite the fact that well-aimed profanity can be an effective rhetorical device.<br><br>Overall, I like the idea of using environmentally destructive practices as swear words. Perhaps they could replace religious swear words like "damn," which have become the mildest class of profanity in the English language. If the new religious sensibility you've written about truly is forming, I can't think of anything more sacrilegious than fracking Mam Gaia for another short-lived petroleum high.<br><br><a href=#c1357695412960918004 title="comment permalink">12/7/13, 10:29 PM</a><br><br>

Communicating about this kind of things to other side of the world with a alien language may not be easiest way to bring clarity, but I will try. <br><br>First of all, European populism is not the same thing as American libertarians. Not at all. Outside the anglosphere, populist movements tend to blend together ideas from both left and right. It is the strong nationalism, not the economical opinions, that marks populism to the right. Cultural conservatism and anti-modernism are common factors. I have traveled quite a lot inside Europe, and these traits seem to be common nominators in very heterogenous and motley crew of "populisms". Still, I am not a politician but just ordinary working man in the specialist position, so I may be wrong also. That is my personal experience, though. <br><br>The other factor playing into the big picture is the fact that parties of traditional Left have lost their grip on native working classes of at least northern/central European nations. Loss of that grip is as complete as it is underrated in the circles of more affluent society. Those neighbourhoods and people who were only two decades ago the most loyal support base for leftist ideologies are adrift now, and the break is as irreversible as it is ground-breaking. Political map of the Europe shall look totally different after Baby Boomer generation makes their exit from voting population. <br><br>At the personal level, err... Internet is wrong place for personal lament, but let's say something at least. My country was bound to COMECON economic system much more tightly than current politicians want to remember. Our country had to sign "Treaty of mutual Friendship, Co-operation and Assistance", YYA, with the Soviet Union after World War Two, even if official position during Cold War was that of deep neutrality. Soviets were good buyers, even if politically agonizing partners. Our country had the benefit to operate under quite conservative Western-style financial system and still have open trade routes into the very heart of the Eastern Bloc. As a result, there was a lot of top-quality heavy industry in my country geared almost totally towards "Eastern Trade". When Soviet Union fell, all this economic activity came to grinding halt. Unemployment rose in couple of years from ceremonial 2-3 % to the staggering 25 % in national level, and situation was far worse where I lived. Proud, skilled craftsmen from high-quality heavy industry were thrown into permanent unemployment, and whole working-class neighbourhoods ravaged and bankrupted, then thrown into hastily expanded public housing projects. Innumerable lives were shattered and whole mental landscape where those people lived changed forever during timespan of two or three years. My father was one of those on the losing side and I rose to adulthood in those same years, among the carnage of our previously prosperous blue-collar community. I am very moderate and dispassionate person, mind you. Younger ones coming from same hoods and circles are even more alienated from current system than I am. I at least had time to grow up as a child in more stable, happier times. Old values were inscribed into me during that childhood. Younger ones have seen only this new reality, if they do not belong to privileged classes, who buy themselves out from the brave, new world. So peak oil and peak resource base shall have political face also, believe me.<br><br><a href=#c4008885132303869682 title="comment permalink">12/8/13, 6:14 AM</a><br><br>

From what direction the winners shall come, I have no idea, but I know that big troubles are brewing under the lid, like they were in the 30's.<br><br> http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/08/david-simon-capitalism-marx-two-americas-wire<br><br>What I find interesting is that JMG has in his books described the best theoretical model for world's current economic and environmental situation I have encountered. This model of catabolic collapse has very good track record indeed in explaining what has happened already, and if nuclear war option is not thrown into the picture, I believe it describes near to middle future also. It is of course only an model, but it works, so...<br><br>I just hope that blog host and frequent commenters in it don't underestimate consequences of tectonic shifts of political landscape either. I have noticed that anglosphere acquaintances of mine have tendency to highlight individual solutions to both problems and predicaments to a point I see as cultural weakness and blind spot. No individual works in the void, and for example there is no individual answers available to resolve predicament of mass unemployment. <br><br>If there is food for twenty, and one hundred hungry persons, mathematics dictate that individual answers help only the luckiest twenty... Those eighty persons left outside banquet would be very stupid if they should not form an alliance to chance that situation. If they win, they can fight all over again among different factions inside original group... <br><br>Whole world-wide infrastructure of production must undergo total remaking to have any true solution for resource depletion and outright destruction of our shared nature. Who really believes that road shall not be very messy? <br><br>When the last Western Emperor Romulus Augustulus, "little Augustus", was disposed in Ravenna at 476 AD, it took CENTURIES for any kind of new order to take place. Those centuries had to be lived through, if you happened to born during them. You could not just fast forward into the new order. Decay and anacyclosis of current "imperial" system has just started, so we have long road downhill ahead of us. One of the most reasonable answers how to react to it as individual living during troubled time is to protect one's own community, be like Bacaudae groups of late Roman Empire. <br><br>It is those people around you that truly matter, not some abstract fantasy Disneylandish Green Future hopium... Some day we must use less, and return to some version of sustainable living. Unfortunately that goal must be achieved through unpleasant stuff involving dirty politics and failed attempts to change direction, and LOTS of fighting over resources. <br><br>People preserving important skills and thinking patterns for the next civilization, waiting our heirs five hundred or thousand years from now, how they are going to deal with those less pleasant persons with no abstract argumentative skills but lots of skills in violence and capability to use it quite freely..?<br><br>After all, Germanic warbands were already Christians when the empire fell... They had some emotional sympathy towards Christian monasteries and their work.

After seeing the Finnish movie " The Unknown Soldier", I belatedly read more of the Finnish history in WWII, aka the winter war/continuation war/Lapland war.The nationalist,ethnic feeling must already have been there to fight like that sequentially against two of the major world powers with such incredible results, but those wars must have reinforced that feeling/identity going forward.<br>In the Anglosphere it hard to conceive of that level of identity.One gets the facile, superficial America number one posture in the USA, but that real depth of feeling here must only exist, and then marginally, in defeated populations such as the Maori in NZ, some native Americans, some Hawaiians, the Irish, the Scots.One feels it in Australia around ANZAC Day, also a defeat, perhaps in some marginal, ex-confederate areas in the US.<br>I guess my question to you is how much that feeling of community forged in fire motivates the identity you obviously feel.For better or for worse, I don't think most of us in the Anglosphere get it on a visceral level.<br><br><a href=#c2562533722455608541 title="comment permalink">12/8/13, 10:59 PM</a><br><br>

I appreciate the difficulties that you may have in communicating because English is not your native tongue. I also respect the fact that you are contributing to the discussion here as it provides an alternative viewpoint.<br><br>Quote: "When Soviet Union fell, all this economic activity came to grinding halt."<br><br>As a completely alternative perspective from an outsider, it is a risky strategy for any business (or country) to receive a large percentage of its income and/or sales from a single customer. Large percentage usually means more than 25% of the total revenue.<br><br>What you witnessed was in fact a failure of leadership in your country as they had all of their eggs in one basket.<br><br>That strategy is risky because, as you have seen, if the orders for products stop coming then the factories simply shut down, leading to unemployment and loss of capital.<br><br>This is what happened both here and in the US leading up to the Great Depression. There was manufacturing capacity, but little to no demand for the products.<br><br>The rapid development of public housing in the wake of such turmoil in Finland is actually a pacifying tool. <br><br>Large groups of unemployed people, who have little to lose are a recipe for revolution. 25% unemployment is a disaster waiting to happen. Have a look at the experience of Greece and Spain right now as they are experiencing these sorts of numbers.<br><br>Realistically, those people who suddenly found themselves in public housing must have lived elsewhere before that turmoil. It may be worth you asking those people about those times and getting some first-hand accounts?<br><br>Finland's experience is not the only possible solution to such an event. Iceland in recent times chose differently and looks to have very different outcomes to your experience in Finland. Cuba is a different example again.<br><br>The plight that you describe has long historical roots with the dispossession of indigenous peoples from their land too. Take away their purpose for living, provide them shelter and food without having to work for it and you create a passive culture waiting for its next meal. Hardly the stuff of revolution.<br><br>Please people, I believe that there should be a safety net for people in society.<br><br>The simple solution to mass unemployment is that everyone across society takes a massive hit to their wages and accepts a lower standard of living. Export markets will magically open up as other countries seek to leverage this for their own advantage. The other alternative suggestion is import tariffs. How about devaluing the local currency so that imported goods are too expensive. There are plenty of answers, but little will within the community to accept a lower standard of living for all. That is why historically a certain percentage of your population was cut loose (this process has also been described here as having them thrown under the bus).<br><br>I too found myself a victim of the recession in the early 90's and was faced with some very hard decisions. This is why I worked towards distancing myself from the benefits of Industrial society (as much as possible). I work on the understanding that if it has happened once, it will happen again.<br><br><br><a href=#c6846536884215682217 title="comment permalink">12/8/13, 11:42 PM</a><br><br>

Down Under, I go out of my way to cultivate acquaintances with every gun toting person living up this way. Of course, no one lives in a void.<br><br>The problem is, very few people know how to grow and process food. This includes preserving techniques which should include home alcohol production from scratch. How about basic medical provision? How about energy? How about shelter? How about communication? How about water?<br><br>Community is one aspect out of a great many, that is why our host discusses individual responses as these skills have to be practised and it is hard to get a broad range of skills. He is preaching a diversity of responses to the future in the hope that some responses are appropriate.<br><br>It is one thing to read about how to make country wines using local apples on the Internet and another thing altogether giving it a go and trying to understand why the mead was so consistently good and yet the cider was so rubbish.<br><br>However, the one thing I do know about the future, is that within the current political system a solution will never arise because they have a simple conflict of interest. The conflict is that they vote for their own pay rises and accept payments from lobbyists.

They give a perfect example of why conquering our Earth to feel powerful and smart, just doesn't seem to work, for very long anyway.<br>The modern version of this story could easily be adapted to"The Epic of Civilized Gentlemen".<br><br>Also i stumbled across a youtube lecture by Dr Joseph Tainter, i'd be interested on your thoughts. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0R09YzyuCI <br><br>Again Thank you.<br><br><a href=#c1774240111031925148 title="comment permalink">12/9/13, 2:48 AM</a><br><br>

He is also a staunch advocate of passenger rail and mass transit and argues that trains and mass transit make a great deal of sense from a conservative and a free market perspective as well as a liberal one. <br><br>http://grist.org/article/2010-10-21-william-lind-makes-the-conservative-case-for-public-transit-but/<br><br>I like Lind because so much of what he has to say, whether about mass transit, political correctness or modern warfare, just makes sense and he doesn’t pull any punches, even when discussing controversial social issues.<br><br>We need more principled conservatives in the public arena, to fight against the excesses of both the left and the pseudoconservative right. In that I agree with John Michael, and I am looking for ways to make a positive contribution. I would like to conclude by saying that I really appreciate having a forum like this where we can have an intelligent discussion of wide ranging topics like Peak Oil and its implications, magic, the future of warfare, democracy and intelligent life on Earth, and many other fascinating issues.

Gilgamesh gets everything he wants until his best friend Enkidu dies, and nothing Gilgamesh can do can bring him back; Gilgamesh then goes on a great quest to win the secret of immortality... and fails. That's the key to his story -- it's about the hard limits on human existence, a point that's been almost completely ignored in the recent Green movement references to him. I may do a post on him one of these days...<br><br>Adrian, isn't that properly spelled "vulture capitalist"? <br><br>Janet, the Middle East is hugely overpopulated and increasingly short on water.

Let me suggest this, though: if the germ theory and epidemiology are going to survive the end of modern industrial society, it's going to be because somebody cared enough to preserve them, and transmit them in a form that people outside the specialty will be able to use. Have you considered writing a book explaining germs, epidemiology, and public health on a village or neighborhood level, in simple language, for those who don't have any background in the subject? Intentional communities and organizations concerned with health in the Third World could use such a book right now, and it would be much more valuable in the future.

And even if myself and most of my fellow countrymen are somewhat nationalistic, that brand of nationalism has NOTHING to do with marching up and down on the streets with black uniforms and leather boots on. I just believe that this deeply delusional and as Enrique pointed out, very extremist ideology of internationalism is going to meet more and more political resistance from growing amount of population which bears the burden but not enjoy the benefits of globalisation. <br><br>And because the economical pie is steadily shrinking not growing, those in the elites must kick growing number of middle class people into the "underclass" to maintain their standard of living and status quo. It is not question of good and evil, but pure mathematics. If physical representation of that economical pie shrinks and gets smaller year after year, and people want to have their slice as big as it was promised earlier (benefits, pensions, dividends), somebody else has to have smaller slice. It is as simple as that.<br><br>My country has been quite poor and unimportant nation with strong primary industry (agriculture, forestry) and strong tradition of nature skills (hunting, wishing, orienteering, gathering berries and mushrooms, etc.) in the close past. Then, after the fall of the Soviet Union, our country got momentarily rich and our eager elite jumped the double bandwagon of insane Western ideology and European Union. <br><br>You know that insane anglosphere-born ideology that blends multiculturalism, liberalism and free markets into this toxic analogue of dose with rat poison and heroin blended into the same package, sold to junkies of idealist elites and their hangarounds..? I believe you do. <br><br>This two-faced Janus god bend on self-destruction I call leftist liberalism in the left and neoliberalism on the right. This insanity has been triggered by somekind guilt-trip about past "sins" of imperialism, I guess. Whatever it's history, my nation should have nothing to do with this madness from the West.<br><br>We were poor primary industry producers in the past, and after couple of fleeting decades of fake prosperity we shall return to those roots. Being poor does not mean you have to be desperate or take a bath in your own filth, so sooner my nation get's out from this bandwagon of EU, destined to become new hell on Earth, better it is for us.<br><br>@JMG: I do not believe that you hold any Disneylandish assumptions about peak-cheap oil present we are living right now or peak-oil future we shall have very soon. It is just firmly rooted anglosphere habit I have observed, willingness to jump to the happy end. If people forget what they have to go through for their heirs to arrive into that desirable outcome, they risk loosing because of overconfidence.

So "politicized" in today's world actually means something unpleasant and contemptible, and that corruption seems to be creeping up the bloodstream toward the idea of "democracy" as well. I don't think this is so much a magical belief system in play, as it's straightforward grieving denial of the relentless realization that our vaunted American federal democracy is a twitching corpse, poisoned by the breakdown products of rotted politics.<br><br>@Enrique, I went and read Lind's rage against the machine -- I keep looking for sense from US conservatives -- and it left me cold and unpersuaded. He opens with:<br><br>"Television, like all virtual realities, comes from Hell.

Earlier generations of conservatives knew instinctively that machines could be Hellish, and they regarded innovative technologies with distrust."<br><br>I remember watching an interview with Rod Serling from back in the early days of commercial television, and it was a fascinating interview to watch, for its pacing, its content, and the level of intelligence it assumed for its viewers. He was talking about this very subject, and pinned the problem -- correctly, I think -- on the very thing that modern conservatives, including Lind (?) deify: the "free market."<br><br>Commercial television has one "message," and only one message: "give me money." This is not inherent to the medium, it is inherent to the market economy, in which anything that cannot be bought or sold is an "externality" and unimportant.<br><br>One of the main reasons that people retreat into "virtual realities," whether video-games or Game of Thrones, is that virtual realities still support a few of the externalities that the market economy has ground down into crass commercial transactions. Externalities like personal heroism. Narrative. Skill. Awe. How many real lives consist of little or nothing beyond earning money, spending money, arguing about money, worrying about money? How many television shows or video games merely emulate that empty existence?<br><br>The real problem with virtual realities is that they provide just enough illusory dignity to modern existence to prevent people from moving beyond the free market and its monotonous message of "give me money."<br><br><a href=#c2410363798725014605 title="comment permalink">12/10/13, 10:47 AM</a><br><br>

How impoverished, constrained, devoid of hope or beauty does our existence have to be, before death starts to seem like a thinkable alternative? For some people that point is "never" -- they will hang in there and survive even in the most grotesque of circumstances (not necessarily becoming nicer people in the process); others will sit down and pine away, or seek martyrdom, rather than face the ruination of their ideals or forsake their gods.<br><br>The vision of our human future as a desperate, deprived, dreary existence among bankrupted, worn-out ecosystems is not all that attractive. Whether it's more attractive than catastrophic collapse, I guess, depends on how you feel about grinding, slo-mo misery versus high drama and flaming wreckage.<br><br>The riff in the NPR article is kind of stolen from MacKinnon's book, afaict. He talks at length about the difficulty of coming to terms with humanity's gradual and progressive bankrupting of ecosystems, the length of time for which we've been doing it, the problem of moving goalposts and revised perceptions... people today have no idea how much richer ecosystems were in their grandparents' time, and adverse, impoverished conditions quickly become "the new normal".<br><br>This is what's "scarier" than catastrophic collapse -- and maybe I even agree with that -- the idea of a human culture from which biophilia is, finally, extirpated... living on a planet from which all species have been liquidated which don't directly serve us. To me it seems a ghastly, nightmarish existence; I personally do not wish to see all other species "conquered", tamed, appropriated or annihilated. But presumably to the people living in such an epoch, it will seem at least as satisfactory as our own -- much as our own view of "nature" today accepts/admires biomes and ecosystems that an indigenous person of 500 years ago would immediately recognise as wrecked, and grieve over.<br><br>Essentially, the flourishing of sophistication and power in human culture has consistently come at the cost of other species, of soil health, of functional food webs, biodiversity, and all those other important words we keep throwing around. Now it even comes at the expense of a stable climate. <br><br>Megafauna, f'rexample, are no more; we have left no room for them. Even fairly familiar species have shrunk in size (of individuals, not just of populations) in reponse to our relentless predation; this is pretty well documented. The world of other animals gets smaller, more furtive, less numerous, less diverse with every passing day.

I believe you do. <br><br>This two-faced Janus god bend on self-destruction I call leftist liberalism in the left and neoliberalism on the right. This insanity has been triggered by somekind guilt-trip about past "sins" of imperialism, I guess. Whatever it's history, my nation should have nothing to do with this madness from the West.”<br><br>Juhana hit this one right out of the ballpark. Neo-liberalism, the pseudo-conservative right and the liberal left are merely different aspects of the same insane ideology, something I realized a long time ago. As for his last observation, he is entirely correct. I remember John Michael once said that we should starting separating ourselves from a dying and hopelessly corrupt culture, namely the pseudo-culture of the mass consumer society, the mass media and post-modern liberalism, while adapting in place. <br><br>I couldn’t agree more, and that has been one of the things I have been focusing on. Not just by trying to become more resilient on a personal level, growing more of my own food, learning practical skills that would be useful in a post-peak world and so on, but by reaching out to people I know who I think might be receptive, and trying to build a grassroots network. I have had some modest success as a growing number of people realize that something is terribly wrong and some start to wake up. Of course, many will remain oblivious until it’s too late, but such is life, and one can only do so much to help those who are determined to live in a state of denial, just like you can only do so much to help a drug addict until that person realizes that he or she has a serious problem and wants to get clean. No doubt this will be a major source of Darwinian selection over the next several decades.<br><br><a href=#c238377241847951095 title="comment permalink">12/10/13, 5:24 PM</a><br><br>

Like Serling pointed out, it assumed an audience that was intelligent, well informed and fundamentally decent. I still enjoy many of the old classic TV shows, which I watch online or from DVD. I was a big fan of Serlings, and loved the shows that he produced when I was growing up.<br><br>Most of the programming on TV these days is the moral and cultural equivalent of raw sewage and radioactive waste. I visited my parents recently, who still watch quite a lot of television, and was pretty appalled at what I saw being broadcast. Most of the programming I saw was either incredibly stupid or consisted of morally degenerate trash aimed at the lowest common denominator, not to mention the 5-10 minute blocs of advertising that constantly interrupted whatever show was playing. You are right about one thing, and that is that commercial television is all about getting the two-legged sheep to buy more junk they don’t need. It’s long been a truism that most children’s cartoons these days are nothing but 30 minute toy commercials. That experience showed me that I was right to give up the boob tube and find better things to do with my time. I don’t miss watching television at all.<br><br>Certainly the cult of the “free market” has to take some of the blame, but paleoconservatives like Pat Buchanan and William Lind have been pointing that out for a long time. Buchanan was a prominent opponent of NAFTA on the right because he understood the devastating effect that it would have on the American working class. <br><br>True conservatives have long understood that there is more to life than markets and the worship of materialism, and that culture and community come first. It’s only with the rise of neo-liberal Randian pseudoconservatism that conservatism has come to be associated with the sort of nihilistic and materialistic worship of the selfish ego by itself in the name of free markets, capitalism and the “convenience of the consumer” as the highest social good. In a sane society, it would be understood that markets are an important social institution that nevertheless exist to serve the needs of a community or nation, and not the other way around. <br><br>Markets and capitalism have their place, but there needs to be some balance, and a recognition that nothing operates in a vacuum. I think a lot of the degeneracy that we see in the mass media is a reflection of a much broader current of moral and cultural degeneration that has been going on since at least the 1960’s and probably has roots that go back a lot further. The producers of television shows these days are simply catering to the tastes of the audience, just like producers like Serling were catering to the tastes of the audiences of their time, which in turn speaks volumes about how things have changed on a cultural level in the last few decades, and not for the better.<br><br><a href=#c6643276231621355770 title="comment permalink">12/10/13, 5:29 PM</a><br><br>

Again, we're not the lords and masters of creation, and I suspect we're going to have to learn that lesson repeatedly, the hard way.<br><br><a href=#c875792810784809654 title="comment permalink">12/10/13, 9:16 PM</a><br><br>

And by the way, me and my friends have also long time ago came to the conclusion that current cultural decay of the West started with 60's movement, with all that hippie nonsense. Before that, moderate Left was real deal, actual working class stuff. After sixties, all that survived was this parade of predictable Looney Left support characters: "deep-thinking" university students from humanist faculty here, minority spokeswomen there and on the top of the cake, as cherry dipped into frosting, some self-lashing flagellants from white, "open-minded" middle class... And they are almost always white. No other cultural meme has dived into pits of self-loathing and betrayal so totally as theirs, the middle class liberal whites. <br><br>Cultural trends cannot turn water into wine or put more limited resources into the womb of Mother Earth, but this cultural trend of Baby Boomer generation has certainly nailed the coffins ready for their grandchildren; no easy options out after decades of open lunacy.<br><br>And JMG, I wait with great interest your writing about "f"-word :). I except something else than usual use of that "f"-word as blanco term describing supposed real-life cartoon villains. As no Darth Vader or Sauron look-a-likes walk the streets of European towns, except after science fiction Cons, that term needs some dusting. <br><br>Unfortunately, situation for Greeks seems already so escalated, that options still open for them as an nation seem to be rule by black or red brand of socialism or never-ending debt slavery executed by international banksters. No fiscally nor culturally conservative voice has risen among them, even if situation there has brewed into the boiling point resembling very closely that on southern bank of Mediterranean Sea just before the Arab Spring. Where is that voice of reason? Nowhere.<br><br>Horrible situation, indeed. I am happy I am not in the situation where those are the only options left.
