The satiric faux-journalism of last week’s post here on
<i>The Archdruid Report</i> was meant as a bit of edged humor at the expense of the overinflated self-image of humanity that’s been fostered by the cult of progress, and I’m glad to say that most of my readers took it as such. I fielded a few quibbles, but most of the commenters took the joke in good part. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I was amused to note that a noticeable fraction of the hilarity focused on the use of “frack” as a swear word. No, it wasn’t a <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> reference; those who are familiar with fracking—that is, hydrofracturing technology, the latest popular excuse for ignoring the narrowing walls of industrial society’s increasingly harsh destiny—will understand the usage at once. Since fracking is a penetrative act carried out with no thought for anything but immediate gratification, it certainly counts as a profanity, and I’d like to encourage my readers to use it in everyday conversation whenever strong language is called for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For that matter, a good case can be made that those who think it’s appropriate to treat Mother Earth that way deserve to be called “motherfrackers.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All jokes aside, though, last week’s post also drew on what was once a traditional way of talking about deep changes in the inner life of peoples and civilizations. That’s why, for example, the Greek scholar Plutarch wove a very similar story into his dialogue on the twilight of the ancient Greek oracles. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
During the reign of the Roman Emperor Tiberius, a character in the dialogue claims, passengers aboard a ship sailing from Greece to Italy heard a mysterious voice calling out from the island of Paxi, telling the ship’s steersman to pass on word to the coastlands further on that Great Pan was dead. The steersman, an Egyptian named Thamus, relayed the message as directed, and a great cry of lamentation went up from the uninhabited shore. Word of this got to the emperor, who was himself a serious student of mythology; he referred the matter to a committee of experts, who determined that the Pan who had just died was the third of that name, the son of Penelope by Hermes (or, in a scandalous variant, by all of her suitors during Odysseus’ absence—thus the name given the horned and horny god). </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a fine irony, and probably a deliberate one, in Plutarch’s choice of an Egyptian as the message bearer in his story. The Egyptians of Plutarch’s time were no strangers to dead gods; Osiris, one of the greatest of the Egyptian deities, was believed to have died twice, and only rose from the dead the first time, a detail that apparently did nothing to interfere with his performance of his divine duties. That’s commonplace for divinities: pilgrims to Tsubaki Grand Shrine in Japan, for example, can visit the grave of Sarutahiko no Okami, whom believers in Shinto consider to be the chief of all the earthly <i>kami</i> (divine powers, more or less) and still very much a living presence. Two millennia ago, in much the same spirit, pilgrims on Crete paid their respects at the grave of Zeus and then offered prayers and sacrifices to him as an immortal god. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this came to mind a few weeks back when the news carried a belated silly season story about the campus atheist organizations at a couple of American universities. The groups in question celebrated Halloween by setting up “god graveyards” full of paper tombstones naming allegedly defunct deities, along with signage hinting broadly that the Christian god was next. The smug and self-satisfied ignorance that’s practically the trademark of evangelical atheism these days was very much on display here:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the deities consigned to these cemeteries, for example, included quite a few who are still being worshipped, some of them by tens of millions of people. (Of course those tens of millions don’t include many white middle class American college students, and doubtless that’s why the sophomore atheists involved in the stunt didn’t get around to noticing them.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It also seems to have escaped the attention of the graveyard-builders that Christians believe that their god died once already, and wasn’t noticeably slowed down by the experience. As noted above, gods do that sort of thing all the time. This is true, curiously enough, whether you think of gods as bodiless superhuman beings, archetypes of the collective unconscious,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>narrative figures portraying the highest ideals of a culture, or what have you: death simply isn’t a great inconvenience to deities. It’s only human beings who find mortality awkward to deal with. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And abstract representations of humanity, like the one whose rise, fall, and wretched end was the subject of last week’s post? That’s another matter still. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Every human society has its own collective image of what human beings are like, which serves more or less the same role in that society as the ego or self-image does in the psychology of the individual. That image is always a polymorphous thing, subject to constant redefinition in the competing interests of subgroups within the society, and it’s also subject to changes driven by historical cycles as well as to something not far removed from genetic drift. Still, variants of the collective human image in any human society always have a close family resemblance with one another, and very often a set of common features that aren’t subject to change, no matter how much debate piles up around other aspects of the image. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The imaginary figure of Man, conqueror of Nature, parodied in last week’s post is exactly such an image. For the last few centuries, that has been the dominant image of humanity in Western industrial societies. As mentioned in <a href=../../2013/08/terms-of-surrender.html>an earlier post in this sequence</a>, Man isn’t you, or me, or anyone else who ever lived or ever will live.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He’s a fictional character who plays the central role in the grand mythological narrative at the core of the civil religion of progress, the mythic hero whose destiny it is to conquer Nature and march gloriously onward and upward to the stars.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To refer to the abstraction Man as the protagonist of a hero myth is not merely a figure of speech, by the way. In a brilliant book,
<i>Narratives of Human Evolution</i>, paleoanthropologist Misia Landau showed that the stories that have been spun around “the ascent of Man”—think about that phrase for a bit—are in fact classic hero tales embracing all the conventions of that very distinctive genre, complete with all the standard motifs that are traced out in studies of the subject by Joseph Campbell and other scholars of mythology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>She examines the classic nineteenth- and twentieth-century accounts of human evolution in detail, and shows how in every case, the facts unearthed by scientific research were hammered into shape to fit a far from scientific narrative. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It probably needs repeating that the narrative in question is not evolution. The evolution of species is one of the facts unearthed by scientific research; in the case of the hominids, in particular, the rambling family tree that led from East African forest apes to the author and readers of this blog has been worked out in ample detail, backed up by an assortment of fossils and artifacts impressive enough that the term “missing link” dropped out of use a long time ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No, what’s happened is that the normal process by which a successful species adapted to challenging conditions and spread beyond its original ecosystem has been rewritten as the central myth of a civil religion and used to redefine the entire two million years or so of hominid existence in the image of the last three centuries of western history. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you want to see the resulting mythology in full flower, all you need to do is pick up a book by an evangelical atheist who tries to deal with human history—Carl Sagan’s <i>Cosmos</i> is a good if well-aged example. It’s not just that every human society and historical epoch that comes up for discussion is judged according to its contribution to Man’s conquest of Nature, though this is generally the case; it’s the way that the conquest of Nature, or more precisely <i>our</i> conquest of Nature, the specific way of conquering Nature that modern industrial society thinks it’s engaged in, is treated as the only normal and natural goal of human aspiration, to such an extent that any deviation from that agenda has to be explained. Thus Sagan, in the book just cited, devotes an extended passage to trying to figure out why the ancient Roman world never got around to having an industrial revolution. The suggestion that they might have had better uses for their time and resources, needless to say, doesn’t enter into the discussion at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a rich irony in the fact that very often, even those who hate Man, conqueror of Nature, and everything he stands for are as convinced as any Carl Sagan fan could be that this cultural construct, this abstract and arbitrary fictional character who represents nothing more solid than one civilization’s currently popular notion of human nature and destiny, is the simple and literal truth about our species. Those of my readers who’ve spent time in the peak oil blogosphere will have read plenty of posts and comments describing humanity as “the ecocidal ape,” helplessly programmed by its genetic heritage to blunder along its current path toward imminent extinction. This is the same myth of progress we’ve discussed here so often, changed only by having the black and white hats switched around. Man the enemy of Nature remains as central, strong-jawed, and omnipotent as in the more popular versions of the tale; it’s just that in this version he’s the villain and victim of the piece rather than its hero. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course those who raise ethical questions about Man the conqueror of Nature as an image of human nature and destiny have a point—is it wise, or for that matter sane, to envision collective humanity as a megalomaniac in jackboots whose sole purpose in existing is to bully the entire universe into complying with his whims?—but there’s a deeper point at issue. The vast majority of humans, across the vast majority of the time our species have been around, have lived in relative balance and harmony with the ecosystems around them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The vast majority of the exceptions have taken place either when humans reached a part of the planet they hadn’t settled before, when humans were in the early stages of adopting some new means of subsistence and hadn’t worked the bugs out yet, or when environmental changes driven by planetary forces have destabilized existing human ecologies and left the survivors scrambling to find some new means of subsistence. Other species in similar situations undergo the same kinds of crisis, and then find their way back to balance—and so do we. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It so happens that all of us were born and raised, and are descended from a dozen generations of people who were born and raised, during a period of drastic instability caused by the second factor just listed: some members of our species stumbled onto a new means of subsistence, which we haven’t yet figured out how to use in a sustainable manner, and at this point almost certainly never will. This sort of thing has happened many times before to our species, and to countless other species as well. One of the core features of our predicament, though, is that this unusual set of conditions is all any of us has ever known, and since human beings are noticeably less sapient than the moniker of our species would suggest, many of us have taken the temporary state of instability that’s dominated the last few centuries, and projected it onto the far from blank screen of human history and the universe as a whole. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One core dimension of the crisis of our age, in other words, is that our sense of the meaning and destiny of our species is well past its pull date. The image of Man the conqueror of Nature was adaptive, in the strict Darwinian sense, during the brief age of extravagance that arrived when we first figured out how to break into the planet’s cookie jar of fossil sunlight. Those who embraced that image prospered and reproduced their kind, both in the straightforward biological sense and in the subtler, cultural sense by which success attracts imitators. Now that the rate at which fossil fuels can be extracted from the planet is running up against hard geological limits, and the net energy yield from such exercises is stuck in a remorseless decline, the image of Man the conqueror of Nature has stopped being adaptive, but a significant lag time has opened up between that change in circumstances and the recognition that it’s time to find a less dysfunctional way to understand who we are and what we’re doing on this planet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a common challenge in individual psychotherapy, or so I’m told, and it’s certainly a challenge in the training of the personality that’s a crucial part of the spirituality I practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>People reliably cling like grim death to the most disastrously dysfunctional self-images, and defend them fiercely against the suggestion that they could see themselves in a different way. Our need for a sense of stable identity is so powerful that many of us would rather be wretchedly miserable than risk the leap into the unknown that surrendering a self-image always involves. One of the great challenges of the teacher in an initiatory school—and I suspect that psychotherapists see things the same way—is to find ways to encourage students to get to the point at which they’re willing to risk treating their self-concepts as concepts, abstractions created by the mind, rather than simply the way things are. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty we face in the modern industrial world is that very few people have gotten to the point at which they’re willing to risk this same shift on a collective scale. There’s a voice calling out to all of us from the island of Paxi, announcing that Great Man is dead, but few are listening and fewer still show any willingness to carry the message to those who are waiting to hear it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus we’ve circled back around to the place where <a href=../../2013/03/the-sound-of-gravediggers.html>this series of posts began</a>, Friedrich Nietzsche’s proclamation of the death of God, for it was that death—less metaphorically, the collapse of Christianity as the foundation of Western cultures—that made the manufacture of Man the conqueror of Nature as a collective human identity both possible and (in a certain sense) necessary. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The problem with Nietzsche’s proposed solution, in turn, was that it simply postponed for a little while the problem it was meant to address. The Overman, the free human being who flings himself into the abyss of a meaningless universe to give it meaning through a sacrificial act of endless self-overcoming, was never much more than a pale reflection of the Christian god, who descended into the universe of matter and human incarnation on much the same mission. It was a brave attempt but not a particularly smart one, and the results, both for Nietzsche and for the European society he proposed to put on new foundations, were far from good. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Dying, as it turns out, isn’t the only thing that gods do easily and human beings find considerably more awkward. Nietzsche may have been right when he wrote that “one must have chaos within one to give birth to a dancing star;” he certainly had the chaos, and arguably gave birth to the star, in the form of some of the most brilliant of all German prose and some of the most challenging philosophical writings in any language. Still, it’s probably fair to extend the metaphor a bit further, and suggest that the radiation emitted by his newborn star proceeded to fry his brain and reduce one of the keenest minds of Europe to the status of catatonic vegetable. As any astrophysicist could have told him, human beings are simply not equipped to give birth to stars. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In less metaphorical language, the ramshackle structures of the human mind tend to break down in predictable ways when pushed beyond the tasks for which evolution has equipped them. The plunge into nihilism I’ve discussed in several recent posts is one of these predictable malfunctions. In Nietzsche’s case, that ended up taking the form of a mental illness that, though it’s been blamed on syphilis, had all the symptoms and progressive course of acute schizophrenia, paranoiac at the time of his psychotic break in Turin and phasing gradually into catatonia before his death in 1900. In the case of European society as a whole, a strong case could be made that much the same thing happened in the half century or so after Nietzsche’s time:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the collapse of Europe into a maelstrom of war, delusion, and mass murder over the decades that followed the continent-wide psychotic break of 1914 was only brought to an end by the exceptionally harsh therapy of Russian and American tanks and bombs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In effect, Western cultures in the nineteenth century replaced their traditional monotheism with a newly minted monanthropism—a belief system that flattened out the rich diversity of humanity into a single abstract figure, Man, and loaded that figure with most of the titles and attributes of the divinity he was expected to replace. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century writings that referenced our species almost always made use of that capitalized abstraction, and proclaimed him the lord of creation, the goal of evolution, the inheritor of the cosmos, and so on through the whole litany of self-important hogwash that surrounded the human project in those days. At that time, as I’ve suggested, it was adaptive in a purely pragmatic sense; it helped to encourage the rapid growth of industrial systems during the brief historical epoch when abundant fossil fuels and other nonrenewable resources made such systems possible. The downside of the experiment was that it left very few barriers in place to the barbarism of reflection, and those barriers fell down promptly once kicked by jackboots. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, the era when that expedient seemed to work is over, terminated with extreme prejudice by the relentless realities of dwindling resource stocks and an increasingly unstable biosphere. Whatever form the Second Religiosity of our age happens to take, whatever ways we and our descendants cobble together to counter the barbarism of reflection and keep the unsteady structures of human thought from the same plunge into chaos that left Nietzsche babbling incoherently with his arms around the neck of a beaten horse, among the basic requirements of the time before us are giving the conception of Man the conqueror of Nature a decent burial, and finding a way to imagine ourselves that has some relation to the realities of the human condition in a world on the far side of a failed industrial project. </div>

Carl Sagan had to tone it down to appeal to the remaining believers, in an age when minor collapses had already begun.

Speaking of energy return it seems you are on the money that the world has reached a peak in net energy.<br><br>http://www.pbl.nl/sites/default/files/cms/publicaties/pbl-2013-trends-in-global-co2-emissions-2013-report-1148.pdf<br><br>Apparently the annual co2 growth rate (rough approximation of all human made combustion reactions on earth) has slowed in 2012 for the first time in years. The researchers with a bias towards progress speculate this is because of renewable energy, hydroelectric dams and efficiency gains. However, I think it is much more likely the entire world energy supply has reached a hard limit on annual production of energy and the lowest hanging fruit in the entire orchard has been picked over.<br><br>On a more spiritual note I have been drawn more and more to Tibetan Buddhism. It is a very ecologically friendly philosophy, because it has to be to have kept intact the very fragile ecosystem of the Tibetan Plateau. I am not sure if a wave of Buddhism will be the second religiosity, I seriously doubt it. Sadly, with the hipster and yuppie types I see in college nowadays I think you may be right that Marxism will become fashionable again. Sadly the opposite of a bad idea in usually a bad idea. I think a wave of Buddhism like philosophy won't appear until we have damaged out ecology until sacred values beyond rationalism is the only thing that can save it. As for myself I may have found a niche in forestry. At least some parts of that livelihood are part of the natural flow of daily sunlight rather than the more ancient variety. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c8362663316243033153 title="comment permalink">12/11/13, 11:27 PM</a><br><br>

The problem is when one moves away from obvious and self evident truth. That is where trouble begins. <br><br>I do respect where you are going. For instance the statement that we both will die and leave this world is obvious unless you want to get ridiculous and play with definitions. But it does move away from the self evident, yes. The fact that we are animals is self evident. The supposition that we might be more than just animals is a belief but is not inconsistent with my original claim that we are animals. We bleed just like they do.<br><br>You are right to say the human conditions is not easily escaped. I share that belief with you but it does not define who I am. <br><br>Regardless of what I believe I am the same physical being subject to the same laws of nature. My weight does not change nor do any other physical characteristics change according to what I believe. My eye color remains the same. My breathing may speed up or slow down as may my heart rate and other physical changes may manifest but these are reactions to what I believe, behaviours and nothing more.

I vomited every half hour for well over 12 hours and by late the next morning I was hospitalised with a drip and a jab of anti-nausea medication. I can well see that people used to literally drop dead as I’m in a bit of shock at how quickly I went from healthy to not very well at all.

Well, General Motors (Holden) have also recently announced that they too will cease manufacturing here.

Agree, but this decision to be wretchedly miserable rather than risk changing is a largely unconscious process, rather than a considered decision. <br><br>The evidence of the need to change is all around us, if we care to look. But there are powerful inner forces that stop us looking too closely. And as you've often said those inner forces and habits are easily manipulated by people with agendas. It's taken me years of inner work to be able to see the way that fear and habit and ego and all those things work in me. And I'm still not able to be completely comfortable with them or to fully control them. <br><br>So waking up is a process not an event, both for individuals and certainly for whole societies, and quite a long process at that. I keep coming back to the life of my parent's generation, who lived through the dramas and carnage of the 20th century in Europe. This experience did lead to the snuffing-out of European colonialism, one particularly silly phase in the life of man the conqueror. But most of the survivors of that generation didn't go back to nature so much as they went back to the suburbs and shops and oil-fueled economic growth. I know my Dad felt like he kind of deserved a life of relative comfort after the rigors of his early life in the 1930s and 1940s. So in response to the implosion of colonialism in the first half of the twentieth century, Europeans built another unsustainable civilization in the second half - more peaceful, decent, etc, but still unsustainable. But after all that war and trauma, who could blame them for wanting it? And this is just one example of the ups and downs and round and rounds of it all. I've been reading that phrase "today's problems are yesterday's solutions" a lot recently. Seems to describe this process well. <br><br><br><a href=#c7421426456031104566 title="comment permalink">12/12/13, 5:57 AM</a><br><br>

Once again I have good news from Maine, courtesy of our local weekly. Our small farmers have reached a peak in selling locally through CSAs and what-have-you. (I know our local supermarket features locally grown right across the street from the farmer's food stand!)Now they are looking to the past, at pre-BIGAG ways of food distribution. Seed money has been collected to start creating "food hubs," which will buy their produce at good prices for them and enable local storage, processing and distribution using economies of scale to keep prices affordable. The idea is that as fuel becomes increasingly scarce, shipping raw foods to Asian slave-laborers for processing, and then shipping processed foods back will continue to jack up BIG-AG food prices. Locally grown and processed will be competitive in such a scenario.<br><br>It always feels like a race to stay one step ahead of the descent. Luckily here in Maine, we never really reached very high up, and it has always been a state you "survive" in, so it's maybe less bruising a fall.<br><br>Here on my homefront, after much thought and research, I've decided to switch horse breeds to foundation morgan. They are genetically essentially half-arabians so can withstand higher temperatures, and from their other half the cold, very hardy, high endurance, small, easy keeping, powerful and even-tempered, family-type, small farmer horses that can "do it all," and barefoot to boot. They are a bit few and far between -- the 20th century brought the influx of outside blood to create refined "show" horses of a poor (imo) type. But there are original type and lines out there and I'm working toward acquiring a young mare for my future small breeding and training operation. The small farmers here moved away from morgans to large and small European draft horses. In a changing climate, I think foundation morgans and morgan-arab crosses will be a much better bet.<br><br><a href=#c2587491301417454419 title="comment permalink">12/12/13, 7:46 AM</a><br><br>

Their world appears to be a barren desert, like a version of Monument Valley in the US, just lots of fancy technological toys and no greenery. In the movie, the Kryptonites had tried to colonize other planets for thousands of years and having failed, retreated to their home world, which they then obliterate at the beginning of the movie. Later in the movie a group of surviving Kryptonites makes their way to Earth and deciding to make it their new home decide to Terraform it (or in this case Krypton-form it). Krypton-forming seemed to consist of flattening the Earth, and destroying all life on Earth, flattening block after block of each side of the planet while breaking up the ground, a very real fracking of the entire Earth,. They destroy all life on Earth to convert the Earth to the look and feel of their home (i.e. upon reaching a world, which changed them from normal beings into super human beings with super human powers, they then proceed to attempt to destroy the source of their new found super powers by laying waste to the planet in their continued campaign to conqueror nature, until stopped by Superman of course). To Man, Conqueror of Nature destroying Nature is not enough; one must infinitely expand and frack up every world that it finds. I’ve also failed to mention that the Kryptonites were all clones, each clone with a defined role in society (save Superman who was conceived in the natural way), because “Man, Conqueror of Nature” wants to conquer nature, including the nature in Man.<br><br><a href=#c3229950466781964797 title="comment permalink">12/12/13, 7:48 AM</a><br><br>

As far as we know, other animals don't have the concept "animal," much less the ability to frame the really very abstract statement "I am an animal." Human beings do.

Ordinary human savagery will no doubt go on under the new sensibility, just as it did under the old; the people who embraced the old sensibility in its early days, in the dying Roman world, were eager to see their new beliefs as the key to Utopia, and you see what happened. The limit to the damage human beings can do to the world isn't a function of religious sensibility, but rather a function of the exhaustion of the resources that make it possible for us to ignore, for a while, the consequences of our own short-sighted stupidity.

Even in those cultures that place meditation at the center of their religious praxis, it's mostly practiced by monks and other religious professionals.

For a start anyone who can afford to wage war along those lines has nukes (or the ability to cobble them together fairly quickly) which make people in charge wary of going at war with others people so equipped. Then armies have spent the last 60 years walking away from that model of warfare with the result that any mobilization would have to start from scratch and be years away from being able to replace the losses and sustain the consumption rates of a prolonged high intensity conflict. Should a big powers war happen and somehow remain conventional I would expect it to be short and end up at the peace table with the loser being allowed to keep some face.

I had heard about it several times as a book that has spawned a spiritual "back to the land" movement in Russia, although I don't really know how much of one it is since everything I've heard about its influence in Russia seems to come from sources connected with it.<br><br>It's the first book in a series. I haven't read any of the others, but the first one was plenty for me to see where it's coming from. It is a story (Megre presents it as non-fiction but it sounds like even he was forced to admit it is fiction in court) that revolves around the character Anastasia, a representation of Megre's view of an ideal human being.<br><br>The book is especially ironic to me considering the last couple of Archdruid Report posts, and the fact that the translator uses the word "Man" as a translation of a Russian word meaning human being. I realized it was basically a new age version of the Man the Conqueror image, even though it's presented as "working with nature". Man the Conqueror appears in varying degrees in most of the new age, but Anastasia's attitude is basically as extreme as H.G. Wells, just with certain aspects completely flipped on their heads, with a Disneyesque version of nature and "pure thoughts" taking the place of technology and science.<br><br>The Anastasia character lives in the woods with basically no possessions, but is free from physical labor (other than walking) by having the wild animals do everything for her. The squirrels bring her food, bears, wolves and eagles do other chores for her. She states directly many times that nature has been created for man, and if Man's thoughts are pure enough then man will return to his "pristine origins".<br><br>Anastasia doesn't seem to offer anything in return to these animals who are doing all her work for her so she can keep busy helping Man through her thoughts, other than her company. Taking from a person and not giving back doesn't win many friends, yet this one-sided relationship with animals is described by Anastasia as "working with nature". Well, plenty of indigenous myths have stories about animals that include fantastic elements, but all of them that I've read portray the animals as having their own motives and desires, and would never just keep on providing for someone who doesn't provide anything for them. All I can see in "Anastasia" is a disconnect from actual nature while portraying a warped notion of nature that willingly submits to Man if only Man is pure enough.<br><br>The only positives positive I can say about "Anastasia" are that I didn't see any apocalypticism she does advocate people making changes in their own life, and encourages regular people to grow a garden even though she doesn't need to. Perhaps some people who are initially inspired by Anastasia to consider a less materialistic life will later find a connection to nature as it is, but I imagine the majority of those who focus on the impossible ideal of Anastasia will be just as ill-prepared to deal with the future as those of H.G. Wells's mindset.<br><br><a href=#c5452031479178383329 title="comment permalink">12/12/13, 1:40 PM</a><br><br>

It's an interesting question why that should be.<br><br>Travis, you could as well, and with equal justice, claim that the universe is symbiotic in nature. Myself, I tend to think that any statement along the lines of "the universe is X" is a communication about the person speaking, not about the universe. <br><br>Roger, I've long been of the opinion that Heidegger used murky prose to conceal the fact that he didn't actually have anything of interest to say -- a habit that he picked up from Hegel. Schopenhauer used to insist that Hegel was a deliberate charlatan, a con artist pretending to be a great philosopher by stringing together words and concepts more or less at random, and I tend to think the old grouch of Frankfurt was quite correct there. A competent philosopher should be able to say what he means clearly, in readable prose; I adduce Plato, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and Whitehead as examples. <br><br>Still, that's a side issue. The point I'm trying to make with K-Dog is that he's trying to privilege one set of beliefs and ideas as "self-evident facts," an that's not a useful move -- it simply makes it harder to understand, and communicate with, all the other people to whom those beliefs and ideas are anything but self-evident. <br><br>Ekkar, yes, and in fact we had a lively discussion of Sheldrake in the comments on an earlier post. <br><br>Andy, oh, granted! Everyone can experience trauma; most people can engage in basic religious practice; for those who can and will meditate, it makes it easier to deal with either of the other options and come through with your brain in one piece. <br><br>Joseph, so noted. <br><br>Daniel, the fact that you can see out past the blinkers of the myth of progress at all is impressive -- most people haven't gotten that far, and in all likelihood many never will. It's not a light thing to challenge the primary myth of an entire civilization. <br><br>Marcello, these are among the reasons why I expect the next major war to be radically asymmetrical, along the lines of the US-Chinese proxy war I described in my scenario of US collapse last fall.<br><br><a href=#c8532818412228353041 title="comment permalink">12/12/13, 1:56 PM</a><br><br>

(This 1870 book had been preceded by zoologist Thomas Huxley, 1863, Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature".<br><br>The man bit? Oh well it could have begun to mean ‘one species’ with an understanding that there were no primitive inferior forms, even if inevitably it was not taken that way. Descent still sounds ok to me: and I am pleased to have inherited some of the culture traits of these old naturalists. I still like to think an upside of global natural history is a bit like seeing the earth (ocean) properly from space. We might just get the picture. <br><br>Europe’s expansion into the Americas was a pretty desperate business, both sides of the Atlantic. The big starting point did not have a great deal to do with fossil fuels. Britain’s ‘carrying capacity’ had maxed by about 1700 to roughly what it had been in Roman times using roughly the same agricultural methods. Increases in total production matched population growth over roughly 200 years. England’s population went from 2.4M in 1520 to about 5.7M by 1750 with food in surplus from 1660 until about 1780. Food output however by 1780 had broken through the ancient ‘ceiling’ using novel ‘organic’ methods, so a population of over 7M was ‘feeding itself’ in 1781. By 1831, however, and in just another 50 years, and despite a 5-fold increase in food production since 1520, England’s population of over 13M could no longer feed itself. <br><br>Finally, to cut an interesting histoy short, over in the USA, by 1920 organic food production and ‘mining’ of ancient soils such as the Great Plains could no longer hack it (on the Plains, peak-horses was 1920), and soil nutrients and yields were drifting down. The only reason the vast increase in urban civilisation (industrialised by then) could survive, was that in the words of Geoff Cunfer: "Rather than adopt one or more of the ancient strategies, farmers (and the industrial nation behind them) created a new option. They appropriated abundant cheap fossil-fuel energy to import enormous amounts of synthetically manufactured nitrogen onto their fields. …” page 219, ‘On the Great Plains: Agriculture and Environment’, Cunfer 2005;<br><br>You have got it about right JMG.<br><br>Phil H<br><br><a href=#c2215146499176838299 title="comment permalink">12/12/13, 2:51 PM</a><br><br>

He pulls a trick worthy of Doug Henning and makes the militaries and their associated aerospace companies disappear from history.<br><br>He manages to describe the Space Program without so much as a backwards or forwards glance at the trillions of dollars poured into making war more lethal, more efficient and more dangerous to the entire planet that produced the ideology, industries and technologies for Nazi (and later Soviet, Chinese and American Efforts) The Nazi background of Von Braun is entirely ignored by Webb and whitewashed to a great degree by Sagan. The V-2 program was carried out by slave labor. "Von Braun could see the workers sicken and die as they were forced to work far past exhaustion with dangerous chemicals.<br><br>Operation Paperclip" a WWII program of the Western allies to recruit Nazis gave all of the rocket engineers a free pass far away from Nuremberg, without ever holding a single discussion over the very human costs of building and using these revolutionary weapons.<br><br>The SETI hopes for another civilization using microwaves to detect our planet rest entirely on the existence of military "chirp" radars, which are the only devices capable of delivering substantial pulses into deep space.<br><br>Remove the militaristic background and backing, and space research would be limited to using blimps, high altitude balloons and very small rockets. Commercial jet travel might not exist, certainly not in its current form.<br><br>Webb goes on to speculate that a paradigm of wholism is probably incapable of producing a society that is literate in science, citing China as the best case study. This is a fascinating claim--Webb manages to re-define science and its various disciplines and processes (distillation, observation, reasoning, the experimental method, record keeping, etc.) as something that only COULD happen in England or Europe.<br><br> He seems genuinely unaware that many heavy industries in China (like high quality steel production) shut down because the British and Dutch were busy draining the Chinese economy of working capital while simultaneously addicting the population to opium.<br><br>The 19th century ascendency of the British Empire happened in large part due to this trade, while simultaneously importing Chinese metallurgists to design better blast furnaces for making high grade steel.With so much money and resources being drained from China, factories shuttered their doors.

We have often assumed that their chiefs are despotic as our kings and emperors have been, but that is not so. He often arbitrates disputes, and his word carries a lot of weight, but he does not order the people about and has to convince them. I recall a quote of a Native American Indian chief, when his people had been badly abused by the whites, saying that he had spent the entire night talking his men out of retaliation (as they would have been slaughtered; it was not the right time for revenge). <br>I had read a Jane Goodall book on the behavior of apes, and how the alpha male might get into a rage or have a fight and vanquish another male, after which the beta male would often offer his rear end as a sign of submission, and would even grab and kiss the alpha male's hands. I couldn't help but notice that in many civilized societies, such actions are regularly done before kings and popes. It is highly undignified, and I cannot imagine Native Americans or African tribals doing this.<br>At the same time, I recall reading in books about childrearing, that a toddler undergoing some minor trauma such as a new sibling or a move to another house, or just being sick, would regress to more babyish behaviors.<br>Daniel Quinn may have been right that most people had a traumatic joining with civilization and lost their tribal roots along with it.

When a system is driven by a sinusoid, the two are indistinguishable. Even if you never expect to solve a differential equation (much less an integral equation), having the roughest concepts of calculus can be useful in making sense of the world. In the case of "why do the cold months follow, rather than surround, the shortest days of the year?", consider that the temperature of an object is determined by the "integral" of heat added to it. The pot on the stove doesn't get instantly hot when the flame is on, nor instantly cool when the flame is off. Heat flow depends on the difference in temperatures across a boundary, and the thermal resistance to flow through the boundary. (Put the pot into a haybox, and it will cool very slowly. Set the haybox on fire, and it will rewarm very quickly (though you really shouldn't do this).) <br>So, the Earth is warmed by solar radiation, and is cooled by its own radiation into space. If solar radiation increases, the Earth's temperature should rise. If the thermal resistance of the atmosphere increases (between the surface and the frigid cosmos), the Earth's temperature should rise, but <b>also</b> the lag (phase shift) between peak solar radiation and peak temperature will increase.<br><br><a href=#c2916623047736641346 title="comment permalink">12/12/13, 6:43 PM</a><br><br>

I had not heard of it, and now I have added it to my (long) list of books to read. I often contemplate the stories people tell about human history, and how even when people insist they are being factual, they are in fact unconsciously reflecting a myth. More specifically, I think of how the term "The Great Turning," used by those like Joanna Macy, David Korten, etc. rubs me the wrong way, because it treats a myth (that humanity is inevitably ascending to a golden age or a more "mature" state of humanity, regardless of human agency in making that happen) as statement of fact, when I see no evidence that a mass awakening is emerging.<br><br>I'm curious if anyone here has read Charles Eisenstein's work and their opinions of it. I have not yet, but I hear his name mentioned a lot (including suggestions from some that he speak at the Age of Limits gathering). I just started to read his book Sacred Economics, so I can form more of an opinion than I currently have when people ask me about his ideas.<br><br>I'm aware he's written another book called "The Ascent of Humanity." My immediate reaction to the title makes me suspect this is another classic hero tale (of a post-industrialism sort), though I could be mistaken. <br><br>@Andy<br><br>I agree how studying anthropology can be enlightening. I majored in anthropology as an undergrad, and despite the many limitations and flaws in the field, it helped me look at every "normal" aspect of my life and the world around me as if it was part of a foreign culture. I remember when I took my first Cultural Anthropology class, I felt awakened and lifted beyond my previous unconscious confines of looking at the world. Also, when I learned about peak oil in 2006, there was no denial on my part; it immediately made perfect sense, and fit in with my worldview shaped in part by my anthropology education.<br><br><a href=#c3848493201613080573 title="comment permalink">12/13/13, 5:01 PM</a><br><br>

I also added one sentence and will delete the original as soon as I see this corrected version. Colourful metaphor remains eliminated and sensitivity understood for future reference.</i><br><br>Clarifying 'Self-evident truth'.<br><br>If we are not solipsists there is the world outside of us, knowledge of which comes to us through our senses. Nietzsche pointed this out. He said the only way we can know anything is through our senses. Our senses can deceive and give us false information but regardless; if the world exists outside of ourselves there is truth in it. That truth is the correct perception of reality as it is.<br><br>Roger said: Maybe what k-dog is trying to say in using the term "self evident" is that we have to accept some things just as they appear. Roger is perceptive, thank you Roger. This is part of what I mean but there is more too it.<br><br>We have to start somewhere and do some acceptance of that which is self evident. In a sense that is what a religion is. There must be some element of faith or we are lost in nihilism. What is religion but a framework with which to function in the world? But with that acceptance we must never stop questioning and accepting that we may be wrong and deceived by our senses. I hold that position. Faith to me must be conditional and never blind.<br><br>I totally agree that "Self-evident Truth" is a common label for "a belief whose foundations I'm not willing to explore." I'm kind of fond of "the all men are created equal" one myself. There is that danger of ceasing to explore but that is not what I'm trying to get at. Complex belief is often colored by our own desires and predilection, our own internal bias. Internally our minds add emotional feedback to sense data and we can wind up with beliefs that move far from a true representation of reality in the process. Which if we are not solipsists is out there somewhere. Internally we pollute our beliefs with our own minds. Belief must surly lie on a continuum between that which is rationally sound in harmony with reality as it truly is and that which is just plain crazy. By self evident truth I'm talking about truth that is close to pure perception unpolluted by the madness of men, representation of reality as it is.<br><br>Is there truly a thing as Self-evident Truth? Maybe not and if so the human condition which is impossible to escape means that to truly be what we are; we must never cease from questioning and accept that we must always at some level doubt.<br><br>We may not know what a new Religiosity will be. But it is my desire that it is one which has a representation of reality close to that what reality truly is and which allows men, women and dogs a satisfying dignified life.<br><br>And onething thank you very much. You too Justin. There is no escape from the human condition and a dog like me is subject to man's whim.<br><br><a href=#c2713978887752675942 title="comment permalink">12/13/13, 10:29 PM</a><br><br>

A belief taken into the soul becomes cherished and one thinks that by giving a belief up they loose some of themselves. If we remember we have intrinsic worth and dignity beyond what we believe then discarding beliefs which have been found to be erroneous is much easier. But for some to discover that they have intrinsic worth beyond carrying a particular dogma is a foreign concept because society brainwashes people into thinking they have no worth unless they hold particular beliefs.<br><br>In this weeks post JMG said:<br><br><i>"Our need for a sense of stable identity is so powerful that many of us would rather be wretchedly miserable than risk the leap into the unknown that surrendering a self-image always involves"</i><br><br>This is true but it does not have to be so. Only people who do not understand that they have intrinsic worth suffer from this trap. Unfortunately that is most of us.<br><br>The Primitive said:<br><br><i>From my view in the cheap seats, it always seems to me that people miss that to hear the other side, you would have to be willing to confront that some fundamental belief about yourself might be wrong. Our beliefs define our very selves, and unless one is willing to openly accept that some part of self is based on something flawed or wrong, your well worded post simply ain't going to change diddly squat.</i><br><br>I don't think that's a view from the cheap seats at all. Change beliefs and the organism itself remains the same. The organism has the same intrinsic worth though beliefs have changed so seeing that beliefs should not define the value of self is enlightenment. <br><br>And: The Primitive also said:<br><br><i>My perception is that we, at least here in the US (since that is where my experience is), are as poorly equipped as humans to deal with this as we have ever been.</i><br><br>I concur and think American society is set up that way so the American way of life becomes sacrosanct and protected.

I'm maintaining the diversity, but it takes so many years for fruit trees to be productive in Australia's sad soils that immediate steps have to be taken. My best summer fruit producers are the strawberries and rhubarb (not to be sneezed at). So, I've decided today to double the productive area of strawberries and over the next year multiply the rhubarb many fold. The bees will be increased from two to three hives. Comfrey and borage will also be massively extended too as some areas are displaying a calcium deficiency (the forest soils are quite acidic).<br><br>It takes so long to understand how best to work with the environment that I have randomly ended up in.

I bake my own bread because it is about a 20km return journey to the nearest bakery (plus no preservatives too - how does industrial bread last a week? Yuk). Yeah, there is a well-stocked medicine cabinet too for the same reason, but of recent years, I've been looking into medicinal herbs.<br><br>Without going into details, I could not keep down Stemetil (Prochlorperazine) either...<br><br>As to the study, well it was just an analysis done by one of the early explorer / surveyors of the country. Today, I looked through my reference books but couldn't find the original source. Sorry. I did come up with a quote from Peter Andrews book "Back from the brink - how Australia's landscape can be saved": page 116: "Australia's landscapes contain only one-tenth of the amount of carbon they had 200 years ago. Whereas our soils once contained carbons that were 4,000 years to 10,000 years old, now they're two years old".<br><br>I hope you are OK with that, but it matches the observations on the ground here. Most of the top soil was lost here during the initial clear felling of the forest from about 1860 onwards. The explorer in question was <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mitchell_%28explorer%29 rel=nofollow>Major Mitchell</a>. Not only did he have impressive facial hair, but he was also reasonably switched on and passionate (the last person in the country to call for and participate in a duel!). As an interesting side note, he named the Mountain range here too.<br><br>Peter Andrews on the other hand sort of lost his farm, family and possibly also a bit of mental health in the process of discovering wisdom. What he discovered was the tools of permaculture, which were actually also some the tools of the Aboriginals simply as a response to this difficult landscape. But they're very good if you are setting out to design a small holding anywhere. He has since been provided a very wealthy patron and has continued his experiments which are very valuable.<br><br>I have a sort of, love / hate relationship with Grand Designs UK (after having actually built the house here) and am always fascinated by the excavations shown there. Unfortunately, I empathise with the owners pain too much. On the other hand a lot of builds are ego driven and this is a very small house. Your soils are in peril from what I've seen too. However, you have a much milder climate so rebuilding them is not as tough a task as here.<br><br>Hi Steve,<br><br>Thanks man. Yeah, I've once met Darren at a local farm in Woodend (Taranaki Farm) who in turn is a big fan of Joel Salatin. He brought Joel out here for a talk and open farm day last year. Those guys almost single handedly got me raising pigs (probably not a good idea though in this hilly environment here though).<br><br>My understanding (and I could be wrong) is that Darren is moving to the US and selling the family farm in Bendigo. Bendigo is about 70km north of here and it is a boom and bust environment. Last summer was hard everywhere in this part of the world.<br><br>David Holmgren is on a farm in Daylesford which is about 40km from here. I have a great deal of respect for the work that he has done and the insights achieved. You can tour his farm some weekends and I was most impressed with it. He seems like a gentle spirit. Nice bloke.<br><br>Man, you’re making me sound like I’m name dropping (you asked!), but it is such a small world, and I can well understand why agricultural design systems such as permaculture originated Down Under. It is just really extreme and the soils are just so poor.<br><br>Thanks again, your thoughts are appreciated.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5500371845170245113 title="comment permalink">12/14/13, 1:18 AM</a><br><br>

I'll consider discussing it in a future post or two. <br><br>Beneath, I really should read <i>Sacred Economics</i>; I got a review copy from the publisher, but the title is so off-putting -- the term "sacred" in contemporary pop culture is generally a label for "and now I'm going to plunge into wishful thinking" -- that I haven't yet been able to work up the enthusiasm. <br><br>Onething, but they didn't get a beautiful Easter Island again, just a barren speck of rock with a few scattered, warring tribes on it shouting "The flesh of your mother sticks between my teeth!" at each other. I really am going to have to do a post about that study, aren't I? <br><br>Steve, you're welcome. Just one of the services I offer!<br><br>K-dog, okay, I'm going to try to rephrase what I think you're saying, and you can tell me (or bark enthusiastically!) if I've got it right. Your claims "human beings are animals" and "every human being has inherent value" are the beliefs you'd like to see a future society adopt as unquestioned truths, because in your view those statements are (a) not contradicted by observed fact and (b) beneficial in their consequences, if firmly believed by most people. Is that more or less it? <br><br>Cherokee, heck of a good question. I'm not sure how much the collapse of a collective image is a matter of the failure of the image to conform to facts, or simly the collapse of the social forms that rely on, and support, the image. Thus Man the Conqueror of Nature could expire because enough people notice that the great war against nature has ended in total defeat, or he might expire because the social, political, and economic forms that support and are supported by that mythic figure become so obviously unworkable that other forms, backed up by different images, take their place. <br><br>Jld, that doesn't happen to everyone -- not by a long shot -- though the overuse of prescription medications with ghastly side effects in today's America has made it much more common than it would otherwise be. One of the reasons I enjoy involvement in Freemasonry and other fraternal orders is that they tend to be full of spry, active, enthusiastic people in their 70s and 80s who are still mentally as sharp as they ever were. The same thing goes for traditional martial arts -- Chinese t'ai chi teachers in their 80s who are more limber than I've ever been are quite common. You might find it helpful to get involved in some context where there are a lot of lively, smart old people; it may help you get past the conviction, fostered by today's popular culture (and heavily marketed by the medical profession among others), that aging by definition means debility and decay.<br><br><a href=#c9138797445682505081 title="comment permalink">12/14/13, 11:18 AM</a><br><br>

I thought it was wonderful. The abbess upbraided me a couple of times for my apparently-cocky attitude; her words, after a frown: "I spare you thirty blows!" She also reminded me, quite pointedly, that I too am going to die. People who I've talked to, including the abbott at that retreat, note that for most everybody (other than me) the reaction to a meditation retreat three or four days in is typically "What am I DOING here?!"<br><br>I went to the first Buddhist Geeks conference in SoCal a couple of years ago. I was fairly astonished at the number of participants I talked to that were in the mental health profession. A couple of talks pointed out that one has to be prepared at meditation retreats for at least one participant to have, often after the retreat ends, a mental "break" or crisis. And a recent Buddhist Geeks podcast discusses how "The Dark Night" is often waiting for meditation practitioners who pursue the practice long enough.<br><br>One final anecdote: also at the 1st Buddhist Geeks conference, a speaker told about laboratory studies on long-time meditation practitioners (ten years and more.) The staff doing the testing found that some of those practitioners were incredibly sweet and caring, but a substantial number of them were QUITE unlikable and difficult people to get along with. This took the staff and the investigators totally by surprise; it was not something they were even investigating, but they found it impossible not to notice.<br><br>JMG, your blog is such a delight AND such a challenge sometimes.

That the Easter Island situation may not have been the people's fault and ours would be, is not the point.

I'll bark enthusiastically instead but I don't think the statement (b) goes far enough.<br><br>Rapine of the earth's resources without regard for other creatures, humans or dogs and the wild animals of the earth would not be possible if it were a majority belief that "every human being has inherent value". Any society that endures is going to have to live in balance with nature and this can be done in one of two ways. <br><br>The first way is a small minority rules with Draconian despotism. Keeping the bounty of the earth to themselves and forcing the ecological footprint of the masses to be small via pain misery and death. The movie Hunger Games portrays such a scenario though it pained me they could not illustrate a higher technology than we currently have without using 'magic' which I'll define as science fiction without regard to the limits imposed by known physical laws.<br><br>I'll add that this way will not be brought about with much death and destruction and the chaos cause by trying to bring about this pattern of life may extinct man all by itself.<br><br>The second way is to respect the dignity of life especially the dignity of fellow men (and pets).<br><br>By recognizing that other humans have inherent worth a society can shun conspicuous consumption and the ethic of living within means so that others are also respected can become commonplace. To many this may seem like a dream but that attitude comes from being immersed in a constant rain of western media brainwashing which encourages one to be free while ignoring the freedom of others. Current American values are opposed to what I advocate and what I advocate seems strange only because the religion of endless growth is foisted on the American and other peoples of the western world every hour of every day.<br><br>To say human beings are animals correctly apprises the human biological condition and allows for behaviors to emerge in harmony with the long term survival of the human race. To say that every human being also has inherent value means that one admits they have inherent value too and the need to prove ones worth by consuming and taking from the earth as much as one possibly can becomes correctly understood as madness. If we admit every human being has inherent value then everyone perceives themselves as part of a greater whole and behaviours emerge in harmony with the long term survival of the human race.<br><br>So I see it as:<br><br>(a) Not contradicted by observed fact. <br>(b) Beneficial in consequence.<br><br>and: <br><br>(c) Essential for the long term survival of humanity.<br><br>and then:<br><br>(d) All dogs eat.<br><br><a href=#c4945348917961380662 title="comment permalink">12/15/13, 11:47 AM</a><br><br>

Just reading this dialogue seems to point out something that lies even one layer below the Religion of Progress. Not sure what it should be called, but let's call it the Power of RIght Intent narrative.<br><br>I've been pondering this very thing in the pseudoconservative babble that seems to dominate political thinking in the West. When faced with suffering, the pseudos justify ignoring it with the attitude that those who suffer somehow <i>deserve</i> their suffering. They like to trot out the Ant and Grasshopper fable, and the "they made this bed…" aphorism. Rape victims were "asking for it" with their behavior and mode of dress. Victims of muggers shouldn't have been walking alone at night. They invariably blame the victim, which betrays an underlying belief that the victim <i>could</i> have done something differently, and <i>should</i> have done so.<br><br>The pseudoliberals recognize that this simply isn't true, but they push the same belief up to the collective. That is, the mugger is as much a victim of society as is the victim of the mugger, but the society <i>could</i> be different, and <i>should</i> be changed. Then there would be no more muggers, or their victims.<br><br>Both views implicitly believe that something can be done, and something should be done, and that the Power of RIght Intent will manifest the intent.<br><br>So when we say that Easter Island society fell because the Easter Islanders chose to wipe out their resource base making stone heads, it's merely another "don't walk alone at night" cautionary tale: don't use up all your essential resources making stone heads, or don't waste your one shot as a species at petroleum-powered industry making automobiles and iPods. If industrial civilization falls because we were collectively idiots, it doesn't challenge the Power of Right Intent narrative. Rather, it confirms it.<br><br>What makes the Easter Island rate scenario "more terrifying" is that it undercuts the Power of Right Intent narrative. It implies that, even had the Easter Islanders done everything that could have been done, they were doomed by factors entirely outside their control. Their Intent, right or wrong, was impotent. They were but playthings of the gods.<br><br>I think we have to go back quite a ways before Francis Bacon to get away from the Power of Right Intent narrative. Medieval society believed that the prayers of the righteous were efficacious; Parzival gained the Graal through Right Intent. Roman society seemed to think itself pretty tough, declaring its emperors to be gods.<br><br>I think we have to go back to the Greek idea of the Fates, and of binding prophecy, to get back to a philosophical belief that Right Intent can be completely powerless….<br><br><a href=#c1836316298661326311 title="comment permalink">12/15/13, 3:40 PM</a><br><br>

About seven years ago I went out near Roma, Qld. with a group from near the coast to tear down an old shearing shed for timber for tent platforms for the coastal center. One of our members had grown up there(near Roma). His 2 brothers &amp; cousin were farming about 20,000 acres with millions of $s of equipment &amp; barely breaking even. We could have had half the houses in the district to tear down. When my friend had grown up there, there were dances, race meetings, etc. Now nothing. All the young people move away. These country towns might have a pub(sometimes) &amp; petrol station/convenience store. For a doctor, bank, grocery, whatever you have to go 50-100 kms.Global weirding &amp; more expensive fuel will finish what the economy &amp; marginal soil have started. I can see the area perhaps going back to what it was 100 years ago with wide ranging cattle grazing &amp; droving them to a rail head,unless the temperature goes much higher.

Oddly enough, he does actually have a point in using the term 'sacred', a point that I didn't quite expect going in.<br><br>The book has some flaws that are worth knowing going in so that they don't make you want to put it down after two chapters. First, it's repetitive. Second, it's too optimistic about prospects for the future in many different ways (but this was at times refreshing, because it allowed the author to focus on constructive ideas rather than doomerism).<br><br>It would be interesting to see you and another author, Chris Hedges, chat sometime. You both appear to me, more than any other two authors/thinkers out there that I know of, to be painting on the same canvas of thought, but from your very different backgrounds (Hedges being a long-time war correspondent). His style is very different than yours, but I think there would be great value in seeing a cross-fertilization. His recent book Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt is worth a read.

These were mostly negative - embarrassment, anger, shame, and so on. I was on retreat with the Goenka school, who prepare students for this thoroughly, by cultivating non-attachment. By the time the memories surface, the students are able to allow these extremely intense flashbacks to pass by, without re-engaging with them. I can imagine that if a self-taught meditator managed to access suppressed memories without being able to let go of them, it could be very destabilising.<br><br>2) Long practice in meditation allows very profound control over the physical processes of the body. One example recently confirmed by science is that monks are <a href=http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1c3jrx/meditation_allows_brain_to_control_body/ rel=nofollow>able to control core body temperature</a>. This kind of thing is far beyond the ability of most non-meditators, and can seem 'magical'. If a meditator has reached this level without taming their ego, he or she risks believing in their own 'superpowers'.<br><br>3) Meditation trains individuals in seeing things as they are. At first this means removing the influence of our own desires and fears. Later, it can mean removing some of the mental filters imposed by our native culture - which can mean becoming far more sensitive to some of the energies and entities that exist in this reality, but which we don't normally allow ourselves to see. If we happen to encounter these, even if they are benign or indifferent, simply the fact of the experience will mark you out as being "mad" if you try to tell anyone else; being set aside from other people like this is in itself a challenge.<br><br><a href=#c726613604960042350 title="comment permalink">12/18/13, 1:47 AM</a><br><br>

This idea could easily be misused, as has been done by politicians (Joe the Plumber comes to mind), or consumerists trying to market "green" items, but the little man prefers to make and reuse, conserve and preserve. Perhaps it's not in-line with your line of thinking, but then again it may be, and a new myth could use some direction, and I think the little man could be a possible symbol of this, rising from the ashes of Great Man. Some story could be developed, following the lines of old myths, but I think especially taking some inspirations from Russian stories which so often have simple, even silly boys/young men becoming heroes.

As made clear in this following article, jumping out of globalist bandwagon greatly reduces rights of both individuals and institutions to waste wealth.

Real world re-localization shall look inward looking and narrow-minded for current Westerners, brainwashed as they are by extremist globalist ideology.

I very much enjoyed the phrase, "the presently unfashionable intellectual humility" (? not quite exact?) because such humility is a gate to open-heartedness. <br><br>I saw such an attitude at work, when I spent 3 months working with a Japanese blacksmith, a follower of the Rivers and Mountains school of Buddhism. When chopping up charcoal, there is much to appreciate. In shaping a blade, there is no perfect, ideal shape. The material has it's own integrity, it's own spirit, and if you respect it, it will remember, and if you don't it will remember. To work with it, you need to appreciate it, be open to it, let it cut you to the heart. <br><br>Then, be mindful of the meditation of the material. The work, the focus, the process, the hammer and anvil, are all comfortable in a great open heart, Then, relax and look out the door for awhile, where the local universe is also working.<br><br><a href=#c6372131374635534716 title="comment permalink">1/27/14, 9:31 PM</a><br><br>
