The attempt to conquer nature—in less metaphorical terms, to render the nonhuman world completely transparent to the human intellect and just as completely subject to the human will—was industrial civilization’s defining project. It’s hard to think of any aspect of culture in the modern industrial West that hasn’t been subordinated to the conquest of nature, and the imminent failure of that project thus marks a watershed in our cultural life as well as our history.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve talked here already at some length about the ways that modern religious life was made subservient to the great war against nature, and we’ve explored some of the changes that will likely take place as a religious sensibility that seeks salvation from nature gives way to a different sensibility that sees nature as something to celebrate, not to escape. A similar analysis could be applied to any other aspect of modern culture you care to name, but there are other things I plan to discuss on this blog, so those topics will have to wait for someone else to tackle them. Still, there’s one more detail that deserves wrapping up before we leave the discussion of the end of progress, and that’s the future of science. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Since 1605, when Sir Francis Bacon’s <i>The Advancement of Learning</i> sketched out the first<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>rough draft of modern scientific practice, the collection of activities we now call science has been deeply entangled with the fantasy of conquering nature. That phrase “the collection of activities we now call science” is as unavoidable here as it is awkward, because science as we now know it didn’t exist at that time, and the word “science” had a different meaning in Bacon’s era than it does today. Back then, it meant any organized body of knowledge; people in the 17th century could thus describe theology as “the queen of the sciences,” as their ancestors had done for most of a thousand years, without any sense of absurdity. The word “scientist” didn’t come along until the mid-19th century, long after “science” had something like its modern meaning; much before then, it would have sounded as silly as “learningist” or “knowledgist,” which is roughly what it would have meant, too.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To Francis Bacon, though, the knowledge and learning that counted was the kind that would enable human beings to control nature. His successors in the early scientific revolution, the men who founded the Royal Society and its equivalents in other European countries, shared the same vision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Royal Society’s motto,
<i>Nullius in Verba</i> (“nothing in words”), signified its rejection of literary and other humanistic studies in favor of the quest for knowledge of, and power over, the nonhuman world.The crucial breakthrough—the leap to quantification—was a done deal before the Royal Society was founded in 1661; when Galileo thought of defining speed as a measurable quantity rather than a quality, he kickstarted an extraordinary revolution in human thought. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Quantitative measurement, experimental testing, and public circulation of the results of research: those were the core innovations that made modern science possible. The dream of conquering nature, though, was what made modern science the focus of so large a fraction of the Western world’s energies and ambitions over the last three hundred years. The role of the myth wasn’t minor, or accidental; I would argue, in fact, that nothing like modern science would have emerged at all if the craving for mastery over the nonhuman world hadn’t caught fire in the collective imagination of the Western world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I mentioned last week that Carl Sagan devoted a passage in the book version of <i>Cosmos</i> to wondering why the Greeks and Romans didn’t have a scientific revolution of their own. The reason was actually quite simple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Greeks and Romans, even when their own age of reason had reached its zenith of intellectual arrogance, never imagined that the rest of the universe could be made subordinate to human beings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Believers in the traditional religions of the time saw the universe as the property of gods who delighted in punishing human arrogance; believers in the rationalist philosophies that partly supplanted those traditional religions rewrote the same concept in naturalistic terms, and saw the cosmos as the enduring reality to whose laws and processes mortals had to adapt themselves or suffer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What we now think of as science was, in Greek and Roman times, a branch of philosophy, and it was practiced primarily to evoke feelings of wonder and awe at a cosmos in which human beings had their own proper and far from exalted place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It took the emergence of a new religious sensibility, one that saw the material universe as a trap from which humanity had to extricate itself, to make the conquest of nature thinkable as a human goal. To the Christians of the Middle Ages, the world, the flesh, and the devil were the three obnoxious realities from which religion promised to save humanity. To believers in progress in the post-Christian west, the idea that the world was in some sense the enemy of the Christian believer, to be conquered by faith in Christ, easily morphed into the idea that the same world was the enemy of humanity, to be conquered in a very different sense by faith in progress empowered by science and technology. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The overwhelming power that science and technology gave to the civil religion of progress, though, was made possible by the fantastic energy surplus provided by cheap and highly concentrated fossil fuels. That’s the unmentioned reality behind all that pompous drivel about humanity’s dominion over nature: we figured out how to break into planetary reserves of fossil sunlight laid down over half a billion years of geological time, burnt through most of it in three centuries of thoughtless extravagance, and credited the resulting boom to our own supposed greatness. Lacking that treasure of concentrated energy, which humanity did nothing to create, the dream of conquering nature might never have gotten traction at all; as the modern western world’s age of reason dawned, there were other ideologies and nascent civil religions in the running to replace Christianity, and it was only the immense economic and military payoffs made possible by a fossil-fueled industrial revolution that allowed the civil religion of progress to elbow aside the competition and rise to its present dominance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As fossil fuel reserves deplete at an ever more rapid pace, and have to be replaced by more costly and less abundant substitutes, the most basic precondition for faith in progress is going away. These days, ongoing development in a handful of fields has to be balanced against stagnation in most others and, more crucially still, against an accelerating curve of economic decline that is making the products of science and technology increasingly inaccessible to those outside the narrowing circle of the well-to-do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s indicative that while the media babbles about the latest strides in space tourism for the very rich, rural counties across the United States are letting their roads revert to gravel because the price of asphalt has soared so high that the funds to pay for paving simply aren’t there any more. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In that contrast, the shape of our future comes into sight. As the torrents of cheap energy that powered industrial society’s heyday slow to a trickle, the arrangements that once put the products of science and technology in ordinary households are coming apart. That’s not a fast process, or a straightforward one; different technologies are being affected at different rates, so that (for example) plenty of Americans who can’t afford health care or heating fuel in the winter still have cell phones and internet access; still, as the struggle to maintain fossil fuel production consumes a growing fraction of the industrial world’s resources and capital, more and more of what used to count as a normal lifestyle in the industrial world is becoming less and less accessible to more and more people. In the process, the collective consensus that once directed prestige and funds to scientific research is slowly trickling away. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That will almost certainly mean the end of institutional science as it presently exists. It need not mean the end of science, and a weighty volume published to much fanfare and even more incomprehension a little more than a decade ago may just point to a way ahead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m not sure how many of my readers were paying attention when archetypal computer geek Stephen Wolfram published his 1,264-page opus
<i>A New Kind of Science</i> back in 2002. In the 1980s, Wolfram published a series of papers about the behavior of cellular automata—computer programs that produce visual patterns based on a set of very simple rules. Then the papers stopped appearing, but<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>rumors spread through odd corners of the computer science world that he was working on some vast project along the same lines. The rumors proved to be true; the vast project, the book just named, appeared on bookstore shelves all over the country; reviews covered the entire spectrum from rapturous praise to condemnation, though most of them also gave the distinct impression that their authors really didn’t quite understand what Wolfram was talking about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shortly thereafter, the entire affair was elbowed out of the headlines by something else, and Wolfram’s book sank back out of public view—though I understand that it’s still much read in those rarefied academic circles in which cellular automata are objects of high importance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Wolfram’s book, though, was not aimed at rarefied academic circles. It was trying to communicate a discovery that, so Wolfram believed, has the potential to revolutionize a great many fields of science, philosophy, and culture. Whether he was right is a complex issue—I tend to think he’s on to something of huge importance, for reasons I’ll explain in a bit—but it’s actually less important than the method that he used to get there. With a clarity unfortunately rare in the sciences these days, he spelled out the key to his method early on in his book: </div>
<blockquote class=tr_bq>
In our everyday experience with computers, the programs that we encounter are normally set up to perform very definite tasks. But the key idea I had nearly twenty years ago—and that eventually led to the whole new kind of science in this book—was to ask what happens if one instead just looks at simple arbitrarily chosen programs, created without any specific task in mind. How do such programs typically behave? (Wolfram 2002, p. 23)</blockquote>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice the distinction here. Ordinarily, computer programs are designed to obey some human desire, whether that desire involves editing a document, sending an email, viewing pictures of people with their clothes off, snooping on people who are viewing pictures of people with their clothes off, or what have you. That’s the heritage of science as a quest for power over nature: like all other machines, computers are there to do what human beings tell them to do, and so computer science tends to focus on finding ways to make computers do more things that human beings want them to do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That same logic pervades many fields of contemporary science. The central role of experiment in scientific practice tends to foster that, by directing attention away from what whole systems do when they’re left alone, and toward what they do when experimenters tinker with them. Too often, the result is that scientists end up studying the effects of their own manipulations to the exclusion of anything else. Consider Skinnerian behaviorism, an immensely detailed theory that can successfully predict the behavior of rats in the wholly arbitrary setting of a Skinner box and essentially nothing else!</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The alternative is to observe whole systems on their own terms—to study what they do, not in response to a controlled experimental stimulus, but in response to the normal interplay between their internal dynamics and the environment around them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That’s what Wolfram did. He ran cellular automata, not to try to make them do this thing or that, but to understand the internal logic that determines what they do when left to themselves. What he discovered, to summarize well over a thousand pages of text in a brief phrase, is that cellular automata with extremely simple operating rules are capable of generating patterns as complex, richly textured, and blended of apparent order and apparent randomness, as the world of nature itself. Wolfram explains the relevance of that discovery: </div>
<blockquote class=tr_bq>
Three centuries ago science was transformed by the dramatic new idea that rules based on mathematical equations could be used to describe the natural world. My purpose in this book is to initiate another such transformation, and to introduce a new kind of science that is based on the much more general types of rules that can be embodied in simple computer programs. (Wolfram 2002, p. 1)</blockquote>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One crucial point here, to my mind, is the recognition that mathematical equations in science are simply models used to approximate natural processes. There’s been an enormous amount of confusion around that point, going all the way back to the ancient Pythagoreans, whose discoveries of the mathematical structures within musical tones, the movement of the planets, and the like led them to postulate that numbers comprised the <i>arche</i>, the enduring reality of which the changing world of our experience is but a transitory reflection. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This confusion between the model and the thing modeled, between the symbol and the symbolized, is pandemic in modern thinking. Consider all the handwaving around the way that light seems to behave like a particle when subjected to one set of experiments, and like a wave when put through a different set. Plenty of people who should know better treat this as a paradox, when it’s nothing of the kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Light isn’t a wave or a particle, any more than the elephant investigated by the blind men in the famous story is a wall, a pillar, a rope, or what have you; “particle” and “wave” are models derived from human sensory experience that we apply to fit our minds around some aspects of the way that light behaves, and that’s all they are. They’re useful, in other words, rather than true. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus mathematical equations provide one set of models that can be used to fit our minds around some of the ways the universe behaves. Wolfram’s discovery is that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>another set of models can be derived from very simple rule-based processes of the kind that make cellular automata work. This additional set of models makes sense of features of the universe that mathematical models don’t handle well—for example, the generation of complexity from very simple initial rules and conditions. The effectiveness of Wolfram’s models doesn’t show that the universe is composed of cellular automata, any more than the effectiveness of mathematical models shows that the Pythagoreans were right and the cosmos is actually made out of numbers. Rather, cellular automata and mathematical equations relate to nature the way that particles and waves relate to light: two sets of mental models that allow the brains of some far from omniscient social primates to make sense of the behavior of different aspects of a phenomenon complex enough to transcend all models. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It requires an unfashionable degree of intellectual modesty to accept that the map is not the territory, that the scientific model is merely a representation of some aspects of the reality it tries to describe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It takes even more of the same unpopular quality to back off a bit from trying to understand nature by trying to force it to jump through hoops, in the manner of too much contemporary experimentation, and turn more attention instead to the systematic observation of what whole systems do on their own terms, in their own normal environments, along the lines of Wolfram’s work. Still, I’d like to suggest that both those steps are crucial to any attempt to keep science going as a living tradition in a future when the attempt to conquer nature will have ended in nature’s unconditional victory. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A huge proportion of the failures of our age, after all, unfold precisely from the inability of most modern thinkers to pay attention to
<a href=../../2013/06/what-actually-happens.html>what actually happens</a> when that conflicts with cherished fantasies of human entitlement and importance. It’s because so much modern economic thought fixates on what people would like to believe about money and the exchange of wealth, rather than paying attention to what happens in the real world that includes these things, that predictions by economists generally amount to bad jokes at society’s expense; it’s because next to nobody thinks through the implications of the laws of thermodynamics, the power laws that apply to fossil fuel deposits, and the energy cost of extracting energy from any source, that so much meretricious twaddle about “limitless new energy resources” gets splashed around so freely by people who ought to know better. For that matter, the ever-popular claim that we’re all going to die by some arbitrary date in the near future, and therefore don’t have to change the way we’re living now, gets what justification it has from a consistent refusal on the part of believers to check their prophecies of imminent doom against relevant scientific findings, on the one hand, or the last three thousand years of failed apocalyptic predictions on the other. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The sort of science that Wolfram has proposed offers one way out of that overfamiliar trap. Ironically, his “new kind of science” is in one sense a very old kind of science. Long before Sir Francis Bacon set pen to paper and began to sketch out a vision of scientific progress centered on the attempt to subject the entire universe to the human will and intellect, many of the activities we now call science were already being practiced in a range of formal and informal ways, and both of the characteristics I’ve highlighted above—a recognition that scientific models are simply human mental approximations of nature, and a focus on systematic observation of what actually happens—were far more often than not central to the way these activities were done in earlier ages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The old Pythagoreans themselves got their mathematical knowledge by the same kind of careful attention to the way numbers behave that Wolfram applied two and a half millennia later to simple computer programs, just as Charles Darwin worked his way to the theory of evolution by patiently studying the way living things vary from generation to generation, and the founders of ecology laid the foundations of a science of whole systems by systematically observing how living things behave in their own natural settings. That’s very often how revolutions in scientific fundamentals get started, and whether Wolfram’s particular approach is as revolutionary as he believes—I’m inclined to think that it is, though I’m not a specialist in the field—I’ve come to think that a general revision of science, a “Great Instauration” as Sir Francis Bacon called it, will be one of the great tasks of the age that follows ours. </div>

I'm just wondering if you think humanity's dislike of humans is a manifestation of the desire to conquer nature or is it just human nature asserting itself as the limits of nature confront 7 billion people jostling for the same resources? Or is this dislike of humanity a symptom of both the desire to conquer nature but also a dawning realisation that while we can do much damage, and exterminate many other creatures, we are finally meeting a cosmic sized but delimiting nature that might not just be too tameable afterall?<br><br>There was a conference recently in Edinburgh, Scotland whose sole topic was how society could privatise nature and turn all natural features, like the air we breath, into cash generating streams of income.

For example, my undergraduate adviser in Geology once remarked, somewhat derisively, that "psychology is trying very hard to be a science, and one of these days, it will get there." I later dated one psychologist and married another, and decided that "one of these days" had arrived; research psychology is indeed a science as other scientists understand it.<br><br>The same thing has happened to anthropology, although the cultural anthropologists are resisting, much to the dismay of the archeologists and physical anthropologists, who whole-heartedly embrace being scientists, and is moving through sociology. Economics would be next, except, as you noted, there is too much wishful thinking going on in that field to make it a science as the scientists themselves understand it.<br><br>Of course, any conquest would be resisted. Watson described one such effort by the French philosophers, who decided to combat the materialism of the German and Anglophone scientists by turning to their own materialism. Instead of following Darwin, they turned to two of the other great minds of the 19th Century, Marx and Freud, to combat Scientism. Too bad, as Watson remarked, that Marx and Freud were wrong.<br><br>You probably wouldn't be surprised by this development. As you've noted, anti-religions accept the premises of their intellectual adversaries, but invert their values. The French were no different in developing their own materialism instead of trying to build a spiritual alternative. Then again, I don't find Anouilh's ennui expressed as Existentialism very comforting, so maybe it's for the best they didn't try.<br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c1486758028405663872 title="comment permalink">12/18/13, 9:31 PM</a><br><br>

If we abandon that course, then what, exactly, is the <i>point</i> of science?<br><br>As you note, the very high civilizations of the Romans, the Greeks, the Chinese, the Mayans, etc. didn't have what we call "science."

It's a somewhat sketchy belief at best, and grows even murkier as both science and technology rise on the curve of diminishing returns. Whatever truth the belief had in the past, it will certainly have less truth in the future.<br><br>There's a common belief that science begets a deeper and truer understanding of the universe, and that this is a good thing. The second is debatable -- the first is simply nonsense. A little over a century ago, space had three dimensions, the universe was infinite in extent and filled with "luminiferous ether," atomic nuclei were indivisible, and time was absolute. Space now has between four and ten dimensions, the universe is expanding from a primordial Big Bang and is filled with a sea of virtual particles and invisible "dark" matter and energy, atomic nuclei are decidedly divisible, and time is as stretchy as a rubber-band. I've recently read of a new theory that our space-time is some kind of holographic projection arising from a lower-dimensional universe with perhaps as little as one "real" dimension.<br><br>How many left-handed quarks can dance on the head of a pin?<br><br>Absent a drive to conquer nature, with diminishing practical returns on investment in science, and with every new theory winging off into Alice's Wonderland, what is the point of science?<br><br>Observation of nature as-it-is, yes.

Do you really think quantum field theorists believe that predicting the Higgs boson will grant them power over nature? They know perfectly well that theoretical physics at the sub-sub-nuclear scale has no practical relevance. You have to build a 30km long accelerator to even watch the things as they self-destruct. <br><br>When Einstein published E=mc^2, he didn't think it had any earthly application. Not enough was known at the time about the nucleus to suggest otherwise. In fact one of Einstein's other papers in that year had finally given convincing evidence that atoms actually exist, so it was too early to think about what might happen if someone came along and started splitting them. <br><br>My point is that motivations can vary a lot, but most great scientists are driven by intense curiosity and a desire to figure out some of Nature's secrets. Is that conquest? I don't know. <br><br>However, there is no doubt that the reason scientists have been given great resources by governments is because governments think they need to do so to either conquer someone/something or to avoid being that someone.<br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c1915401917485085264 title="comment permalink">12/19/13, 12:20 AM</a><br><br>

The more I bring a conceptual layer of ideas and measurement to my experience, the less in touch with reality I am.

A couple of recent experiences to illustrate:<br><br>Although I'm not a scientist, I have spent the last few years working with academic researchers on a large computer science project. In observing scientists in action there did seem to be a tendency to cling to ideas and suppositions, often in the face of mounting contrary evidence from testing and analysis. This seemed especially true the more hat funding and professional reputation was on the line. This particular research project went on 5 years. Common sense intuition could tell what the results were going to be after 12 months. We took another 48 months to fully test and document that same early insight. This seemed a little pointless to me, but seemed just fine to the scientists who believed that since the early idea was now proven with data it could now be considered true and worthy of publication. Until then it was just a fluffy-headed hypothesis.<br><br>In a related vein, my wife has been working on solving some health problems that have plagued her for years. She has finally done it with herbs and diet, after many unsuccessful traditional medical interventions including a couple of surgeries. Basically, she got in touch with her own body, consulted a naturopath, followed her experience and intuition, adjusted her diet and went with what worked.

Just because there are a wide range of speculations about the dimensionality of space-time does not mean we know less than a century ago.

Irving Yalom, a famous psychologist and group moderator, commented that “the scientific quantifiability of [mental health] data was directly correlated with its triviality”. <br>As a mental health counselor, I have observed that the best practitioners, no matter what their specific degree or title, act as artisans or craftspeople; they understand the concrete principles of their job, but there is also an artistry and a respect for the unquantifiable aspects of the relationship that makes for good psychotherapy. Carl Rogers, considered the father of humanistic, client-centered psychology, described the three core conditions for effective therapy: genuineness, unconditional positive regard, and empathetic understanding. These conditions are widely accepted, and their results well-documented. A meta-study of research articles strongly supports the view that the strength of the therapeutic relationship is the greatest factor in successful therapy, and Carl Roger’s core conditions are all about the relationship. The short of it is that they work. The thing that frustrates the more “scientific-minded” researchers (and not a few of my professors) is that they aren’t sure exactly why the core conditions work, and they can’t quantify them “properly” for “real research”. Even my professors, when we came to Carl Rogers, would encourage us to be genuine, accepting, and empathetic, but wouldn’t really explain how to do that (there aren’t many quantifiable techniques for being a kind, genuine, empathetic person) and wouldn’t really mention it again (As a funny side note, we spent more time with Skinner – a lot more “data” to talk about, and some “concrete” mental models to discuss).<br><br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c739449567291697685 title="comment permalink">12/19/13, 6:48 AM</a><br><br>

I enjoyed this essay very much. I have a couple things I'll toss into the mix. <br><br>One is that the conquering of nature is one way of looking at science. But some of what you write of is, as I am sure you know, engineering and not science. At some point the distinction can get subtle as I know all too well. But one of the driving motivations of many engineers, including myself, is not necessarily to conquer nature as it is to build things. <br><br>There is a drive in so many of us to design, build, and operate tools, machines, buildings, etc. I suspect many of us would have been carpenters and blacksmiths and wheelwrights stone masons and whathaveyou not too many centuries ago. I would wonder if this drive to be, for want of a better term, craftsmen is not an inheritance from our long history where the ability to manufacture a useful tool could be a huge advantage in tough survival situations. <br><br>There was a high price that was paid when the engineering profession allowed its highest degree to be changed from a Dr of Engineering to a Doctor of Philosophy. The difference is subtle and at the same time massive. If the future holds what you describe then I would not be a bit surprised to see that switch reversed. <br><br>And ~that~ would be my offering for today. That the difference between a Doctor of Engineering and a Doctor of Philosophy in ~whatever~ Engineering is also the difference in what would be useful in the future you describe versus what fits into the economy of today. <br><br>Best wishes to you over the holidays Brother. <br><br>Will<br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c8073072990930110437 title="comment permalink">12/19/13, 7:31 AM</a><br><br>

Later others make up rules to explain what is going on inside the system (Maxwell's equations, etc.). These explanations help to further develop the higher level technology. Eventually technologists are way beyond scientific theories in their own world of practical problems(high level elctronics, etc.) developing a parallel science of equal value with all sorts of engineering rules. Engineering is not just applied science. Technologists are groping to get newer, better, faster or just different effects from materials and mostly as long as it works theory of why does not matter but they have learned that as tech has developed faster and faster that they have to make their own theoretical knowledge base to accelerate the process. Still, all that matters is results. Scientists can stay in ivory towers (see aristotle and quantum theorists) if they want but an engineer has to live in the real world. <br><br>To pay due respect to a common set of internet acquaintances I would like to say that The Oil Drum was therefore so important for building a basis for resource shortage concept as engineers are reality based and when empty talk runs out (economists explanations of reality) and scientists are out in left field doing their own fantasy thing that engineers do the heavy lifting turning a good idea into a useful product. Almost anything can be true, cool but not neccessarily marketable, profitable, acceptable, financable, etc. Peak oil was this idea from the TOD crowd.<br><br>Our limits are now defined more and more by CO2 output of cars, low energy consumption electrical devices, recyclability. This recalls to me all those 70s green ideas you'Ve discussed and the alternative agronomy nowadays. <br><br>Reality(and resulting theory thereof, e.g. religion or science) is relative to who we are, what we need, where(and when) we live(local environment). Without fossil fuels our current scientific theory would not have come about as it is mere explanation of what was happening in the world of high energy technology in scientific theory about physics, electricity, etc. Most of chemistry started with getting color dyes and pharmaceuticals from coal tars in 19th century germany. <br><br>If we stopped science(attempts at explanation of current observable tech) before we had access to coal we would have stayed with wood based coals then steel making would have remained primitive and also our scientific instruments as well and electrics and chmeicals and pharma would be nonexistent as well as faster than horse travel and telecoms.<br><br>In short you can only explain what you see and can test. Everything else is speculation. This is why moderns consider themselves above religion as religion is based on "myth" or childlike "just-so- stories". Mapping the universe, DNS, etc. needs massive fossil fuel reserves. Ignorance was bliss for us earlier primitives and the modern sleep of reason breeds Frankenstein monsters. <br><br>If Siddha powers are real then in trance one can perhaps perceive the double ohelix or chemical structures in one's own body but utilize this on an industrial scale - no way. Perhaps bilocation and other such miracles of Jesus but not for the masses. "Don't try this at home" is valid for the hi-tech here.<br><br>The future of science is like the man moon landing hoax theories. Future generations will refuse to believe what they don't see. This is why the bible belt has such pulling power in their anti science bias. Intuitive reality is what an emotional animal - primate with brain or not- likes and a story book religion fits that better than ten thousand page discourse over the nature of nature.<br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c8828725487831251646 title="comment permalink">12/19/13, 8:15 AM</a><br><br>

When I was in college, I knew several professors who had been ardent Skinnerians during the heyday of the movement -- one of them had built a Skinner box for his infant son in order to do experiments on the kid -- and, having recanted, were able to describe in detail the failings in Skinner's methods. My response to the critiques was certainly shaped by their discussions. <br><br>August, exactly! One of the big points of contention between Galileo and the Catholic church was that the Church insisted that mathematical models of celestial phenomena needed to be treated purely as models, while Galileo insisted that his model was the literal truth about the heavens. <br><br>Pinku, oh, granted. Thing is, it's simplistic to claim that Marx and Freud were wrong -- or, for that matter, that Darwin is right. All three offer models of the universe of human experience, which are applicable to certain phenomena and inapplicable to others. The triumphalism that insists that a theory is true because it happened to win out over the others is a real barrier to understanding. <br><br>Joseph, good. You're grappling with the issues involved here. I'd point out that classical logic went through the same crisis of faith -- if the whole world can't be explained by logic, what is logic good for? -- and the answer turned out to be that, first, it's a very useful tool for solving certain kinds of problems, and second, learning and practicing it has positive effects on those who do it. Just as practicing a martial art, say, has value even if you never get into a serious hand-to-hand fight outside of the dojo, practicing logic -- or science -- is a healthy discipline for the mind. <br><br>Alexey, I think you've missed Wolfram's central point, which is that arbitrary systems with very simple rules very readily mimic core aspects of nature <i>even when the systems haven't been designed to mimic nature</i>. Of course Wolfram's models aren't models of specific mathematical processes -- but neither are the various branches of pure mathematics, and yet those provide the models through which physical scientists pick and choose to find analogues to natural processes. <br><br>Richard, it's subtler than that. Take an absurdly simple set of rules for turning squares black or white in a grid, set it up under the right conditions, and processes analogous to growth, evolution, crystallization, etc. emerge spontaneously from the interactions of the whole system. Nothing flows into it -- the system itself, despite its apparently mindless simplicity, becomes a generator of astonishing complexity. <br><br>Christian, yes, I read it a couple of years after it first came out. I have to say I wasn't impressed -- it seemed simplistic to me. <br><br>Raven, "a telos for Talos" wins you today's gold star. Good!<br><br>Phil, bingo. There are times when I'd like to translate <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> as "reductionism always ends in absurdity."<br><br>Yupped, exactly. Science has become a prisoner of its own relative success, and more to the point, of the personal advantage of its practitioners. That's common enough in human institutions, of course, just as it's common for such institutions to keep on proclaiming their own infallibility in the face of a growing body of evidence to the contrary. <br><br>Unknown, fair enough -- I'll always accept a grammatical correction. <br><br>M, I see that sort of thing all the time. I've come to think that the lag time between when an ideology stops working and when its believers finally notice that it's stopped working is one of the least recognized and most important factors in history.<br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c1691113296820102453 title="comment permalink">12/19/13, 11:03 AM</a><br><br>

I don't think that cellular automats can mimic core aspects of nature from PRACTICAL point of view. <br><br>I'll try to clarify. If I take physical theory of optics, melt some sand and apply some brain work and hand polishing I can construct a telescope or glasses. Telescope is hugely helpful for the military, glasses for the eldery. Notice that without the theory of optics I am unable by trial and error construct such complicated objects, though the technology is bronze age maximum. <br><br>For me this is the core value of science: ability to make very useful things, that cannot be done without deep theoretical understanding of nature.<br><br>May be I lack imagination, but I don't see how the output of cellular automats theory can be applied to construct anything usefull. Going to absurdity: How one can construct glasses using cellular automats?<br><br>As for other aspects, I agree with you.

In other words, something like:<br><br>Imagine a vast number of villages, with paths between them, these paths being used by runners to exchange messages. The villagers all speak the same language--English, Klingon, whatever, the language is not important. What is important is that for any message exchanged between the villages, it must be written down, and must be written down with the letters of the words reversed: "good day" is written "doog yad", and then a runner delivers that message to the next village. Therein, the translator Olef Byteswapson reads the message, "doog yad", and announces to his village that the other village has said "good day". They all agree that this is so, and send back the reply--"dna doog yad ot uoy sa llew"--and then a runner carries this reply to the original village. Therein, the counterpart to Olef, another byte swapper, reads the message, and announces to her village the reply thus previously stated. And so it goes.<br><br>How did this state of affairs come to be? Well, back in the day, "doog yad" was the actual language, as spoken between the few big castles and towers of the land. There were also some little villages, but they did not speak with anyone, at least not yet, and they spoke using the "good day" form. Now eventually the towers and castles went away, or anyways became much less important, while the little villages multiplied, and yet the same tradition of speaking in the manner of the big castles and towers carried on, at least when exchanging messages between places.<br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c1983901758290898350 title="comment permalink">12/19/13, 12:46 PM</a><br><br>

I have no problem with that. In that sense, doing science can be viewed as something like art, or at least recreation.<br><br>That also places science back in the realm of wonder, since the use of the scientific method isn't intended to yield anything but beautiful (human) abstractions based on nature. Like forms in poetry, there are rules, and your abstractions have to follow the rules, or they stray from "science" into "fantasy." But both science and fantasy are then on a more-or-less equal footing, following different rules. We can argue whether the sonnet (one set of rules) is better than the heroic ballad (a different set of rules), but it's an aesthetic argument.<br><br>It raises the question of how much human resource we're going to devote to this. Perhaps quite a lot. In post-Renaissance Europe, a great deal of human resource was devoted to the arts: sculpture, painting, music, poetry. Most civilizations have been very fond of entirely impractical (but imposing and beautiful) architecture. Science can certainly fit as art.

"Middlebrow megachurch infotainment" is a brilliant coinage; clearly I have to catch up with this guy's writings. <br><br>Adam, exactly.

I'd point out, though, that Roman and Chinese engineers (among many others) accomplished impressive technical feats without any sense that they were in the business of conquering nature; doubtless the engineers of future ecotechnic societies, as they tighten the screws on renewable-energy technologies we can't even imagine yet, will be equally free of the delusion that nature exists so humanity can tell it what to do. <br><br>Ed, and that's exactly why -- or one of the reasons why -- I'm so concerned about making sure that science survives as a living tradition. If people still know how to ask nature questions and get replicable answers, it's less likely that the achievements of the present age will turn into the fairy tales of the far future. <br><br>Karl, excellent! Many thanks for the links. <br><br>Kyoto, and a happy solstice to you, too! To my mind, the problem with the current climate debate is precisely that nobody's interested in asking what actually happens -- a subject about which paleoclimatology has a lot to say -- because the answers to that question advance nobody's agenda. <br><br>David, yes, that's fair enough -- it makes sense of things to me that other forms of thinking don't. I suspect the reason I find Wolfram's work fascinating is that his cellular automata are morphologically equivalent to a great many other things in nature, and can be understood in similar ways. <br><br>Robo, Wolfram got there well ahead of you.

But it is a matter of faith -- specifically, faith in progress -- that science is leading in any particular direction, such as "toward a deeper and truer understanding" of the universe. I brought up the profound difference between 19th century cosmology and 21st century cosmology as one illustration of this.<br><br>You say you believe that we know more now than we did in the past, but I would respond (as in the old Lone Ranger joke), "Who 'we', white man?"<br><br>I suspect that *I* know a bit more about celestial mechanics than your average iron-age Druid.

A good example of this in action has been the disastrous consequences of trying to put neo-liberal economic policies and neo-conservative foreign policies into action.

That sort of thing is very difficult to do without the kind of elaborate infrastructure possible in a fossil fueled industrial economy. Still, given the importance of weaponry and military defense, especially given the rising tide of violence and disorder that the breakdown of the modern world will produce, I would imagine this will be a very high priority for national governments, warlords and the like. <br><br>I don’t expect firearms to go away entirely, but it’s a good question what the highest feasible level of firearms technology will be in an ecotechnic society. Will it be automatic weapons, bolt-action rifles, rifled muskets or flintlocks? Societies that retain or can re-discover the ability to make assault rifles and machine guns could have a decisive military advantage over those that can only make bolt-action rifles, muskets or crossbows. Incidentally, Russia could have a major head start in this category since its modern firearms like the AK series assault rifles and PK series machine guns are simple, rugged and very reliable. That’s one thing I have long respected about Russian weapons designers. They develop weapons that are competitive on the world arms market and effective on the battlefield, but are designed to be simple, cheap and easy to maintain and operate. This is true whether we are talking about the T-34 tank, the AK-47 rifle or Sukhoi fighter jets.<br><br>I recall we had an extended discussion thread on this very subject a while back on the Archdruid Report, but can’t remember which essays.

The heat has kept me inside the house.<br><br>Quote: "understand the internal logic that determines what they do when left to themselves."<br><br>Yeah, this is exactly the process that I follow here when trying to provide optimal conditions for the living systems (chooks, bees, fruit trees, vegetables, herbs and wildlife). Following this methodology is easier and less work really than tinkering with the systems all of the time. It is just slower and requires more resources.<br><br>The bees are a really good example. I've set them up and just observe what they do and try to get a feel for their cycles - if left to their own devices in optimal conditions (they're pretty happy at the moment with all of the flowers here).<br><br>Most of the advice and books for bees is geared towards maximum / efficient production. Very little advice and practice is geared towards resiliency of the colony. It is little wonder that colony collapse disorder is so widespread. Such a moniker is really another name for: water stress, food stress, predators, disease, environmental stress and finally my favourite - relocation stress. It is hardly any wonder why bees have such a hard time of it across the planet!<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c3744548578937571924 title="comment permalink">12/19/13, 5:44 PM</a><br><br>

Fascinating stuff.<br><br>Some years ago, I embarked on an interactive art project, a major component of which was the simulation of waves moving on the surface of a body of water.<br><br>It turns out that cellular automata is rather well-suited to this end. The math is simple, and requires no calculus, to my continuing amazement. Further, the simulation exhibited realistic refraction and reflection of waves, which confounded me for the longest time, given that the underlying model knows *nothing* of such phenomena. I didn't program it to do that !<br><br>Two things that really stuck with me from that project are how very simple rules can give rise to amazingly complex, beautiful, and utterly unexpected behavior, and how hierchical thinking can literally blind you to other ways of looking at things.

That gets you tonight's gold star. Of course the part of nature that the savants of the Enlightenment were most interested in conquering was human nature. I'm reminded of that quote from <i>Dune</i>: "Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.”<br><br>Raven, ah, you saw that, too? The fracking bubble is losing air, so of course the next excuse for ignoring peak oil is being trotted out. Notice that the promoters are talking excitedly about how this "disproves peak oil" -- which nobody supposedly believes in any more -- and that considerations of net energy are nowhere mentioned. I'll do a post on this latest pond scum ponzi scheme sometime soon. <br><br>SLClaire, good to hear. I'm busy looking through heirloom seed catalogs and planning next year's garden, too -- and yes, close attention to what the garden has had to say is a central part of that. <br><br>Alexey, the same thing was true of mathematics in ancient times, when the basics of geometry and the like were first being worked out. We're a long way from the point at which cellular automata can be used directly to create models for, say, optics; the point Wolfram has made is that there's another potential source for such models, one that very readily duplicates phenomena in nature that have been hard to model using mathematically based formulae. <br><br>JP, the importance of Wolfram's work doesn't preclude the emergence of other ideas that will also be important!<br><br>Thrig, that's a great example of the impact of history on systems. That's a blind spot in many ways of thinking about the world -- many things are what they are, not because of first principles, but because history happened to go careening down one path rather than another. <br><br>Joseph, for the next five centuries or so, if things follow the usual pace, there won't be much in the way of spare resources to devote to anything but survival, which is why practical sciences such as field ecology and agronomy have the best chance of getting the scientific method through to the future. Later on, after the deindustrial dark ages, the possibilities may broaden out more than a bit. <br><br>Jt, you know, if you want your comment to be taken seriously, it would help if you refrained from dragging in irrelevancies. If you'll reread my post, you'll find that neither I nor Wolfram claimed that he invented cellular automata; insisting that there's no conceptual difference between the standard mathematical models used by science and the kind proposed by Wolfram simply shows that you don't know what you're talking about; and whatever may have happened 2000 years ago, the scientific revolution that shaped our present world is the one I've discussed, of course. As for the confusion between models and the reality they represent, please go back and notice just how many self-proclaimed rationalists insist in print that if current theory doesn't provide a mechanism for a given effect (such as the medical consequences of acupuncture), the effect doesn't exist. That's exactly the confusion I'm discussing here, you know. <br><br>Joseph, you're overgeneralizing. I'm sure people who understand logic also get drunk and depressed; nonetheless, it's good training for the mind, and helps evade certain common stupidities. That's all I'm suggesting for science. <br><br>Enrique, exactly! What you've called ideological thinking is a major reason for the crisis we're in -- combine that with the sort of mental blinders that keep people from noticing that their theories do not match the reality on the ground, and you can run a civilization into the ground in very short order!<br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c7240545920519560934 title="comment permalink">12/19/13, 6:46 PM</a><br><br>

So days are filled with 'I want, I want...' and 'Nooooo!'. Eventually we find some degree of acceptance of the world as it is and the frequency of the tantrums decreases.<br><br>Modern science has enabled satisfaction of many desires that were previously unattainable, but the gap between human desires and reality is so huge that it hasn't made much difference. The religion of progress has encouraged many to believe that their desires will be met in the future...and we are on our way to some epic tantrums as reality asserts its preeminence over wishful thinking. <br><br>I guess I see this situation of unmet desires in a world of limited resources as a universal norm. Often it is not just superficial desires but survival needs that are unmet: like enough food to eat or fuel to keep warm. I'll have to think more about your contention that the war against nature is a recent ideology. It seem a bacterium, a tree, and a rabbit all face the same gap between the desires they have evolved which cause them to seek exponential population growth and the reality of their environment which keeps them in some kind of population equilibrium. Bursts of change (like discovery of stored fossil fuel) produce bursts of exponential growth, but the desires are never satisfied and a new equilibrium is eventually reached...maybe after a crash. I guess you are talking about the ideologies that humans develop to rationalize our situation. Maybe the ideology that we should seek to conquer nature is relatively new. The instincts to try to satisfy our desires by manipulating nature seem to be universal and largely unchangable. I guess it is the moral structures we develop for managing our instincts that you are talking about.<br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c5028624525792492170 title="comment permalink">12/20/13, 5:55 AM</a><br><br>

One of the last times I saw her, she told me she'd stopped trying to remember her grandchildren's names at number sixty-three. She had eleven children herself, one of whom was gay and was expelled from the family and community as a Devil's child: when you have eleven, you can afford to throw one or two away.<br><br>We visited them in Idaho, once, and went to a church service on Sunday. One of their shibboleths as a religion was to never, ever see a doctor, for anything whatsoever: it was a loss of faith in God to turn to doctors, and was the difference between salvation and eternal damnation. I remember one fellow in the parish, his nose gone, his face half-eaten by "The Cancer," standing up in church and praising God for the strength that God and his community had granted him to stand up against doctors and rely on <i>faith</i> for his healing.<br><br>These people -- my own shirttail relations -- were as ignorant as dirt regarding science: they held it in worse than contempt, they called it Evil. They weren't especially bright, and were by no means formally educated. Their understanding of Christianity was the most primitive kind of literalism you could imagine, maybe more primitive than you can imagine. Their lives were profoundly rural: wells they dug themselves, cattle and crops they raised themselves, some trade with "outsiders" to their faith, which they did not actually depend upon.<br><br>Yet in two generations, these savages went from "man and wife" to at least sixty three grandchildren. Should the mathematics of their lifestyle continue, a century would see them a thousand-strong. Two centuries would see them a million-strong. Despite the stillbirths, the diphtheria, the cancer, the dotage and senility. Or, at a thousand-strong, the family blood-feuds and wars.<br><br>By contrast, I spent seven of my most formative years intensively studying to be a scientist, with all the traditional liberal-arts trappings. I obviously thought, at the time, that both education and science were in some way important. The profession of scientist lost its cachet for me thirty years ago, but now I'm questioning the premise all the way to bedrock.<br><br>Is there any value, whatsoever, to "science?"

I enjoy the beauty of science as much as anyone.<br><br>Ultimately, science is best at grappling with understanding and solving tasks in the physical world. But as we have seen with nuclear disasters, genetics, surveillance tech, big pharma, and so on, there are always unintended consequences. Science creates more new problems often as much as it solves old ones. Most of the time science does not serve mankind, it serves those who bankroll it, and those guys aren't much interested in service or progress, except the kind that puts more money in their bottom line and more toys for bragging rights among their peers. We don't have enlightened masters who want the good of all (see Runesoup this week too).<br><br>For the poor and untutored, you don't need science or money to outbreed (in Darwinian terms, surpass in success) your neighbors. "Idiocracy" anyone?<br><br>So really, science, in its purest form, is really a belief system, a way of life, an aesthetic practice for the mind/soul/spirit, with practical side benefits. Much like druidry or hermetics or philosophy or the spiritual exercises of Ignatius, or contemplative prayer, or meditation… now it is going off into the bizarre and fantastic as Joseph indicates with these new discoveries. It is a practice of the Mind-Soul, but with material benefits of controversial worth.<br><br>What I see in some of the responses to Joseph's honest struggle is the same kind of thing I get when I mention Peak Oil or Collapse to the uninitiated.

Thank you.<br><br>However, I'm also questioning the generally-assumed causality of science begets technology.<br><br>I'm thinking about a post I recently saw, making an impassioned plea for parents to vaccinate their children, and I thought about the eradication of smallpox.<br><br>Talking about the "conquest of nature" as an inviable philosophy can be taken to the absurd extreme of saying that humans should therefore try to not alter their environment at all (binary thinking), meaning if people can't find an appropriate cave, they have to stand outside and get wet. Every organism on the earth alters its environment in an attempt to live a little easier, and humans are no different. So if we figure out how to eradicate smallpox, I for one am not going to shed any tears over "viral genocide."<br><br>But the smallpox vaccine was developed from cowpox in the late 1700's, and involved simple observation of milkmaids and "Hey, let's try infecting people with cowpox and see if that works as well as when milkmaids catch it accidentally." It worked, so they kept doing it. That, and some political will to violate people's "civil liberties" by vaccinating everyone who came in contact with a smallpox victim, effectively eradicated smallpox.<br><br>No genes were sequenced in this process. There were no double-blind studies. No one understood WHY milkmaids so rarely caught smallpox after they'd had cowpox.<br><br>Malaria eradication in the US has been a similar sort of observe-and-imitate process. It doesn't take much "science" to observe that malaria incidents rise during mosquito season, and all attempts to eliminate malaria are centered around eradicating mosquitos, first by draining swampland, and finally (in the US) by widespread use of DDT.<br><br>You don't need a culture of science to drain swamps.<br><br>I think DDT is a fairly typical example of how science actually interacts with technology. It did require a culture of science to synthesize DDT (1874), but what this did was to create a "playbox" with a bunch of new toys in it, toys that don't occur in nature, toys with completely unknown properties. The insecticidal properties of DDT were not discovered until 1939, and it was only after widespread use that its harmful side effects were discovered and publicized (1972).<br><br>(continued…) <br><br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c3637628846620207556 title="comment permalink">12/22/13, 11:27 AM</a><br><br>

This may contain useful toys. It may contain harmful toys. It will likely contain toys both useful and harmful (e.g. DDT): any toy that doesn't already exist in nature and is useful (i.e., is potent in bringing about some effect) is likely to be very dangerous indeed, because our natural environment will not have feedback mechanisms in place to regulate it.<br><br>The culture of science I was taught considers itself morally neutral: it creates toys indiscriminately, in the name of "knowledge," without any regard to consequences, which it considers "imponderable."<br><br>Viewed from a systems perspective, there are two things that a new toy created by science MUST NOT do: it must not self-replicate, and it must not persist for a long time in a natural environment. <br><br>It seems that every toy that science has created in the latter category has been at best a mixed blessing, from DDT to CRCs to GMOs to nuclear bombs and atomic power, and in the end the harm tends to outweigh the benefit, since the benefit is invariably short-term and short-sighted (e.g. profit or power), while the harm (if any) is by definition long-term.<br><br>We have (fortunately) not been very successful at the former kind of toy. The closest has been the uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction: before the first atomic bomb was tested, there were some calculations that indicated a full atomic detonation would start a nuclear chain reaction in the atmosphere's nitrogen, meaning that the Trinity test had some probability -- based on unknowns -- of incinerating the entire earth.<br><br>But we're working hard now on creating biological chimeras that will reproduce indiscriminately, and we're increasingly inclined to release them into the wind to "see what they'll do."<br><br><i>This</i> is how people play with toys created by science.<br><br>I think there's a fair chance that future generations (humans or corvids), should they come across a repository of information about our age, will shudder and consider our stance of "scientific moral neutrality" to be one of the most criminally negligent and irresponsible things they've ever imagined.<br><br>They will thank their gods that our culture died.<br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c2027332761569720985 title="comment permalink">12/22/13, 11:28 AM</a><br><br>

My answer may be philosophically naive, but I'll offer it anyway.<br><br>When it comes to the physical universe, there is such a thing as truth. It's better to know the truth than to have to guess.<br><br>I went to summer camp as a child, and spent a lot of time staring up at the night sky from my sleeping bag. Away from the suburban light pollution, there were a whole lot more visible stars than at home, almost a different reality.<br><br>I was interested in astronomy, so I knew what stars were, about how far away they were and what the Milky Way is. None of those facts could be deduced from staring at the stars for half an hour at a time with my naked (actually behind glasses correcting for myopia) eyes. The stars appeared and felt cold and mysterious. As a thought experiment, I entertained the idea that I was looking at an opaque hollow sphere randomly pricked with holes through which a great light was shining. That explanation fit what I was seeing equally well.<br><br>The ancient Greeks worked out the shape and size of the Earth from careful observation and geometry. They didn't have the technical means to figure out the true distance of the sun. They didn't know the four states of matter; they didn't know the difference between the fire of an oil lamp and the fire of nuclear fusion. They did not know all the naturally occurring elements and how the elements relate to each other. They did not know that the materials of which the Earth is made were formed in the furnace of our star. They would have liked to have known these things.<br><br>I hold in my mind both a mythical understanding of the sun and moon as divine master and mistress of human life and a scientific understanding of the same. The sun begets the matter and energy in which we have our being; the moon stabilizes the tilt of our planet's axis and governs the tides, providing favorable conditions for the evolution of complex life forms.<br><br>Without science, I would only have the poetic version of the story.<br><br><br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c8778278292799012923 title="comment permalink">12/22/13, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

The proportion of completely non-interesting interactions is similar. And like in most other scientific investigations, the motive to discern most remarkable and potentially <i>productive</i> patterns is just the same friend of pure curiosity. DNA self-assembly algorithms is already an empirical+modeling field of research. Before long, simple rules with <i>useful</i> consequences would be implemented in organizations and what not. First though, functional modes of chaotic phenomena have to be still worked out (if that is a right idea at all).<br><br>Regular scientists are not that hell-bent to <i>subjection of nature</i> - pure curiosity is still their deep motivation. But <i>applicability</i> pressures increased at the universities - and that was not scientists' initiative at all. The centuries-old university institution has been significantly corporatized in the last decades. Scientists are still very well trained in research logic, and it is hard to tell them something new here. But they generally do not wish to bother with interests' games and media circus. Public perceptions of science are predominantly generated by most sponsored fields (like economics, haha) and new management tricks. These are corrupting factors indeed.<br><br>And regarding this called Progress Religion: some political differentiation would be interesting. The liberal types like Carl Sagan do not take progress for granted. Just check <a href=http://www.dailykos.com/ rel=nofollow>liberal community blogs</a>: scientific knowledge meshes with concerns of the civilization course almost daily. Carl Sagan would be concerned today similarly - though most likely ignored or ridiculed in today's media. Who are the real priests of the Progress Religion now? Guys like Thomas Friedmann, Matt Ridley, Malcolm Gladwell - real shills for that "responsible" corporate freedom to act regardless of broad consequences, so deliberately nursed in today's deceptive political economy. This "conservative" tradition derives more directly from Christian insecurities than from liberal fantasies, I guess. In a cynical sense, spreading Progress Religion is a rational strategy now - for those who may indeed know better. Ain't it convenient to keep impressions of cyclic recoveries and inevitable progress constantly present in the collective consciousness, when the things will not really go that direction? Some may not be sure about subjection of nature, but are very confident about managing masses in crisis. That is a less public science, possibly with cellular automata.<br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c5470343440873838655 title="comment permalink">12/23/13, 3:20 AM</a><br><br>

For it is only when science is abstracted from this whole that we suffer its excess and abuse. Though the list of holistic modes of thinking Lance laid out (Druidry, philosophy, meditation, etc.) has not been hugely influential in taming our excesses, human beings are capable of a great deal of political diversity and so other modes and orders are possible, perhaps even ones with some respect for wisdom. Who knows, decline might be a catalyst for change in this direction.<br><br>It is an amusing piece of historical naiveté that Francis Bacon’s proposed utopia (find it his very readable New Atlantis) restricted science to an elite and wise ruling class, somewhat like philosopher kings with slide rules, but without all the irony. The point was to maintain a social order among the masses through the celebration of their material success. (If I remember correctly, the highest praise is given to those with the most offspring! So safe to say the lower classes were not spending time in the lab…) For Bacon, science and technology would be safely managed through wise political philosophy. It is a difficult and troubling path forward from Bacon, through his protégé Hobbes, all the way to our current predicament where political wisdom itself seems naïve. In some ways it represents the path of ideological ascent to Hubbert’s peak.

I'm on-board with that.<br><br>The other, proposed by JMG, is that it is a useful personal mental discipline, which he has compared to formal logic, or to martial arts. I'm not sold on this one yet.<br><br>The science-begets-technology-begets-comfort/wealth/power is commonly accepted, and is the underlying justification for most of the big money poured into science research. I don't buy this: to the extent that this actually works at all, I think it tends to be more harmful than useful, e.g. DDT or CFCs. <br><br>There's another reason for doing science, probably the main reason it's done. Fresh out of graduate school, I landed a position in the R&amp;D division of a privately-held billion-dollar company. After a few years working there, I figured out that we were really an off-the-books division of marketing: our job was to wear lab coats and geek-out high-ranking dignitaries from other companies: we were exotic parakeets, or "bards of the court." Our job was merely to impress -- little else. In other words, doing science is valuable simply because everyone else is doing it, and it is important to "keep up with the Joneses."<br><br>Space race, anyone?

Things like long ships or suits of armor are artifacts of a civilization at its peak, not headed into decline. Medieval Catholic Europe was a civilization in its own right, probably peaking around the Scholastic age in the thirteenth century, then degenerating into the Age of Cathedrals (large, useless monuments to the past) and finally into the debauchery of the Renaissance Popes. It was the decline of the Church that made the Renaissance possible in Italy, and the Protestant movement possible throughout the rest of Europe.<br><br>But I most certainly disagree with the premise that masters of technology preferentially pass on their genes. One of the most prevalent sets of genes throughout Eurasia are the "Genghis Khan" genes, and he didn't boast any technological mastery that I'm aware of. He just got around. A lot.<br><br>@cherokee -- well, yes, people are part of nature, as is what people do, including science. And even in a stable forestland, some fungus may come along with a new chemical defense that gives it a short-term advantage, destabilizes the sere, and wipes out its own environment along with itself and its vaunted new adaptation. I'm not enough of a naturalist to know if or how often this actually happens.<br><br>If it happens to humans, well, it happens. But I reserve the very human right to point fingers and complain mightily as we all go down.

For example, in nutrient and carbon cycling there are simply enormous and basically inaccessible functions with titles like “microbial decomposition” or “mycorrhizal associations,” or “clay complexation” that account for the majority of the action, but are by and large undiscoverable outside highly reductionist and interventionist lab experimentation. How it works in the field is probably beyond our comprehension. One tidbit that blew my mind last term, the clay fraction of a hectare of loam 1 meter deep has a chemically active surface area equivalent to the surface area of the United States! Whoa! Complexity trumps comprehension! And of course, this is just as true in many other fields of study.<br><br>The discovery of complexity through empirical observation followed the discovery of complexity through logical analysis by some 2500 years. But seeing is believing, right? The real question is what is to be done with that discovery? In very broad terms, both eastern and western philosophy use this discovery to inspire a deep and confident humility and love of life and the natural world. At least in the western tradition, the dialectic education of the soul requires a stepwise and egotistical mastery, not unlike the scientific method, to exhaustively prove that mastery itself is neither possible nor ultimately desirable. Practice is not enlightenment, however necessary. And so that is how I return to the question of the value of science. The human soul is by nature curious and deserves to know to the deepest degree possible. Science is an excellent means to this end, but that end does not express the fullness of human potential. For knowledge is not wisdom, however necessary. And so we arrive at the value of philosophy.<br><br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c1449482845691769423 title="comment permalink">12/24/13, 6:50 AM</a><br><br>

Plenty of ancient Greeks, for example, had unmet desires, but they pursued the fulfillment of those desires in a worldview that assigned humanity a strictly limited place in the great scheme of things, and delighted in telling stories about the hideous fates of people who tried to overstep the boundaries assigned to our species. <br><br>Zaphod, I gather you read my blog right after Jim Kunstler's!<br><br>Redoak, exactly.

If you don't think that the practice of scientific thinking has value, that's your personal choice, and can't be gainsaid by anyone else.

Even so, even a broken clock catches a blind mouse, or what have you. <br><br>Roger, I'm not too worried.

Things like long ships or suits of armor are artifacts of a civilization at its peak, not headed into decline.”<br><br>Which brings up the whole question of what we mean when we rather loosely refer to a “civilization”. <br><br>To quote Wikipedia “Civilization … generally refers to state polities which combine these basic institutions: a ceremonial centre (a formal gathering place for social and cultural activities), a system of writing, and a city... divided into social classes with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations”.<br><br>Yet what we often refer to is actually a culture, society or ethnic group, or, more usually some combination of all three.<br><br>I don’t think the Nordic people who built the Long Ships were a civilization, though they certainly were a culture and a society and an ethnic group. Neither, I think, did being near a cultural peak or not come into it: Rather, I suspect, they were a good example of the kind of opportunistic middle power that thrives when there is no Roman style civilization to “control” them. <br><br>And by the way, this kind of society usually seems to be far more inclined to develop new ideas and technologies than the usual run of civilizations, with the notable exception of the nations that arose in Western Europe and China (but that is a different discussion). Probably, I guess, because the Western European civilizations tend:<br>1. To retain many of the primitive features of cultures/ethnic groups.<br>2. To have economic systems and social arrangements in which slavery plays a minor role if any.<br><br>I won’t argue the point on whether some (and only some) Medieval societies were also civilizations, and in which time periods, though I think there is an interesting and prolonged discussion to be had on that one.<br><br>What I will argue is that continual technological, social, artistic and economic innovation preceded, continued through and continued after the Medieval period, including Medieval Catholic Europe. So, you see, I would argue strongly that advances in ships, weapons, society and technology enabled rather than depended on Medieval civilization.<br><br>Whether a particular civilization was peaking or not at a particular time had little to do with it.<br><br>As for: “But I most certainly disagree with the premise that masters of technology preferentially pass on their genes. One of the most prevalent sets of genes throughout Eurasia are the "Genghis Khan" genes, and he didn't boast any technological mastery that I'm aware of. He just got around. A lot.”<br><br>What!!! Genghis Khan didn’t command technology (and lots of related techniques such a military organization and training, governing an empire, integrating foreign knowledge and lots else)??? Come on, read about the guy a bit! <br><br>I mean, he shaped a bunch of nomadic desert herders into a nation and military force that took down the most technologically advanced major power on earth – China. Read about the tactics that annihilated the best Medieval armies, the superb laminated bows that made sniping practical, the light silk armor, the administration developed from scratch that controlled the largest contiguous empire in history.<br><br>You don’t have to make the stuff to command it (I carefully used the word “command”, not master). In fact the investment in skill needed to (a) produce it and (b) use it to best advantage is usually well beyond the capacities of one person: The maker and the user often need to be separate people.<br><br>Oh! And the user is not necessarily the person who commands it, that is often yet a third level, one that requires understanding of the technology, how to use it best, how to manage the users and much else.<br><br>Likewise, it is the successful who pass on their genes and this is exactly what Genghis Khan’s 30 million descendents demonstrate. After all, that is what the whole game is about, and all it is about, at least according to that cruel old witch – Mother Nature.<br><br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c4854136590882063550 title="comment permalink">12/24/13, 8:53 PM</a><br><br>

By the late 1970s, "research on systems equivalent to cellular automata had largely petered out." But then the publication of Wolfram's papers redefined and reinvigorated the field, drawing in many followers—although most of them went off on the wrong tangent or wasted their time on trivial details.<br><br>It didn't happen that way. To begin with, interest in cellular automata did not peter out in the 1970s; it was thriving.

Wolfram took no part in that.

Thank you for another thought-provoking essay. I now have to add Wolfram to my ever-growing "Archdruid Report Reading List."<br><br>I had a few small forays into this kind of science back in the late 1980s as an undergraduate, before leaving it for more "practical" (employable) work.<br><br>My favorite was part of a senior-level math seminar on chaos theory and fractals. The most famous fractal, of course, is the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set%22%22 rel=nofollow>Mandelbrot set</a>. It's a beautiful example of a simple rule yielding amazing complexity. <br><br>The rule, in English rather than as an equation, is this: take any complex number <i>c</i>. Square it, then add <i>c</i> to the result. Square that result and add <i>c</i> again. Repeat this endlessly.<br><br>Now, consider the question: does the value of the result "blow up" (increase without limit) or not? That's the Mandelbrot set - the collection of points that don't blow up when this rule is applied. As the Wikipedia article notes, this yields a distinctive and easily-recognized shape.<br><br>My partner and I had an idea for a project, and asked our professor "What's so special about two as the power? What if we cubed the sum every time? What about arbitrary powers?"<br><br>"I have no idea - what a great question!" was the reply.<br><br>So we wrote a simulation to find out.<br><br>And it turned out that there's a simple relationship between the exponent <i>n</i> in the equation and the overall shape of the set.<br><br>We got our grade for the project, celebrated, and thus ended my one bit of original mathematical research. :)<br><br>I note with both awe and amusement that my smartphone supports, as a toy application, a fractal generator which does in fine detail the same simulation we did crudely on a PC in 1989, and does it in mere seconds rather than the hours we needed. Progress!<br><br>peace,<br>Zach<br><br>P.S.: It seems to me that Christopher Alexander's "Pattern Language" of architecture might be another example of this sort of science.<br><br>P.P.S.: Merry Christmas to all!

Most part of current mathematical models were shaped by esthetical issues. The Plank's formula for the Black body emission was driven by a simple matematical esthetical change ( adding a -1 in the denominator) which in turn made all the previous mathematical but inconsistent descriptions to unificate and , again gave the birth to the quantum concept. <br><br>Plese, don't understimate the incredible success of math in describing nature, because it has surprised so many times the researchers themselves that someone legitimately wondered why the mathematics is SO suspiciously successful to describe nature. <br><br>The probable answer is that nature and mathematics share a common nature, if you pass me the verbal joke. <br>There are some humorous questions that I love to ask to my friends: do the imaginary part of complex numbers really exist? Do the numbers "really" exists by themselves without the human brains? What really make the difference between the existence of God from the existence of a number? <br><br>Are both of them really "tools" to manage real problems of our existence? And why they indeed work? <br><br>These questions are not entirely philosophy or religion or science, they are questions that come from heart and the mind, a spontaneous process. <br><br><br>To go back to the question of science and models, I can confortably say , yes, the matematical models are what they are, models. They come from a particular methodological approach, that is called analysis and synthesis. It worked very well in a awful large part of natural fields. Being a scientific approach, not the science itself, it has its own limits. A lot of scientist have believed that this is the only method available, on account of its success, but it is a illusion. <br><br>I call Analysis and Synthesis the Saruman approach. <br><br>There are obviously other approaches, used in other fields of science. The Holistic approach, for example, is better suited for complex systems, which simply lose their nature if you try to split apart their components in smaller ones. The Holistic approach : I call it the Gandalf approach. <br><br>I used those two Tolkien's characters because they are highly evocative of a human attitude that can drive scientist using the different approach. <br><br>The Saruman approach tend to break things apart to look inside, and is driven by a sort of lack of respect to the thing you are examining. This is particularly true when you are killing living things or people to study them. Indeed you can obtain results using this approach, but you are indeed losing something else that is extremely important in the broader view and in other subtle aspects.<br>The Gandalf approach is infinitely more difficult then the previous, It requires more then mere intellect, but also a great deal of humility, wisdom, patience, and respect, and the results are far less certain or directly useful. Conversely the approach itself has the possibility to reach knowledge simply unreachable to the other approach. <br>And, more important, this knowledge is not driven by the idea of control and conquer. It is more or less a matter of love and interest.<br><br><br><br><a href=an-old-kind-of-science.html#c8983513522875037175 title="comment permalink">12/30/13, 2:05 AM</a><br><br>
