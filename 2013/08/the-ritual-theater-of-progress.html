This habit of drafting my ideas on the future of industrial society right out here in public has its disadvantages, to be sure, but there are benefits as well. One of the more unexpected of these is the way that the illogic that swims through the hidden places of the collective consciousness of our time so often rises to the bait I offer, and thus can be hooked and hauled in for closer examination. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the last few weeks, a fine example of the species has landed in my creel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Back in July, in
<a href=../../2013/07/held-hostage-by-progress.html>an earlier post in this sequence</a> about the ways that the mythology of progress holds both science and religion hostage, I noted that fusion researchers have spent the last fifty years trying not to learn the obvious lesson taught by their repeated failures. Whether or not it’s possible to make a functioning fusion reactor, I pointed out, is immaterial at this point; the last half century of experiments have shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that even if the thing can be done, the cost of building fusion reactors will be so high that fusion will never be economically viable as a source of electricity for the grid. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Before we go on, I’d like to ask everyone to reread that last sentence, and notice that this argument doesn’t claim that fusion reactors are impossible—that, in point of fact, it doesn’t deal at all with the issue of whether fusion power is technically feasible. This may seem like an obvious point, but I can assure you, dear reader, that it’s far from obvious to a good many of my readers. Over the weeks that followed, in fact, I fielded a flurry of comments chiding me for my supposed insistence that harnessing fusion power is impossible. Quite a range of different arguments were deployed in an effort to dispute this point, ranging from the plausible to the frankly silly; the one thing that none of these commenters seem to have noticed is that the claim they were imputing to me is one I hadn’t made. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Longtime readers of this blog will know that this is far from the first time this odd sort of paralogic has featured on the
<i>Archdruid Report</i> comments page. A few years ago, for example, I was rash enough to point out in a post on the future of technology that the internet’s long-term viability in a deindustrializing world will not depend on whether maintaining an internet in such conditions is technically feasible, or whether it can do things that today’s geekoisie consider cool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rather, I suggested, the survival of the internet will depend on whether it can pay for itself in a world where energy and resources will be much more scarce and expensive than they are today, and whether it can compete with other ways of providing the same services that are less dependent on extravagant inputs of depleting resources and complex technological infrastructures. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I found the response to this suggestion utterly fascinating. The commenters who showed up to insist that the internet had to survive the end of the present age of fossil-fueled abundance didn’t dispute my argument; they didn’t mention it at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead, they pretended that the point I’d raised had never been brought into the discussion, and insisted over and over again that keeping the internet viable in a deindustrializing world was technically feasible, that the internet can do all kinds of things that today’s geekoisie consider cool, and that the survival of the internet was therefore certain. Even when I pointed out to them in the comments that they were evading the issue I was raising, they kept on trying to talk about technical feasibility and the cool stuff the internet can do, and to pretend that economic limits had never been mentioned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This went on for three weeks of posts and commentary, until I finally shook my head and went on to the next topic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This sort of paralogic isn’t unique; it isn’t even unusual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Long before I started this blog, I noticed that any question at all about the economic viability of technological progress lies squarely in industrial civilization’s blind spot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Pick any technology that fits the canned image of the future projected by pop culture, and try to talk about whether we can actually afford to pursue it—in most cases, this is a far more crucial question than most people realize, so it’s rarely difficult to find points to raise—and you can count on the identical response. For a long time, I wondered why this particular issue should be subject to such remarkable distortions of thought and conversation; over the course of the last few weeks, as I reflected on the latest round of paralogic in the context of the current series of posts, I think I’ve come to understand the reasons behind it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To make sense of those reasons, it’s going to be necessary to take what will look like a drastic detour, and talk about the role of ritual theater in the world’s religions. I don’t happen to know of a faith on the planet that doesn’t have at least some examples of this very common practice. Modern societies are no exception to the rule; those of my readers who grew up Christian, for example, and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>recall Nativity plays and Easter pageants from their childhoods, already know as much about ritual theater as they’ll need to know to grasp what follows. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Ritual theater doesn’t follow the same rules as the secular drama that’s found in today’s playhouses, cineplexes, and DVD racks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are no surprises in ritual theater, no unexpected plot twists, no unfamiliar characters, and for good reason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The point of ritual theater in a religious context is to enact whatever’s seen as eternally true in the religious tradition that sponsors it. Depending on your religion, what’s eternally true may be revealed in some specific historical event—say, the Buddha beneath the Bo tree or Christ on the cross—or in some recurring natural event—say, the cycle of the seasons—or it may be permanently outside of time, symbolized by myths which “never happened but always are,” as the Greek philosopher Symmachus put it. One way or another, some blend of folk imagination and the creative genius of individuals makes these things visible in ritual theater, which represents (literally, re-presents) the eternal in a form that everyone can experience. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a lot of variation between one religion’s ritual theater and another’s, but within any given tradition, the plot outline and the emotional reactions sought by the performance tend to be as stereotyped as a politician’s campaign speech. Pick any of the early Greek tragedies—these were originally enacted at religious festivals in Athens, and so are classic examples of ritual theater in more senses than one—and you can pretty much count on watching a proud and gifted individual have his life destroyed by the incomprehensible decrees of the gods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That was the structure of ancient Greek ritual drama, and the response, as Aristotle describes it, was an emotional catharsis of pity and terror in which an ancient Greek audience reconciled themselves to their place in the cosmos as mortals subject to the awesome and inscrutable immortals. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It would have been unthinkable to Aeschylus or Sophocles to have a god pop up in the middle of the stage at the climax of the play and fix everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What was utterly inappropriate in the early Greek ritual theater, though, became common in the later secular drama of the classical world, where <i>deus ex machina</i>—literally, the god out of the stage machinery—was so common as to become a catchphrase. Christian ritual theater, which emerged out of late classical drama, proceeded to take that experience as its central theme. What JRR Tolkien in a brilliant essay called “eucatastrophe”—the sudden, shattering reversal that transforms tragedy into triumph—thus became the core experience of Christian ritual theater, passed on via the mystery plays of the Middle Ages straight through to the passion plays and parochial school pageants of the present time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Leap to the other end of the Old World and you’ll find a completely different mode of ritual theater in the Noh drama of Japan. The most common story line among Noh plays has a wandering priest making his way through unfamiliar country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He happens on someone he takes for an ordinary village girl, or some other perfectly natural person. As she sings and dances her story, though, it gradually becomes apparent that she is a supernatural being of some kind—a ghost, a demon, a spirit or a deity—whose destiny the priest may change through his own power and piety, or may simply witness. The whole drama serves to communicate the distinctive religious vision of Japanese folk culture, in which the supernatural shimmers through the apparent solidity of the ordinary world like colors in shot silk. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Civil religions have their own traditions of ritual theater.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here in America, back in the day, school pageants on George Washington’s birthday and civic celebrations on the Fourth of July routinely copied all the standard forms of religious ritual theater, complete with the utterly stereotyped plots and the predictable emotional reactions common throughout the genre. I don’t happen to know whether the Young Communists’ Leagues of the former Eastern Bloc countries did the same sort of pageants for May Day, though I wouldn’t be the least surprised to learn that they did. Tolerably often, though, the ritual theater of civil religions takes a less self-consciously dramatic form, and gets acted out in some facsimile of real life:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>think of the show trials of Stalin’s Russia, in which thousands of people were coerced into acting out the role of wicked dupes of the capitalists, and were then rewarded for their performances with a bullet to the brain. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The civil religion of progress by and large has kept its own ritual theater out of the realm of formal performance, but makes up for this by trying to enact its stereotyped dramas in every possible informal venue. Those of my readers who haven’t been hiding under a rock since the days of Galileo already know the plot of those dramas right down to the finest of details. They begin with a lone genius who shakes himself free of the prejudices and superstitions of the ages, and thus manages to see some part of the world clearly for the first time. The dramatic action emerges out of the conflict between the lone genius and his (or, very rarely, her) less gifted contemporaries, who defend those prejudices and superstitions against the efforts of the genius to upset the applecart of conventional thought. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The plot thus defined includes a few variations, mostly involving the end of the story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The genius may be condemned and killed by the outraged authorities of his time, only to be vindicated and glorified by future generations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He may struggle on gamely to the end of his life, ignored or denounced by all right-thinking people, and then be vindicated and glorified by future generations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Alternatively, he may triumph over the opposition by proving his case conclusively, and having vindicated himself, is then glorified by future generations. In each case, the emotional reaction expected from the audience is the same: identifying themselves with the future generations just mentioned, they are called on to glorify the great heroes of progress, to rejoice in the salvation from the prejudiced and superstitious past that these heroes have conferred on them, and to wait expectantly for the even more wonderful things that future heroes of progress will inevitably bring the world in times to come. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A detail worth special attention here, though, is the debate between the lone genius and his prejudiced and superstitious adversaries that always, explicitly or implicitly, fills the middle act of the drama. There’s no more thoroughly stereotyped scene in the whole field of ritual theater. The adversaries of progress have a set of standard lines assigned to them by the standard plot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They are supposed to point out that whatever idea or technology the lone genius is championing violates the immemorial order of the cosmos or the authoritative teachings of the past, to insist that whatever it is can’t be true or won’t work, and to warn that if the idea is accepted or the technology put into general use, some kind of horrible fate will follow in short order. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The lone genius, in turn, is assigned a set of standard counterarguments to overcome these ceremonial talking points. He is supposed to say that the onward march of human knowledge has rendered the immemorial order of the cosmos and the authoritative teachings of the past obsolete, that whatever innovation he’s championed is true or will work, and that it will bring immense benefits to the human race in the years to come. Both sides recite their parts in the second act, fulfilling the requirements of the script, and in the third act the lone genius triumphs, posthumously or otherwise.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve pointed out already <a href=../../2013/07/on-far-side-of-progress.html>ina previous post in this sequence</a> that this stereotyped script has been pushed onto the history of thought incessantly by the popular culture of our age, even when it’s been necessary to twist history hopelessly out of shape to make it fit the storyline, as it’s usually been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s important to recognize how great a distortion the ritual theater of progress has imposed on our sense of our own past, but it’s at least as important to notice the ways in which the same ritual theater structures debates over technology here and now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The discussions of fusion power and the future of the internet I mentioned earlier are cases in point. The issue I was raising was not one of the ceremonial arguments that the opponents of technology are supposed to utter in the second act of the drama. I broke the rules of the ritual theater of progress, and after a brief interval of consternation, the other actors in the drama did the logical thing and brought out their own ceremonial counterarguments, as though I hadn’t been so silly as to forget my proper lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When I proceeded to break the rules again by drawing attention to the issue I’d actually raised, rather than the one that I was assigned by the script, they got thoroughly flummoxed; some retired in dismay, while others kept on trying to follow their scripts even though I’d gone out and ignored mine. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I can sympathize with their feelings. Still, it’s probably worth noting here that not all discussions of science, technology, and other holy symbols of the civil religion of progress are meant to provide venues for the ritual theater of that faith. If fusion power and the internet were purely spiritual realities—say, two of the blessings that the faithful could expect to receive after death in some kind of techno-heaven buzzing with starships, jetpacks, and domed cities—that would be a different matter, but fusion reactors, internet data centers, and the like are also expected to solve practical difficulties here on earth. That means that a discussion of their prospects arguably ought to extend beyond the limits of ritual theater, and include points that aren’t part of the ceremonial dialogue.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, whether a technology makes economic sense in a world of rapidly depleting resources and spiraling economic dysfunction is a valid concern, whether or not that concern conforms to the stereotyped arguments of our time. If some future iteration of ITER finally gets a sustained fusion reaction going, that’s an intriguing bit of experimental physics, but unless that event leads to the discovery of some way to maintain such a reaction that costs a couple of orders of magnitude less than $14 billion per reactor, that’s all it is—and since every cheaper option has been tried in half a century of very well funded experimentation, it’s a safe bet that in fact, that’s all it is. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This was already recognized in the early 1980s. I recall independent studies in the appropriate tech scene in those days, which showed that if the relatively simple tokamak reactors being tested in those days could be made to work, the result would be a power plant that would produce about as much electricity as a standard fission reactor, at roughly ten times the cost. Given that fission power is the most expensive source of electricity in common use today, and has never been economically viable anywhere on earth without massive government subsidies, this is not exactly encouraging. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s thus not hard to imagine a future in which, let’s say, excited physicists announce to the world that sustained nuclear fusion has finally been accomplished, using some elaborate new reactor design ten times more expensive, adjusting for inflation, than those relatively simple tokamak reactors that failed to do the job in the early 1980s. Running the numbers, governments and utility companies calculate that, including all economies of scale, each new fusion reactor would cost a hundred times as much as a comparable fission reactor, with consumer bills to match. Has the energy crisis been solved? Not in any sense meaningful in the real world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the real world, a technology has to be economically feasible to build and use, or it doesn’t matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It really is as simple as that. The galloping economic expansion of the age of cheap abundant energy now visible in history’s rearview mirror made it possible to ignore that unwelcome reality for a time, or at least to pretend that it didn’t matter—you’ll notice that the grandiose plans to cover Manhattan with a dome and give it a year-round climate of 72<span style="font-family: Tahoma">°</span>F and no rain, along with a great many other economically preposterous projects of the recent past, never even got to the detailed-blueprint stage. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style='font-family: Times; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>The coming of the age of scarcity that’s now upon us, though, draws a hard line under such fantasies. From now on into the foreseeable future, the first question that has to be asked about any technological project is “Can we afford to use it?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The second, which needs to be asked immediately after the first, is “Are there ways to do the same thing less expensively?” These questions may not be part of the ritual theater of the civil religion of progress, but I’d like to suggest that consoling true believers in that faith with assurances of the invincibility of their surrogate deity may be less important just now than dealing with the imminent impact of the end of abundance and the twilight of the industrial age. </span></div>

To observe the ritual theater of Anglo-American atheism in full spate, watch the comments page of any online essay in English that says anything sympathetic about religion, and observe how the "angry atheists" pile on with their ceremonial talking points and their carefully cultivated rage. The plot here is the Great War of Reason against ignorance and superstition, and the response expected from the audience of believers is the enthusiastic embrace of an identity as a member of the blessed minority of knowers of the truth, fiercely persecuted by the minions of evil. I don't read enough contemporary European atheism to have a good sense of its ritual drama; I know that in 19th century France, at least, it generally had a lot to do with thumbing one's nose at the Pope -- but of course things will have changed since then.<br><br><a href=#c7314932125960065050 title="comment permalink">8/14/13, 9:18 PM</a><br><br>

This is where the complex supply chains become a major issue, even if the materials themselves aren't particularly rare.

The other day I was re-reading Limits to Growth, and was reminded how delays inherent in the system mean that time is the most crucial ingredient. Suppose we wanted to transition to a world in which the Internet could be sustained on an annual solar budget. Could it be done? Maybe. But to get from here to there will require many substitutions of materials, manufacturing processes, software, social/business structures, and so on. And, if nothing else, we'll need to downscale our expectations of what it can do. What makes it particularly hard is the fact you point out -- that folks will be trying to downscale the Internet (and the energy system) at the same time as the resources (time, money, and otherwise) to do so are getting scarce, getting us into one <a href=http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/10/the-energy-trap/ rel=nofollow>Energy Trap</a> after another (as Tom Murphy calls it).<br><br><a href=#c1538819830275786107 title="comment permalink">8/14/13, 9:25 PM</a><br><br>

The promise of electric vehicles seems much the same sort of nonsense in my mind. People rarely mention the economics of the things unless of course they insist that just like mobile phones, the battery technology will improve and the costs will come down. Yeah right.<br><br>They never quite seem to be able to grapple with the fact that batteries are quite an established and old technology and there are not that many easy gains to be made.<br><br>Meanwhile in the real world, no one is buying electric vehicles because they cost between 2x and 3x that of an equivalent internal combustion engine vehicle.<br><br>What no one is mentioning is that for electric vehicles to be feasible they have to weigh no more than a very small go-kart. Not quite an SUV? hehe!<br><br>On a serious note, I do now know of a guy who has an electric vehicle and lives off grid. He is also several thousand kilometres north of here and as such gets much more year around sun light.

In this bizarre "reality" we currently inhabit (or does it inhabit us?), "economically feasible" seems just to mean that a certain set of economic actors can make a bundle from it, whatever it costs everyone else, and whether it works as advertised or not. As you mention, nuclear power is an example; biofuels from plants grown for the purpose is another, and of course fusion...<br><br>A phrase in last week's post caught my mind's eye: "... [when] internet service costs more than the median monthly income..."<br>This brought back to me Ted Nelson's Xanadu project, and his idea of "Silverstands", local outlets where people would go to access the "textual universe" (<a href=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~drbr/moulthro.txt rel=nofollow>here's</a> a review of Nelson's vision).<br><br>From there, I jumped to a vision of the near future, where some form of global (or at least widespread) network would still be operational, but would require people to go to some facility outside their homes to use it. The natural candidates for this would be the facilities that are already "community information access points": libraries.<br><br>Whether they have "silverstands" in them or not, libraries are going to become crucially important in the coming seres, both to maintain repositories of information and, as natural hubs of community activity, the kind of commons that could help neighborhoods jell into real communities).<br><br>Another thought, on the religion of scientific progress: looking outside the US, there may be emerging scientific "cultures" that have already "left Hagsgate", returning to the kind of scientific processes that serve cultures, rather than just corporations.

The ritual of progress like all rituals forces thought and action to go in a specific direction and stifles independent thought. This is intended by design though no mastermind ever put the system in place consciously. It arose organically and naturally, as a way to pass on knowledge. <br><br>The medicine man, the high priest. Class, class lets all have quiet and all turn to page 83. Stay within the lines, that's what good people do.<br><br>The contradiction is that progress means change and rituals exist to preserve what is, not change it. If rituals allow for creativity at all it is always confined within strict limits, among limited choices. Mostly rituals are intended to follow a specific form as exactly as it is possible to do. Humans mimic and feel good when they do it right. Sadly this can get us through the day even if the mimicry winds up hurting others. As long as someone else approves of someone getting hurt then someone gets hurt.<br><br>In a narrow way the contradiction in the ritual of progress is avoided if we understand the ritual unquestionably worships the god of technical flux. A god that punishes those who do not accept and implement all that is technically possible to do without question. The god requires superpowers to defeat the contradiction. The ritual requires that technology be without fault. Only those weak of faith dare question this precept. <br><br>Technology is without fault and will solve all. Only man is weak and whenever we are blessed with new technology it is a sin not to use it to maximum potential. New technology always trumps old. That's how the madness goes.<br><br>The ritual has a dogma, an irrational inner core belief which ignores that technology is subservient to man and raises the worship of the god of technical flux over and above any respect of the individual. We are born, we live, we die. Technology exists to serve, it exists only as long as man exists, it has no life without mankind. Technology also is born, lives and dies and its life can outlive the life of particular individuals but without mankind to implement it, technology is gone. <br><br>The worship is irrational, unlike a real god technology is not omnipotent. Technology has limits and can't solve all problems. It is nothing without us. Sacrifice on its altar is in vain.<br><br>An anti-ritual is needed. The ritual of progress critique. Rigorous examination of the practical benefits and true cost of all technical solutions new and old. A meta-technology. Technology about technology.<br><br>We also need to control our population. We are against the wall.<br><br><i>We shall not cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time."</i> - T. S.

These extra people would have to be fed. Growing the extra food was going to take a while, before the nearby big tree in the island's forest cover that was designated to be the main hull could even be felled, hollowed out with fire and stone tools, and then hauled to the beach-front building yard.<br><br>So -- first, plant your gardens. No question for the First-and-Second-Law-constrained fisher/gardener/gatherers of that stone-age culture that economic considerations are paramount. They -- lucky them! -- had no concept of massive amounts of extra slave energy comprehensively available at frankly derisory real prices, to assist them in endless bloated megalomanic schemes. About the worst that the Pacific islanders could manage, without that sea of easy extra energy available, was the disaster of Easter Island. So the ship-builders calculated the food-economics and the scheduling times with some hard-nosed realism.<br><br>Welcome to the global resurgence of that realism, just beginning with the new era of the Long Descent. The economics of any scheme -- in the uncompromisingly-realistic sense of available energy- and material-flows -- is indeed paramount, increasingly from here on, in our feasibility considerations. <br><br>Thus, a whole bundle of schemes which have been and continue to be floated to deal with the growing global crises are never going to happen, precisely because of those &gt;economic&lt; constraints. <br><br>That goes as much for 'green' biggies, <br><br>The big dissipative structures which we've created in the brief -- two centuries or so -- cheap'n'abundant-fossil-carbon era are about to undergo some serious down-sizing and de-complexifying. Realworld economics, which actually takes account of the undodgeable Laws of Thermodynamics, will have its way. Schemes which can't be funded -- with real money which actually represents accurately the &gt;essentials&lt; that it prices -- won't happen.<br><br><a href=#c8341789456182829836 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 1:56 AM</a><br><br>

The personal automobile. It's already the second major expense after housing for most people, and many people can give it up (if painfully). Before we even talk about how EVs will never do it, we should confront the issue that even regular cars are almost certainly going down the drain at some point.

It seems that this is important, just “because”. If you can’t have the most or be the biggest, you have to have more or be bigger than somebody. I remember talking about telescope sizes with my father and he pointed out that the McDonald Observatory (Texas) Struve telescope (1938) was 82”. When Kitt Peak (KPNO) built a similar size telescope in 1964, theirs was 84”. Then Steward Observatory (University of Arizona) built their 90” on Kitt Peak in 1969. These later telescopes weren’t larger than the Mt. Palomar 200” finished in 1948, but they were larger than somebody else. Even though these incremental size increases meant basically nothing in telescope utility, they meant a lot politically. It was “worth” the increased expense to be “bigger” even though, as pointed out in the paper I previously referenced, light gathering power increases by the 2nd power of telescope size, cost increases by about the 3rd power.<br><br><br><a href=#c477637026512299452 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 5:52 AM</a><br><br>

F. Disney:<br><br>“…A single telescope, however large, can provide only a limited amount of observing time; this can be divided up into small increments for a large number of observers, or into reasonable amounts for a small and fortunate clique of astronomers. Which is the better strategy is a nice question, but in either case the pitfalls are rather obvious. Also, because of the pressures of time and cost there is always a temptation to use the largest telescopes for bandwagon astronomy, or for measurements which will bring a definite return. The more speculative observations, or ones involving new and temperamental instruments which require adjustments on the telescope itself, may receive a low priority or not be done at all. In other words, there is a temptation to do first class second-rate astronomy. Conversely, small telescopes are often used to make pioneering investigations.”<br><br>Wes Lockwood at Lowell Observatory brought this quote to my attention several years ago. He’s been using the same 21” telescope for several decades doing continuous observations, a telescope that was constructed in the mid-1950’s for my father’s use. The steel tube for that telescope is a piece of natural gas pipeline donated by El Paso Natural Gas. Not a high-budget telescope!<br><br>My father always built his own instruments tailored to the observations he wanted to make, today each telescope is equipped with a set of instruments designed and built by the telescope owners/operators and a visiting astronomer almost always uses those instruments. I wouldn’t be surprised to find that the observations and science often have to be tailored to the provided instruments rather than the other way around. Questioning these things (telescope size, equipment provided, quality of science, etc.) is goring several sacred cows, therefore the violent responses! I’m sure similar situations can be shown for all branches of science.<br><br>(1)Arrays vs. Single Telescopes, Johnson 1981<br><br>http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1981raoa.conf..141J/0000141.000.html<br><br>(2)Optical Arrays, Disney 1972<br><br>http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1972MNRAS.160..213D/0000213.000.html?high=520c46f2f703660<br><br><br><a href=#c6123011605216088424 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 5:57 AM</a><br><br>

I think you and your audience are talking past each other with that term “economically viable.”<br><br>The normal understanding of economic viability means some undertaking will return a profit (preferably, but not necessarily a sustainable one). Dollars go in and you produce something that people will pay even more dollars for. Heck, producing $1,200 Kardashian sunglasses can be “economically viable” if there are enough suckers around. It’s a flexible system where it is very problematic to declare that something can never be economically viable – since it’s always possible that someone might be motivated to pay for it. In fact, to the extent that normal economics is a symbolic system more than anything else, your own claim is absurd.<br><br>Your own view of economics, if I understand correctly, diverges from that in at least a couple of relevant ways. First and most obviously, you see thermodynamics lurking under it all - that an energy system which requires more e in than out can never be truly viable in the effort to power the grid. (Your commenters would generally go along with this idea, of course.) But I think at least some of your commenters take your claim to rest on that – the idea that fusion is destined to be an energy loser – but this is obviously a mere technological hurdle to them and not a basis for a claim of impossibility. <br><br>I assume the dogmatism of your claim lies in your more radical modeling of economics, catabolic collapse, which you haven’t really talked about for quite a while on this blog and is probably not top of mind for your commenters. Not only does the money needed to throw at fusion’s hurdles grow more precious and contested, but also the scale and complexity, and infrastructural investment of this variation of energy production (should it succeed in evolving to that after all) becomes effectively impossible to maintain. In this way, it becomes quite obviously not “economically viable.” In fact, as your more recent argument goes, the idea that it could be, strikes you as so unlikely and absurd that the only reason people can’t see that is due to a progress delusion.<br><br>Although I agree with you that people who are enthusiastic about fusion are almost certainly engaging in traditional progress-think. I believe some of the people who object to your claim that fusion can never, never be feasible may instead be misunderstanding your claim about what “economically viable” means.<br><br>Well, with this overlong comment I’ve tried to put enough words both in your mouth and the mouths of your commentariot, so I’d better shut up and listen now.<br><br><br><a href=#c7806040144821425523 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 6:15 AM</a><br><br>

Ah, one of my friends replied, they have all the technical issues worked out, multiple hardware redundancy, etc, etc, no data can get lost. Yes, but, I was not questioning the technical robustness of the enterprise but the economic one where the cloud provider goes out of business. Who will rescue your data. Oh never mind.

Other things that seem like they should be natural low cost solutions (railroad transportation for example) don't carry the day because of politics and individual choices. I think your assessment of fusion is correct. I like to say that magnetically or inertially confined fusion will never be cost competitive with gravitationally confined fusion otherwise known as solar power. But the claim that ITER will not lead to low cost ways to control fusion on earth is only an educated guess. It is very hard to know what materials and confinement schemes might be workable and what their costs might be. That said, my educated guess matches yours...I don't see where they are going to get the orders of magnitude cost reductions that would be necessary and I think research dollars would be much better spend on gravitational confinement.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3935058182670030251 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 7:24 AM</a><br><br>

Set in the present day, it depicts self-satisfied technologists reveling in their latest toys. A wise elder arrives and tells them to prepare, because their technology will soon pass away, leaving them bereft and helpless. To mock the wise elder, they declare that of course their technology will pass away, because even better technology will soon come to replace it. They then depart the scene, while one at a time the wise elder's disciples make short speeches about how blind and foolish they are. But some years later, the economy collapses, and sure enough. all the technology (not just fusion plants and space probes and live streaming video, but tractors and transistors and e-mail too) vanishes, leaving the technologists bereft. Humbled, they beseech the disciples of the wise elder for instruction in how to warm their houses without electricity and raise food from the soil, which the latter have prepared themselves to provide. This ending is neither happy nor tragic, and life goes on, highlighted by two songs sung simultaneously in counterpoint, one grieving over losses, the other celebrating that a long-standing destructive imbalance has been brought back into balance at last.<br><br>And yet, I could swear I've already seen ritual theater a lot like this, somewhere, very recently.<br><br>(Please don't ask me whether I'm being supportive or sarcastic. I seem to get closest to insight at the point where I can't tell myself. Less cryptically, I can't help finding the hyperbole inherent in ritual theater to be silly and often counterproductive, whether I agree with the intended message or not.)<br><br>I vividly remember the "survival of the Internet" discussion from several years ago, because a lot of it took place on other forums around the Web, including my own "native" forum. There, at least, there was real discussion of costs and benefits, not just technical feasibility. For example, given a plausible scenario where Internet access is so costly that "only the Lord of the Manor can afford it," implying that it would be unavailable if not completely unknown to the peasants, I raised the question: "Two neighboring Lords of the Manor with equal estates both have costly Internet access. One keeps it for his own use; the other makes an effort to distribute access among his tenants, giving them additional sources of information on medicine, meteorology, engineering, and agricultural practices. Thirty years later those two estates go to war against each other; which would win?"<br><br>(For better or worse, it was that discussion that first brought me to the ADR, when I rightly began to suspect that the self-appointed emissary I'd been conversing with was doing a poor job of representing JMG's actual views.)<br><br><a href=#c3691450151681613883 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 7:29 AM</a><br><br>

Holly successfully struggles against the obscurantist standards of country music and brings his rock innovation into the world.

So <i>of course</i> fusion isn't going to be easy. But once the "breakthrough" has been made, the blueprints, lab notes, formulas, etc. -- the power-infused magic talismans -- are turned over to the industrialists, who then get busy churning out consumer products and profits, a magical process that makes the difficult technology affordable. Like any magic, it's inconceivable that it could fail. Unless, of course, the talismans fall into "the wrong hands." (Cue the sinister music, call out the action figures.)<br><br>I'm surprised that none of your critics knew their own scripts well enough to "refute" you with this. Maybe it's because we all know too well that the "magic of capitalism" is broken? Or maybe they just weren't very bright.<br><br>The other comment involves noting a thread that seems to run through all economic thinking: that economic limits are supply limits, rather than demand limits. Demand limits never seem to come up. But demand limits are at the core of most (all?) of our current crises.<br><br>We will probably never have an actual shortage of oil (supply). What happens instead is rising production cost (with plenty of oil available at that price) that makes it unaffordable to the end-use customers. So they stop using it and find some other way to get by: all the way down the energy curve to draft animals and human muscle if necessary. Demand drops, and now supply exceeds demand, driving prices below the production costs (or below profit expectations), so supply is deliberately cut back by the producers to prop up prices and profits. There's still plenty of oil, but it isn't profitable to produce because the <i>demand</i> (at that price) has vanished.<br><br>There was a time when copper roofing was popular. Copper production peaked in, what, the 1960's? Prices for copper rose, and people stopped putting copper on their roofs.<br><br>We'll see the same story with oil. "Did you know," people will say in the twenty-fourth century, "there was a time when people used to <i>burn</i> oil?" Eyes will widen, and heads will shake in disbelief. I suspect that people in the 24th c. will have all the oil they need, for however they are using it (which will not involve burning it as fuel.)<br><br>That's what will kill the internet. It isn't that we'll run out of germanium, or power, or whatever. It's that people will no longer have luxury income or time or even the inclination to indulge in on-line geekery. That lack of demand will kill the whole enterprise.<br><br>Which is to reinforce your central point: yes, perhaps we could develop fusion power. Or space mining. Or interstellar travel. But there will be no demand for it.<br><br><a href=#c3640705017868639628 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>

Which is to say (at least in it’s own terms) industrial society has witnessed a progression of events and technologies that have ushered in an age of abundance and extreme specialisation. Whether one agrees with the nature of all this as good, depends on values. The Amish, among others have shunned it (as an example). Your point, which is key, is to remember that as inevitable as Progress became in the wake of key, historic, collective decisions to put fossil fuels to use in a particular way, it is not necessarily permanent, and is most likely now just a habit of thought or a dream – again, no matter what value you attach to it. <br>The morality play for secular progress you describe conjures many a narrative in the arts and in music. The solitary genius becomes an archetype if not a god, in the secular religion, and it becomes institutionalised as it is popularised for the obvious reason that centres of power thrive when people buy in to the narrative. But in certain cases, just as the story of progress can be said to have taken place in say, telecommunications, so too have instances of creative genius fit rather neatly into the narrative. Granted, it likely requires a particular selection of facts, but it can make for a good story, and very often, remarkable artistry, which of course is another value judgement…<br>I do see the danger of holding onto the narrative too tightly, since it does distort and simplify history. It also feeds into culture of the “they will think of something” to save us all. “They” must of course be geniuses developing fusion/algal/wind/fuel-cell wonder-mobiles for us all against the odds…<br>I often remind myself and others of the relative ease with which our society adopted petroleum as a source of energy, and how the infrastructure we put to use to service our energy consumption has been built up over time so exhaustively. On the one hand the technology was relatively simple and immediate (internal combustion engine makes car go), whereas our expectations for technologies since then to replace (save us from) petroleum are hard-pressed to fulfill all the conveniences associated with it. I wonder if the way we describe these expectations to ourselves, especially through advertising don’t also fall into the category of secular ritual theatre…<br>Well those are my thoughts for a busy week.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c2137789436975290921></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/05841965592726951658 rel=nofollow>Adam Funderburk</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Hi JMG,<br><br>Two points:<br><br>First, it seems that we don't need formal religious ritual plays in our society because 95% of our media follows the established plotline nicely. The stories all around us are mostly that of Progress (or its antithesis, Apocalypse). I can't think of many commercially successful, popular movies that haven't been about the plucky, determined hero making things better for all, or about how our runaway technology and hubris is going to destroy everything. <br><br>Second, I have definitely noticed the curious mismatch between what is possible versus what is feasible in the mental health field. Over the years, we have learned a lot about human behavior (even though many of the best ideas are very old ones, appropriately tested and given the seal of Progress of course). Many of these ideas and techniques COULD technically be put to general use and conceivably do a great deal of good. In the wake of the many recent school shootings for instance, many mental health professionals lobbied for more school counselors with a greater degree of training and influence in the schools. I have read numerous articles from counselors, psychologists, and social workers about all the things that SHOULD be done to prevent future tragedies, all technically possible and all garbed in the appropriate “forward-thinking, progressive” language. Thinking of this blog, I usually smile sadly and just shake my head. If it were possible to lower the ratio of counselors to students in every school around the country, begin teaching emotional awareness and healthy coping skills to kids starting in pre-K, actively involve parents, counselors, and teachers when a potential problem arises, and organize mental health programs in every school, then I have no doubt that we would see a reduction in school violence. But as you have said about certain technological wonders in the past, “It ain’t gonna happen.” The costs would be very substantial, in an age where schools are strapped for cash anyway. I can teach my individual clients these skills, and I see what a difference self-awareness and healthy coping skills make in a person’s life, but it is becoming harder for individuals to afford therapy, much less trying to get funding to put this in every school. <br><br>And yet many of my peers are still lobbying fiercely, passionately, and sincerely for things that are not feasible, many of them seemingly unaware that the pie is shrinking for good this time. I truly believe that if the important things we have learned about the mind and emotions are to survive the “end of progress”, then mental health workers are going to have to re-define the meaning of mental health in an age of scarcity. <br><br><br><a href=#c2137789436975290921 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 10:24 AM</a><br><br>

Time is also money or, if you wish, a resource in distressingly short supply; if we had a century to rework the internet to deal with a low-energy future, that would be a considerably less challenging prospect. Murphy's "energy trap" language is extremely useful -- of course there are also resource traps of other kinds, most of which are clamped tightly on industrial society's tender bits just at the moment. <br><br>Robert, of course societal values will choose among those prospects that are economically viable. If a society can't afford to pursue a project, though, it doesn't matter how highly it's valued! As for new forms of ritual theater, of course -- as I mentioned, every society has some form of it. <br><br>Renaissance, very good! The only drawback is that believers in progress won't see the point in simplicity. If you're talking with unbelievers, of course, it's an excellent way to approach things. <br><br>Cherokee, bingo.We can talk about how electric cars will save us, in order to justify keeping lifestles that guarantee that nothing can save us. <br><br>Dwig, it's possible to ignore economic viability for a certain period of time, at least if the problems aren't too great. If a project can't be paid for, though, it normally won't proceed for long before one or another form of bankruptcy interrupts the process. The approaching round of crises may be a good example of this! As for scientific subcultures, I'd be delighted if that were the case -- do you happen to know of any? <br><br>KL, true enough. The very public diatribes of the "New Atheism" (which of course isn't new at all -- does <i>anybody</i> remember Bob Ingersoll these days?) are a good example of ritual theater, with their utterly stereotyped plots and emotional payoffs. <br><br>Harry, I've been trying to duck that stereotype since the beginning of this project; what I'm saying, after all, has been said many times across the centuries, and right now there are plenty of other thoughtful people saying many of the same things. <br><br>Tom, good! "Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony." It's a great example of the collision between two incompatible forms of ritual theater, the medieval monarchical and the modern far left radical. <br><br>Flute, thank you. I'd like to put both those questions on the business end of a branding iron, and apply them to some tender posteriors! <br><br>K-dog, good. That's why the same old "new ideas" keep getting rehashed over and over again; the script of progress calls for a supply of innovative ideas, but the needs of ritual demand repetition and familiarity, so the same set of utterly familiar fantasies about the future get branded as "innovative and new" when they're nothing of the kind, and repeated endlessly at the right point in the ritual. The flying car is the classic example, though Musk's "hyperloop" (which featured in science fiction most of a century ago) may just catch up.<br><br><a href=#c1506850719478770082 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 10:39 AM</a><br><br>

Of course the old man was utterly correct -- in order to launch a major technological project, you need to prepare the economic surplus needed to support it all the way along the development curve, and you need to do that in advance. That's one of the many reasons the space age came to its sorry end. There are huge implications in that principle, which I'm going to need to think about for a good long while. <br><br>Mr. O, good! Check out the writings of the current generation of perpetual motion entrepreneurs -- they take the same ritual drama and turn it into farce. <br><br>Leo, excellent. Of course you're quite right; pushing the costs of an uneconomical technology onto some larger system may preserve the technology over the short term, but it risks crippling the larger system in the slightly longer term. <br><br>Paul, I don't see myths as having a "flip side," unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean by that. When one myth collapses, people normally find another to take its place, and there are always plenty of options competing for adherents; thus the failure of, say, the myth of progress won't necessarily lead to a return to agrarianism -- it might equally lead to a vision of history in which clinging to what's been gained in the boom times of the past becomes a major social goal, or to some other way of thinking and action. <br><br>Phil, that's a classic example; many thanks for it.<br><br>Ursachi, my question is how much of this program is designed to make sure that the other three billion get their daily dose of propaganda and advertising from the US and other industrial nations. A lot of motives can hide behind the mask of the public good. <br><br>Rebekah, the "hyperloop" is a tired science-fiction fantasy that gets dragged out and paraded around every decade or two; the money would be better spent improving California's conventional passenger rail system. I'm not familiar with Gagnon; as for "full spectrum dominance," that's the latest incarnation of the US military's ongoing effort to bankrupt what's left of the US economy in the name of global empire; I've discussed at some length in previous posts where that's headed (the short form: catastrophic failure, since so gadget-heavy a military system begs for monkeywrenching.) <br><br>Wall, the society in my online novel <a href=http://starsreach.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>Star's Reach</a> is of course a work of fiction, and it assumes significant continuity between the Meriga of 2450 or so and the America of today. You'll notice that Revolutionary France, Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany were all relatively transitory, and were followed by a return to something closer to normal for the societies in question; I'm envisioning the same sort of process at work in my story. Mind you, business as usual in Meriga four centuries from now includes an established religion worshipping Gaia, laws that condemn people who use fossil fuels to be buried alive, and a presidency that's turned most of the way into a hereditary monarchy, ruling over a protofeudal aristocracy of "jennels" and "cunnels" -- the corresponding Roman military ranks gave us titles such as "duke" and "count" -- but that's ordinary historical change in a Dark Age society. <br><br>Adamatari, no argument there -- stick a fork in the personal automobile, it's done. As for an internet, I've been suggesting for some time that packet radio (basically, text-based computer links over ham radio frequencies) might make a satisfactory transitional technology as the internet as presently constituted prices itself out of the market for most people; when computers do the same thing, as they will, that can morph into some derivative of the old message-traffic system, which still exists in ham radio circles. <br><br>Raven, excellent.

Which makes me ponder - how much of a falling away will the religion around the US Constitution and Bill of Rights impact everyday folk in a resource-impaired future? Are there ways we can really protect the cultural values around the Life, Liberty, Equality, Due Process, etc that have made a social difference just as we can shepherd the core values of true scientific process in small ways for the future?

That leaves me wondering about the anomalies in contemporary astronomy that, according to Kuhn, should be piling up around the fringes of the science, because they can't be addressed from within the existing way of doing things. <br><br>Andy, nah, my argument is actually based on a great deal of respect for the half century or so of fusion research that's already taken place. Every relatively low-cost option for magnetic or inertial confinement has been tested, retested, and re-retested; the reason that ITER has a price tag of $14 billion is that all the cheaper options have been tried. I'm also assuming that the price tag on ITER and other fusion research projects is wholly justified -- that a sustained fusion reaction is so difficult to create that this level of expenditure is necessary (and of course the evidence from previous experiments supports this). Any future fusion reactor must therefore involve comparable complexity and costs that, while they'll doubtless be lower once the bugs are worked out, will not be the several orders of magnitude lower that would be necessary to make fusion economically viable as a source of electricity for the grid. I don't think that's an unrealistic assessment, all things considered!<br><br><a href=#c6955633553761627440 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 11:29 AM</a><br><br>

It's typical journalism that every twist and turn in the long story of fusion research is labeled as a "critical phase," when it's just another step along the same road. <br><br>Stanley, you might want to take the time to read my blog before leaping to conclusions. Should fusion power somehow become both practical and affordable, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that will simply free us up to slam face first into the next limit to growth. (No matter how you parse it, limitless growth on a finite planet isn't an option.) As for fusion's prospects, I'd encourage you to read Charles Seife's useful <i>Sun in a Bottle: The Strange History of Fusion and the Science of Wishful Thinking</i>, a critique of fusion research by an author who can hardly be criticized for a lack of detailed technical knowledge of the subject; as I've mentioned in past posts on this subject, Seife's work is one of the sources I've drawn on. There are plenty of critics of the ongoing fusion boondoggle, though you apparently aren't aware of them. <br><br>Gunnar, that's a great example. <br><br>Stu, an excellent point, which can be generalized: what are the downsides to the technology? What problems and dependencies does it create? <br><br>Wolfgang, that's another great example. <br><br>Ganv, as I commented to Andy, I'm relying on the hard work and persistence of half a century of fusion researchers. They've covered a vast range of possibilities, and they're working with areas of physics (for example, electromagnetism) that are quite well understood. I think it's fair to give them the benefit of the doubt; if they've gone to vastly expensive programs like ITER, I'd say it's safe to assume that they've already explored the cheaper options. <br><br>Myriad, fair enough. My take is that an internet so costly that only the lord of the manor can access it won't be able to support itself at all, because there will be so many cheaper ways -- among other things, using the kind of low-cost human labor that lords of manors have at their beck -- to provide some version of the same services. Thus the likely winner of the competition is neither of your two aristocrats, but the baron next door who doesn't waste his resources on the internet, but spends them on more affordable technologies that improve his estate, help his serfs and vassals produce more value, etc. <br><br>Richard, that's fascinating. I'm not surprised -- the myth of progress has been applied with great enthusiasm to the arts, to their great detriment.<br><br>Joseph, demand limits are important so long as it's remembered that "demand" in economic terms means "ability to pay," not "desire for a product." A million people with no money who are starving to death, to an economist, is an example of lack of demand for food. It's a shorthand, and in some ways a deceptive one, for the failure of an economic system to provide access to goods and services; that failure can have many causes, though of course hard limits on resource availability are among them. <br><br>Kyoto, of course that's important to remember. We have indeed seen three centuries of rapid technological and scientific progress; what makes that into the foundation for the supreme mythology of our time is simply the assumption that past performance will inevitably predict future results.<br><br><a href=#c1164102672794019785 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 1:57 PM</a><br><br>

Are you up for getting the ball rolling? <br><br>Phil, exactly. If the money (or the equivalent in energy, raw materials, labor, and time) can't be had, it doesn't matter how neat the technology looks on paper. <br><br>Unknown, I don't think that's something that can be settled in advance -- which is to say, it depends on who's willing to put how much effort into preserving democratic ideals in a difficult age. I've argued that this is a valid and valuable project; the ongoing collapse of the civil religion of Americanism is going to make it harder than it would otherwise have to be, but it's still not impossible. <br><br>Ursachi, fair enough. It'll be interesting to see how it works out. <br><br>Stanley, not at all. I'm counting on the brilliance and hard work of half a century of fusion researchers to have covered the less expensive options before trying anything as gargantuan as ITER. If all you can offer in response is unsubstantiated claims that there might be something out there that will turn the fusion fantasy of limitless cheap power into a reality, it seems to me that a sensible policy is to put all that money toward known, proven technologies that would actually do some good -- until, that is, you can offer something better. <br><br>Joseph, granted, but there's also quite a bit of "we simply don't have the money" technology out there -- and people do starve to death, not because they're sitting on their hands, but because they don't have the skills, the resources, and the time to do anything but starve. <br><br>Onething, if you're giving pollinators a safe place to thrive, you're making a huge contribution to the future.

The furious zeal with which partisans of the various vaporware energy sources defend their claims that we can, too, have all the energy we want suggests to me that they know they're wrong; it's the person who's losing his faith that's always the most passionate about proselytizing it to all and sundry. <br><br>Joseph, not at all. As you quite rightly point out, a million people starving to death doesn't even make the evening news these days. Still, it gets the point across! <br><br>Repent, though I don't share your fondness for Jones et al., I agree that the short term crises are the rough part of the Long Descent; knowing that industrial civilization is going to take a century or two to fall really isn't much consolation if it's your job that just got eliminated by a contracting economy, your house that got devastated by a climate change-driven storm, your civil rights that went away in a political breakdown, and so on. I'll sketch out some of what I think we can expect along these lines in future posts. <br><br>As for me, I do this because it's worth doing. I feel I've already made a significant impact on the peak oil discussion, and far more importantly, on the lives of people who are better prepared for the deindustrializing future now than they might otherwise have been. Bit by bit, the discussion is shifting from pie-in-the-sky technological and political schemes to practical projects that can be carried out by individuals, families, and communities, and lay the foundations for more extensive projects to come. As for my wife, thanks for asking -- we celebrated our 29th anniversary last month; she's just as much on board with this as I am, and has a notably larger range of practical skills than I do. <br><br>Robert, you can always get an attentive audience here by quoting Eliot (or, for that matter, Yeats or Jeffers). Of course he's quite right, and you're equally correct to apply his logic more broadly. When the Constitutional Convention finished its deliberations and Ben Franklin walked out of the hall, a lady friend (he had a <i>lot</i> of lady friends) approached him and asked what kind of government they'd proposed for the new nation. His answer applies just as much now: "A republic, madam, if you can keep it." <br><br>Joseph, building pumping stations on Titan and shipping methane home via spaceship to keep the earth supplied with natural gas. Given current technologies, the raw cost would bankrupt the planet. <br><br>Harry, if you want to encourage Stoicism, you'll get no disagreement here. What bothers me about the would-be square-jawed heroes is that so many of them seem to be playing a Hollywood film inside their heads, with themselves in the starring role; there are times that I swear I can see the credits rolling past in their eyes. <br><br>Joel, my question is whether it would give that much more of an advantage than would be accessible via simpler technology -- say, a network of shortwave radio stations using handbuilt vacuum tubes (a common item on the old-tech fringe of the DIY movement these days). In a world of much tighter resource constraints, the simplest tool for the job will likely be the best, and in the absence of fossil fuels, skilled human operators may well be the best information processing technology for the money.<br><br><a href=#c2932202510435692114 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 5:42 PM</a><br><br>

You articulated it much more elegantly and perhaps more clearly than I could have, allowing our host to give an equally elegant and clear answer.<br><br>Now here is probably a far less elegant and clear expansion of the point to the rest of the peak oil/end of growth sub-culture. I am thinking of the ritual theater that has formed in this sub-culture and, as been pointed out so often in this blog, it seems to naturally follow structures set down by the religion of progress. There is the ritual theater of anti-religion of apocalypse, which has found such fertile ground in peak oil and has help lead, if any help was needed, to current boy-who-cried-wolf response that so many people feel toward these issues. The other side is one derived from the religion of progress itself, the idea that we can have a renewable energy version of our lifestyles.<br><br>I see both in the Transition Movement, though the anti-religion is a bit more of an under-the-radar phenomenon. Transition seems to do a somewhat better job of keeping the excesses of religious of progress type ritual theater in check than other Green movements. However “somewhat better than most” is certainly not going to be good enough, especially when the next noticeable wide spread crisis happens.<br><br><br><a href=#c2004599570083477325 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 6:11 PM</a><br><br>

Don’t put it through if it’s too far off topic.<br><br>In 1978 Wieslaw Wisniewski and my father wrote an article entitled “The Mystery of Vega”.<br><br>http://www.qsl.net/kg7bz/Vega.pdf<br><br>Wisniewski was a Polish astronomer who immigrated to the US in the 1963 and worked closely with my father.<br><br>As you know, there are certain unvarying stars that are designated as “Standard Stars” and Vega (Alpha Lyrae) was often considered <i>the</i> standard. What Wisniewski and my father did was point out all the many decades of evidence that Vega was not so unvarying and this should be investigated. They point out that this variability should certainly preclude it’s use as a standard, let alone a primary standard.<br><br>Every astronomer they approached totally poo-poo’d the idea, some quite nastily. I remember my father telling me that one astronomer at Kitt Peak told him “We’ve always used Vega as a standard and we aren’t going to stop. You don’t know what you’re talking about!”<br><br>They eventually published the article in Star &amp; Telescope Magazine in 1979 as no other journal would accept it. Then back sometime around 2005 I remember seeing an article saying that Vega was no longer to be used as a standard due to it’s <i>variability</i> in brightness and spectrum. How many decades to even take a look and then only when things were staring them in the face because the latest observations were unmistakable? If you know how these standard stars are used for equipment calibration, you’ll see that using Vega introduced small errors into every observation that used Vega as a comparison star for differential photometry and spectroscopy.<br><br>Take a look at today’s Wikipedia entry for Vega<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega<br><br>and notice how it omits and discounts earlier observations of variability and infrared excess. Not mentioned are most of the observations of brightness pointed out in the 1979 article, in fact it says only two observations showed variability and no others did. Not quite! It says that the infrared excess was <i>discovered</i> by the IRAS satellite after 1983. The observations of Morrison &amp; Simon in 1973 and Wisniewski &amp; Johnson in 1976-77 ignored. It’s as if something isn’t significant or doesn’t exist unless it was done in an expensive and extremely complex manner!<br><br>Different but interesting subject, notice the last paragraph of the 1979 article…<br><br>Something knows we're hams, verification 73 stputri<br><br><a href=#c1028321246479626478 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 7:48 PM</a><br><br>

How will it help to redefine mental health?<br>*****************<br>I do not think that resource constraints and a more labor intensive lifestyle means that we have to give up the ideals of respect for both genders, other races, or allowing homosexuals a place in society. <br><br>I do think some more radical feminists are confused. The best example I can think of is a bumper sticker I used to see in the very progressive town I used to live in. It went like this: "A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle." This irritated the heck out of me, not only because it's rather hateful, but so very out of touch with reality.<br><br>I picture said feminist driving home in her car from her office job, stopping at the grocery store, turning on the light and putting food in the fridge. Everything she has just done and touched was prepared for her by the hard labor of men. <br>Unrealistic notions of "equality" based on sameness won't pass the giggle test in a simpler, more agrarian lifestyle.<br>But while a certain amount of division of labor by gender is probably almost automatic, that does not at all mean that the life of the intellect will die out, that ideals of justice and due process cannot be maintained, that women cannot have an equal voice in decisions and so forth.<br>There are so many things we won't be able to hold onto; knowledge of women's fertility cycles, nutrition, sanitation, aseptic technique, logic and the scientific method need not be among them.<br><br><a href=#c4604220577788366289 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 7:52 PM</a><br><br>

So there you are: industrialisation plus technology. The Nazis certainly worshipped technology too: "Nazism equals neo-tribalism plus permanent Blitzkrieg", which nobody actually said.<br><br>Only Pol Pot, with his Year Zero and abandonment of the cities, seems not to have believed in industrialisation. Strangely enough, in the 1990s I once saw a poster by the British Movement, a tiny neo-Nazi group, showing what looked like stormtroopers with clubs. The slogan was: "Back to the land! Abandon the cities!" Apparently the party was under the leadership of neo-Strasserites at the time: Pol Pot meets Ernst Roehm, I thought.<br><br>I worked in West Berlin from 1979 to 1980, and I did wander around East Berlin on May Day 1980. The members of the Free German Youth were recognisable by their blue shirts and red neckerchiefs. I saw one such young lad sitting on Alexander Square, strumming a guitar and singing "Blowing in the wind" in English. There were lots of Russian soldiers about, and East German ones too, still with those peaked caps that made them look like Nazis minus the swastika armbands. Communist Party members with flags marched through the city centre, accompanied by floats with images of Marx, Engels and Lenin. No Stalin - perhaps he was the fallen angel. (Anyway, few Christians mention the devil these days, either). All the party members were wearing red carnations. The president, Erich Honecker, gave a speech in Alexander Square, and Russian soldiers, including females, put on free dance displays in the city parks.<br><br>On East German children's radio, I remember two songs were often played: "We're learning Russian!" and "We're building socialism!" All this would lead to communism, a heaven on Earth. How a totalitarian state was supposed to turn into its opposite, where the state would wither away (no different from anarchism then), I didn't understand. <br><br>On East German TV the words "capitalist", "fascist", "neo-fascist", "racist" and "neo-imperialist" were used non-stop. "Today the fascist, neo-fascist and neo-imperialist states of the European Economic Community held a summit meeting in Brussels," the smiling female newsreader would announce. Or else, on a children's programme: "Today, children, we are visiting Africa, to see how the African children suffer under the exploitation of the powers of the neo-imperialist West." Forget "Wacky Races", then.<br><br>In the Weimar Britain of the 1970s, Marxism had seemed to be everywhere, and I hated it. For the East German communists, collapse came in 1989. Marxism had been around all my young life, and I was delighted by its demise but had never expected it. Which parts of capitalism or commercialism will I not miss, come the Emergency? Hard to say, at this lack of distance.<br><br><a href=#c8065377198268289608 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 8:19 PM</a><br><br>

It can be a bit of a semantic dispute, but also, I think you'll agree, a real difference.<br><br>People do think and behave about progress much as they do and have done about religion. But this might have more to do with the way the human mind becomes bounded by the inherited stories of the culture in which it arises.<br><br>Getting to the point. There is a critical difference between the religion of progress and the ancient and classical religions that pre-dated and are likely to survive its collapse: unlike the traditional religions, the Myth of Progress can and will be proven false. But one cannot say the same about the existence of God, or the divinity of Jesus, or the pantheon of Hinduism.<br><br>The etymology of "religion" is revealing: to be "re-bound", or "re-tied." Into what? Into the cohesive, common society/polity/culture necessary - as a previous commentor pointed out with the example of the Polynesian boats - to do the basic manual labor to grow the food to feed the workers who will build the ships.<br><br>The myth of progress does function in that way, by binding people together in a common labor - that is, to keep on pushing technology, in the hope, perhaps, of some miraculous breakthrough - a la the Second Coming, or Fusion Power, or Free Energy, what have you. The power of this faith is reinforced, not by Inquisition or propaganda as it was (arguably) in the past - so much as the see-it-before-your-eyes reality of rockets to the moon (although that may be much more short-lived than we are taught to believe).<br><br>Note: I have gone through, and continue to go through, a phase of "Losing My Religion" of progress. It's not an easy thing. At first, you want to tell people to wake up and smell the compost. I'm glad you're here since you've done a crafty job of breaking spells; but I suspect for most people, the only way will be "seeing-[progress collapse]-is-[un]believing." <br><br>So that's a complicated matter, because as you've indicated before, it's likely some other belief systems will have to move in to replace the collapsing religion, which we might call the glue that binds us. Might the atheists begin to change their tone when they see the progress myth disappearing and social decay setting in? Certainly fundamentalists will be there with their trumpets and baptisms by fire. One can only hope that things will hold together long enough for some kind of new social glue [religion] to be made.<br><br><a href=#c2200797568605315988 title="comment permalink">8/15/13, 10:06 PM</a><br><br>

He is Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist, writer and popularizer of science in general and futuristic ideas in particular. He has not long ago (I can't remember the context. It might have been 1 of Kaku's appearances on a television show) spoken optimistically about electricity generation using fusion technology, and I seem to recall him mentioning a date, 2040 I think it was. He said that it seems evident that just as fossil fuels start running especially low (he didn't use the term resource scarcity), fusion power would "come to the rescue". He used different words but this was clearly his point. Interestingly enough, Kaku is an expert on the life and accomplishments of Albert Einstein, who definitely qualifies as an example of a hero in the ritual "play" of the civil religion of progress. Kaku's reverence for Einstein started when Kaku was still a boy. Perhaps Kaku unknowingly acquired his civil religion of progress at roughly the same time. Now personally I admire Michio Kaku, having read 1 of his books many years ago which discussed string theory, Einstein's general theory of relativity, the standard model of particle physics, how gravitational theory remains difficult to reconcile with the standard model, etc. Kaku is a brilliant man, and is quite warm and engaging as well. So some very admirable and endearing individuals can be captured by the myth of progress.<br><br><a href=#c8999423325366785752 title="comment permalink">8/16/13, 1:39 AM</a><br><br>

You mention the fusion one, but from the recent ones, the one that stroke me the worst was the angry replies of the "atheists" to your statement that your faith can cope with evolution quite well, especially because they replied to you using a understanding of the evolution concept that is a generation and half old and at best incomplete ( basically throwing in the gargabe all the discoveries made of retroviruses carrying genes between species, prions ( think mad cow disease ) and the fact that atleast some gene expression blocking proteins can be inherited with no direct intervention of DNA ... especially the last one is normally forgotten because it somewhat vindicates Lamarck and recognizing that a much maligned theory of old actually had a point on the newer one is something that we can't have in the religion of the infinite and unstoppable techocomplexification, can't we ? :/ )<br><br>Anyway on the fusion issue, my impression is that, as a friend of mine used to say, the "Sun in a bottle" approach ( putting hot hydrogen plasma in a very confined space and hope that something happens ) is known to be doomed for aleast 2 decades , as I remember seeing a article in the early 00's about the experiments done in some laser assisted fusion experiments ( IIRC in France ) where the interviewed scientist simply stated that at the time they couldn't even explain a good bunch of energy leaks in the process ( they atributted it to neutrinos, the energy garbage can of theoretical physics, the equivalent on saying that demons ate it if you want to put it that way ). If you can't even drop a consistent energy budget on a process after 3 decades or 4 of dropping scientist-hours and money bucketloads in the issue, you can either assume that the issue is either being aproached in the wrong way with tenacious persistance for external reasons ( as most of those scientists and facilities double as fusion nukes labs, you have to wonder ... this aproach is pretty much like trying to develop a explosion engine powered by TNT or C4, if you think about it ) or that it might be out of your reach at all ...<br><br>( cont ... )<br><br><a href=#c8166554201375148644 title="comment permalink">8/16/13, 9:30 AM</a><br><br>

Both nice reads and a somber reminder of how gigantism infected the academia and on the blind faith some scientists tend to have in some constants that might not be ones :/<br><br>- Second, to Joseph Nemeth: being myself in a roughly 8$/gallon ( or 1.60€/L if you prefer ) gas price at this moment ( it was slightly higher some months ago, though ), I'm not sure if people will drop the cars at 10$/gallon even if you have a good public transport network behind ... IMHO the breakout will be somewhat higher in here ( in spite of seeing people being quite reticent to make trips bigger than 100 km even in a ocasional basis ), but I can atleast confirm that at this time pizza delivery in this area ( I live in the outskirts of my country cap, so there is not exactly lack of costumers ) rarely goes to more than 5 km away from the store ( and I'm talking about actual 5 km of drive ) and normally does not pass of a 2-3 km radius. So I do think that is entirely possible that they would drop it altogether if the gas price rose much more ... OFC that to the States standarts, 2-3 km radius of delivery and 100 km trips are pretty much the same as zero, I assume :p<br><br><a href=#c5391526779268031198 title="comment permalink">8/16/13, 9:37 AM</a><br><br>

My point was that a modern city dweller can be quite oblivious as to where all those easy ignition switches come from. When I lived in Chapel Hill, the power went out one winter for 8 days, during all of which it never rose above freezing. There were electricians working outside in the freeze night and day, almost entirely men. Oil rigging is dirty and dangerous hard work. Not many women. I'm not saying there should be women, I'm saying that it is perfectly appropriate that heavier jobs are mostly done by men (I say mostly because I'm a great believer in allowing people to follow their inclinations even if they are rare).

I stood out in the heat pouring water from above my head to aerate them...but we neighbors all stood together and helped. One had a hand coffee grinder, one ran out of sawdust for their composting toilet and I got them some from tree processing of fallen trees that my husband was working on, a local store had ice and we fetched it for one another combining trips with scarce gas.

I don't know its name, it is a relationship to work. Work is hard and needs to be done with break neck speed GO GO GO! When something bad happens (decline events) you need to work harder. But working harder causes a person to be used up. Instead we need to work longer, and at a sustainable pace.

The case of oil is glaringly obvious. The USA having 5% of the global population therefore has a wildly unrealistic per capita use of fossil fuel energy and in particular, petroleum. The USA has depended on importing crude oil since the 1950s and will continue to do so until the lifestyle changes. Use of petroleum has already declined in most OECD countries, including USA, since 2008 in response to stalled economies and higher oil prices, so some small changes have already been enforced. <br><br>New sources of oil production in the USA have high annual decline rates (and costs) and this will severely limit future domestic production’s ability to substitute for imports. The very recent large uptick, however, in US oil domestic production after prolonged decades of decline has made a difference to the rate of imports. Nevertheless USA still imports about 50% of the oil going into US refineries.<br><br>The net result is that US oil imports have dropped since 2008 and stand at about 7.5 million barrels per day and this has changed the share of global oil that the US must import. This now stands at about 10% of total world production of crude oil (+condensates) at around 75 mbpd. (I am leaving aside the issue of total fossil fuel liquids, which is a higher number.)<br><br>Oil available for export worldwide is currently less than 50 million barrels per day – exporting countries increasingly use more of their own production. The USA relies then on importing about 15% of the entire world's exportable oil. The US is still in pole position as the world's largest oil importer ahead of China but is being forced into a high-cost decline. <br><br>Readers interested in the changing numbers can use http://mazamascience.com/OilExport/index.html<br><br><br><a href=#c4513309990320738844 title="comment permalink">8/17/13, 3:43 AM</a><br><br>

There's hardly a peasant that doesn't get it. If you expend more calories in working your patch of land than the calories you harvest from it you will die of starvation. Pretty simple really. <br><br>I would suggest that, such is the distance in time and space from the farm-world reality of living things, of physical effort, that the average, advanced westerner doesn't have a sniff about "economic viability". How did the housing crisis and ensuing worldwide financial disaster happen after all? <br><br>Never mind the problem posed by this unreal, anti-septic world of cubicles and keyboards that too many of us live in. People seemingly can't even deploy grade school arithmetical skills in managing a household budget. You would think that, given the dozen or so years of "education" that people get courtesy of the state, that straight addition and subtraction of numbers would be the easiest and most mundane of functions to exercise. But no. A large proportion of people couldn't even tell you their take home pay. No, seriously. <br><br>It's a multi-faceted problem. It's not one that could be solved, as Mao might have done, by just shipping urban intellectuals to the country-side to harvest crops and feed pigs. It's a problem that requires educrats to do what they say they're doing but aren't, that is, to teach people to think critically and logically, to discern truth from lies, fact from fiction. When it comes to basic issues of money we're mentally saturated and invested in this system of fraud and deceit. It does have the surface shine of legality and legitimacy, mind you, buttressed as it is by well established commercial practices, laws and institutions.<br><br>I'll give a quick example: how many times have you heard it said that shareholders are "owners" of the company? Let me ask another simple question, define "ownership". Well, from a reality based perspective, to "own" is to have the right of use and possession. Can you think of a better, more practical definition? I can't. So, do shareholders "own" the company? No, they don't. Shareholding comes with certain rights attached like the right to have the company managed with a view to earning a profit, the right to a fractional share of a dividend. But, in fact, if it's facts we're concerned with, when it comes to divvying up the money, shareholders come last in line behind everyone else, be they employees, creditors, taxing regimes etc. Hardly constitutes "ownership, does it? When they talk about corporate funds they say "shareholders' money". Bah. <br><br>So, shareholders are "owners" of the company are they? This one of the bedrock falsehoods upon which our system of scams is built. There's more out there. This is just one of the biggest. Swamps and thickets of outright lies, frauds, b.s., illogic, all of it out there for the purpose of separating you from your money. Have you ever sat in front of a financial advisor? Ever listened to the talking head commenters on business news shows? Half of what they say sounds like gobbledy-gook doesn't it? The other half is just so hard to make any sense out of. It's just all so twisty-turny that maybe you really DO need to have a Wharton MBA. Listen, I'll let you in on a little secret. So much of it sounds like gobbledy-gook because it is. So much of it is so hard to make any sense out of because so much of it really doesn't make any sense. You're not crazy and you're not dumb.

Management has the right, within limits, to direct company activities on behalf of shareholders. Does not mean that shareholders own the company. <br><br>I'm not dumping on Americans. North of your border it's the same thing. We're in a fog, we immerse ourselves in the same system of absurdities, we live by it, we willingly surrender our assets and personal interests to its dictates. Why? Because everyone else does it.

However, just like you’ve mentioned before with not being able to quickly move back to a non-oil based agriculture system because we don’t have the infrastructure or knowledge, the same is true of Packet. We had built an infrastructure of mountaintop VHF nodes, computer programs for automated mail delivery and an organized networking system.<br><br>Today, none of those exist anymore. There are no longer any NETROM/TheNet ROMs to put in the non-existent TAPR TNC2 compatible nodes. All the software that did all the BBS functions of message forwarding and delivery are obsolete. Yes, some of the old executable files are still archived on sites like tapr.org and ftp.ucsd.edu but the latest versions are from 2000 or before and need a DOS based computer to run. Almost none of the source code was archived.<br><br>The packet that’s done today is almost all done on a PC with sound card for interfacing to the radio but there’s no BBS or forwarding built-in except by interface to the Internet. All that would have to be re-developed. All the software that was widely used was written by hams that are now either our age or older. Most of the BBS systems I knew of were run by retired hams who had the time to run them and are now either in their 80’s or dead. A tremendous amount of expertise is gone. Forwarding was also done on HF, but Packet is not very suitable for HF, there are now some much better protocols for dealing with the propagation issues that HF has.<br><br>I was involved in Packet from pretty much the beginning, a good friend of mine was one of the founding members of TAPR (Tucson Amateur Packet Radio, pretty much the inventors) and helped build the initial 17 prototype TNC1 TNCs in 1982. Even TAPR doesn’t do anything that has to do with Packet today. I recently thought about getting a TNC on the air again just to see what was there, it took me a while to find a decent one even on ebay. I think most of the hardware has been thrown out. There are a couple companies still making TNCs, but they are mostly used for a few dedicated commercial purposes and aren’t as cheap as they used to be.<br><br>Yes, if you want keyboard-to-keyboard packet can be done today. It’s going to take a lot of hardware, software and infrastructure work to get a system like we had in the late 1980’s-early 1990’s. I wonder… There’s a lot more on this subject, maybe in the next few months when you’re on the air.<br><br><br><a href=#c2222196041423669477 title="comment permalink">8/17/13, 5:56 PM</a><br><br>

I thought it was marginally relevant.<br><br>Getting back to economic viability, I am asking myself how I can use the tools of green wizardry in my own life without the essential ingredient of land. I do not have any more extra money to buy land and I am too old and disilusioned with the system to try to have another career making extra money beyond food and shelter. I have simplified my life tremendously (I drive a bicycle and take buses, I have learned basic gardening skills, I know how to build rocket stoves and weave on a loom and fix mechanical and electrical things, etc), but I don't own either land or money, or basic farming tools. I do still have lots of human energy, but I want to put it into something that I believe in and that will yield food, shelter, human relationships, art and scholarship (basic needs). And I don't want to start farming on my own. Reluctant to do it even with a wife. I think it takes a community. <br><br>So can any of you offer me some land to work on? Perhaps I can be your serf, or maybe we could just share? Wouldn't you rather have me than the angry, killer barbarian hordes? Land ownership seems to be one of those taboo subjects in most circles...Somehow we have been distracted by Progress from owning the things like land tools and materials that make life possible. I don't want all the technological jee-jahs, but I do want land. Do I need to go work as a fusion researcher in order to make money to buy land? I already worked as a semiconductor engineer and gave away my money to people who hopefully will be able to create somewhat of a livelihood in a city.

Most family farms don't provide a steady middle class income; one or more adults in the family has to earn a paycheck in town. I have read that there are many elderly farmers whose children and grandchildren don't want to be farmers and who are looking to train someone younger to take over; there are a few organizations that try to make matches between farm land owners and prospective farmers.<br><br>In California, good agricultural land is very expensive and water rights are hard to come by. However, there is also a lot of rural and exurban property that is not being used intensively and that has adequate space, soil and water to put in a good sized garden. For example, middle class people who own a second home or cabin in the country and want a year round caretaker. Rich people with a horse property who want a stable boy. <br><br>There is a growing interest in the educational value of gardening for children and I think that almost any summer camp would be receptive to an offer from an experienced gardener to put in a kitchen garden and take care of it. Camps and resorts that cater to adults also want to boast that the food they serve is grown locally.<br><br>Reliable, competent gardeners, like reliable, competent handymen and house cleaners, are highly valued by people who have enough money to hire help. The demand is more for growing ornamental plants than edible ones, but edible landscaping is starting to be trendy. If you got a few part time jobs of this sort, the referrals would fetch as much work as you could handle.

If one does not have an existing community or supportive family, I can think of two paths forward, either of which takes time.<br><br>One is to do related activities in one's spare time and hope by doing so to meet up with people who have common interests and compatible skills. The other is to create or join an existing intentional community.<br><br>The intentional communities that have been mentioned on this blog are monasteries and communes, but there is a less drastic form of intentional community called cohousing. Cohousing is an organizational form that allows people to pool resources while also having some private space and transferrable ownership. It is flexible in that people can contribute skills, money or both.

In general, long distance communication that's faster than a rider on a horse is a very good thing to have!<br><br>Iuval, I missed it in the flurry! I recall such stories in science fiction, back in the day, but try to suggest it as a reasonable approach to current issues -- oh man. As for your situation, farming is <i>not</i> the only option, or even necessarily the best one. You have a range of skills; choose a couple and work on getting them to the point that people will gladly trade you things you need for the products of your craft, and you're good to go. Small-to-medium urban centers in the middle of agricultural regions generally do fairly well in ages of decline, so long as they're not right on the main invasion or migration routes. <br><br>Ian, then find your local amateur radio club and get started studying for your license exam! Once you have your "ticket," the doors open very wide indeed. <br><br>Cherokee, I did indeed. As for <i>The Oil Drum</i>, I suspect that was part of it -- peak's here, and now it's time to shift the discussion from whether and when to what to do about it all. <br><br>Phil, that's an oblique reference to the symbolism of <i>A Vision</i>, his work of esoteric philosophy. The cycle of the Moon from new to full and back again is his symbol for the life cycle of any whole system, from a human life to an artistic movement to a civilization, and the "European Moon" is the marker for the stages through which Western civilization passes toward its death. <br><br>Hawlkeye, good. You get today's gold star; down the road, we're going to have to talk about what happens when it no longer makes a profit for anybody to do any economic activity at all -- a condition that comes inevitably in the downslope of a civilization. More on this as we proceed!<br><br><a href=#c3305913042699465409 title="comment permalink">8/18/13, 11:02 AM</a><br><br>

I wasn't clear enough before. I am not so much looking for a way to have a livelihood in the current economy (I have that settled, sort of), or a (even partially) collapsed economy. I am looking for a life that inspires me (and has the potential to inspire others), and producing most of my calories with other people is one ingredient in that. See my response to Deborah below.<br><br>Dear Deborah Bender, thanks for your advice. I am in the US (Central coast of CA right now) and I am aware of the water, farm and land situation. I don't think most family farmers would let me have their farms. I was on several such farms and they would rather sell the farms and give the money to their offspring, or give it to a church. Perhaps if I had stayed longer and developed more of a relationship, but it didn't seem likely. I am also aware of WWOOF and am wondering if any WWOOFers ever get land from the farms they are working at. I think it's mostly a master-serf relationship, which is not really what I'm looking for (though there are “enlightened” masters, like the one I am currently working for at a retreat center, who has got a heart of gold) . I'd like to be able to participate in decision-making either in an IC (like you mentioned), or in a village setting where each family has their own land, but much mutual aid and mutual culture happens. But I can't afford land or most IC joining fees. I have no interest in suburban or urban intensive agriculture at this point (though I did it in the past when I started an urban IC which seems to be thriving), because I don't like cities, and I am interested in producing most of my calories (in conjunction with people in my IC or village), which means grains and beans and/or meat, which means extensive agriculture, not just intensive. I also tried the caretaker for rich people route on an island in NH for a few months, which was nice while it lasted, but not good for a longterm situation.<br>My ex-girlfriend worked for a children's camp and daycare program that had a big gardening component (started by the wife of a Dean at Duke University). I have no interest in doing this for a living. I want to produce food for me, my family and my village, not for rich people, or rich people's cute programs, whether they are retreat centers, camps for kids, edible landscaping, or ornamental plants.<br>As far as ICs, I've only found one I really like, but ironically they don't want me at this point (I don't get along with the alpha male). I am working on finding people with mutual desires and interests. I think I am too far on the fringe though to resonate with anyone. I have left my tribe of scientists and engineers, but have probably taken too much of their worldview with me to make me appealing to most folks in the IC movement, or permaculture folks. Perhaps there is something for me in another country. My old timer Israeli Kibbutznick friend told me not to try to start an IC in the US because they have an ethos of rugged individualism and don't know how to cooperate unless they are forced to or have a leader telling them what to do. Perhaps he was right, but the individualism has its advantages as well.<br><br><a href=#c6180925679374163231 title="comment permalink">8/18/13, 8:35 PM</a><br><br>

You are a most pleasant character.<br><br>There is no reason a woman cannot be an electrician and wire a house. But I think that the fossil fuels is hiding both men's and women's hard work. I don't know that women's roles were regarded with contempt so much as the women themselves...this in my opinion is a poison that has led to some of the imbalances of some branches of feminist thought. I started by objecting to the bumper sticker that says women have no need of men, which only makes sense to someone living an artificial lifestyle.<br><br>I don't know about meat and grains. A lifestyle without fossil fuels is going to require some hard work, and without the strength of men, women would be in a bit of trouble. That doesn't mean that women's work is less necessary. What worries me is when women deny that, because it indicates to me that they have actually bought into the old contempt, and are trying to make up for it in the only way they know how. <br>As for herbs, I am totally into it!

We just call it a pot-luck cider-pressing party; everyone brings different kinds of apples and pears and something to eat, and takes turns at the press. All the kids love to grind the apples to help out, certain party-poopers who dread the chit-chat can roll up their sleeves and yes, rub elbow-grease with a neighbor they've yet to meet.<br><br>For many folks who attend, this is perhaps their first experience of a common-purpose work gathering with a big group of people that's also fun and enlivening. Sometimes parties can be as vapid and dreary as cable-injected "entertainment". This is quite different, and it resonates deeply in the collective memory.<br><br>And everyone goes home with gallons of cider, the beer-makers have gained a few converts, the canners have traded peppers for their salsas... and the invisible ties that bind have been softly woven among strangers without their noticing.<br><br>I know we're all going to need to help each other out in ways not all of us can yet imagine. Yet it's far too easy these days to get clobbered into the Doomer box by banging on about the gory details. It's so much better to plant the seeds by modeling examples of inter-dependent community living.<br><br>And because this party is specifically in the fall around a harvest activity, it prepares the common ground for the idea of feeding each other in all kinds of ways. It helps to activate this dormant notion of engaging the project of food-supply with each other, instead of the truck-stop grocers. <br><br>With each passing season the gathering grows; more and more neighbors lift their glasses to each other in common cause.

My point was that cutting waste in the US is enough to shake the oil markets.

He had a household accident that severed part of his ear, and ended up in the ER of the nearest hospital. It was early morning, and only one doctor was there to stitch the ear back on.<br><br>In the middle of surgery, the doctor received a phone call on his cell phone, and left the surgery to guide a truck from the water authority to his home. This is necessary, my friend noted, because to get water, you have to call the water authority, which will send around a delivery truck. If you miss the truck, it will be at least another 24 hours before you can get water: when demand is high, you can get pushed back in the queue and have to wait several days.

As far as the IC fees, I think if you include in the join fee the price of the land and house, it comes out in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. this is not the case for the Possibility Alliance where you join for free and it costs just a few thousand to build a small house for a family (out of cob, strawbale and locally milled lumber or unmilled wood).

Investments of energy in a place that had declined more gently would be extra-profitable if they were paid back in electricity savings within the dominion of the priestesses.<br><br>I don't doubt the cost-effectiveness of skilled operators, but mechanical error-correction algorithms can more-fluently negotiate the tradeoff between redundancy and efficiency, allowing information to be conveyed with the bare minimum of power needed to achieve the specified certainty and speed. Digital messages can go very, very far for the energy, so long as the "listener" is inhumanly patient with noise.<br><br>A handful of 140-character ASCII news reports would take a lot less energy to transmit and especially to receive than a few minutes of audio. Not only might this savings in electricity recoup the cost of an integrated circuit over its lifetime, such a system would also justify the privileges of feudalism in a culture where weapons access is democratic. <br><br>By the way, there are myriad ways to substitute skilled labor for fossil fuels in IC fabrication. Designs tolerant of a less-controlled cleanroom would go a long way toward this goal: The circuits I'm imagining would be fabricated as a range of smaller, less-specialized circuits, with only a single layer of metal; creative people would then use a probe station to examine each die, and decide what can be made from those devices that haven't been ruined by dust, ultimately fashioning a device via manual wirebonding. Such a circuit would probably take less energy to fabricate than building just its analog portion out of hand-blown vacuum tubes (though I guess ruinmen could find plenty of W, Mo, and glass, work in any of these media requires a lot of fuel, W above all), even if we don't account for the greater service life possible in ICs. Each guild of microfabricators would be able to supply its portion of the global electronics market using a single set of masks. Masters would keep up the guild's supply of masks, and would carry out a few special projects, via electron-beam lithography; time on any working SEM would of course be very dear, and a handful of the wealthiest guilds in the world would likely vye to have the most-operational one.<br><br>Even if I'm right and digital devices would allow access to a network nice enough to justify their expense, it would be wise to design them to also interface with a parallel network on which humans can communicate via Morse code without any digital processing.<br><br><a href=#c5944371027267390519 title="comment permalink">8/19/13, 7:01 PM</a><br><br>

One older couple has been there many years, and another couple joined 4-5 years ago. They have been looking with very little success for other couples or families to join.<br><br>They get very few nibbles, and so far none have been appropriate or they have evaporated.<br>I'll give you a couple of examples. There was a young couple, and the man was going to build a cob house. Anyway, there was some kind of porch he built, and it was immediately apparent to anyone who had done any construction, that he had no idea of what was adequate support. They tried to tell him, but he wouldn't hear it. It came down in the first storm. He was planning a vegetable garden, and the two couples told him there was no sun there. These are people who have been gardening all their adult lives. But this young whippersnapper said that he didn't believe that would be a problem because plants evolved in forests and jungles! Anyway, they left and it seemed that they had talked a good line, but their real interest in the place was that the land was free. No real interest in community and not capable of it. So - now there is a small join fee.<br><br>They got an inquiry recently from a single woman, a vegan in her mid fifties, who thought that it was reasonable to ask the other two couples, who are in their fifties and sixties, to build her a house.<br><br>This location is very rural, east coast, not so much employment opportunities, not a very educated populace, and the land is fairly raw. A clearing for a garden, and a house would be needed. I certainly would recommend a wife...<br><br>Each household is fairly independent, but some sharing is welcome and desired. They want to have more people and community. What people often don't get is how hard and how much work it is to create a homestead.<br>One of them is Catholic, and so far as I know the others are pagan.<br>There are some real hurdles, but if you want you can ask for my email.<br><br><br><a href=#c559393609184205990 title="comment permalink">8/19/13, 10:07 PM</a><br><br>

My point is they are all nice things, but obstacles can be formidable..<br><br>Some reflections on radio, repairs..<br><br>I remembered having watched a movie depicting a positive figure using radio communication to save the planet after modern communications failed. "That is brilliant! Make be I should get on with it..." Then it daunted on me, probably there also be no policemen (self defense against armed robbers?), no water supply (digging a deep hole underground?), no vegetable (get a decent house with a backyard? can't afford it in cosmopolitan HK).... "Afterall it is a movie..." I rationalized and forgave myself for lack of action.<br><br>In HK we can't get a repair man who charges reasonably (the repair charge of manufacturer after warranty is as much as half the newest model with more functions!) to repair our old appliance (we buy a new one...so wasteful!) because people can't make a decent living that way. Some people take an interest to do their own repair (I do for simple things too). Once in a while, local news would report a brave guy burned his appliance during repair (in rare cases also his flat), afterall we are all amateurs without proper training. But no complaints, boxers got head injuries. Fighting is fun and so is appliance repair.<br><br>In China appliance repair is a dying industry (dead in HK). I chatted with one owner once and he told me that he could feed his family well with repairing old appliances "But I like my boy to go to University and earn more!" Sure he does. "Do you teach your boy to do repair?" "I am eager to, but he aspires to be a pop singer! I hope I can find an apprentice...."<br><br>In case any of you have kids who are good at mechanical things and who are interested to learn old appliance repair and don't mind to be an apprentice at a small shop in China, there will be lots of opportunities.

It is hard not too to ignore them when you live in a forest, after all. Over here there is a debate about indigenous versus exotic and from my perspective it seems largely ideologically driven. My reason for this perspective is that the forest here has been modified by humans for the past 40 to 60 millennia so there is no such thing as a "natural" untouched forest left. I even understand that historically in the Middle Ages, parts of Europe were largely deforested for agriculture, meaning that they have the same predicament, for different reasons. I'm searching for some sense of meaning in this ideological debate and it is seems overly complex. If I may be so bold to ask, what is your take on the subject (from a historical point of view)?<br><br>Hi Deborah,<br><br>Australia is something of an island. Did you know that Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia (it's a big island) has some of the last pure strains of Ligurian bees? We don't have Dutch elm disease and so we have some of the world’s last great stands of elm avenues too (not far from here). Varroa mite is unheard of, but I'm unsure about chestnut blight as it may well be that we have European chestnuts as well as the Asian or American chestnuts. The trees are spread so far apart geographically, that you just never know what is lurking about the place here.<br><br>PS: Still haven't had a bad mead yet, but this may well be my taste buds and it does get better as it matures. The scrumpy is improving as I add sugar to the brew. It was an error to use natural (ie. low sugar) apple juice. Apples don't generally have enough natural sugars to produce the expected sweet / dry cider.<br><br>Onething,<br><br>Thank you, that is a very pleasant sentiment. No worries, there's just plenty to eat other than grains and meat (we forget that in such well-fed times!) and women's contributions to food were historically more consistent than men's. Of course it makes sense that the gender divide is exposed for the divide and conquer strategy that it is. Vegetables and fruit can produce quite a lot of calories in a diet. Glad to hear that you are boning up on herb lore as it is important stuff and should serve you well now and into the future.<br><br>Hi Hanshishiro,<br><br>Thanks for the link as I wouldn't have thought of that. Smoking can be used as a preserving method with many foodstuffs. I still have a lot of last seasons dried walnuts in the kitchen and they are really yummy.<br><br>Gotta bounce!<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c6961134533504099654 title="comment permalink">8/20/13, 4:14 AM</a><br><br>

The underlying conceptual design of a TCP packet, whether sent over fibre or to an aerial, is beautiful, as one sees from, e.g., from Eric Hall's book <i>Internet Core Protocols: The Definitive Guide</i>. <br><br>As a robust cyber-radio alternative to packet, one might consider PSK31. I have not used packet. PSK31, on the other hand, I did use a bit, before our misguided University of Toronto closed down its radio-club shack and forced me to start working toward a shack of my own. <br><br>PSK31 does not have the error-correction ("SYNCHRONIZE" and "ACKNOWLEDGE") capabilities built into TCP/IP. In compensation, it is easy to use. You point and click on a computer radio-spectrum display, and you see a stream of text, and then you type your own text in and hit a send-it-out icon, and that's about it. <br><br>This must be the Nirvana for which the radioteletype hams were so sweatily striving, from the late 1940s onward. <br><br>In the long run, we will have to say good bye to TCP packets and to PSK31 and to any other kind of ham radio that relies on computers. Then we will be back to radiotelegraphy, i.e., "CW" (in which I train 6 days a week, for the most part running the MFJ-418 Pocket Morse Code Tutor at 20 words/minute, on random CW "words" assembled by the MFJ-418 from the FCC set of 43 characters). <br><br>A few weeks ago on this blog, I cited the 1950s-and-1960s 28-tube R-390A as arguably the best-ever HF receiver. A rig in the spirit of the R-390A would be appropriate for robust CW in a post-Internet future. <br><br>But last night, I noted an additional good rig, which I may as well mention here: the partly solid-state, partly vacuum-tube, perhaps-circa-1986, Kenwood TS-830S transceiver. One source for writeups and opinions on the TS-830S is eham.net.<br> <br>At eham.net, the general feeling seems to be that the TS-830S is a classic. <br><br>I additionally gather from a quick check of the Web that the TS-830S is in some sense capable of at least some repairs in the home workshop. Admittedly, it is unlikely to be as home-repairable as the circa-1960 Heathkit Comanche and Cheyenne that I picked up this year for 250 Canadian dollars, since it in all probability has some integrated circuits, sitting not on point-to-point wiring but on a printed circuit board. And the design of the circuitry is likely to be so elaborate as to preclude the full component-by-component understanding that is a proper aspiration for 1960-vintage Heathkit owners. <br><br>When you look at the TS-830S front panel in photos, you get a sense of how wonderful ham radio still was a scant three decades ago: there still are the 1960-style controls for "drive" and "loading", and there is even a control for "heater" (to turn cathode heaters or off, I guess, for the tubes in the final stage of transmitter amplification). Although there is a convenient digital frequency readout, there are none of those silly 21st-century buttons for "memories". <br><br>The whole thing looks somehow calm, a greeting from a sane past. <br><br><br><br>Sincerely, <br>working <br>on this thing and that<br>(antenna theory, circuit theory,...) <br>so that I can go to air with CW<br>in perhaps 2014, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>VA3KMZ<br>approx 25 km north of Toronto core<br><a href=http://www.metascientia.com/ rel=nofollow>www punkt metascientia punkt com</a><br><br><a href=#c2871907749641179098 title="comment permalink">8/20/13, 11:26 AM</a><br><br>

I am sure you are right.<br><br>Over the past half century, I've been involved with several benign subcultures in Northern California. I have noticed a continual growth in the size and variety of outdoor gatherings and festivals that are participatory, staffed mostly by volunteers, and which blur the lines between performers and audiences. <br><br>Americans spend most of their lives being lectured by experts and entertained by celebrities. They hunger for a chance to offer something of themselves to an appreciative audience and to experience a community that is egalitarian and gently self-organizing, even when it is only a temporary respite from "the real world". <br><br>For some people, the first experience of a community that notices and values all its members and is based on voluntary mutual exchange rather than commerce and competition is so profound that they organize the rest of their lives around seasonal escapes into a festival subculture.<br><br>Manya of these festivals and their communities are centered on some form of art, historical reenactment or alternative spirituality. Art and spirituality are important but for most people are not entirely real unless grounded in and expressed by something practical and material, like cider press stations and cob ovens. More events like the Possibility Alliance get-together you described are very much needed.<br><br><a href=#c3259616970242859135 title="comment permalink">8/20/13, 11:47 PM</a><br><br>

That's a virtue, because it prevents home networks from interfering with each other. <br><br>If you want to talk to your neighbors, you can buy unlicensed "Family Radio Service" (FRS) radios at many retail stores. <br><br>If you want to cover a county, use VHF (aka "2-meters") or UHF ("70cm", "440" MHz) FM-voice ham radio, with a repeater station up on a tower. You'll need a "Technician Class" license from the FCC, which means passing a multiple-choice test designed, like a driving test, to make sure that you know the rules for safety and polite coexistence.<br><br>To cover a region (such as my Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia), HF at 3.5-4.0 MHz is good after dark. For that, you'll probably need to upgrade your FCC license to "General Class". Another test.<br><br>To work Europe or all of North America, HF in the 14 MHz band seems to work best lately. (HF performance depends on sun spots, though, and can be plagued by lightning noise.)<br><br>There is an "Extra Class" license which grants access to a little more HF spectrum, for those who pass a yet more difficult test.<br><br>None of the amateur radio tests require competence in Morse Code (any more).<br><br>For every ham frequency band, there's a way to send digital data. Higher frequencies tend to provide faster transmission, as do more expensive modems.<br><br>A note on privacy: when you get a license, your call sign, name, and home address become accessible through the FCC's license database web site. Other web sites (such as QRZ.com) apparently scrape the database to make your information more readily available to the public. This is, I believe, so that if your neighbors hear you on their non-ham radios, they can pound on your door to complain.<br><br><a href=#c4091447174914094452 title="comment permalink">8/21/13, 7:06 PM</a><br><br>

(or whose ritual theaters are perhaps a bit more real and meaningful -or at least discussable and analyzable in empirical and logical and evidence based terms....than than -let us just say - "run of the mill" ritual theaters? <br><br>Example: the Roman Catholic church has its own rituals and also its own ritual theater; and so does atheism; and in a different way so does experimental physics and its relationship to theoretical physics. <br><br>Are all these ritual theaters equal, equivalent or are some ritual theaters perhaps "more equal than others"?
