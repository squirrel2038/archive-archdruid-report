Today’s debates over hydrofracturing (“fracking”) oil-bearing shales, the theme of last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, have dimensions that go well beyond the world of ritual theater discussed there. To begin with, of course, a great deal of money is being made off the current fracking boom by assorted Wall Street office fauna, and their efforts to keep the gravy train rolling for their benefit doubtless have quite a bit to do with the remarkable disregard for mere geological reality to be found in so much pro-fracking propaganda these days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br>
That sort of strained relationship with fact is a sufficiently standard feature of speculative bubbles that it ought to be high up there on the checklist of any connoisseur of financial lunacy. Those of my readers who recall the details of the late housing bubble will doubtless think of the enthusiasm shown then for what were called NINJA loans—that is, loans given to borrowers who had no income and no jobs or assets, but who would one and all, so bankers insisted with straight faces, pay back those loans religiously out of the money they were sure to make flipping properties. The same logic doubtless governs the equally earnest insistence that the ferocious depletion rates that afflict fracked wells simply don’t matter, that kerogen shales like the Green River formation that have resisted every previous attempt to get oil out of them have suddenly transformed themselves into nice extractable oil shales for our benefit, and that the results of wells drilled in the best possible “sweet spots” in each formation must inevitably be repeated by every available wellsite in the region. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here, as with the countless other examples that might be put on display by some Dickensian Spirit of Speculative Bubbles Past, the understandable desire to make a fast buck off other people’s cluelessness might seem to offer an adequate explanation for the bumper crop of fatuous twaddle that’s being pushed by the pundits and splashed around so freely by the media these days. Still, I’ve come to think that there’s more going on here than the passion for emptying the pockets of chumps that sets the cold sick heart of Wall Street throbbing, and indeed that there’s even more at work than our culture’s touching habit, discussed over the last two weeks, of reenacting the traditional morality plays of the civil religion of progress in order to console the faithful in difficult times. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Plunge into the heart of the fracking storm, rather, and you’ll find yourself face to face with a foredoomed attempt to maintain one of the core beliefs of the civil religion of progress in the teeth of all the evidence. The stakes here go far beyond making a bunch of financiers their umpteenth million, or providing believers in the myth of progress with a familiar ritual drama to bolster their faith; they cut straight to the heart of that faith, and thus to some of the most fundamental presuppositions that are<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>guiding today’s industrial societies along their road to history’s scrapheap. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Since the days of Sir Francis Bacon, whose writings served as the first draft of the modern mythology of progress, one of the central themes of that mythology has been the conquest of Nature by humanity—or rather, in the more revealing language of an earlier day, by Man. You aren’t Man, in case you were wondering, and neither am I; neither is Sir Francis Bacon, for that matter, nor is anyone else who’s ever lived or will ever live.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This person called Man, rather, is a mythical hero who gives the civil religion of progress its central figure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just as devout Christians participate vicariously in the life of Christ through the celebration of the sacraments and the seasons of the liturgical year, believers in progress are supposed to participate vicariously in Man’s heroic journey from the caves to the stars by purchasing hot new products, and oohing and aahing appreciatively whenever the latest shiny technological trinket is unveiled by Man’s lab-coated priesthood. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Man’s destiny is to conquer Nature. That’s his one and only job, according to the myth, and when Man’s not doing that, he’s not doing anything worthwhile at all. Read any of the standard histories of Man written by true believers in the civil religion of progress, and you’ll see that societies and eras that devoted their energies to art, music, religion, literature, or anything else you care to name other than extending Man’s dominion over Nature are dismissed as irrelevant to Man’s history, when they’re not critiqued outright for falling down on the job.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You may be thinking by this point, dear reader, that a belief system that likes to portray humanity as a tyrant and conqueror<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma"> rightfully entitled to view the entire cosmos as its own private lebensraum </span>may not be particularly sensible, or for that matter particularly sane. You may well be right, too, but I’d like to focus on a somewhat more restricted point:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>according to this way of looking at things, Nature is not supposed to put up more than a pro forma struggle or a passive resistance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Above all, once any part of Nature is conquered, it’s supposed to stay conquered—and of course that’s where the trouble creeps in, because a great many of the things we habitually lump together as Nature are refusing to go along with the script. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Examples come to mind by the dozens, but one of the most significant and frightening just now is the collapse of the most important health revolution of modern times, the conquest (that word again) of bacterial disease by antibiotics. I’m not sure how many of my readers realize what an immense change in human life followed Alexander Fleming’s 1928 discovery that a substance excreted by bread mold killed most bacteria without harming human cells. A century ago, dysentery and bacterial pneumonia were leading causes of death in most industrial countries, killing far more people than heart disease or cancer, and the odds of living from birth to age five had an uncomfortable resemblance to a throw of the dice even in wealthy countries. Penicillin and the antibiotics that followed it changed that decisively, enabling doctors to stop bacterial diseases in their tracks. It’s because of antibiotics that I’m here to write this blog; the scarlet fever that had me flat on my back for weeks when I was seven years old would almost certainly have killed me if antibiotics hadn’t been available. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Outside the public health and infectious disease fields, most people remain serenely convinced that the relative freedom from bacterial disease that’s characterized the recent past in the industrial world is destined to remain fixed in place for the rest of time. Within those fields, by contrast, that comfortable conviction finds few takers. Penicillin, the antibiotic that saved my life in 1969, won’t even slow down most microbes now. Diseases that used to yield readily to an injection or two now have to be treated with complex cocktails of increasingly toxic antibiotics, and every year more pathogens turn up that are resistant to some, most, or all available antibiotics. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s plenty of blame to go around, at least for those who want to play the blame game. It’s been common since the 1950s for physicians to prescribe antibiotics for conditions antibiotic therapy can’t treat—for example, the common cold. It’s been equally common since the 1950s for livestock farms to give their animals daily doses of antibiotics, since (for complex biochemical reasons) this causes the animals to gain weight more quickly, and thus be worth more money at slaughtering time. Both these bad habits helped give bacteria the widest possible range of opportunities to develop resistance. Still, these and other contributing factors simply help feed the main issue, which is that bacterial evolution didn’t come to a sudden stop when Fleming started paying attention to bread mold. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve commented several times in this blog that understanding evolution is crucial for making sense of the predicament of the industrial world, and the approaching end of the antibiotic era offers a solid example of the reasons why.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Evolution through natural selection is the process by which living things adapt themselves to environmental changes; it works through individual organisms, but its effects are not limited to the individual scale. In the case of the spread of antibiotic resistance among microbes, there are at least three patterns at work. First, microbes are being selected for their resistance to individual antibiotics. Second, as new antibiotics are brought out to replace old ones, microbes are being selected for their ability to develop resistance to one antibiotic after another as quickly as possible. Finally, the pressure exerted on the entire microbial biosphere by the pervasive presence of antibiotics in the modern environment is giving a huge selective advantage to species that have the ability to exchange genes for resistance with other species. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The results are being documented in increasingly worried articles in public health journals. A large and growing number of pathogenic microbes these days are already resistant to the antibiotics that used to treat them; new antibiotics brought onto the market start running into problems with resistant bacteria in a fraction of the time that was once necessary for resistance to emerge; and the transfer of antibiotic resistance from one species to another is becoming an increasingly troubling problem. The possibility of a return to pre-1928 conditions, when a simple bacterial infection could readily turn into a death sentence and most families buried at least one child before the age of five, is seeing serious discussion in the professional literature. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As already mentioned, though, such worries are falling on deaf ears outside the public health and infectious-disease fields. There’s a mordant irony in the reason why, though I suspect it’s not often relished outside of the peak oil scene and a few other places where the same logic appears. Faced with the prospect of the end of the antibiotic era and the return of bacterial illnesses as major threats to public health, most<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>politicians, like the people they’re supposed to serve, respond with an overfamiliar sentence:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Oh, I’m sure they’ll think of something.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The increasingly frantic efforts of researchers to find new antibiotics and stay ahead of the remorselessly rising tide of microbial resistance get no more attention than the equally frantic efforts, say, of drilling companies to find petroleum deposits to make up for the increasingly rapid depletion of existing oil fields. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In both cases, and in any number of others, the myth of progress is the most important barrier in the way of a meaningful response to our predicament.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>According to the myth, we can’t go backwards to any condition encountered in the past; what Man conquers is supposed to stay conquered, so he can continue his ever-victorious journey from the caves to the stars. It’s unthinkable, in terms of the myth, that the supposed conquest of some part of nature—say, bacterial disease—might represent nothing more than a temporary advantage that the pressures of natural selection will soon erase. Thus when this latter turns out to be the case, those believers in the religion of progress who aren’t forced to confront such awkward realities in their work or their daily lives simply repeat the sacred words<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Oh, I’m sure they’ll think of something,” to invoke the blessing of the great god Progress on His only begotten son, Man, and then proceed to act as though nothing could possibly go wrong. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty, of course, is that an embarrassingly large portion of the territory supposedly conquered by Man over the last three centuries is showing an awkward propensity to ignore Man’s overlordship and do what it wants instead. The much-ballyhooed Green Revolution of the mid-20th century is another case in point. The barrage of fertilizers and poisons the proponents of that movement turned on agriculture won a temporary advantage over the hard subsistence limits of earlier eras, but it was only temporary. The reckless use of artificial fertilizers turned out to have drastic downsides, while the poisons drove insects and weeds into exactly the same frenzy of intensive natural selection that antibiotics brought to the microbial world. Insects and weeds don’t reproduce as quickly or swap genetic material with the same orgiastic abandon as microbes, but the equivalent changes are happening at a slightly slower pace; one of the dirty secrets of conventional agriculture is that herbicide resistance among weeds and pesticide resistance among insects and other agricultural pests are spreading rapidly, erasing the short-term gains of the Green Revolution while leaving the long-term costs in lost topsoil and poisoned water tables to be paid by generations to come. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Farmers faced by resistant weeds and pests, like physicians faced by resistant microbes, are turning to increasingly desperate measures to get the same results that their equivalents got with much less trouble. That’s exactly the situation that’s driving the current fracking boom and bubble, too. Back in the glory days of petroleum exploration and discovery, drillers could punch a well a few hundred feet into the ground and hit oil; now it takes hugely expensive deepwater drilling, tar sands extraction, or hydrofracturing of shale and other “tight oil” deposits to keep the liquid fuel flowing, and the costs keep rising year after year.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The implication that has to be faced is that the age of petroleum, and everything that unfolded from it, was exactly the same sort of temporary condition as the age of antibiotics and the Green Revolution. Believers in the religion of progress like to think that Man conquered distance and made the world smaller by inventing internal combustion engines, aircraft, and an assortment of other ways to burn plenty of petroleum products. What actually happened, though, was that drilling rigs and a few other technologies gave our species a temporary boost of cheap liquid fuel to play with, and we proceeded to waste most of it on the assumption that Nature’s energy resources had been conquered and could be expected to fork over another cheap abundant energy source as soon as we wanted one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That follows logically from the myth, but it doesn’t follow in reality. Instead, the temporary advantage our species gained by exploiting all that cheap, easily accessible petroleum is being brought to an end by factors even more implacable than the constant pressure of natural selection on niche boundaries: the simple facts that a finite planet by definition only contains a finite amount of any given resource, and that deposits of every resource are distributed according to the power law—the rule, consistently true across an impressive range of fields, that larger deposits are much less common than smaller ones. Those factors are not going away; the fact that Wall Street office fauna are shoveling smoke about, ahem, “limitless amounts of oil and natural gas” from fracked wells, may make them their umpteenth million and keep the clueless neatly sedated for a few more years, but it’s not going to do a thing to change the hard facts of the predicament that’s closing around us all.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Seen in this light, the mythology of Man’s conquest of Nature bears an uncomfortable resemblance to a certain other campaign of conquest launched to the sound of blaring brass bands and overconfident pronouncements in the not too distant past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Like German civilians tuning in to news broadcasts from Berlin in the heady summer of 1941, people in the world’s industrial nations have taken in any number of proclamations about Man’s latest glorious victories in the war against Nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The conquest of disease, the conquest of hunger, the conquest of air and space and distance itself—is there <i>any</i> scientific or technological success, however temporary, that hasn’t been praised in those fatuous terms?—each had its fifteen minutes of fame as Man’s heroic legions of science and progress pursued their allegedly invincible <i>Drang nach Sternen</i>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Some time ago, though, the content of the propaganda broadcasts began to change, though their tone did not. Nuclear fusion seems to have played much the same role in Man’s conquest of Nature that Moscow played in that other campaign, the goal that seemed almost in reach time and again, but never quite fell into the hands so greedily outstretched for it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Other campaigns meant to push the frontiers of Man’s dominion further out into Nature’s unconquered territory have had equally mixed luck, and even the immense effort that put an American flag on the Moon turned out to have no more influence on the course of events than the rather less challenging campaign by an SS mountain battalion that put a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>different flag on the summit of the highest mountain in the Caucasus range. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s what followed that relative stalemate, though, that’s of importance here. Beginning in 1943, the German civilians tuning in to those radio broadcasts from Berlin had to deal with an increasing burden of cognitive dissonance, as the heroic battles and triumphant victories breathlessly announced by Goebbels’ acolytes stopped moving eastwards on the map and started shifting back toward the west. The forces that had been sweeping everything before them in the suburbs of Moscow were now doing the same thing in the vicinity of Smolensk, with no explanation of the change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor was there any clearer explanation to be had as Germany’s glorious victories shifted steadily westwards, past Minsk and Warsaw and Breslau, until nervous listeners in the Berlin suburbs, just before the broadcasts stopped for good, could hear the sound of artillery rattling their own windows.<br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left">
<span style='font-family: Times; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>The question that all would-be conquerors need to ask themselves, in other words, is what will happen if their planned campaign of conquest fails. None of the 17th-century thinkers who played a role in launching humanity on its assault on Nature seems to have posed that question, even in private, much less tried to think through the answers. I’d encourage my readers to have this in mind when the latest reports of glorious victories place these latter more and more often in territory that was supposedly conquered in earlier campaigns. I’d also encourage them, to push the metaphor a step further, to think about what terms of surrender might be demanded of us when Man’s grand attempt to conquer Nature ends in defeat—something we’ll discuss further next week.</span></div>

Godwin!! <br><br>... ;) ... jk<br><br>This week I was listening to an interview by Tony Wright about his book, "Left in the Dark", which posits that prehistoric humans had much better left/right brain integration than humans do today, when the left-brain seems hugely dominant. (I will answer your question about terms of surrender, I promise!) <br><br>According to Mr. Wright and various pop-culture interpretations, even though both our hemispheres are involved in all mental tasks, the left-brain is basically the seat of abstraction, remove, theory, and mental distance. The left-brain looks for theoretical/mathematical laws and doesn't deal with the here and now, nor with the people and objects in front of your eyes. The right-brain lives in the moment and in the situation, observing and accepting and appreciating what is in front of your eyes without bothering to make abstractions, generalizations, or rules about those things.<br><br>Mr. Wright believes that what currently passes for human intelligence is a degraded form of the left/right-brain harmony that our ancestors used to have. When we moved away from our prehistoric diet, our brain functions decayed, and our modern mode of thought and civilization -- based on rules, abstractions, math -- is essentially a brain malfunction.<br><br>So back to your question. When the dust settles -- thousands of years after the resource wars, natural disasters, and Nature reconquering Man -- the terms of surrender may well include (a) greatly reduced population, living only in the most idoneous ecological niche that our species is adapted to; and (b) giving up what we think of today as "human intelligence". <br><br>The vision that leaps to mind when you ask your question, after I heard Wright's interview, is that of a human species that is content to live off the natural fruits of the land with a bare minimum of machination (and of course this implies a far smaller population). The ultimate post-collapse Man does not share with Modern Man the driving greed and ambition which makes us today not only want to grow and accumulate wealth in an endless linear fashion, but also to that end, to want to take apart the universe like a boy investigating a pocket watch or a transistor radio. <br><br>Unfortunately unlike the curious young boy with the radio, we do not have the option to get or buy another planet when we take this one apart and find we lack the knowledge to put it back together again properly.<br><br>Who knows, perhaps future post-collapse Man in my vision, with his brain harmony, will still understand language, still appreciate modern Man's art and literature, could amicably converse with modern Man if any survived. They may not be all that different from us in any measurable or tangible sense. But the post-collapse Man would simply lack the ambition and the urge to screw around with the building blocks of the world, because post-collapse Man would be too busy enjoying it harmoniously on its own merits to bother taking it apart. We wouldn't necessarily _lose_ the abstraction and understanding of greater principles, which our left-brain provides. That abstraction ability would instead find a more harmonious place among a better-integrated lifestyle, rather than dominating nearly every waking moment as it does today.<br><br><a href=#c2575352463878952556 title="comment permalink">8/28/13, 9:59 PM</a><br><br>

More broadly, though, there's a terror of time and change that pervades contemporary thought, and gives us all those images of the future in which nothing significant ever changes again -- I'll be talking about that down the road a bit, when I have a better sense of how to do so. <br><br>Tom, excellent.

Not something to mess with!

What does or doesn't happen thousands of years from now is an interesting question; what I'm hoping to discuss is what's happening right now -- namely, the decline and fall of industrial civilization and its established civil religion of progress, and the replacement of these by dark age transitional societies on the one hand, and new religious forms on the other.

Antibiotic resistance. Bacteria do have a great propensity to transfer DNA from species to species. Since this was considered a characteristic of sexual reproduction in bacteria I have been seeing more and more suggestions that applying species concepts to bacteria is a bit meaningless.<br><br>There is a potentially future good side to this exchange of DNA and that is what is gained easily can be lost just as easily. Antibiotic resistance is an added metabolic burden for a bacterium. In a future without large scale use of antibiotics, most bacteria are likely to lose their resistance eventually being outcompeted by non-resistant bacteria. Thus penicillin is likely to regain some or all of its lost efficiency. Hopefully we will still know how to produce it, at least in small quantities required for judicious but 'essential' use.<br><br>Just a small question. An oddity in your blog (and in Stars Reach) that has intrigued me for some time, is that the last paragraph in most posts are in a different font.

Are the green wizards also dusting off 1970′s self help manuals?"<br>What we need is group therapy. Moving out of "comfort zones". <br>Perhaps I am being crotchety, but in a system as "tightly coupled" as ours is (for the purpose of maximally screwing the planet, fellow man, &amp; if possible, God's order itself), a future in which "man" re-enacts Oedipus Rex seems highly likely, indeed probable. <br><br>I think the "green" and liberal movements, "crunchy" though many of their constituency is, are living in a relatively artificial world, in which men are not subject to terrible thirsts and desires for things to excess, particularly status, comfort, and violence/sex. I estimate that as many as 50% of humans can be categorized as this way, with the remaining bulk (40%) prey to ideologies and blinkered worldviews. For their chance to succeed would require abolishing democracy, &amp; making sure that the 10% or so of humans who are recognizably "virtuous" were actually Solonic or Platonic lawgivers, revered sages who ruled over villages, counties, nations, and Empires. <br><br>No, I think you have it, at the end of the day.

I would also be aware that an even more compelling case against progress can be made with the overall health of our society.

It would be easy to argue that the last 20 years of an american's life are much more miserable then they were in the 1970's and 1950's with higher rates of cancer, diabetes and autoimmune disorders.

I will have a wife soon but no kids. However, what else can I do besides move to a medium small town where I can attempt to; connect/create community, become more self sufficient, adapt to a simpler lower energy lifestyle? I am sometimes at a loss at the complexity of trying to set myself and my loved ones up to endure and thrive in such a fragile world.

Is there a path you recommend between Apocalypse and Progress on a personal level? <br><br>Sometime I feel we are on the edge of a paradigm shift in attitudes towards progress and materialism that will only be breached by an economic crisis/discontinuity (dollar collapse?).

Like the new reality (since 2005) that students can take out loans from private banks and have government protection for those loans against bankruptsy. So the system of "moneyed interests" has protected themselves from loss at the expense of the young (and foolish). And the housing boom and bust shows another example, underwater mortgages where self-interest should tell people to walk away, but there's still an irrational faith that "hard work pays off" and housing values will recover. And health care shows a third insanity, where the cost of one hospitalization can exceed a lifetime savings of an average person without insurance, and perhaps someday soon even our mortgage-free homes will be at risk, into forced sale to pay off unwanted medical debts.<br><br>Wendell Berry's ideal of "Sales resistance" offers one direction, but its only attractive if you realize debt is a luxury the average person can't afford, or at least the only debt that is secure is in mutuality of neighborliness.<br>http://home2.btconnect.com/tipiglen/resist.html<br><br>My thought is we're approaching a time of "divergent success" where "following the rules" works for many, but not all, and the deck is still stacked against breaking the rules.<br><br>So if "freedom to learn from our mistakes" is a birth-right, and a necessity for some part of our life, I think "sales resistance" must try to draw the line, and label "deep end" in anything that has high personal risk like debt, and boycott those activities and find communal solutions to replace them? <br><br>At least that's a soft answer - we need to see big business and big government are not our friends, and when they make uncredible promises with irreversible consequences for failure, we need to stop giving up our responsibility for that.<br><br><a href=#c4291228677708124939 title="comment permalink">8/28/13, 11:21 PM</a><br><br>

It hit me a few years ago that I didn't know how to do anything except 'knowledge work', and that I needed to do something about it. That's actually turned into a major challenge: if you realise in your forties that your life needs to be transformed... deciding how that will happen requires a re-evaluation of your identity. It's taken me a few years to even start shaping up a new vision of who I think I should be. I'm lucky that I'm in a position where that time has been available, and I'm still able to afford training and travel. A lot of people aren't going to be so fortunate. I think it's Dmitry Orlov who wrote that a large number of people will remain professional knowledge workers in their own minds, even though they now happen to earn their living by digging ditches....<br><br>More generally, I think that awareness of the end of progress is gradually seeping into public awareness here in the UK.

The Daily Telegraph's chief economic editor (and my fellow Welshman) Ambrose Evans-Pritchard has written about peak oil on a number of occasions, while yesterday's Financial Times carried an opinion piece by James Ganesh which quite bluntly pointed out that globalisation and technology have effectively ended growth in Western economies for good.

It is possible that those cultures which have been dominant in the recent past and today have a fatal flaw which results in a dysfunctional relationship to the natural world. Perhaps the myth of progress itself is an outgrowth of a culture characterized in part by a particular kind of hubris, a sense that humanity is above nature, a special creation that is inherently more valuable than other creatures. An adversarial or antagonistic attitude towards nature by a culture can provide a short term advantage in the production of weapons, for example, but may ultimately prove to be self-destructive. --- The qualities which allow 1 culture to dominate other cultures are not the same qualities which allow a culture to persist sustainably within the natural world.

It is likely in his case that he was saved by the sulphonamide developed by May &amp; Baker in Britain prior to the mass production of penicillin. Sulphonamides as a class were originally discovered in 1930s Germany by Bayer. I find the Wikipedia article on Fleming to be a very useful introduction to the modern antibiotic story.<br><br>Distinguishing between antiseptics and antibiotics is part of that story. Various public health measures including clean water had already made a very large difference in childhood mortality, along with more direct anti-septic procedures in handling childbirth and surface wounds.<br> <br>Note however, the story (in the Wikipedia article) of Fleming in WW1 seeing use of antiseptics directly on a wound surface making an underlying deep wound more hazardous, not less. This illustrates a general point that surface bacteria including our special intestinal environment are ‘our’ primary contacts with the living world. Bacteria and micro flora and fauna have their own signalling procedures of which ‘antibiotics’ are a part (soil bacteria have been a useful source of antibiotics).

Transmissible disease (infection), as you suggest, is threatening a nasty comeback on our civilisation’s home turf, but meanwhile, Progress in its ‘retreat from Moscow’ is actively promoting the ‘disease transition’ where the ‘Western Diet’ and related habits translate into epidemic chronic ‘non-infectious’ disease worldwide.

One of the things that leaped out at me that I had missed as a child is the extent to which Death lurks around every corner.

And yet I get the feeling that Ms. Spyri intended this to a be a fairly normal, albeit interesting, lot of characters. It's also worth reading Hans Christian Andersen's "The Child in the Grave."

Years ago, when I first heard about MRSA and other hospital superbugs, I had a sort of cognitive dissonance reaction - how could untreatable bugs be found in hospitals, our very temples of healing? But five minutes contemplation of evolution and the incredibly rapid rate at which microbes mutate, in response to antibiotic stimuli found in hospitals, quickly yields to the head-slapping realization: of course that's where superbugs are going to breed, a modern hospital is the perfect evolutionary petri dish. <br><br>Implications are pretty scary. Like so much of our predicament, there are only two ways out: desperately keep running forward (more growth! more drilling! more research! more printing! more drugs! etc), or turn and face the tiger. This particular tiger, bacterial infection, I'm afraid will be worse than if we'd never started down the penicillin road. So much microbial mutation in so little time. There are some great alternatives (Stephen Buhner's Herbal Antibiotics: Natural Alternatives for Treating Drug-resistant Bacteria is a great source of natural wisdom). Anyone serious about managing their health for the future should be integrating the "herbal lifestyle" into their day to day life and diet. It's actually one of the easiest things to do if you are looking for a place to get started on changing your life, even for people who don't have land or garden space, since many of the plants can be wild-gathered. But natural plant remedies will only go so far: plants evolved their own defenses to microbial attack over eons and we've helped grow a lot of new microbes over the last few decades.<br><br><a href=#c7227074105622767642 title="comment permalink">8/29/13, 6:57 AM</a><br><br>

Human beings seem to operate with leaders and followers. I often see people saying things like "We need to do this, think that, stop being like this..." and I think, wait a minute, it is not the average person engaging in these acts, it is the few, the elite, those with real influence and decision making ability, while the masses of people would not consciously choose to do things like poison the local groundwater for thousands of years if they only had correct information.

It might be essential for human society to have an awareness that a certain small percentage of people seem to be naturally sociopathic, and that the personality traits of such people make them deceptive, manipulative, and greedy for power, status and luxury. In other words, it is not just that they happen to exist among us, but that they will disproportionately seek the very spots that they absolutely should not have. What happens is that after their destructiveness is seen, humans in general berate themselves for "our" shortcomings, when the fact that is lost is that some people are much more destructive than others, and that humans need to protect themselves from falling under their sway.<br><br>BUT - things are never simple, and the other side to the coin of bad leadership is that large percentages of the population are not wise, and are easily tempted by the various manipulations and lies of the destructive ones.

And other skills such the development of cooking, and making containers, clothes, shelter, boats, and many everyday tools unrelated to hunting, and the cultural glue required for all this cooperation. You just have to spend a little while on one of the "bushcraft" courses available these days to realise what our big brains and hands are used for - hunting is only one small part of it.

Perhaps you can at some stage in the coming weeks or months explore DeAnander's concept, and in so doing help to give his term the wide circulation it deserves? <br><br>It might be useful to learn from you about societies in history that were plagued with the veneer-economy problem and societies that were comparatively free of this problem. Can anything illuminating be said about feudal Japan, for instance, or about Byzantium? <br><br>The concept of veneer reminds me a bit of the case studies in Jane Jacobs's writings on cities and the wealth of nations. I think she would have said that the successful cities - the ones practicing what she, in a turn of phrase rather less arresting than DeAnander's, called "import substitution" - were for the most part successfully vigorous in their real economy, as opposed to the veneer. One of her examples of such success is Venice, in its period of construction and ascent as opposed to its period of decay and decadence. <br><br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br>near Toronto<br><br><a href=http://www.metascientia.com/ rel=nofollow>www punkt metascientia punkt com</a><br><br><a href=#c3506820622412224996 title="comment permalink">8/29/13, 11:10 AM</a><br><br>

These things are still well within living memory. A lot of Europeans, including my parents and relatives, lived in such conditions. <br><br>Both my parents lost siblings due to maladies that should have been easily cured but weren't due to a lack of money. They died as infants/toddlers, their condition made worse by nutritional deficiencies. I agree, JMG, I think as far as the future of medical care goes, we can look to the past for a likely direction, that is to say a lot of early deaths from a lack of medicine. My father said that, when he was a boy, he would see broken down old men in their sixties, utterly worn out by a life of toil, inadequate food and sickness. Losing your teeth because of wear and tear and a lack of dental care was the norm, which could worsen your physical condition and shorten your life. Welcome to the future. <br><br>In the old country there were also a lot of deaths in childbirth as most women could not give birth in a hospital or clinic. Some individuals, like my grandmother, would assist with births using knowledge picked up from her mother and other women in the village. <br><br>Nowadays we hipsters are mystified and amused by the up-tight attitudes about sex in so-called "traditional" societies. After all, we went through the free love era of the sixties, so now we occupy a superior vantage point, we're easy-breezy, liberated from the old collective straight-jackets, dismissive of nags and prudes. We're all relaxed and intellectual about our kids hooking up. I mean we can't supervise them all the time, right? We educate teens about safe sex and tell them to use condoms. So what's the big deal, right? It's part of growing up, right? We get vasectomies, ligatures, the pill, abortions. Needles and pills for a case of the clap (though with drug resistant strains that's getting dicey). So, mostly, no biggie. If worse comes to worse, there's drug cocktails to extend your life if you are HIV+. <br><br>Why the retrograde attitudes in traditional cultures? Imagine impoverished places where birth control, aside from abstinence, is unavailable or unaffordable. The same with abortions performed by highly trained doctors. No medicine if you get sick with an STD. Nevermind illicit sex, in this context, licit sex can have dire consequences. Pregnancy means danger to the mother and another mouth to feed neither of which are trifling matters. <br><br>And so, from the peasant farmer's point of view an unmarried, pregnant daughter is not a "problem" to deal with, it's a calamity. Who will marry the girl now? Who will support her and her child? The unborn's father? What's to be done? A "shotgun" wedding? It's a real option. So is a murderous inter-clan feud. A trip to a non medically trained abortionist, before her condition becomes obvious, may be an appalling option but it too is an option. <br><br>In the developed world we're generations removed from widespread hunger and deprivation. But there are places where dire poverty is the norm. And in such places a girl's chastity, a wife's faithfulness is paramount. One more child to feed in a family can cause hardship. Hardship from one more child that may not have been fathered by the woman's husband is utterly intolerable. <br><br>In my parents' old country, while women had to be conscious of their own dress and deportment and highly circumspect in their dealings with the opposite sex, consequences didn't just accrue to the female. And while so-called "honour" killings of insufficiently compliant or misbehaving girls and women weren't unknown, some dandy fooling with other guys' wives or daughters risked his life (and no joke). However, it was the unfaithful wife, the unmarried, pregnant girl or unmarried mom that became radioactive, their character being forever suspect. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c2199547885180403021 title="comment permalink">8/29/13, 11:11 AM</a><br><br>

The idea that life has a tragic substrate was vivid to the Greeks and ancient Hebrews, and persisted to an extent in the Roman West through the Stoics, triumphalist and hero-venerating though the Western Romans also were. The idea was front and centre in the very best of Elizabethan English stage drama. <br><br>One of the dark points about the Reich, at least as we hear it in Lord Haw-Haw's farewell broadcast from around 1945-04-30, was its perverse failure to apply the necessary insights on hubris and cosmic justice, even at its end. <br><br>The stories we currently tell ourselves, like the stories of the Reich, neglect the concepts which are the building blocks of tragedy - the hubristic "tragic flaw" amid nobility of character; the inevitability of retribution for hubris; the horror, and above all the pity, stemming in a healing way from the theatre audience's contemplation of a moral order that brings hubristic idolaters down by their own hands and brains; and the possibility that the idolatrous tragic protagonists can themselves, before their extinction, have a moment of redeeming moral clarity, in which they themselves accurately understand their fate to be the working of cosmic justice. <br><br>As a Catholic, I hold a tragic analysis of human history to be only a part-truth. But is it a part, which we have to accept even when we go beyond it in considering the full theology of Easter. Tragedy is, so to speak, the indispensable algebra that has to be mastered before the adolescent maths student can embark on Univariate Analysis, or the indispensable five-tables-of-conjugations that have to be mastered before the aspiring adolescent classicist can safely be turned loose on Catullus. <br><br><br>Sincerely, <br> <br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br>near Toronto<br><br><a href=http://www.metascientia.com/ rel=nofollow>www punkt metascientia punkt com</a> <br><br><br><br><a href=#c5429290856299160267 title="comment permalink">8/29/13, 11:13 AM</a><br><br>

In his view, there are subtle energy fields which he calls morphogenetic fields. These influence a great many different types of phenomena, including living organisms. Patterns of development which become well-established tend to influence succeeding generations through these morphogenetic fields, and the better established and more prevalent a pattern is, the more strongly the influence is felt down the line and the more deeply a particular form becomes entrenched. He cites numerous examples as evidence from biology, chemistry, crystallography, the behavioral sciences and so on.<br><br>So viewed from the perspective of morphic resonance, it’s not just genetic influences, it’s also the case that as anti-biotic resistant strains become more common and comprise a larger and larger percentage of the population, the more those strains influence the development of future generations of pathogenic microbial species, including related species, by influencing the relevant morphogenetic fields.<br><br>Incidentally, the concept of morphic resonance and morphogenetic fields ties in rather nicely with traditional occult and esoteric teachings as well, which is probably one of the reasons why the scientific establishment hates it so much even though Sheldrake has provided quite a lot of evidence to back up his hypotheses.<br><br><a href=#c6142640557174020191 title="comment permalink">8/29/13, 3:08 PM</a><br><br>

Antibiotics is one great example, cancer treatments and surgical care are others, etc. <br><br>But one of the legacies of industrial healthcare (both medical interventions and chemical sanitation, etc) is that it has allowed and encouraged us to forget about the basics of preventive health and self-care, which were really foundational to traditional medicine (whether chinese, indian/ayurvedic, european herabalism, native american, etc). And these preventive health and healing traditions worked in deep understanding of and in concert with the natural world. <br><br>For example, most of us have lost touch with the basic rules of taking care of our diet and nutrition (understanding the digestive process, knowing what spices and herbs to use to optimize it and build up immune resistance, adjusting to seasonal food availability, eating local plants that can best help us fight local infections, etc). First we lost the accumulated knowledge of gnerations, then we lost the actual diet as globalization and fast food did away with traditional foods. So now, as we face the future, we need not only to re-learn how to grow more food locally, but also how to squeeze the best health and nutritional outcomes from it. There are some encouraging things that happened over the last few decades. For example, scientific studies have been able to verify some herbal remedy efficacy (proving scientifically what generations of grandmothers already took for granted), and so quite a few people still know that garlic is good for heart health, etc. But, generally, I see this aspect of reviving the local/seasonal diet as more challenging than growing the food in some ways.<br><br><a href=#c1296919858958081456 title="comment permalink">8/29/13, 4:50 PM</a><br><br>

Thermo-therapy. When I've had a finger scratch or hangnail start to redden, swell, and throb, I've soaked it for a ten or so minutes in a cup of hot water. Think of it as a very localized, extreme fever. Heat kills germs. 2. Photo-therapy: exposure to sunshine synthesizes Vitamin D in our skin. Vitamin D is important for disease immunity. But the typical doctor advises the typical patient to avoid sunshine to prevent skin cancer. (The typical patient assumes that if a little is good, a lot is better, so it's not terrible advice.) 3. Nutrition: know what (and how much) you NEED to eat, and eat only that. 4. Don't poison yourself with alcohol, smoke, crystal meth, STDs, etc. 5. work a little exercise into your daily routine (e.g. hanging laundry up to dry, wiping down the shower stall, washing dishes, walking for transportation, gathering food from a garden, etc.)<br> <br>Alas for capitalist medicine, there's no way to turn a profit on basic disease prevention as enumerated above. It's so simple, and so much not-what-anyone-wants-to-hear.<br> <br>By the way, it was noted above that "colds" rarely proceed to bacterial pneumonia any more, but that might be because doctors do prescribe antibiotics for viral infections. "But antibiotics don't cure viruses!" Of course not, but they can keep bacteria from taking advantage of a virus infection.

I see the line trotted around about legions of faceless doctors uneasy about antibiotic resistance, and I gotta say I just don't see it in practice. To contest a few points:<br><br>Scarlet fever is caused by strep. In all this time, strep really hasn't developed much resistance to penicillins, they are still the standard of care for empiric treatment, even before the resistances come back. The medicine your doctor gave you as a child is probably close the same one I'd empirically prescribe to a child with scarlet fever today (amoxicillin). No one would raise an eyebrow if I even went with old-school penicillin for grins. Penicillin is still quite effective and the antibiotic of choice for multiple types of infections.<br><br>Staph is trickier, granted. The MRSA (methcillin-resistant staph aureus) that's been the topic of countless anguished Newsweek, etc. articles, with ominous suggestions that doctors everywhere wake up sweating at night thinking about it? Honestly we just assume assume anything that might be staph is MRSA and treat accordingly until it's proven otherwise. There are multiple quite effective IV and oral choices available. VRE, VISA, etc. that's resistant to the current IV antibiotic of choice, vancomycin, is supposedly out there somewhere, but honestly it kinda has bogeyman status to me personally I guess as I haven't seen it, much less seen it cause a serious threat to a patient's health.<br><br>We've come to take antibiotic stewardship quite seriously, actually. I'm sure there's still yahoos out there handing them out like candy, but it's not the standard of care anymore. It's working, too, in my community at least, we're already starting to see a decline in Cipro resistance for urinary tract infections, as doctors have eased up on overprescribing. Antibiotic resistance tends to decrease a bug's overall fitness, so when we ease up the selection pressure towards it, it will fall off.<br><br>I have exactly one patient I can think of who is colonized with a bug that frankly scares me. She's colonized with a bug resistant to all but one IV antibiotic, and I worry about what happens when that one runs out. She's indeed a victim of people throwing antibiotics at her for anything. I can at least understand it as she's demented, and we usually err on the side of caution in those cases as the patient can't provide a reliable history. In the big picture though, modern medicine has already extended her expiration date at least a decade, and she's currently puttering along happily, surrounded by family that love her, and it will most likely be one of the other ten medical conditions that does her in eventually. I wouldn't call her a failure story no matter what the future holds for her.<br><br><a href=#c515344068629746336 title="comment permalink">8/29/13, 6:40 PM</a><br><br>

And yours?<br><br>Trippticket, I also use herbs and alternative medicine, and I know their strengths as well as their weaknesses. Of course fewer people will die of heart disease once antibiotics go away -- heart disease is primarily an ailment of the middle-aged and elderly, while infectious diseases tend to kill at all ages, leaving fewer people to live long enough to get heart disease. Now of course something's going to kill each and every one of us sooner or later, and I don't propose to judge which death is more unpleasant, but I'd encourage you to do some research into family life in the pre-antibiotic era, when herbs were standard healthcare, and most families still buried at least one child before the age of five. <br><br>Greg, we did -- where did you think most grains and vegetables came from?

In my view terms of surrender don't actually make sense here. This is because I don't think that there was ever even a war. Sure, we might have battled against microbes, and the whale, and our fresh water supplies, and our top-soil. But to say that Man went to war against Nature in it's totality. That just seems like delusions of grandeur. After all, we did "battle" with Nature by using a gargantuan supply of fossil fuels (provided by Nature), and using it to manipulate matter and energy (using Natural laws). When did Nature do battle with us then? When she decided not to give an infinite supply of extractable hydrocarbon? When she decided that top soil shouldn't spontaneously replenish itself with nutrients? When she decided not to provide functionally limitless supplies of water, impervious to our industrial run off? In my view surrender ultimately must mean realising that we have been, and always will be constrained by and reliant upon the natural world.<br><br>After reading your post I drew an interesting parallel between the corporate Man of the religion of progress and the Church being the corporate body of Christ in Christianity. It occurs to me that the mythic narrative offered to me by my former Christian sect which saw my life's meaning in terms of building a small but integral part in building Christ's expression on earth, as paralleling the mythic narrative offered to me in the progress religion in which each person can collectively taking part in the building up of man until he eventually takes his throne as an immortal, omniscient, omnipotent God sitting upon his throne amongst the stars. The main difference seems to be that my Christian sect seemed to have a much more active role for me. Unfortunately I'm not knowledgeable enough about late medieval Christianity to know whether there concept of the Body of Christ was picked up by Progress, or whether the reverse happened.<br><br><a href=#c4130260427905539614 title="comment permalink">8/29/13, 9:19 PM</a><br><br>

They had general cleaners but nurses were expected to scrub everything clean with antiseptic more or less every day. Woe betide any who brought in dirt etc on their shoes.<br>Now the philosophy has changed and wards have carpet, dusty decorations hang everywhere and cleaning is superficial by poorly paid workers who don't understand the difference between tidy and clean. Just about everyone is pumped full of antibiotics to keep the bugs at bay.<br>I read an article the other day where a hospital medico has been having great success in controlling MRSA etc. The solution.

Antibiotics were not even on the horizon. His doctors got his spine as straight as they could and shot X-rays down the length of his spinal cord. It saved his life in the short run, but he had nerve conduction problems for the rest of his life.<br><br>Economics may further complicate the picture. New antibiotics like Avelox and Zyvox cost thousands of dollars for a course of treatment. If/when insurance goes away, they will be mostly unavailable. <br><br>At the other end of the money spectrum, injectable Penicillin G was manufactured by only one company on earth (Wyeth). In the early 2000s, Wyeth stopped making it for a couple of years, for economic reasons. Pen G very reliably treats neurosyphilis. Few other antibiotics will. Within a year, people began to die of complications of neurosyphilis again as Pen G supplies ran out and no other manufacturers stepped up to the plate to make it. Wyeth eventually began to make it again at a somewhat higher price. <br><br>Versions of this scenario continue to play out in drug manufacture.

Early mechanisation and later the green revolution ushered in a relatively rapid shift toward urbanisation. While lots of poor farming-class workers would take on jobs in factories, a not insignificant segment of the population was able to “move on up” by seeking education and specializing. I don’t think it’s a stretch to say “thus penicillin” and so many breakthroughs and discoveries that have marked the 20th century. <br>Specialization is the sub-plot, if you will, of the petroleum age, and we’ve taken it to the nth degree along the trajectory of diminishing returns and over the peak of Hubbert’s Hill. If by necessity some 80% of us return to farming jobs (perhaps kicking and screaming?) over the next hundred years, Nature will have had her say. What will the specialists’ priorities be? Our wish list of things to do will be long, but we may be short on the talent pool side of the equation. It seems to me that, following an Archdruid’s lead, one could do well to reduce or eliminate their dependence on powers-that-be and the mysterious “they” for their medical and agricultural security.

Any given human in Europe at the time could be homozygous for possession of the doormat (and soon dead), heterozygous with half the doormat tally (and sometimes recovered), or homozygous for absence of the doormat. The last option was a genetic "defect," a pair of them actually, but these "defective" people went on to repopulate post-plague Europe, and passed that lucky mutation on to a large percentage of the folks reading this string.<br><br>HIV gains cellular entry in exactly the same way, so we descendants of plague survivors are just as genetically immune to HIV as we are to bubonic plague. Lucky us.<br><br>That said, most of the crowd diseases we're talking about came from, well, crowding, and living in close proximity to our domesticated livestock, as you know. As painful as losing a child might be, and you have my deepest sympathy, believe me, a far less populous world, perhaps one populated with ecotechnics that gained some lasting sense of the curses, as well as the blessings, of agriculture over the millennia (and of course adopted horticulture in response), will also be a far less diseased world.<br><br>I'm not sold on the idea that keeping a larger percentage of people alive temporarily, by all means available, is a good thing when it almost guarantees a much greater calamity down the line. You seem to agree, but then you consistently argue in favor of that system. <br><br>Of course this is a larger historical perspective as opposed to one on the verge of losing its grandfather to COPD-induced pneumonia. The immediate effects hurt, no doubt, but your perspective is surely panoramic enough to have a feel for the silver lining in energy descent with regards to health.<br><br>And our infant mortality rate in the modern industrial U.S. ain't all that great either, since you brought it up...<br><br>Cheers.

It is not for beginning herbalists, but the first part of the book could be enjoyed by anyone, and I think you, especially, JMG, would like it. He summarizes how the superbugs came to be and the research that shows the "intelligence" of the bacteria in terms of how they develop resistance and how they communicate it to other bacteria, even those bacteria that are not related in any way to themselves. It is FASCINATING. Definitely challenges the "superior-human" myth that underlies modern society. We battle recurrent MRSA skin infections in our household. We finally bagged all the antibiotics and clinical washes and have had excellent results using herbal essential oils. Of course, given the work that is involved in creating EOs, I'm not sure they will be an option in the long-running future, but Stephen's methods do not involve EOs, and they are also very effective (just not as easy as buying that EO bottle).

Which sounds to me like his little ones were never vaccinated. <br><br>No doubt, an intense course of studies in an academic setting and a lifetime of work in a particular field gives one a perspective one otherwise wouldn't have. My own mis-education wasn't in a scientific area so I'm at a disadvantage in that sense. No doubt one so trained and immersed on a day-to-day basis would have access to results of research that would buttress such a decision as to vaccinate (or not) or to acquiesce (or not) to a doctor's prescription for pharmacy dispensed medication. So far be it from me to judge. <br><br>I'm not a scientist and, as you say JMG, anecdote isn't data. But I have a question and this is assuming the poster's kids were never vaccinated. I wonder if the poster is old enough to have lived through a polio outbreak. Polio is no joke. In my hometown there were kids that were sickened by it. Some seemed to recover reasonably well. Others ended up disabled. A kid that lived down the street from us caught it and had a terrible time. He eventually got up out of bed but couldn't get around without crutches. He died some years later in his teens. <br><br>And so, when the vaccine became available, people got off their duffs and got vaccinated. There were no naysayers that I ever heard. You know what? Ever since, polio hasn't reared its ugly head. Not in my home town nor in any in this country. At least that I'm aware of. A good result I would say. The only people suffering are the ones with the lingering effects of their earlier illness.<br><br>OK, all I know is what I see in the news but the news hasn't reported any outbreaks for decades. Yes, this is non systematically gathered data without the imprimatur of a big-time research university. And maybe we're going back to pre-vaccination days anyway. But why rush it?<br><br>What I'm saying is there are different kinds of perspective. Scholarly papers give you one kind. However, real life illuminates issues in a way that jargon encrusted studies will never do. The poster says, "Maybe dying of a bacterial infection isn't so awful in the end." Yes, given the alternatives, maybe it isn't. But has the poster ever witnessed such a death? <br><br>One last thing: we seem to assume that pre-industrial people took the deaths of infants/toddlers in stride ie that it was fully expected that if you have five, you lose one. Well, no they didn't take it in stride. At least my own grandmothers didn't. They mourned the loss of their little ones to their dying day.

Buhner has a way of helping me to “get” what we have been missing; a thing I experienced as a child visiting my grandparents at their farm but lost somewhere along the way, that sense of curiosity and wonder, that “belonging” to all that is.

Maybe I should consciously accept that and just go all the way. Anyway, let me explain things in a slightly different way.<br><br>The hue and cry about antibiotic resistance? Guess what, it worked. The academics made their point. We know it's a problem. Resistance is in the back (if not front) of our heads when choosing an antibiotic. Public health departments keep yearly tallies of resistance patterns in the area, and empiric treatment for likely pathogens is based on them. Dispensing antibiotics solely for patient peace of mind is discouraged. Broad spectrum antibiotics should be reserved for when they are appropriate. The resources we use to guide treatment are pretty consistently in line with these principles. No need to belabor it further.<br><br>Remember what you've said about ignoring negative feedback loops in apocalyptic fantasies? What specifically comes to mind is the assertion that governments likely won't curl up in a fetal position and plunge us all into permanent Hobbesian anarchy at the first whiff of trouble. Well, don't these multi-drug resistant superbugs fated to cull everyone's children sound a bit like the Third Horseman? Also vaguely of the Grey Goo apocalypse.<br><br>But anyway, implicit to the narrative is that doctors will make no changes to their practice, which I can tell you is not the case. Beyond that, I get the sense that these bugs would need to develop an, I don't know, almost malevolent taste for otherwise healthy human flesh. Let me explain.<br><br>The people who I've seen die from infections generally fall into 2 categories. Some were holding onto life by a thread anyway, and the bug tipped them over. I'm thinking the very young, the very old, the immunosuppressed, the really, really, really, I mean really chronically ill (we're really astonishingly good at keeping people alive even if not well and in a general state of misery). The second group would be those with incredibly fast-spreading infections, like necrotizing fasciitis. What's rather interesting is that the people in both groups did not generally succumb to the wrong choice of antibiotic. They generally died with the proper antibiotic prescribed. Antibiotics don't so much purify you of pathogens, they largely give your body enough breathing room to do it's thing. If your body has no fight left in it, or the infection spreads so quickly it completely overwhelms your ability to fight it, you're pretty much just out of luck, bucko. I've seen people die of infection, but not had the cinematic revelation of "ESBL" as the eventual cause of death as we all helplessly sat on our thumbs while infection ravaged an otherwise salvageable patient. If someone's headed south, we don't even wait for sensitivies, we change our approach, and when it can work it does.<br><br>I guess that's pretty anecdotal, sure. But what exactly is the chain of events required for superbugs to rampage across us all? First condition, we refine, and refine, and refine these bugs to be resistant to everything that exists. Ok, I know of at least one example of that. Problem is it's basically just set up camp in the bladder flora of an old lady and seems for most part content to just sit there and chill. Her family isn't all perishing like flies even though they have to have been exposed to it. So then these superbugs need to spread wide and far and set up camp in the big wide world. Yeah, ok, the existence of community-acquired MRSA put that as a possibility. Then all these scattered bugs need to stack up resistance after resistance, after resistance. We've got quite a few classes of antibiotics, you know. Then they have to hold on to these resistances, at the same time outcompete all their non-resistant bacterial brethren that make up the earth's flora to become the primary form of life on earth. Or something like that. Anecdotally, you know, they're just not quite following the script.<br><br><a href=#c4903862184352508467 title="comment permalink">8/30/13, 4:45 PM</a><br><br>

Answering your concerns pointwise: 1)Your take on my children's vaccination status is astute. Not vaccinated in any way.<br><br>2)No, after my "immersion" in my field of study, I believed almost the exact same thing most of you do: vaccinations good, irresponsible parents bad. It required a personal revelation about our status as humans almost 5 years ago to turn that perception on its head.<br><br>3)There are tons of similar stories to go around, both anecdotal and empirical. They have nothing to do with my genome.<br><br>4)There were also a lot of people vaccinated against polio that didn't need it. Again, built-in genetic immunity to crowd diseases we temperate Eurasian farmers evolved around. Native Americans probably needed the vaccine.<br><br>5)The news may not have, but the CDC did recently. Or rather, announced a cancer epidemic associated with something like 90% of polio vaccinated-people in some third world country. It sounds so ambiguous because it was pulled and squelched the next day, never to be seen again (and for obvious reasons), as far as I can tell. I'd love to get my hands on it again. I'm not rushing anything except a return to sanity.<br><br>6)I'll second that! Real life, first-hand experience has given me almost all of my insight into the way things work, quite at odds with just about anything I "learned" from a big-time research university like the one I attended. My advice: spend four years on a Weston Price Foundation website instead.<br><br>7)I realize that a deep and calculated evolutionary perspective often comes across as cold. I get that. Because in the current Disney environment it is. When Bambi dies we feel bad for such a cute little fawn, not taking into account that Bambi's death might be better for the species as a whole. Same for vegetarians: it's easy to feel bad for a big brown-eyed cow as an individual, not really understanding that our alliance with cows as a food animal has been an enormous boon to the species - multiplication far beyond their pre-alliance numbers, protection from predators, manicured forage, medicine, if you want to count that as a boon...<br><br>I kill a lot of the meat I eat, and it's always hard to do, but it's ultimately much harder on everyone and everything else when people just eat meat packages they purchased from the supermarket. In the end there will be a lot more people eating no meat at all because this sort of system removes you from your impacts, and therefore your sense of responsibility to them.<br><br>If I lose a child to some "preventable" disease because of my bad decisions I will kick my own ass for the rest of my life, I assure you, whether I deserve it or not. But my children are bigger, stronger, and smarter than most, and I think our curious approach to the world has a lot to do with that. If nothing else, their immune systems are probably much more experienced than those of their peers. I hope we've done the right thing in the end, and I certainly think we have.<br><br>And last, but not least, the hardest part of all this vaccination business is that "they" need to be vaccinated against us a lot more than we need to be vaccinated against "them". Although it's a lot easier on folks like us to flip that around. And a lot more profitable...<br><br><a href=#c2895582539570741924 title="comment permalink">8/30/13, 7:27 PM</a><br><br>

Bacterial evolution makes our antibiotics ineffective after a fairly short while. In contrast, vaccines seem not to suffer that fate, except when it comes to pathogens (such as the common cold) that mutate rapidly for other reasons. Moreover, vaccines are possible for many viral diseases, while antibiotics only work against bacteria. Finally, vaccines may be something we can keep well into the great descent, being that they are not resource intensive, thanks to the amazing capacity of our immune systems to amplify the signal introduced by a tiny amount of vaccine (or pathogen).<br><br>Regarding "I wonder if there's any way to arm the badgers so that they can do some culling of their own!", that brings to mind the constitutional rallying cry "I reserve my right to arm bears!".<br><br><a href=#c4536983972873666220 title="comment permalink">8/30/13, 7:41 PM</a><br><br>

Several weeks ago a commenter referenced “History as a System” by Jose Ortega y Gasset. I looked it up and found it a most interesting read. I was especially intrigued by his reference to the idea that faith in reductionist science was dying and this was written in the late 1930s. <br>Then I read “Good Calories, Bad Calories” by Gary Taubes. This is a chronology of the last 150 years of nutrition science and the public policies that have evolved. It is clear form Taubes writing that what we are being told by national health authorities about low fat diets being heart healthy and that we need to lower cholesterol for heart health are not supported by good science. Most of the national nutritional health advice seems to be based on egos and ongoing conformational bias rather than good science. <br><br>Considering Gasset’s reference to the dying faith in science in the 1930s and Taubes’ detailed description of how our national nutritional policies are not based on reproducible science tells me that American culture has been struggling with how to make good use of science for some time. Worst of all it seems to me that we are losing that struggle. <br><br>Since I was educated in the 60s to believe in science in ways that have clearly not worked well for me and therefore I am finding it necessary to change how I approach much of that information I am curious as to your views on what it is going to take to change this approach to knowledge on a national level.

In some cultures the perceived danger of ending up with an infertile and (under Christianity) undivorceable wife meant that marriage was delayed until the future wife became pregnant. Obviously this violated strictures against premarital sex, but a farmer needs children. Also, children in non monetized economies are not just an expense. Every mouth to feed comes with two hands to work, is an old saying. If children are weeding, watching the geese, keeping an eye on a younger sibling and not costing hundreds of dollars in day care and school supplies they are less of an economic burden. <br>On the subject of polio, I am part of the last polio generation. My ex (who is 12 years older than me) an author of my acquaintance and one of my best friends all contracted polio as children. I also remember the newsreels of rows of victims in iron lungs. I seem to recall from some long ago class that the epidemics of the late 19th and early 20th century were partly caused by better sanitation. As the professor explained it, in more primitive conditions young babies and children would get polio and either die or recover completely. Better sanitation meant that infection was delayed until later childhood or young adulthood, a time of life during which the virus is more likely to cripple victims who survive. Not sure whether this idea is supported by more recent research.<br><br><a href=#c8211003961179810822 title="comment permalink">8/31/13, 3:59 PM</a><br><br>

There seems to be a very Hobbesian trend in some people's thought--an assumption that if civic order breaks down the natural result will be the war of all against all that the philosopher Hobbes believed had been the state of natural man. I was just reading an article about the homeless in Sacramento's local alternative paper (Sac News and Review). The first thing that struck me was that the homeless interviewed talked of forming "families" of unrelated individuals who camp together and protect one another. This is what people do. Some people are loners either by choice or because they are not tolerated by their fellows. Some will form predatory bands, outlaw groups who will prey on others. But most people will, I believe, form groups for mutual aid, companionship and safety. <br><br>@Deborah--one reason drs. give so many vaccines at one time is that they can't rely on all parents returning for the required visits.

I once had rats living in/near my compost bin. (My mother had composted some fatty bones during a visit, and I guess that was all it took to invite them in.) I bought a pair of spring traps (traditional mouse traps, doubled in every dimension), baited one with peanut butter mashed into cotton string tied around the paddle, set it out by the bin one afternoon. I went out to check it the next day. It was gone! A few days later, as I was working around the area, I came across the relocated trap and the disgusting, maggot-ridden partial carcass of a rat. This is an example of what NOT to do.<br><br>So, learning from my mistake, I threw out that filthy trap, and set the other one just before dusk. I checked it just an hour or two later. A rat was inert but intact, no worse to handle (wearing gloves) than a plush toy. I buried it in the garden, and put the trap away for the night. Every night for the next two weeks or so, I'd set it out after dinner, and bring it in (full or empty) before going to bed. After catching 5-6 adult rats, there were apparently no more to be had, and no signs of their presence (and none since then). <br><br>The moral of the story, I think, is that I tried to never let one rat learn from the misfortune of another. Also, if a rat was reluctant to take fresh bait on Monday night, it might be more eager to take it on Tuesday night, having had Tuesday morning to regret "the one that got away".<br><br>Of course, I had a relatively small number of rats to worry about. Taking one rat a day, or even ten per day, might fall below your maximum sustainable yield, unless you also create rodent-proof grain storage. Habitat destruction is much more effective than harvesting in driving a species to extinction.<br><br>By the way, peanut butter alone got licked off without springing the trap. With peanut butter worked into string wrapped around the paddle, the rats would tug on it.<br><br><br><a href=#c3687058504791068074 title="comment permalink">8/31/13, 7:07 PM</a><br><br>

Having largely been raised by a Japanese stepmother, I learned the advantages of some fermented foods early on, and of course then there's beer!<br><br>Hector, if you're going to try to out-archdruid me, you might start by learning one of my basic rules, which is to identify and discount binary thinking -- in this case, the binary between the business-as-usual reassurances you're offering and the gray goo-style apocalypse you've mistakenly assigned to me. Of course you're holding the line; thirty years ago, your predecessors were doing so with an abundance of effective antibiotics and no resistance in sight; thirty years from now, as present trends continue, your successors will be holding the line by hoarding the handful of antibiotics that still work for the most critical cases, and they'll still be able to point to the fact that it's mostly the weak and vulnerable who die, just as you have -- it's just that in their time, there will be more of these. <br><br>The logic you're using is the same as that of petroleum drillers who insist that since they're still keeping liquid fuels flowing to market, peak oil can't happen. Here as elsewhere, a snapshot of current conditions is much less useful than an overview of the broader trajectory. Of course physicians are doing their best to counter the rising tide of antibiotic resistance, and will continue to do so, despite your claim, that's an inherent part of the narrative -- just as it's an inherent part of the peak oil narrative that we'll keep drilling all the more frantically as production falters and prices go up. Meanwhile, just as every tank of gas you use hastens the day when it's all gone, every antibiotic you prescribe puts additional selection pressure on the microbial biosphere -- which is why microbes develop resistance to new antibiotics in a fraction of the time they used to, and exchange of immunity from one organism to another appears to be becoming more common. <br><br>That's what peak oil analyst Rune Likvern calls the Red Queen's race: you have to run faster and faster just to stay in place. It's an increasingly common situation across the board in modern industrial society -- and while in theory, you can just keep on running faster and faster, sooner or later it's statistically inevitable that you'll trip. <br><br>Stonymeadow, oh man.

They're remarkable creatures. Snakes and ferrets come to mind as possible countermeasures...<br><br>As for those midwinter feasts, exactly. Families counted on raising a mess of livestock during the green and growing months, then slaughtering them once autumn turned hard toward winter, eating heartily, and salting, corning, or drying the rest of the meat to keep it fit to eat for the lean months to come. <br><br>Kyoto, the whole "free energy" thing to my mind is the last word in deliberate self-deception. It takes very little research to find out why none of the schemes will work, but if you do that, you have to accept that your whole life is going to have to change, and those who aren't willing to do that convince themselves that there's limitless free energy basically because they want it to be true. Sad, but predictably popular. <br><br>Kevin, I don't know, but I do know that a lot of people aren't eligible these days due to one or another bloodborne organism. It would be interesting to do the research and find out what's up. <br><br>Joyce, I read "The Handmaid's Tale" but haven't touched the other two -- I'll give 'em a look. <br><br>Robert, the account I heard was that some of the rebels, who didn't know what they were handling, got clumsy or stupid and gassed themselves. Still, I suppose it might have been deliberate. <br><br>Unknown Tom, if you want to lose all faith in the objectivity and value of science, the history of expert opinion about nutrition is a good thing to study. I haven't read Taubes' book, but I did enough research of my own at one point to end up shaking my head at the sheer unadulterated nonsense being pitched by all sides in some very public discussions. <br><br>Dennis, fascinating -- certainly the militaries of an earlier time were absolutely fastidious about having everything polished, scrubbed and cleaned, and the horrific death toll from disease in war may have helped inspire that. <br><br>Rita, very true indeed. Human beings are social primates; it's hardwired into us to seek the security of a group, and an age of crisis isn't going to stop that -- quite the contrary, a tightening of group loyalties and boundaries is pretty much guaranteed as we proceed down the curve. <br><br>LatheChuck, three for three. On the subject of solar distillation of alcohol, it's surprised me that nobody in the hill country, as far as I know, has caught onto the fact that a solar still doesn't produce smoke for the revenuers to scent, and gives a steady, even heat without hot spots. If and when they do catch on, I wonder if the product will be renamed "sunshine"!<br><br>Robert, I don't expect debt slavery as such, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if the US government sometime soon passed a law allowing people to get out of student debt in exchange for, say, a four-year hitch in the armed forces.

Would that an old friend of mine suffering repeated hospitalisation for Heart Failure - well, he could drown on his carpet at home as an alternative - had not been in denial about his hypertension well over a decade back.

The role of adversary comes a bit too readily to me, and given your bad experiences with my profession, it's remarkable you show the amount of patience you do.<br><br>I do know quite well how the religion of progress is behind most of the expectations of what I do. If I were a more prudent individual, I should have run away from questioning it the moment I made that connection, but it's not in my nature. Hopefully I'll make peace with it all eventually, for the time being I just feel terribly non-reassuring to patients and colleagues when I try and point out what modern medicine really isn't very good at and probably never will be. We can't deliver a life free of disease, depression, and discomfort, and valiantly going through the motions like I've been taught to do usually just makes me feel like a charlatan and I try and avoid it.<br><br>Still, there's still quite a lot I can offer, even if it's not everything. To try and wind up what I meant earlier, I still think you overestimate the impact of the selection pressures of antibiotics. It really is a big wide world out there, and our misguided attempts at conquering nature in the antibiotic realm were perhaps a bit more limited in scope than we tend to think.<br><br>Hospitals definitely collect bad bugs, since that's where the antibiotics are. I do advise everyone to avoid the hospital/ER whenever possible for that reason. Don't go there if you're just sick and want to feel better, go if you're dying. Still, all these horrible bugs set to destroy us all don't seem to significantly affect the average lifespan of hospital employees as far as I know, and I know our routine sanitary precautions aren't THAT good. Wouldn't we be dropping like flies if they were all poised to conquer humanity?<br><br>Chronically ill people who are incapable of eradicating infections and routinely infused with antibiotics to keep the pathogen load acceptable tend to develop resistant strains. Still, their caretakers, etc. don't seem to catch them. Probably because the main culprits are otherwise normal environmental flora that anyone with a normal immune system comes into contact with on a daily basis and fights off.<br><br>You know the serious infections that afflict young children that might have killed them before antibiotics? In my anecdotal experience, these pathogens tend to have pretty clean resistance profiles. My guess would be they tend to be picked up from the environment more than making the rounds from antibiotic infused kid to antibiotic infused kid, and last I checked we weren't spraying the earth with amoxicillin, crop duster style.<br><br>The pathogens that depend on humans as their main host are out there, and probably the greatest cause for concern, as resistance passes from human to human, picking up resistances along the way. It is a well-known issue with HIV. HIV, syphilis, and most of the stuff you should vaccinate your kids against come to mind. Maybe they will be the ones that end up killing us. Still, they typically have a pretty narrow form of transmission, otherwise the human race would have been wiped out by syphilis long ago.<br><br><a href=#c6688402359061863420 title="comment permalink">9/1/13, 1:28 PM</a><br><br>

I tend to doubt that, but they could be a contributing cause.<br>The harm that vaccines may be doing could come from the fact that the microbe enters the body in a way that does not occur in nature, the additives (mercury, formaldehyde, aluminum and adjuvants) and the possibility of something coming from an animal source. One such is the simian oncovirus #40 which is pretty much known to have contaminated some batches of polio vaccines. Most vaccines are developed using animal tissues. In other words, some people are going to get cancer because of their polio vaccine. It stands to reason that doing the above to your body could stress the immune system, although again, I suspect that it takes multiple insults for most people to succumb. Unfortunately, our industrial chemical laden society provides them. Vaccines provide some immunity but it is not a natural immunity and does not last. Now they are revaccinating adults against DPT. <br><br>Certainly autoimmune diseases, allergies and asthma as well as autism are rising steadily and we don't know why, but we do know some populations such as the Amish are unaffected. I listened to a radio program once in which a doctor who had an upper middle class progressive patient population that does not vaccinate stated that out of 5,000 children there were none that had autism or asthma. I was shocked as it had never occurred to me to link vaccines with asthma. Of course those upper middle class yuppies and the Amish have superior nutrition and avoid chemicals, so it is not simple.<br><br>It seems to me therefore that a reasonable approach would be to restrict vaccines to those diseases that really harm and kill children. Chicken pox does not qualify, nor measles. I don't know why one day old infants are given their first of three shots against hep B when it is not a contagious or childhood disease and the immunity is thought to last about 12 years.<br><br>If it is so that there is a health loss and/or risk with vaccines, it obviously makes sense that repeated vaccinations will increase that risk. One can take a tiny bit of poison, even mercury, and it might be worth it not to die of pertussis. But I think that excessive use of vaccinations might qualify as another attempt to battle nature without understanding the full implications.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c7863463491744624008 title="comment permalink">9/1/13, 8:43 PM</a><br><br>

Hope someone else here gets as much pleasure from it as I am, and hope also that someone else here finds it at least somewhat comforting that a man who manages $100 billion is taking this kind of thing to heart...which is to say, someone on Wall Street, I think, has a heart far less cold or sick than the norm.

It's a hard lesson, but one of the basic ingredients of maturity. <br><br>Phil, oh, granted -- there are quite a few things that could be done, starting with an absolute ban (enforced by large fines) against the routine use of antibiotics in animal feed as a growth stimulant. The question is whether any of them will get done. I note that late last year, England's chief medical officer (the equivalent of the Surgeon General here in the US) was <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20354536 rel=nofollow>still vainly pleading with physicians</a> to stop prescribing antibiotics for colds and flus, which they don't help -- and Britain has socialized medicine and could presumably stop the practice by government edict at any time!<br><br>Michelle, no argument there. The enthusiastic pursuit of the utterly worthless may be the most characteristic thing about today's industrial societies. <br><br>Bret, heck of a good question. How do you tell what's actually going through the mind of a man who manages billions of dollars, and makes more or less depending on what rumors are circulating on Wall Street minute by minute? If you're considering going to work for someone like him, just remember that it's a real challenge to enter the rat race without turning into a rat...<br><br>Unknown Deborah, I didn't know about the nonprofit thing. I was thinking about the GI Bill when I suggested that that might be the price of student loan amnesty, though. <br><br>Hector, one of the things that I hope the Long Descent will restore to the healing professions is a less overwhelming sense of entitlement on the part of patients! Still, I'd point out again that a snapshot of current conditions isn't necessarily any more useful in your situation than it is in, say, petroleum production -- the fact that you can get gas at every gas station, albeit for a higher price, doesn't mean that peak oil won't be a far more drastic problem down the road; in the same way, the fact that hospital orderlies aren't dying like flies just at the moment is not as relevant over the longer term as it might seem. <br><br>Do you happen to have access to stats on MRSA skin infections outside health care settings, by the way? I haven't been able to track down numbers, just comments in official publications that they've become common since the 1990s. That's the sort of creeping public health failure I'm suggesting: a slow increase in cases every year, putting more burdens on an already crumbling health care system, loading costs onto society, and increasing the death toll a little each year. Tuberculosis, which was one of the three top causes of death a century ago, is increasingly resistant; here again, it's not a pandemic that's the thing to worry about, but the slow tick upwards in cases that can't be treated by antibiotics. <br><br>Onething, of course there are tradeoffs. That said, once again, I'm not really interested in discussing the pros and cons of vaccination here, as that's a subject that attracts far more heat than light these days. <br><br>Bret, I have a copy of Ophuls' book -- it's been on the to-read pile for a good deal longer than it should have, largely because of the research I've had to do for the novelization of the "How It Could Happen" scenario.

They all grew to be teenagers, &amp; we lost 5 of them to neighborhood dogs that would follow kids over from their yards. I instituted a strict dog ban (prerogative of ruling sovereign, to protect his vassals), and the remaining seven have become very savvy, staying close to the house. They still won't roost in the coop: they always go to the elderberry bush on the fence, so we have to put them up at night. But I built a nesting box on the side, and one chicken regularly uses it. We get 2-3 eggs a day right now, which isn't bad. It's been an incredible morale booster to have even small success like this. My kids know a lot more about chickens than I do.

Antibiotic development is not half as profitable for drug companies as developing drugs for life-long conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and increasingly cancer. All the public health gnashing of teeth about needing new antibiotics will not induce most drug companies to divert significant portions of their R&amp;D budgets to drugs that cure someone in 7-21 days, meaning they have to make back the R&amp;D budget plus profit on a much smaller number of dispensing events. This accounts for the VERY high cost of newer antibiotics as well as the embarrassing lack of new options in the R&amp;D pipeline vs. new chronic cancer and diabetes treatments. We could perhaps continue the Red Queen's race a bit longer, long enough to actually put effective prescribing restrictions in place and ease into the post-antibiotic future without potentially massive die-offs right away, but as it stands the slope is quite steep.<br><br><a href=#c4455594689454462284 title="comment permalink">9/2/13, 8:52 AM</a><br><br>

This is important in an interview, because anything but some variation on 'I'd like to be a ' (just one slot <i>below</i> whoever is giving the interview, because you don't want to say 'I'm hoping to take away your job') means you are not focused on "success" as defined by this myth.<br><br>Despite the fact that everyone is well aware that in a hierarchical structure at each higher level there are fewer positions (and even fewer people really competent to fill them), yet everyone is supposed to be eager to be that person. (Hence the misunderstanding that "anyone can be President" does not mean anyone could do the job.) I suspect the cognitive dissonance this produces manifests as the callous disdain towards people who have "failed to live up to their potential" -- a phrase that appears in early elementary school -- and which implicitly permits poor people to be socially marginalized and disregarded. Thus partly explains the welfare system in practice.<br><br>This myth, thus expects each us to desire 'conquest', that is, to expand our power, to increase our social prestige and wealth, hence our growth-for-growth's-sake economics, and thus the vast majority of our "leaders" became leaders precisely (as you indicated in earlier posts) because they follow the script better than others.<br>No one is asked to remain in some position because they do it well, nor respected for choosing that path. Everyone is expected, explicitly or implicitly, to be seeking to "get ahead" to 'advance' to... well... to progress in a career. (N.B. "career": (v). to move swiftly along; rush in an uncontrolled way)<br>There is almost no explicit accommodation within the social or economic structure for someone who would rather simply excel at a task than eagerly seek continual increase, even though the increased pay and the increased status, also comes with increased stress and time-commitment.<br>The terms of surrender demanded of us will be to give up this eternal quest for more and start behaving like a member of the community of life on Earth.<br><br><a href=#c6119176979872324893 title="comment permalink">9/2/13, 10:11 AM</a><br><br>

I will give a thumbnail sketch of the numbers below, but the abstract is that I was able get them to that size in about 10 weeks at an outlay of about $50. If you eat a bird a week, that would be about a half year's worth.<br><br>Now it sounds like Cherokee is culling from a mixed-use flock. I was raising the most productive meat bird out there, and was willing to feed them. They required about a bag and a half of commercial feed, which would have been lower if it had not been early spring and too cold to put them out till later than I would have liked. They only spent 2 weeks in a movable pen, and the feed use went down during that time, though they were at their maximum size. I think there are also birds available now that use less feed, though the time required is longer.<br><br>I know feeding is not exactly permaculture, but it's widely practiced by Salatin and others in the pastured poultry field. Also, I would argue it's a great way to import fertility if your land needs that (and whose doesn't?)<br><br>Now, I was able to improvise pens, etc, and was given waterers and some other gear. The cost is only for the birds themselves (~$1.25 each) and feed (2 25# bags at about $10, though that cost has risen last cpl years.)<br><br>Anyway, I would not discount the ability to feed yourself a little supplemental meat, in a fairly "sustainable" way, depending, of course, on where you draw the line on that word.<br><br><a href=#c672239799555138785 title="comment permalink">9/2/13, 12:00 PM</a><br><br>

Forgot to mention... Food to my mind is simply another expression of energy, which is what I was thinking about with the mid-winter feasts. Animals are a good way to store that food energy.<br><br>Also, a few people mentioned susceptibility to fungal infections. I just wanted to point out that because we literally are what we eat, fungal infections generally thrive in an acidic environment. If people are having troubles with fungal infections (and also yeast infections), if they reduced their acidity, they may just find that their bodies get those pesky infections under control.<br><br>To reduce acidity in your body, try eating more basic ph foods such as leafy greens.<br><br>I twigged to this because of the conditions with soil, as acidic soils favour fungal growths and basic soils favour bacterial growths. The ph of the foods that are produced are a reflection of those soils. Compost is generally basic and you use it to grow leafy green vegetables. Whilst on the other extreme, tree crops are happily fed with mulch which is quite acidic.<br><br>It is really hard though to eat too much basic food, so this is not a real worry. <br><br>Most industrial food is highly acidic because the acidity is used as a preserving agent.

(That said, the acne cream has paid for the infrastructure that can be turned to quite rapidly generating a custom phage treatment for just about any bacterial outbreak.) Phage treatment is much lower-tech and easier to maintain than antibiotic production, to say nothing of antibiotic development. Sure, at the lab here they've got the process automated to speed things up, but that's all just frills. Really, all you need is culture medium to grow the target microbe, porcelain filters to isolate the viruses, and an autoclave to keep it all clean. I have been assured by the principle investigator at this lab that XDR TB is in principle treatable by virus, and that getting the phage treatment into the lungs can be done with apparatus simple as a perfume-bottle atomizer. Apparently anti-TB phages are beginning to see use in identifying TB cultures, but I don't know of any human trials yet. Phages are also used for Y.pestis cultures, and some in vivo testing has been performed on mice. <br><br>Another oft-forgotten pre-antibiotic treatment is serum. That's what Balto was bringing to Nome-- they didn't have an antibiotic for Diphtheria back then. Serum treatments are injections of antibody-rich blood plasma from a human or animal which has been infected with the disease that needs treated. Works on bacteria and some viral infections (including Ebola), but of course is rather expensive. Horse-serum was shown to be effective in treating plague during the turn-of-the-century outbreaks that lead to the identification of <i>Yersinia pestis</i> as the plague bacillus.<br><br>All this is to say that as long as a certain level of social cohesion is maintained and the knowledge is not lost, we could maintain a good defence against many infectious diseases. The bigger question is where and whether that level of civilization can be maintained.<br><br><a href=#c1066464292708969463 title="comment permalink">9/4/13, 10:11 AM</a><br><br>

If there's an abscess that's drained that can be cultured and often is, but garden variety cellulitis really can't be cultured effectively even inpatient, so we don't bother, just treat empirically. I do know community-acquired MRSA is an issue. The MRSA rate of staph infections is about 30-40% in the nearest hospital to me, granted a lot of that is from the kinds of folks who end up in the hospital a lot. It's high enough we don't even bother with penicillins/cephalosporins, unless someone has no risk factors at all for MRSA, and even then if it's a serious infection we'll generally err on the side of caution.<br><br><a href=#c214016860142203356 title="comment permalink">9/4/13, 1:25 PM</a><br><br>

(These facts have been gleaned from a careful reading of the Mainstream Media.) Fact #1: Tokyo Electric Power workers are allowed maximum exposure of 100 milliseiverts per year.<br>Fact #2: The radiation-measuring equipment issued to these workers measures up to 100 mSv per hour.<br>Fact #3: Workers have been reporting radiation levels of up to 100 mSv around the waste water storage area.<br><br>Let's pause for a moment. If you're carrying a meter which hits its limit at 100, and as you step forward, or wave your sensor wand, you see it hit 100, by what numbed sense of self-preservation do you NOT GO GET A BETTER METER? <br><br>When, just last week, they brought in a meter that would read up to 10,000 mSv/hr, they found levels of 1,800 (today, reported up to 2,200). Without protection, four hours exposure at 1,800 mSv/hour is probably lethal. OK, so they did have protection, and it's not hard to protect against beta particle radiation, and they probably didn't camp there for four hours, so I'm not afraid for their immediate health. <br><br>But what condition of psychological pressure, intellectual or educational deficiency, or wishful thinking allows someone to pretend that a measurement at the limit of an instrument's range is trustworthy?!<br><br>(Note: if you sense an excited tone in my writing, it does NOT reflect personal anxiety about the effects of Fukushima radiation on North America.)<br><br><a href=#c8790058732923420575 title="comment permalink">9/4/13, 7:07 PM</a><br><br>

I was not claiming the method I used was "sustainable," whatever that means. It was an experiment to see what I could learn about the basic needs of meat birds.<br><br>Now, protein production, especially meat protein, is always going to be more "expensive" in energy or whatever other terms you want to use. Everything you put into an animal is going to have to come out of some piece of the earth somewhere. But on the other hand, we can't live on carbohydrates alone. So some of us are probably going to concentrate some of that grain production into meat. Of course, there is a loss in the process, and if any loss is intolerable by your definition of "sustainable," then that's not going to leave much.<br><br>Sure, there are a lot of good meat animals that can be quite productive on what is essentially waste products from a farm. Chickens are one of those. And, yes, the Cornish Cross is a pretty high-maintenance animal. I do know there are better meat birds for pastured poultry these days. I have also been told by the woman who was mentoring me in my experiment that some pastured poultry growers these days are feeding exclusively on forage and cracked corn. Still a significant input, and no doubt affects yield, but far less resource-intensive than the packaged feed I was using.<br><br>Anyway, I believe that a lot could be done to optimize the process compared to what I did. Growing the birds during a better time of year would have enabled them to be on pasture sooner. Feeding with corn and peas, which are pretty easy to grow here, would have also been an improvement. Heck, by mid-summer I cull out about half my purple hull peas, but the birds would not object to curcuillio eggs or larvae, I'll bet.<br><br>There's also the issue I alluded to in my post, that of importing fertility. Well, this is certainly not sustainable in the long run, but most farmers and gardeners I know have done it, at least in the early stages of their operation. Never hauled in a load of manure or gin trash? Then you get a medal, I guess. It seems to me that, during this transition time, an excellent way of importing fertility would be in the form of feed, be it hay, corn, rabbit pellets or what have you. You can then turn that into a product you can sell to offset your costs or even support yourself while building the health of your land. The only reason I didn't go forward with broiler production was the investment of time and money I would have had to put into the processing end.<br><br><a href=#c9174664859592018001 title="comment permalink">9/4/13, 9:15 PM</a><br><br>

It means capable of being sustained. Which means not dependent on the depletion of a non-renewable resource, or a resource that renews more slowly than we use it. Feeding animals the conventionally grown grains as the bulk of their diet isn't sustainable by any meaningful definition. <br><br>About importing fertility -- the alternative to this is concentrating fertility. Animals that feed on range and forage do this really well. They roam over your land and accumulate nutrients, then concentrate them in wherever they spend the night. You use the litter from their sleeping quarters to enrich the places you grow nutrient-intensive crops. Pasture and range do not need to have fertility imported in most areas unless it is overstocked and you are drawing too many nutrients out of it. And mass importation of fertility increases nutrient leaching from the land, which winds up in streams, lakes, and groundwater. <br><br>People managed to keep livestock and grow crops for about 8000-10000 years without feeding animals large quantutues of grain or importing fertility en masse from distance sources. These are innovations of the fossil fuel era. Sure there were famine and crop failures then. And there are now, too.<br><br><a href=#c3279382496789230567 title="comment permalink">9/5/13, 4:30 AM</a><br><br>

The way I see it:<br><br>1. Either we are bits of random, self aware protoplasm on this probably unremarkable planet for 70 years or so, then poof we're gone and well . . . so what?<br><br>or <br><br>2. Our consciousness is part of a larger energetic/consciousness entity/continuum and will return for, probably uncountable, rounds of learning here, or somewhere similar. So for this particular go-round, well . . . c'est la vie I guess.<br><br>Personally, I've had enough glimpses of something akin to 2 to choose that as my belief system. <br><br>The thing about this particular place though, is that we are so inexplicably awful to each other, other sentient lifeforms and our habitat. That I find is the most daunting issue. <br><br>Every single spiritually-oriented teaching entreats us to “love thy neighbour”, yet when the crunch comes, we do anything but that. Paradoxically, most of our leaders seem to embody the worst of our traits.<br><br>If this is a learning crucible, the lessons are very intense, but don't seem to sink in. We've been going round in circles for millenia. This guy has an interesting take on why that might be http://questioneverything.typepad.com/question_everything/2013/08/either-profits-go-or-we-go.html <br><br>Anyway, again thanks for the reminder to detach from outcomes, given that attachment to any particular outcome is the major source of pain. <br><br>What will be will be and all we can do, is what we can do.<br><br>Somebody mentioned the www.mybigtoe website a few posts ago and I'd like to say thanks for that. He's arrived at the same conclusions as many other 'esoteric' teachings, albeit from a different direction with a different and interesting perspective. Interestingly he also referred to Jane Roberts' Seth material, which pops up frequently in this area.<br><br>To pay it forward, for those that don't know www.dhamma.org offer free (donate if you want) courses in Vipassana meditation. A blocker for many people may be that the initial course is 10 days and you can't talk. Hah! Just turning up to do that is transformational in today's 'always on' context.<br><br>One great thing about Vipassana is that you should be able to experience first hand the other continuum per option 2 above. <br><br>P.S. The interstellar thing never could be done by conventional modes of travel. It would have to be through inter-dimensional/anti-grav type movements.
