<div class=MsoNormal>
The reduction of contemporary debates about the future to ritual theater, the theme of last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, isn’t limited to the specific technological issues I discussed in that essay—the increasingly dubious quest for fusion power, on the one hand, and the prospects for the internet’s survival in an age of economic contraction and resource scarcity, on the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Across the landscape of contemporary (mis)understandings of the future, just about every issue you care to name has been turned into yet another modern morality play in which progress gets to act out one more symbolic triumph over its eternal enemies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To describe that habit as unhelpful is to understate the case considerably.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Modern industrial civilization faces serious challenges in the years immediately before us, as the paired jaws of resource depletion and environmental disruption clamp down ever more tightly on it, and the consequences of decades of bad decisions come home to roost. In order to deal with those challenges, hard questions need to be asked and realistic answers considered—and this isn’t furthered at all by the tendency on the part of so many people these days to lapse into cheerleading instead. It’s rather as though you were trying to have a serious discussion about educational policy with someone whose only response to anything you said was to shout, “Central High, Central High, rah, rah, rah!” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Any number of examples of this could be quoted, but the one I’d like to discuss here<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is the way that fracking—hydrofracturing of oil and gas-bearing shales, to give it its more precise moniker—has been transformed, at least in the popular imagination, into the conclusive answer to those annoying little worries about the impossibility of extracting an infinite amount of petroleum from a finite planet. That’s worth discussing just now for at least two reasons. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first of these is that the public debate over fracking is almost certainly about to become a good deal more heated than it’s already gotten, due to the publication of a lively and eminently readable little book on the subject—<i>Snake Oil: How Fracking’s False Promise of Plenty Imperils Our Future</i> by Richard Heinberg, which you can order from the publisher <a href=http://www.postcarbon.org/book/1788629-snake-oil-how-fracking-s-false-promise>here</a>. Those of my readers who have been following the peak oil story since its reemergence early in the last decade will recall Heinberg’s <i>The Party’s Over</i>; that and James Howard Kunstler’s memorably edgy <i>The Long Emergency</i> were the books that launched peak oil into the collective conversation of our time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<i>Snake Oil</i> may just accomplish the same thing with the side of the fracking debate that’s getting no attention from the mainstream media. Heinberg makes four points in the book, each of which could usefully be put on the business end of a branding iron and applied to the tender backsides of pundits and politicians alike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First, the loudly ballyhooed claims that fracking promises a new age of limitless cheap energy for Americans are pure malarkey, based on a patchwork of unjustifiable assumptions and outright fabrications that wildly overstate potential production and tacitly ignore all the downsides of a far from flawless technology. Second, in the usual fashion of today’s American economy, fracking piles up short term profits for a few by loading immense long term costs on local communities, natural systems, and future generations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Third, a significant proportion of the hoopla over fracking is being orchestrated by those wonderful folks on Wall Street who brought you last decade’s housing bubble and bust, and the same kind of financial shenanigans that nearly capsized the global economy in 2008 and 2009 are being applied with gusto to a burgeoning bubble in shale leases and the like. Fourth, and most critically, the increasingly frantic cheerleading being devoted to the fracking industry these days is simply one more delay in the process of coming to grips with the real crisis of our time—the need to decouple as much as possible of industrial society from its current dependence on fossil fuels. As Heinberg points out, there aren’t enough economically recoverable fossil fuels left in the planet’s crust to keep the world chugging ahead on a business-as-usual track of economic growth for much longer, but there’s more than enough to finish the job of destabilizing the Earth’s climate and pitching us face first into a very difficult future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
None of these points will be news to regular readers of
<i>The Archdruid Report</i>, but then regular readers of
<i>The Archdruid Report</i> are not this book’s primary audience. (You won’t find any of my peak oil writings in the bibliography, either, and for very good reason—a book meant to influence policymakers and the general public does itself no favors by citing archdruids.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those of my regular readers who need facts and figures to argue against fracking-industry shills, or who want a short and highly readable book to press into the hands of the uninformed or undecided, will certainly want a copy, and those who have just stumbled across this blog and are still trying to figure out what all the fuss about peak oil means could do much worse than to get a copy of <i>Snake Oil</i> and read it—the absurd media blather about “limitless fossil fuels” and similar oxymorons gets a well-earned hiding at Heinberg’s capable hands. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The publication of <i>Snake Oil</i>, then, is one of the reasons why a discussion of fracking is particularly relevant at the moment. The other?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That comes from an even more unanswerable critique of fracking—this one written by the impersonal forces of geology and economics. This will come as no surprise to this blog’s regular readers, either; as I suggested in <a href=../../2013/02/the-end-of-shale-bubble.html>a post earlier this year</a>, with the approach of autumn, the fracking juggernaut is running on fumes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Consider <a href=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-18/shale-grab-in-u-s-stalls-as-falling-values-repel-buyers.html>this story</a> from the financial media—tip of the archdruidical hat to Ron Patterson’s blog <a href=http://peakoilbarrel.com/ >Peak Oil Barrel</a>, one of the rising stars of the post-Oil Drum peak oil scene, for the link. Big oil names Shell and BHP Billiton are writing down the value of their shale assets by billions of dollars. Meanwhile the value of oil and gas-related transactions, among the top profit centers for Wall Street every year since 2005, has dropped like a rock and, unless something changes drastically, won’t even make the top five list this year.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor is this happening solely on Wall Street; out in shale country, too, the boom is grinding to a halt. <a href=http://fuelfix.com/blog/2013/08/19/economy-slows-with-fayetteville-shale-drilling-lag/ >The pace of drilling in the Fayetteville shale</a> has dropped precipitously this year; in Texas, meanwhile, <a href=http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/08/20/5095998/barnett-shale-production-dips.html>gas production from the Barnett Shale</a> has dropped more than a billion cubic feet a day, to levels last seen in 2009; while in the Marcellus Shale country of Pennsylvania, insurance companies are starting to <a href=http://grist.org/climate-energy/fracking-boom-could-lead-to-housing-bust/ >cancel homeowners insurance</a> and home mortgages are becoming unavailable as the health and environmental toll of reckless shale development piles up. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Headlines of this sort are becoming increasingly common in the financial press as one month gives way to another. With utter predictability, so have articles and essays in the mainstream media crowing about the supposed end of peak oil, and financial-advice columns urging the general public to get out there and invest their life’s savings in shale oil and gas. Those who recall the way the housing bubble played out over its last year or two will recall this same phenomenon: as the fundamentals turned sour, the chorus of pundits praising the arrival of a new age of prosperity for all got louder and louder, until the crash of collapsing prices finally drowned it out. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Exactly how long it will take for the shale bubble to tip over into full-scale bust probably can’t be known except in hindsight. The same principle probably applies just as well to another question that may be even more explosive: just how much of Wall Street and the broader US financial industry depends on income skimmed off the shale bubble for its economic survival. It’s when the tide goes out, as Warren Buffet famously said, that you find out who’s been swimming naked; when the bubble bursts and companies with heavy exposure to the fracking industry can no longer cover their day to day costs by tapping into the money flows any speculative boom attracts, the consequences could fall anywhere along the spectrum from sharp regional recessions in shale country all the way to panic selling on global markets and a reprise of 2008’s economic turmoil. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suppose it counts as belaboring the obvious to point out that these aren’t the consequences that were supposed to flow from the so-called shale revolution, according to the pundits and politicians and industry shills that filled the media with proclamations of good times to come. Still, the point needs to be made, because it’s a safe bet that the same promises of abundant energy and prosperity for all will be made in regard to any number of equally dubious revolutions and breakthroughs and great leaps forward in the years ahead., with equally unsatisfactory results. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The rhetoric that surrounded the fracking bubble from its inception, after all, was exactly the sort of ritual theater of progress I discussed in last week’s post. Read any discussion of fracking in the US mainstream media and you’ll find every one of the standard cliches present and accounted for: the imaginary barriers that are there solely to be overcome, the innovative new technology hot off the lab bench, the lucky discoveries that show up just in time for the new technology to exploit, the ceremonial debate in which the opponents of progress raise doleful cries about the timeless order of rural life that’s about to be destroyed while the protagonists proclaim the dawn of a new day of prosperity and abundance for all, and so on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
None of this has any relevance to the facts on the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Outside the realm of ritual theater, the limits are real, the technology isn’t new and neither are the discoveries, the destruction announced by the opponents of fracking has turned out to be quite tangible, and the new day of prosperity and abundance has gone missing in action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, you won’t hear that from the media, not until long after the boom has gone bust, the hardware has been sold to the Chinese for scrap, and the sole remaining legacy of the shale bubble consists of county-sized areas where the groundwater is too toxic to drink. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is what happens when a culture’s traditions get fatally out of step with its circumstances. Not that long ago in America, the ritual theater of progress was adaptive, to borrow a bit of jargon from ecology: more often than not, those who extracted more resources, burnt more energy, built more infrastructure, and produced more goods and services prospered, and so did their communities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Every disagreement about economic development, as I showed last week, was therefore forced into what amounts to a ceremonial pattern that guaranteed that the proponents of progress would win every round. When the limits to growth were still far off, when it was still possible to pretend that resources were infinite and the environment’s capacity to absorb pollutants was just as limitless, that was a successful strategy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The problem with that strategy was that it was unable to adapt when the hard limits to resource reserves and the biosphere’s tolerance for pollution came within sight. In terms of our culture’s faith in progress and the ritual theater that unfolded from that faith, those limits could only be interpreted as another set of imaginary barriers to be overcome, and another set of doleful cries for the opponents of progress to utter in the ceremonial debate they were supposed to lose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That’s why every response to the crisis of our time that gets favorable attention from the US media is framed as an overcoming of imaginary limits by way of some innovative new technology, and quickly gets its chorus of opponents of progress uttering doleful cries, so that the heroes of progress have the appropriate ritual setting against which the can sing their praises of the shining new day about to dawn. Those are our traditions and our rituals, handed down to us by our tribal elders, and it’s simply our bad luck that those traditions and rituals have left us hopelessly unprepared to deal with the real world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the real world, the most important task facing each of us right now is that of grasping that the absurd abundance of energy and resources that Americans enjoyed in the second half of the 20th century was anything but normal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A cascade of fortuitous events handed the American people of that period a huge surplus of energy and resources, orders of magnitude greater than any comparable example in history. Of course we squandered most of it, and picked up habits of extravagance and waste that will have to be unlearnt painfully as the last of the surplus fades away. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To accept that task, though, is to abandon habits of thought and action that have pervaded American culture throughout living memory. The habits of thrift and self-discipline that our forebears learned in the school of hard necessity—“use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without”—drowned in the flood of mostly unearned wealth that saturated American society during this nation’s age of empire, and every detail of contemporary American culture militates against a return to those sane but unwelcome standards. At this point, as I’ve argued more than once in the past, any response to the challenge of our time that doesn’t start with using much less energy and other resources simply isn’t serious; still, our culture being what it is, unserious responses remain the order of the day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, there’s at least one good reason to think that this latter may be a distinctly temporary condition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The fracking bubble, after all, was not the first such response to the twilight of cheap abundant petroleum. In the wake of the 1970s energy crises, it bears remembering, the same sort of rhetoric currently being deployed on behalf of fracking was much in evidence, as the reckless pumping of the North Sea and Alaskan North Slope oilfields crashed the price of oil and convinced a great many people that the great god Progress was still soundly ensconced in his temple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then as now, an increasingly frantic effort to scrape the barrel was treated as proof that the barrel was still full, and allowed politicians, the press, and the public at large to put off necessary changes for a little while. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Notice the difference, though:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the scrape-the-barrel efforts launched by the Reagan counterrevolution of the 1980s kept oil production propped up for more than twenty years, while the equivalent efforts this time around barely managed the thing for five. The available reserves in 1980 were large enough to crash the price of oil and pay for one last spectacular era of prosperity; the reserves tapped by fracking weren’t enough to keep the price of oil from rising up into triple digits, or give the economy more than a brief and localized boost. We really are getting near the bottom of the barrel—less metaphorically, the point at which petroleum production worldwide tips over from its current unsteady plateau into the long ragged decline that marks the twilight of every resource.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style='font-family: Times; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>Those necessary changes still wait to be made. What remains to be seen is how many people in America and elsewhere will rise to the challenge and make them, and how many will cling to the failed beliefs of a bygone era until the night closes in. </span></div>

BHP is an Australian mining company and it was in the news here way back when you posted that original essay on shale that they'd been done over completely on that deal to get into the US fracking market and were taking a big hit on their investment. I left a link to the article that week entitled: "Know when to fold em" - yep, titled after the gambler song...<br><br>As costs go up, I have noticed that with small business here that it is getting increasingly harder to make a decent profit. <br><br>What I'm seeing anecdotally is that those employees working for very large companies (banks, telco's, miners, government etc.) seem to be drawing a nice salary and doing far better than those self-employed types in small business. Dividend holders for those large companies aren't doing so well these days either (better than bank interest though which is slowly nose diving here and may soon be in line with the US).<br><br>Interesting stuff.<br><br>When you mentioned about the point at which economic activity becomes profitless, it started me wondering about food - which is an economic activity after all in our current society.<br><br>Insurance is an interesting situation too. Over here the government legislated that the insurers had to provide cover for floods. Traditionally this has not been covered for obvious reasons. They provided coverage, but at "go away" prices. I read somewhere that some policies were being sold at $35,000 per annum due to the likelihood of an insurable flood event happening. By the way, everyones policies went up because of the flood coverage. I can see a day in the future when house insurance will become unaffordable. By the way, bushfires are lower risk than normal house fires, just in case anyone was interested.<br><br>Mind you the building regulations are so extreme in the area that I live that I doubt very much whether there will be any new houses here for a while until complexity inevitably is reduced or people disregard regulations. I doubt very much whether there are any more than a handful of houses built in this country to the standard I had build to and this house is small.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c4960860419337038414 title="comment permalink">8/21/13, 10:33 PM</a><br><br>

The booked talked about the reliability of Oral tradition as a source of information (As I am guessing with the indigenous Americans, the pre-european New Zealand Indigenous persons (known as Maori) did not have writing and preserved knowledge via oral tradition)<br><br>The book points out for example, that oral tradition info such as that about extinct species or failed crops, will tend to be discarded as of course, human memory is a limited storage facility and the elders will have had little immediate use for it. In a similar way, despite our abundance of more durable written records, western civilization seems to be following a similar pattern. That is we discard info useful to us in times of economic stasis/contraction, and keep info useful to us in times of massive economic growth. Of course now we need the info about economic stasis/contraction it is not so readily available to us.<br><br>Did the Romans and Maya decline in a similar fashion? The tribal elders were used to times of growth and thus discarded earlier knowledge of more basic living.<br><br>Fortunately on the other hand, the sheer scale of western civilization has exposed it to all kinds of cultures and ways of living. The information required to adapt to a contracting, and then more static economy is there (perhaps more than it was in civilizations before us?). Whether we can overcome our progress dogmas and actually make use of that info of course, remains to be seen.<br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c3176712116945389593 title="comment permalink">8/21/13, 10:49 PM</a><br><br>

A comment in today’s post has highlighted a key issue that I have been seeing lately: “A cascade of fortuitous events handed the American people of that period a huge surplus of energy and resources, orders of magnitude greater than any comparable example in history. Of course we squandered most of it, and picked up habits of extravagance and waste that will have to be unlearnt painfully as the last of the surplus fades away.”<br><br>I have, or have had, twenty-something to early-thirty-something clients (millennials I suppose), among my clientele since I got licensed, and almost to a person, they have felt lost. Most of them come from at least middle-class backgrounds and a decent majority of them have had their sessions paid for by parents or grandparents. As well, a majority of them were either living at home, or having “home” paid for by family. And the vast majority of them were either in college, or college-educated. Most of the “millennials” that I see have been given a great deal during their lives, and like the quote above, have come to expect it. <br><br>The advice that most of these young people have gotten all of their lives is to go to college in order to work in a fulfilling, yet lucrative career, and to invest their money. Most of the parents sending them to me seem to want me to “find out what’s hindering their motivation”, or to teach them ‘self-discipline and self-confidence so that they can realize their potential”. The thought that macro-forces are playing the greatest role in their children’s lives has not entered the picture in a meaningful way yet. <br><br>To be fair, many of the young people I see do have ingrained habits of laziness and entitlement that affect their day-to-day decisions, but I am seeing more and more how these are learned patterns of behavior, not “character flaws”. As a culture, we have taught bad habits to an entire generation that now has the misfortune to be living at the forefront of a drastically changing world. This is definitely a complicated case of macro-forces and learned personal behaviors interacting in unhelpful ways. When you’ve learned that you don’t really have to work hard to succeed, that technological innovation is both good and normal, that as long as you believe in yourself, you will succeed, and that things are only getting better, it’s normal to feel depressed, anxious, and lost when the world is not measuring up. <br><br>I truly believe that young people could embrace more helpful philosophies and habits if they were presented with the real picture, but the people teaching them are largely clueless themselves, most having grown up in a world of abundance. When I bring up some of the unwelcome realities in session, I feel that I am up against a lot of other people (family, media, government, etc…) who are offering a much more palatable picture of the world. I am hoping that the evidence of their own senses will be enough to counter the unending stream of propaganda, but most of the younger generation has not learned to use and trust their own faculties, instead living more and more in digital worlds (This is a good place to stop, as that is a subject for another post). <br><br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c7006847936274153105 title="comment permalink">8/22/13, 5:51 AM</a><br><br>

Your rhetorical skills (as in the "Trivium" of grammar/logic/rhetoric) are only getting better. This was a hilarious post, almost overkill!<br><br>BTW, I happen to know that finances for the local hospital I work for peaked around 2005: the trend has been downward since then, &amp; all I see is stress to the panicking point on the faces of the managers. It'll be sad to see people triaged off to die, but I'm afraid it's coming: insurance companies don't just want to pay, they will eventually not be able to. <br><br>My choice is rural Arkansas or rural Idaho. The Northwest may be a little more matter-of-fact &amp; civilized, when it does hit. The New South is on testosterone, hunting Yankee dollars. Hell, half the managers down here are from the technocratic training grounds up North. The older South hangs on, as a remnant, and we now have the challenge of assimilating millions of immigrants from Mexico, while our youth is largely oblivious and ready to prop up the Empire at any cost. There's no escaping this thing, but it seems wise to at least move somewhere off the invasion routes. I wonder when the technocratic elite will wake up &amp; see what's been done? Probably right after the masses do. <br><br>So many mistakes - it's sad. But the country was built on cheap promises: <br>"The colonists arriving in America during the nearly two centuries before the creation of the United States were a different breed from the immigrants who came after 1789: the first group more settled (and settling), educated, and pious, concerned with transplanting civilization to the New World; the second rootless and rapacious, exploitive, materialist, and individualistic, interested in escaping Western civilization rather than in recreating it a hemisphere away. The colonists, being civilized people, carried civilization with them; the immigrants, less civilized, brought chaos. The colonists sought remote places in which to worship their God undisturbed; the immigrants hoped to "get ahead," "make something of themselves," exercise their precious "equality" against everyone, including especially their betters. From approximately the beginning of the nineteenth century forward, the immigrants debarking at Boston, New York, and Philadelphia consisted largely of the European peasantry and proletariat; men and women who, whether from the country or the city, had never owned or controlled land--indeed, any natural resources at all. Released into the vast American hinterland beyond the Appalachian mountains and, later, the Mississippi River, they behaved like slum kids set loose in a Mayfair confectionary shop of continental proportions. As the comparison suggests, the determining factor seems to have been class, not culture, race, or ethnicity, the late-arriving Anglo-Saxon-Celtic immigrants having acted as irresponsibly as the newer stock (or more so, Sandoz--the daughter of Swiss immigrants herself--would say)..."<br>http://www.chiltonwilliamson.com/articles/thm_how_the_west_was_won_again.html<br>As a conservative by temperament, upbringing, culture, and choice, I am deeply troubled by the failure the "Right" to free itself from the modern Age of revolution, whether in technology or politics or the economy. <br><br>You may be an archdruid, but I believe that when the history books are rewritten, people will not be afraid to accord you the right honorable title. <br><br>BTW, has anyone noticed that the extreme Left &amp; the far Right are starting to wake up &amp; see certain things eye to eye? I love Erik von Khuenhelt-Ledhin's old saying: "I am a liberal of the Far Right". <br><br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c9036913603331738941 title="comment permalink">8/22/13, 7:13 AM</a><br><br>

Long trend of urbanization is reversed.<br><br>Only problem is that farming is actually very hard work, and requires skills and knowledge totally ignored in current school systems. Industrial "green revolution" farming is probably most insane thing ever done by mankind as species... Large tracts of best pasture have been reduced to barren zombified soil, kept in their "suspended animation"-state only by petro-chemical products. This problem is temporary, but unfortunately ahead of us, not behind. Productivity of established agriculture shall not remain as high as it is now, and things it products are going to be much more expensive.<br><br>Of course, while waiting for manure/petro-products to enrich actual fields, in the North it is always possible to revert into side-business of slashing and burning some forest and sowing the ashes... Accompanied by newer slash-and-char methods. Pretty rudimentary, but what can you do? I believe life is going to be pretty basic for ordinary folks after couple of decades of sustained contraction. When cut trees are spread to form a carpet and covered with earth top with vents, and burnt with low flame, you get terra preta. Black soil.<br><br>While ashes from coniferous forests are too bitter to nourish other seeds than certain variety of rye seeds, deciduous trees are different. Thankfully life cycle of forest (from meadow to old fir forest, from childhood to seniority) is triggered by burning. After decade or two it is possible to burn-clear sweet grove of different birches, alders etc. Their ashes produce a lot. Talking about death and rebirth of life-giver, there is example from real life. <br><br>Progressive thinking has lead to tragedy when applied to food production.

Then somewhere in the 70's the money disappeared and people started getting laid off. At first just a few, then more and more, and at first there would be going away parties for the person from your group that got laid off. That turned to parties to see off groups of people and then the parties stopped because more people were getting laid off than were left to give them a party. And then the whole enterprise was disbanded. Furniture was hauled out and bulldozers dozed up the floor tiles. And that was the end of that. The question in the aftermath was whether it was better to get laid off earlier and get a head start on whatever was next or to have a job as long as possible and continue the good life based on salary based on past prosperity.<br>Not surprisingly, most people will want to hang on to prosperity as long as possible. To choose insecurity and lowered living standards willingly on the expectation that you will end up there anyway is hard to do. Even if you are convinced that diminished prosperity is in everyone's future, you still want to hold on to your current prosperity for as long as possible. You might even convince yourself that they, whoever they are will invent something to ward off the unpleasantness of having to do with less.<br>And so, our political leaders, wise people and students of human greed that they are continue to sing the song of prosperity, knowing that to stop singing that tune will lead to their own personal demise.<br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c6665910243474214952 title="comment permalink">8/22/13, 9:57 AM</a><br><br>

One Native American complained that there are so many of these flares that there's no dark left at night any more, and from what I could see from the train, he's right.<br><br>Also, the scale of the farms is impressive out there, 1000's of acres. I can't imagine how they can be worked w/o cheap diesel fuel.<br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c3630707009205527801 title="comment permalink">8/22/13, 10:40 AM</a><br><br>

Agriculture is a much more fertile ground for slavery and besides large scale industry won't survive without substantial fossil fuel inputs. Sure, some modest size industry might survive using water power, wood and maybe some coal left over but scale would be limited. The pressure on wood resources was getting unsustainable by the 17th century in many places, this should give an idea how far you can go on renewables civilization wise.<br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c4483111908027331952 title="comment permalink">8/22/13, 11:14 AM</a><br><br>

Keep trying to open the eyes of the young; we need to know what we are up against.

Terrifying, yes... but empowering.<br><br>The hardest part is that we don't want to believe, and would rather hide in digital worlds, as you point out. It's easier that way. Video games etc. are also much better designed at triggering the reward centres of the brain than the rudderless lives most millenials are stuck in.

I am now living 15 kilometers from an interior city in a small South American country. I live in a thatched quincho that is comfortable 9+ months of the year. During the colder times of winter (down to 10 C.) I wear more clothing. Drinking water comes from a well, and washing water is pumped from a stream. Several of my neighbors come with 10 liter containers to get drinking water from my well. A truck delivers fruit, vegetables, and other consumables to a common area down the road once a week. Most people here walk to where they need to go, hitching a ride into town with those few of us who have vehicles, sharing the cost for fuel. Most do not have computers, some have cellphones, but most prefer to instead walk to their neighbors to have conversations or to make plans. Houses are built from local natural materials and with all local labor. Some are hooked into the grid, some have small solar panels for lighting, and some have no electricity at all. Some use flashlights, but most navigate darkness with rediscovered senses.<br><br>I have chosen to live here, and it is a lovely way to live. I feel like I am living in a manner that is both of the past and the rapidly approaching future. While the changes I have made may seem extreme to some, I have not experienced feelings of deprivation. On the contrary, I am feeling more peaceful and contented than I ever have. It is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable experience.<br><br>The future may not be so bad.<br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c3292530352126345995 title="comment permalink">8/22/13, 4:12 PM</a><br><br>

You might have heard of some of the other factors involved, such as Attila the Hun...<br><br>Wiseman, I've been talking about that for years -- consider <a href=../../2012/07/on-far-side-of-denial.html rel=nofollow>this post</a> from last year. <br><br>Magifungi, good. You're ahead of the curve. <br><br>Compound F, taking action is always a good first step. I'd encourage you to read histories and memoirs from comparable periods in the past -- that really does make it easier to deal with the emotional reactions, at least in my experience. <br><br>Phil, why am I suddenly thinking of that line from the Beatles song <br>"A Day in the Life" about four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire? <br><br>Bill, that would be utterly unnecessary. In the Third World America that's taking shape around us, any company able and willing to offer even the most pathetic wage in exchange for twelve-hour work days will get flooded with eager applicants. Slavery's expensive and inefficient compared to sweatshop labor in a poor country, which the US will be in the not too distant future. <br><br>Adam, that's a crucial issue, and one that's going to have to be addressed by those closest to it. May I encourage you to write down what you'd say to your clients if you could really cut loose and lay everything on the table, turn it into an essay, and get that thing in print or online? It might do a lot of good. <br><br>ChemEng, thank you! <br><br>Matthew, it would be very helpful if we had more than the smallest scattering of real conservatives -- that is, people who are actually interested in learning from the past and conserving its lessons -- rather than today's flurry of free market fundamentalists and religious zealots who are busy trying to immanentize the eschaton with just as much blind faith as the Marxists they claim to hate! <br><br>Bill, I'd think that, too, but once the big boys start bailing out and writing things off, the end is rarely far. <br><br>Alphonse, thank you. Agreed, "the new normal" is a thoughtstopper of the first order. <br><br>Malcolm, collectively, we're rushing toward our fate with open arms. Individually? There's still a lot of room for you and me and other individuals, who are willing to think and feel for themselves rather than simply bleating in tune with the rest of the herd, to make a difference for themselves, their families, and their communities.

We ("we" being the Progress-oriented, technologically-obsessed and market-driven mainstream global culture, I guess) seem to make a virtue of being "driven", of yearning, of having ambition and a perpetual desire for More and Better. Our mythologies, as JMG points out, define our heroes as innovators, contrarians, people who break through previous limits and deliver More (of whatever -- power, speed, convenience, comfort, toys, military might, etc). People who are satisfied with what they already have are seen as fools (or worse, villains obstructing the magnificent march of Progress).<br><br>And our culture is therefore an uneasy one, hungry, ambitious, never satisfied, never experiencing simple contentment. I had a marvelous satori moment the other evening -- doesn't really matter where or when, long story -- when I realised that at this particular moment I had achieved my heart's desire, that the yearning and planning of 25 years had taken me to where I wanted to be, and I felt I was -- at long last -- at home in my world. And that moment made me realise how rare contentment is for those of us who dwell in the industrial cores; I felt that my life had offered very few such moments, so that this one had the fresh tang of rarity. It seems odd -- we have so much More (TM) of Everything than our ancestors, yet we are never really at peace, satisfied. Even the most fortunate among us (and I count myself as one) can spend decades never being really contented.<br><br>I have been thinking ever since about contentment, its rarity, the endless propaganda (advertising) teaching us never to be satisfied with what we have -- and reading your description of a simple life in a low-tech milieu, I thought that it sounded far more rich in contentment than the average lifeway of, say, a successful upper-middle-class urban professional somewhere in N America... this train of thought really doesn't lead anywhere, and perhaps that's all right :-)<br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c9053414835382742693 title="comment permalink">8/22/13, 9:57 PM</a><br><br>

Because convincing so-called "conservatives" they are actually revolutionaries (who like to clear cut old growth forests for newspaper and construction, for example, or who think that democracy can be elevated to global scales as an ideology) is utterly hopeless.

I’m always amazed to hear supposedly sane people voice their belief that “shale will save us”. I’m helping to teach at a local “preserve the harvest” event tomorrow – I’ve stopped arguing, and am just doing what I can to provide information to those who are interested in hearing. If this is a race (and it is: knowledge against decline/crisis), it’s one of the slowest races I’ve ever been in! LOL! But it’s happening…<br><br>This opinion piece from the NYT is more about your previous essays, but I thought you’d be interested in hearing a physicist’s POV:<br><i>Americans always expected their children to face a brighter economic future, and we scientists expected our students to inherit a world where science was embraced by an ever-larger fraction of the population. This never implied turning science into a religion or demanding slavish acceptance of this year’s hot research trends. We face many daunting challenges as a society, and they won’t all be solved with more science and math education. But what has been lost is an understanding that science’s open-ended, evidence-based processes — rather than just its results — are essential to meeting those challenges.</i><br>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/opinion/welcome-to-the-age-of-denial.html?src=me&amp;ref=general<br><br>If he really embraces the “evidence-based processes”, it would be interesting to ask him about solutions to peak-energy… <br><br>@Wolfgang <i>Not surprisingly, most people will want to hang on to prosperity as long as possible. To choose insecurity and lowered living standards willingly on the expectation that you will end up there anyway is hard to do. Even if you are convinced that diminished prosperity is in everyone's future, you still want to hold on to your current prosperity for as long as possible. You might even convince yourself that they, whoever they are will invent something to ward off the unpleasantness of having to do with less.</i> <br>That’s exactly what my suburban friends are doing! I’ve stopped “preaching” or even mentioning my current concerns. They know where I stand and what I believe (the chickens, rabbits and hand wellpump are a give-away, I guess), and they just don’t want to hear it.<br><br>@Nicolas <i>What do you think are the future challenges specifically awaiting the mentally retarded and disabled, and the professionals and family members that care for them.</i><br>I’ll jump in here (as a retired mental health therapist) because I’d been thinking of that, too. It might not be as dismal as one thinks: a world without all the bells and whistles will be slower and simpler, and there will be more useful tasks for the slow and disabled to do, and others who will be working alongside at a slow enough pace to keep an eye on them. That’s how it was before, and probably will be again. There will likely be a crisis-period for everyone IMO, where the new pattern isn’t set and the old one doesn’t work. Successful navigation of this “jump” will depend on local circumstances.<br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c7908683429700710215 title="comment permalink">8/23/13, 7:43 AM</a><br><br>

I'd encourage everyone who reads this blog to do a couple of practice outages in the next year or two -- shut off the main circuit breaker for your house, and get by for the next day or two with no electricity at all. That way you'll already have some clue what to do as electricity from the grid becomes more irregular, as it will. <br><br>Cherokee, I think you've just earned a shoulder patch as a certified organic gardening geek! <br><br>Matthew, yes, that would be a good start. It was Kirk's <i>The Conservative Mind</i> that first showed me that I have more in common with old-fashioned conservatives, of the sort we don't have in America any more, than with today's liberals. (Mind you, I have at least as much in common with old-fashioned liberals, but we don't have those in America any more, either. What do you do in a society where the liberals have forgotten how to liberate and the conservatives have forgotten how to conserve?) <br><br>Leo, that sort of mismatch almost always happens when certain kinds of mythic thinking are applied unintelligently to the world of everyday experience. As for war, yes, we're in one of those periods where pressures are building rather than being allowed to vent in small wars. My guess is that the big wars that will follow will more than make up for it. <br><br>Joy, my wife and I bought our house when we moved to the Rust Belt in 2009; it's still entirely possible to get insurance, so long as you don't live in a rural area with frackable oil shale underneath it.

It's a strong one (consider, for a start, all the B-movies relying on this form, from THEM to Jurassic Park and everything in between).

Still, I think there is a hunger out there for a viable, saner alternative to mainstream liberalism (which has little in common with classical liberalism), the activist Left and the pseudo-conservative Right. I have long considered myself to be a paleo-conservative or traditionalist conservative, for lack of a better term. Among the major influences on my thinking have been Edmund Burke, Thomas Jefferson, Oswald Spengler, Winston Churchill, James Burnham, Henry Kissinger and William Lind. When I took Intro to Political Theory at university, I wrote my term paper on Burke, and my mother once bought me Kissinger’s memoirs (both volumes) as a Christmas present.

Too many of those who fancy themselves as conservatives these days forget the “conservative” and “conservation” both come from the same root, and that there is nothing conservative at all in the extremist propaganda of Ayn Rand and her acolytes or the ideologies of the neo-cons, the Rapture Right and the market fundamentalists.<br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c3150394271918834384 title="comment permalink">8/23/13, 6:58 PM</a><br><br>

If so, yes, he has an exact knowledge of what's coming down, and has every intention of using that knowledge to put himself and his goose-stepping friends in power. It's all too likely that there will be equivalents in your country and mine before too much longer. <br><br>Marcello, the peace dividend was real but by no means unlimited -- the Tokugawa bakufu (military government) kept itself in power by maintaining a substantial military force. The resource restrictions were astonishing by the standards of most other periods -- the amount of coal used was very small, and the single largest source of energy was raw human muscle.

The Frankenstein narrative is a very important part of the role assigned to the opponents of progress, thus it's familiar and appealing, and everyone knows it might have a point in some cases, just not in any of the ones that happen to come up for discussion.

Thanks for the link. <br><br>Leo, most social mammals assign to young males the job of trying to get killed, so that natural selection has a chance to work. War is one of our standard human ways of doing that; lacking it, you get various other more or less effective ways by which young men try to remove themselves from the gene pool. <br><br>Enrique, thanks for speaking up! I haven't studied Kissinger at all, but Burke and Spengler are major influences on my thinking, as you've probably noted.

But since readers (and you too JMG) may have moved on to this new post (and since this new post ALSO deals with ritual theater, I now will repost my same comment here below. (it is basically a plea to either distinguish between different categories of ritual theater(s) –in itself perhaps an interesting exercise -or to use the concept more sparingly...or maybe both….since too much of a good thing easily can end up making it into a bad one?)<br><br>But with respect to this week's post I do agree that there is also a ritual theater of fracking.<br><br>Here is that comment:<br><br>"Hi JMG....it seems to me that the (very) good (and also useful) concept (or the reality) of "The Ritual Theater" is being expanded to cover too many things or “theaters”. Is it possible that we may be reaching a "Ritual Theater of Ritual Theater"? <br><br>And are there things (empirical realities, logical arguments, and their related phenomena whether social or biophysical) that are NOT ritual theater? (or whose ritual theaters are perhaps a bit more real and meaningful -or at least discussable and analyzable in empirical and logical and evidence based terms....than -let us just say - "run of the mill" ritual theaters? <br><br>Example: The Roman Catholic church has its own rituals and also its own ritual theater; (and so do all the other main religions) and so does atheism; (of both the Anglo-American kind and the European Continental kind) and in a different way so does experimental physics and its relationship to theoretical physics. And perhaps even Thomas Kuhn's explanation of the structure of scientific revolutions also has become a kind of ritual theater. (a sub-plot of the ritual theater of progress?) <br><br>Are all these ritual theaters equal, equivalent or are some ritual theaters perhaps "more equal than others"? Or is George Orwell too and the way we see his works and discuss him also "a ritual theater"? <br><br>I think there are not only limits to growth but also to very good concepts and ideas and some apply in "certain regimes" but not very well in others. Are we moving close to the speed of light? In which case perhaps some good relativism and warped spacetime needs to be introduced also with respect to some of the good concepts we use. <br><br>Thanks for clarifying or elaborating further.<br><br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c7794150217224578734 title="comment permalink">8/23/13, 11:47 PM</a><br><br>

It was exactly the same feeling I had (maybe less on magnitude) when I learned about abortion. It wasn't so much the thing in itself, as just the sheer thoughtlessness of the whole affair, combined with the failure to find an alternate purpose or use for something "wanted for something else". Enrique, if you want more of the same, try Nicholas Gomez Davila, or maybe Donoso Cortes. Burke is about the best the Anglosphere has to offer. There are also the Catholic traditionalists, who raise some interesting arguments about the progress of "Revolution":<br>http://jcrao.freeshell.org/LouisVeuillotReevaluation.html<br>It'll be interesting to see how history is written AFTER all this happens; I would imagine there would be a great temptation for the survivors to do the "classical liberals" injustice, simply because of the association with what came after the 1848 movements, etc. Because I'm seeing more of a "feudal" and monarchic style of civilization dominating the West, rather than some advanced socialism. It's how people think in their guts and in their blood that will largely determine what comes next, &amp; having ridiculed the Middle Ages (like a son hating his father), we are bound by karmic law to have to emulate it (we've reinforced those patterns in our mind). Hence, it will also be a danger to have cheap knock-off imitations of what people THINK the Middle Ages looked like (wenching, boozing, pillaging, etc.), rather than what it truly was. <br>JMG, sir, do you think there is career value in becoming expert in such things as medieval construction, herbology, symbolism, lore, etc.? I've been thinking that building a good library of resource books on such things as cabin-construction, Scottish highland folk life patterns, etc., etc., might be as important as owning land. People are going to be starved for old and new ideas, benumbed and shocked with appalled and desolate feelings - not the best ground for "ingenuity". Will we "forget"?

My idea was to imagine that I have a "wallet" of resources, and every year I spend so much to buy my share of what humanity "collectively owns". That way I can make huge numbers personal. Idea being that in a perfect world (???) we would all share resources more or less fairly, as we are all created equal and lazy bums who do not deserve would not exist, etc. Right?! :)))<br><br>I do not know how much oil is there total, and how much of it is economically mine-able. What I know reasonably well is how much oil do we EXTRACT, and I assume that no significant amount of new oil is being deposited at the moment.<br><br>If I am to be "optimistic", I would say the world extracts about 70 million barrels per day. <br><br>So, if there was the same amount of people as in 2000, you would be spending about 4 barrels a year, that is about 126 gallons. With a car that takes somewhat over 10 gallons to fill up, that means you can go to the gas station once a month, providing you ONLY use gas for transportation. I hope your daily commute is under about 15 minutes each way with your 30mpg car, because that's all you can afford to be fair.<br><br>Since it is 2013, it is not 4 barrels anymore, but just about 3.45 or so (more people!) So you won't be going to the gas station every month, you need to take a 1.5 month vacation once a year.<br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c9140116588831820086 title="comment permalink">8/24/13, 7:31 AM</a><br><br>

To my mind, the crucial point is the need for surplus energy and resources to build any new energy infrastructure. What's being wasted today on fracking won't be there when it's needed to insulate homes, put solar water heaters on roofs, etc. -- and at a certain, not infinitely distant point, if no sane steps are taken, there won't be enough resources available to do anything at all. That's one of the critical issues that gets too little attention these days. <br><br>Marcello, there are already GOP politicians who are backing down on gay marriage.

The pack of villains presently pulling the strings don't have the interest or the will. Talking to duffers - my own age group - the prevailing attitude seems to be that they'll run out the clock. Meaning sit tight and hope to be safely dead and rotting in the grave before it truly hits the fan. <br><br>As for the young folk, they don't want to hear about it having troubles galore trying to make a living. But hear about it they will and if solutions are to be found they will have to come from their kind. <br><br>In the meantime, it's not like we'll do nothing. So what will we do? Well, we'll follow elite opinion and do what we've done in the past, that is, paper over the problem and try to buy some time. For one, we'll get the Fed and its central bank counterparts elsewhere to wave their magic monetary wands. That this was already tried and didn't work doesn't matter. Excuses will be made. We didn't do enough of it or we did too much of it or the timing was wrong. Self deceiving group-think is our modus operandi. <br><br>One hundred and seven dollar oil comes from diminishing supplies but also exhorbitant money printing. It hasn't escaped the notice of oil producers that the Fed is printing money like there's no tomorrow, "Easing" they call it. <br><br>And so the oil barons want more USD to compensate. In 1998 oil was around 10 USD/barrel. Since then the price has risen more than ten-fold in USD terms. In Canadian dollar terms that world price of oil had risen only about six fold. The difference is the price Americans pay for especially egregious money supply mis-management. What the Fed giveth the oil markets taketh away.<br><br>That's not to say things are hunky dory in Canada. Our present situation is merely disastrous in scale as opposed to apocalyptic as in the US or Europe. The healthier horse in the glue factory so to speak. But, like the US and elsewhere, public discourse here is intellectually hobbled and ideologically blinkered. We do a lot of posturing but that's pretty much it. As Orwell said, we spend lifetimes not seeing what's right under our nose. So, if you're looking for a hive of energetic and courageous thinking and action, don't look to this place. NOBODY is willing to look this thing square in the face. OK, maybe we'll re-cycle pop cans but only if everyone else is doing it. But give up the SUV? Not on your life.

I think the references were conservative about estimating infrastructure cost (e.g. not taking into account batteries and electronics and grid balancing systems for solar, or nuclear waste storage), but there were other assumptions that are questionable.

The current method of getting oil from third world nations of printing IOUs is unlikely to remain viable in a shrinking economy, and it is unclear how long the implied/applied use of violence will be able to keep things going after the financial system goes the way of the dodo.<br><br>Thus I wouldn't be surprised if the west finds it access to oil decrease a lot faster than the Hubbert curve would suggest.

I red that blog and have read it before but I enjoyed doing so again. <br><br>Let me pose a question to you and most certainly anyone else who cares to offer an opinion: "What have we already learned of civilization's response to the onset of oil resource scarcity/price increases that will probably be repeated in the future?"<br><br>JMG has made a absolutely great observation previously that as we encountered financial crisis points we (as viewed from 30k feet) sliced off another piece of the middle class and lowered their standard of living. Then we moved on. <br><br>But what about the response to oil/energy price increases? <br><br>The reason I pose the question is that the responses I have seen thus far point to a reaction that is glossed over a bit in articles like the one that was referenced. We saw miles driven lowered just a tad. We saw vehicles become a tad more efficient. We saw a little more of society's resourced directed toward procuring energy. <br><br>AND we saw more oil become recoverable. How much is a subject of hot debate. But the proof is in the numbers: we are bringing oil online that was considered uneconomical a few decades ago. <br><br>What happens as the next price increase comes into play? You have to assume the same reactions will occur until they no longer work. More oil will come available but at a higher price. I can assure you right now that there are engine designs out there right now that beat the dickens out of anything on the road now and as gas prices go up they become viable. Same thing in spades for drivetrains and vehicles. <br><br>I guess what I am saying is that I disagree not with the concept of resource scarcity, not at all. I just think that the time scale is all wrong and therefore the reaction from society in the future is all wrong. Brother John has again and again mentioned a time scale of centuries. I gotta tell you that from where I sit he is right. <br><br>I can very easily see a nation that still hasn't realized the predicament it is in 20 to 30 years from now simply because the change will be gradual. <br><br>Will<br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c4408233521671894585 title="comment permalink">8/27/13, 7:55 AM</a><br><br>

"Inside the box" thinking is what we want. "Inside the box" solutions is what we expect. <br><br>Our central bank governor just got a promotion. He was hired by the Bank of England to run the show there. A Harvard grad he is and, not only that, but an Oxford PhD and a Goldman alumnus. Impressive, no? Surely indicates an arsenal of intellectual firepower, wouldn't you say? <br><br>But still, he's a non Brit, a child of the far north and a foreigner. So how did such a person gain such a reputation as to be even considered for the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street? <br><br>Well, consider this, he was the Governor of the Bank of Canada during the 2008 crisis and, by all accounts, applied a sure and steady hand. And under his regime we suffered no bank failures. He is celebrated in the world of the political and financial elites, in fact, it is almost impossible to find someone more respected than he. He is fearsomely intelligent and well spoken and a calm and re-assuring presence. I wrote to him a while back and do you know what? He wrote back. He addressed my questions. This from an unelected bureaucrat and one about as far up the foodchain as you could get. <br><br>An aside: know what else? I also wrote to our Federal Minister of Finance, an elected official, the number two guy in our government after the Prime Minister. And he did not write me back. Nor did anyone in his staff. Not even an automated reply saying thanks for the email but due to volume we cannot reply to each one. The elected official didn't reply. I digress.<br><br>Maybe most important, at least the way it looks to me, is that, as governor of the Bank of Canada, he followed the Greenspan/Bernanke playbook. That is, in the heat of the crisis, open the money spigots, suppress interest rates and hope for the best. All of it well "inside the box". Greenspan had applied the liquidity remedy for the 1987 crash, the Long Term Capital Management debacle, the tech/telecom crash of 2000. <br><br>You might ask, is this what a doctorate in economics gets us? And from Oxford no less. What does it cost for Harvard and Oxford degrees anyway? <br><br>How is it then? Is a promotion the reward for not shaking the tree with innovative ideas? What's the implicit message? Is it this, to attain positions of high leadership, do what everyone else is doing and do not diverge from established orthodoxy? Even if the orthodoxy has only a glancing connection to reality and, even worse, even if it requires application of the same policies that had a hand in creating the mess in the first place? But we have to be fair. The levers available to a central bank governor are limited. He might argue that he was constrained by Fed action and maybe he would be right. <br><br>Also, a great many of us, at least in my age group, are unshake-ably convinced that there is such a thing as a free lunch. Don't tell us there isn't, dammit, because there is. So we asked him to do the impossible, that is, to use monetary policy to alleviate problems that have their origin in the real economy. No matter what, no monetary policy regardless of configuration will create cheap and abundant oil. Electronic entries on bank ledgers will not mitigate the effects of offshoring. But don't tell us that. We are "inside-the-box" black belts and we're not having it. <br><br>The question remains, how much of the 2008 crisis was a result of Fed and other central bank monetary and regulatory mismanagement? And how much was the effect of 150 dollar oil? <br><br>Anyway, to his great credit, at least in my books, he did write me back. I mean, it's not as if he was looking for things to do.<br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c96659228417879761 title="comment permalink">8/27/13, 10:25 AM</a><br><br>

(The U.S. also seems to have added a new twist by pretending that it's possible to fight a war where <i>only the enemy</i> dies, although it doesn't seem to be working very well.) The former works quite well as long as the Empire is running as intended, and the latter is somewhat plausible as long as you can 'force multiply' by burning more energy than your opponent. Unfortunately, neither of those conditions is likely to hold for too much longer.<br><br>Add that to the psychological effects @Adam Funderburk mentioned earlier, and the scenario starts getting scary. It's only a short step from feeling lost and helpless to feeling <i>betrayed</i>, after all, and righteous anger is a powerful drug. It looks to me like we have all the ingredients necessary for a good thaumaturgist to whip up a firestorm - he/she just needs to choose an appropriate scape-goat to launch the Jihad at.<br><br>So I'd say that the important question isn't what will happen to any excess young men; it's what - or <i><b>who</b></i> - will burn to light our funeral pyres?<br><br><br>*Or possibly 'them'.

We've had riots because of unaffordable food. The substitution game does not seem to be working anymore -- no cheaper substitutes for petroleum have come on line. In fact we have instead been compelled to use more expensive forms of petroleum. When commodity and energy prices come down it is because of global recession, not because of technological innovation. <br><br>Cornucopianism works just fine so long as you are still digging into the front of the horn.

"Too big to succeed." Or perhaps "Too big to endure." Gigantism doesn't seem to be a ticket to longevity (not among terrestrial critters anyway); big dogs die younger than small dogs, large organisations are more inefficient and self-defeating than small ones, and how many of the N Hemi megafauna are still with us (outwitted by those destructive, fast-breeding little hairless chimps)?<br><br>But what I meant to say was that I've been thinking a lot lately about multiple economies... seems like there's a "real" economy that produces stuff that people really need (like food, clothing, housing, and the transportation of stuff needed to ensure the above)... and there's a "surface" or "veneer" economy floating on top of the real economy that consists of activities that no one actually *needs*, like entertainment and advertising, toys and games, casino capitalism, grandiose luxuries for the one-percenters, etc. I'm thinking that as I look around me I see that the veneer economy has grown monstrously, abnormally thick, dwarfing the real economy. More people have jobs in "service" (often serving such relatively useless enterprises as fast food or big-box consumerism) than in subsistence activity, and the most money is being made by (forgive my directness) some of the most useless people, those whose activities produce nothing tangible (in other words, a high-priest caste).<br><br>When I think about an expensive-energy world, with expensive transport and a crying need for useful trades and specialities in every bioregion, it seems like an impossible transition. We have so few people left among us who can do anything really useful. Only 2 percent, so I'm told, still work on farms in N Am; and we are instructed to celebrate this as Progress :-) whereas for many years now it has been striking me as immense fragility. Anyway, I'm preaching to the choir as usual, but has anyone spent much time analysing the two -- or more -- economies, the baseline or subsistence economy of real resources and real beneficial goods, vs the luxury or discretionary surface economy of illusion, entertainment, symbolic manipulation and various forms of games-playing? I wonder what percentage of the economy of, say, Edwardian Gt Britain was devoted to the upkeep of upper-class gentry (a luxury or discretionary economy, less vulgarised than ours)?<br><br>One young fellow I know is a very useful individual -- he's a tree faller, a good fisherman and home canner of fish and veg, a sailor, an outdoorsperson of considerable experience and skill, knows a lot about edible wild plants and hunting: an asset to any community he might care to join. In addition to these virtues he has lovely manners, a cheerful and hard-working disposition, and a kind heart. He's one of very few people I know between the ages of 25 and 45 who seem like folks you would *recruit* for your post-peak village if you could. I contrast him with a young woman I also know who is now unemployed after several years of being one of the legion of assistant animators working on digital animation sequences for Disney films. She has no other practical skills, as far as I know, other than a couple of seasons as a tree planter. She's young enough to learn, and healthy and strong enough to work, but to me she seems like a prisoner of the false promise of the surface economy: that the world of useless luxury would continue and grow and grow forever, a bubble leeching off the real economy somehow immune to the hard physical limits on resources that the real economy requires.<br><br>When I count the number of people I know who are captives of the surface economy -- graphic designers, video game engineers, entertainment industry technicians, financial advisors, blah blah -- I feel deep dismay. What will happen to all the people with no useful skills, as the useless jobs dry up?<br><br><a href=well-and-truly-fracked.html#c1086864837866203210 title="comment permalink">8/28/13, 2:40 PM</a><br><br>
