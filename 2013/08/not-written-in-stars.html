<div class=MsoNormal>
When Friedrich Nietzsche proclaimed the death of God—in less metaphorical terms, the collapse of the Christian faith that had provided the foundations for European social life since the Dark Ages—he saw that event as a turning point in human history, a shattering and liberating transformation that would open the road to the Overman. That hope turned out to be misplaced, and it’s worth keeping in mind that any equally grandiose claims that might be made about the consequences of the death of progress will likely face disappointment along the same lines. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even so, the collapse of the civil religion of progress marks a significant shift, as important in our time as was the event that Nietzsche announced turned out to be in his.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Like its forerunner, the death of progress promises to kick the props out from under a great deal of today’s conventional wisdom, and pose serious challenges to some of the industrial world’s most central institutions. The case I have particularly in mind here is modern science, and in particular the impressively large institutional forms that have been built up around the scientific project over the last century or so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Those forms were achievable only because a widely shared faith in progress made resources and funding available for them, and their continued existence depends just as directly on the survival of that same faith. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A specific example may be helpful here, so let’s consider the future of astronomical observatories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>An observatory big and high-tech enough to contribute significantly to the advance of astronomy can be a very expensive proposition—the Palomar observatory outside San Diego, for example, costs over US$10,000 a night to operate—and the ebbing tide of prosperity in the industrial world is starting to make those costs hard to cover.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here in the US, the National Science Foundation has proposed to delete the funding for six government-funded observatories, while many observatories owned by universities are facing funding cuts or closure as a result of similar pressures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Observatories are particularly vulnerable in this context because they don’t make a profit for anybody. At a time when computer science and molecular biology departments at many universities increasingly operate as commercial enterprises, churning out patentable products to line the pockets of professors and university administrators alike, astronomers have got to be feeling like the red-headed stepchildren of academe; no matter how excited they and their colleagues may be about discovering a new type of quasar or what have you, the discovery’s not going to make them or their university any money, and the university administration is just as aware of this difference as the astronomers are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These days, the sciences are being sorted out into two camps, those that produce technologies useful to government and business and those that don’t; I’m sure my readers need no help figuring out which of those camps is getting the lion’s share of research dollars these days, and which is being left to twist in the wind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At this point I’d like to take the discussion in a deliberately improbable, even whimsical direction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It so happens that astronomers do have another potential source of income available to them—a funding source that could probably support many if not most of the existing observatories in the style to which they’ve become accustomed, and would be completely independent of government grants and the whims of university administrations alike. It would require a certain number of grad students to get some additional training, but it could be done with equipment that can be found in any observatory. What’s more, it was the funding source for several of history’s most important astronomical projects. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s as simple as it is elegant, really.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All that would be required is that observatory staff would have to learn how to cast and interpret horoscopes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, I’m well aware that that’s not going to happen, and in a moment we’ll talk about the reasons why, but let’s set that aside for now and consider the thing in the abstract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Despite the fulminations and wishful thinking of the rationalists among us, astrology’s not going to go away any time soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s been a living<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>tradition for well over two millennia in close to its current form, and is as lively now as it’s ever been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The rationalist crusade against it has been a resounding flop, having failed to make the least dent in its popularity; today astrology supports its own economic sector of publishers, computer firms, annual conferences, correspondence schools, and many other businesses, not to mention thousands of professional astrologers who make a living casting birth charts, annual progressions, horary charts, and other astrological readings for a large and enthusiastic clientele. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Not only could astronomers tap into this market, it actually takes a continuing effort on their part to avoid doing so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve been told by astronomer friends that observatories in the US routinely field calls from people who are a little confused about the difference between astronomy and astrology, and want someone to cast their horoscopes. Put a new message on the answering machine, teach the receptionist how to take down birth data, and that’s fixed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The biggest and most prestigious observatories would have the most to gain—what Hollywood hunk or celebutante, for example, could resist the temptation to drop five figures on a genuine horoscope from the Palomar Observatory, complete with a glossy star field photo of the second or so of arc that was rising on the ecliptic when he or she was born? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor would this be anything new in the history of astronomy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Johannes Kepler paid the bills while he was working out the laws of planetary motion by casting horoscopes; Claudius Ptolemy did the same thing more than a millennium earlier while he was writing the Almagest. (Granted, neither man was in it just for the money; Ptolemy also wrote the most influential treatise on astrology ever penned, the <i>Tetrabiblos</i>, while Kepler was a brilliant innovator in astrology—the Keplerian aspects are very nearly as important in the history of modern astrology as the laws of planetary motion are in that of astronomy.) For that matter, the roots of modern astronomy reach deep into the traditions of the astronomer-priests of Sumeria and Babylonia, who made the first known systematic records of planetary movements and, not coincidentally, cast the first known horoscopes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Much more could be said along these lines, but it’s probably better to stop here, so that my rationalist readers don’t fling themselves at their computer screens in a purely reflexive attempt to leap through cyberspace and wring my neck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of course the modest proposal I’ve just offered has about as much chance of being taken seriously as Jonathan Swift’s famous suggestion that the Irish ought to support themselves by selling their infants for meat, and it was made in much the same spirit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We can take it as given that in today’s America, astronomers will embrace astrology on the same day that Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins fall on their knees together and accept Jesus as their lord and savior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor, for that matter, am I interested in rehashing the weary debates over the validity of astrology. The issue I want to raise here is why the suggestion that astronomers might consider taking up astrology summons up so violent and visceral a reaction on the part of so many people these days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s important to get past the standard rhetoric that surrounds the subject—the insistence on the part of rationalists that astrology is unacceptable because it’s irrational, medieval, and just plain wrong. Sports fandom is well up there on the scale of irrationality, and yet it’s perfectly acceptable for astronomers to be rabid fans of the local baseball team; reenactment groups like the Society for Creative Anachronism are about as medieval as you can get, and yet an astronomer who belongs to such a group faces no criticism; as for just plain wrong, your average economist has astrologers beat three falls out of three—you’ll never catch an astrologer claiming that the sun will rise in the west tomorrow morning and then never set again, while it’s par for the course for economists to insist that the speculative bubble du jour will never pop, that the laws of economics can trump the laws of physics and geology, and so on. Yet you’ll never hear scientists denouncing economics as the crackpot pseudoscience that it arguably is. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What puts astrology outside the pale for today’s astronomers and the rest of the scientific community, rather, is that the collective imagination of the modern world assigns it to the dismal past from which the surrogate messiah of progress is forever saving us. Like the Christianity from which it drew a great many of its central metaphors, the civil religion of progress has a very wide streak of moral dualism; there’s the side of the angels in white—or, rather, the researchers in white lab coats—and then there’s the side of the devils in some infernal equivalent of Madras plaid, and in contemporary culture, there’s no question about the side of the border on which astrology belongs. It’s part of the kingdom of anti-progress, the exact equivalent of the Christian notion of the kingdom of Antichrist. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The white-hot passion with which so many scientists condemn astrology and other systems of rejected knowledge thus has its roots in the identity that scientists are taught to assume by their education and their professional culture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From the time of Francis Bacon right down to the present, scientists have been encouraged to think of themselves as laborers in the great cause of progress, leading humanity forward out of the superstitious past toward a brighter and better future of ever-increasing reason, knowledge and power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From the 19th century onward, in turn, this is the image of themselves that scientists have by and large tried to project into the wider society, with varying degrees of success. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That kind of acting out of an ideal can be a dangerous thing to do, and civil religions rarely have much sense of the risks involved. Theist faiths with at least a few centuries of experience under their belts tend to be a good deal more cautious; Buddhist monks who visualize themselves as bodhisattvas and Christians practicing the <i>imitatio Christi</i>
have traditional protections to keep the identification of the self with an ideal figure from spinning out of control into psychological imbalance. Those of my readers who, as I did, had the chance to spend some time around old-fashioned Communists will have seen some of what happens when those protections are neglected; the leader of the proletariat who goes to great lengths to avoid noticing that the proletariat is not following him, and melts down completely when this latter detail becomes too evident to ignore, was once a tolerably common type. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That type became much more common in the second half of the 20th century, when it started to take effort not to notice the fact that the American proletariat wasn’t going to follow a Marxist lead. In the same way, I don’t think it’s accidental that the current rationalist crusade against religion, astrology, and everything else it likes to label irrational, medieval, wrong, etc., shifted into overdrive in the final decades of the 20th century, right about the time that it first became really difficult to justify the blanket claim that progress was always as inevitable as it was beneficent. Like their theist cousins, civil religions fairly often respond to challenges to their core beliefs by moving toward the extremes and looking for somebody to blame, and the cultural politics that assigned the label of “anti-progress” to certain traditional practices such as astrology gave the civil religion of progress an assortment of easy targets once the onward march of progress began to lose its appeal. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty with such exercises in scapegoat-hunting is that they do nothing to solve the problem that drives them, and may actually get in the way of addressing serious challenges. The status of science in contemporary American society is a case in point. Not long ago, when a qualified scientist got up in front of the public and spoke about some matter of scientific fact, most Americans took him at his word.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nowadays?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>One of the core reasons for the failure of climate activism in the US is that a great many Americans know that an expert opinion from a distinguished researcher can be bought for the price of a research grant, and have seen scare tactics used to push political agendas so many times that another round of dire warnings from experts doesn’t impress them any more. When climate activists chose to rely on the prestige of science to back up a standard-issue scare campaign, in other words, they were making a serious strategic mistake, on which their opponents were not slow to capitalize. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To some extent the collapse in the prestige of science has unfolded from the way that scientific opinion has whirled around like a weathervane on certain very public issues in recent decades. Plenty of people alive today still recall when continental drift was crackpot pseudoscience, polyunsaturated fats were good for you, and ionizing radiation was measured in “sunshine units.” It’s important to the workings of science that scientists should be permitted to change their minds on the arrival of new evidence, but that necessary openness clashes with the efforts of the scientific community to claim a privileged place in the wider conversations of our time—for example, by insisting that claims by scientific authorities should not be challenged from outside the discipline no matter how many times these same authorities have changed their minds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Add to that clash the increasingly visible corruption of science by financial interests—the articles in medical journals that are bought and paid for by pharmaceutical firms eager to promote their products, the studies whose conclusions reliably parrot the propaganda of their funding sources, and so on—and you’ve got the makings of a really serious public relations disaster. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That disaster is not going to be prevented, or even delayed, by denouncing astrologers and their ilk. Mind you, it may succeed in making astrology more popular than it otherwise would be, for the same reason that the Republican Party’s bizarre habit of defining anything it doesn’t like as Communism may yet convince a good many Americans to give Marx a second chance. Given the very real pressures being brought to bear on scientists and scientific institutions in the current environment of economic contraction and violent political partisanship, it’s unlikely that anything more constructive will be on anyone’s agenda until well after the damage is done—and it’s the bad luck of astronomy, along with a great many other sciences not currently participating in the worst of the abuses, that it’s likely to be tarred with the same brush as those who richly deserve it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Factor in the twilight of the civil religion of progress, though, and the ethical and political crisis of contemporary science becomes something considerably larger. In a world of the sort we’re most likely to encounter in the decades ahead, in which sustained economic growth is a subject for history books, a growing fraction of Americans live in gritty suburban slums with only the most intermittent access to electricity and running water, internet service costs more than the median monthly income, and let’s not even talk about how many people can afford basic modern medical care, faith in the inevitability and beneficence of progress will make roughly as much sense to most Americans as faith in the worker’s paradise of true Communism did to most citizens of the Soviet Union in 1980 or so. In such a future, government funding for scientific research will be at the mercy of the first demagogue who realizes that gutting the National Science Foundation, and every other scientific program that doesn’t further the immediate needs of the Pentagon, is a ticket to a landslide victory in the next election. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So long as scientists keep on thinking of themselves as heroic workers in the grand cause of progress, furthermore, any attempt on their part to counter such efforts will labor under brutal limits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The vision of futurity central to their identity is already becoming the subject of bitter jokes of the “I believe I was promised a jetpack” variety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the shift in the collective imagination implied by those jokes continues to spread, like the old-fashioned Communists mentioned earlier in this essay, scientists won’t be able to respond to their critics without jettisoning their traditional rhetoric, and they won’t be able to jettison the rhetoric without abandoning the heart of their public identity. That’s a trap from which very few organizations and social movements ever manage to escape.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus it’s uncomfortably easy to imagine a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2070 or so, say, that resembles nothing so much as the national convention of one of the old-line American Communist parties eighty or ninety years earlier—a small group of old men going through the motions of an earlier time, repeating decades-old slogans, voting on resolutions that matter to no one else on the planet, and grimly trying to pretend that history hasn’t left them sitting in the dust. In such a future, those astronomical observatories that haven’t been stripped of metal by looters and left to the wind and rain might find a second life as homes for the very rich—it’s just as easy to imagine the attendees at the convention I’ve just described muttering bitterly about the Chinese trillionaire who’s just had the former Palomar Observatory remodeled into a mansion, and boasting to reporters from 2070’s mass media about the spectacular view from his new home. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The point that needs to be grasped here is that the institutional structure of science in America and other industrial nations—the archipelago of university departments, institutes, and specialized facilities for research that provide the economic and practical framework for science as it’s practiced today—faces massive challenges as we move forward into the deindustrial world. On the one hand, the raw fiscal burden of supporting that structure in an age of economic contraction and environmental payback will become increasingly difficult for any nation to meet, and especially challenging for the United States, as it descends from its age of imperial extravagance into a far more tightly constrained future. On the other, the emotional commitment of scientists to the civil religion of progress, and to an understanding of the purpose and goals of science that only makes sense in the context of that religion, places harsh burdens on any attempt to preserve that structure once popular faith in progress dissolves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It might still be possible to maintain scientific research as a living tradition in the centuries immediately ahead of us. In future posts, I plan on talking about ways in which that might be done, and the reasons why I think a project of that sort is worth pursuing. Still, it’s crucial to realize that nothing guarantees the success of such a project; to borrow a phrase from the astrologers, the survival of science as a living practice is not written in the stars. </div>

One of the striking findings was that the old narrative of the arts as central to “culture” (in its original sense of something that grows and progresses) had vanished from the public consciousness almost without a trace (in the Midwestern US in any case). This formerly widely held idea that arts could lead to a kind of moral or other kind of “elevation” survived only among a small stratum of the elite. For the rest, the arts might be interesting or entertaining or a chance for people to show off a skill, but it wasn’t a public matter and certainly not important to the “development” of your city or your nation. In effect, “Progress”, had died out in this realm practically without the public noticing.<br><br>In order to rebuild a sense of arts as a public good, we found that talking about the “ripple effect” of arts in a community brought people back on board. That is, art events – whether you cared to be there or not – made your community a better place to live, knit people together and enriched a shared conversation, and so on. It is a pivot that will warm an art booster’s heart, but it no longer has anything to do with Progress.<br><br>My point with this tangent, is that I strongly suspect that Progress is going to slip away from science as well, perhaps similarly unremarked by the public at large. And to the extent it persists, science, practical, useful science will be valued not as the heroic engine of Progress, but as a practice, and a method, and a toolkit that can make that community and that place that you value, better. I’m a bad gardener, because I’m a bit too much of an experimenter, and tend to value a lesson learned more than a full basket of cucumbers -- but I’m sure if I had to buckle down I could use some science to create some more constructive ripples in my gardening community.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c8700115441894142084 title="comment permalink">8/7/13, 7:19 PM</a><br><br>

They'll be squirming over this one for sure! Hehe!<br><br>I've known three people over the years that have completed a PhD in science and then promptly walked away from it into a wholly new career. Sometimes, it makes you wonder how important was the original research that they conducted? My gut feel was that they walked away because of the lack of tenure, necessity of chasing research funding and possibly also because they never realised that the completion of the PhD was simply just another beginning and the world was not going to embrace/celebrate them for achieving their own personal research goals. It was probably a bit of a shock for them to be treated no better and probably worse than, your average research assistant.<br><br>Occasionally these three people display a level of arrogance about subjects outside of their field of research endeavours that is gobsmacking. It is not an endearing quality...<br><br>Leading people requires better observational skills and understanding of the peoples motivations and real world conditions than they apparently have. <br><br>Your historical observation about astronomy and astrology got me thinking about farmers of all things. People’s perception of a farmer is someone driving a massive tractor roaring across the landscape. My aspirations are somewhat less (not owning a tractor) and I dream of dung heaps. It always strikes as being totally surreal how much of our organic matter no longer makes its way back into the soil. Even worse it is treated as a waste product. It is amazing how cheap this stuff is in bulk and it won't be until we need it as a society that we'll wake up and realise where it all went...<br><br>I reckon the medical industry is pretty down on herbal lore too for much the same reason. In my enthusiasm, I accidentally mentioned to a Doctor once that I consumed some herbs as a remedy for an ailment. Won't make that mistake again as I ended up feeling like a bit of a dolt after the lecture.<br><br>PS: I had a very smart lady working for me years ago that used to make a very good living - in addition to her salary - providing astrology readings.<br><br>PPS: Next week you may shock me by suggesting that ecologists might have to stop writing reports and get out and do work on the ground with their hands?<br><br>Hi Celine,<br><br>Thank you for the suggestion.

Thank you for your well written, concise articles: I am always amazed at how you've managed to bring the good side of popularization (so well done by scientific organizations) to the area of civil religion, ethics, religion (although I come from a Traditionalist/esoteric framework which makes "dissensus" inevitable, at times). One of the more cogent explanations of "Anti-Christ" I've read is Steiner's (as interpreted by Bondarev): If Christ's mission was to redeem or uphold Lucifer with the right hand, &amp; balance Ahriman (Law) with the Left (the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath), then the earthly Trinity of force is the opposite of Anti-Christ, which is the use by Asuras or demonic legions (associated with the seven deadly sins) who attempt to use Lucifer's imagination and Ahriman's exaltation of Law to create the "flattened" modern world-state: the Anti-Christ, to which all must burn incense. Sounds a little differently when put this way, &amp; perhaps a minor quibble (given the thrust of the article). I do agree that secularism has become its own religion, with its own impoverished and twisted versions of things like Last Judgement, Anti-Christ, Heaven, Hell, etc. Brilliant writing, as always. The Thought precedes the Reality. The subtle rules the dense. It will be mildly amusing (if it weren't for the human suffering) to watch the "traditionalists" in secularism try to explain how &amp; why things like Financial Unity ("FU") &amp; global super-states will save man from what is coming. In the long run, the question of the meaning &amp; sacral nature of Life, rather than limited special interest groupings of "human rights", is going to be decisive, especially on the North American continental mass. Do you think that (perhaps) the rise of Science as a religion is in some measure explained by the purposeful "incarnation" of souls in large numbers or waves during our times, all of whom share proclivities in that direction? Such a doctrine is not foreign to astrology...?<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c8007991632408501146 title="comment permalink">8/7/13, 8:27 PM</a><br><br>

The internet does that for you now for free. Like everything else. <br><br>The other day I heard an astronomer talking on the radio about one of the recent exoplanet discoveries. He was describing where it was located in the sky, and mentioned it was right at the tip of the tail of Scorpio. I practically jumped out of my skin as though I had heard Richard Dawkins make a passing reference to The Almighty Creator. The astroNOMERS call that constellation ScorpiUS. The astroLOGERS call it ScorpiO. This is the sort of small difference that wars are fought over... <br><br>To paraphrase Douglas Adams, scientists are not proud of their ancestors and never invite them 'round to dinner. Most of the natural sciences loathe their intellectual and conceptual grandparents, and speak of them only with derision. Sure, this may be because their faith in progress requires rejection of the antecedents... but...<br><br>...when I ditched academia and became a trucker, I found that I joined a trade that was proud of its ancestors and saw a continuous thread linking themselves back to the mule teams and the spice trade. We felt ourselves the heirs to a great tradition that spanned the millennia. When we drive I-84, paralleling the railroad tracks, and seeing the signs marking the route of the Oregon Trail, we feel the continuous thread linking us through the generations. When we blow through the Cumberland Gap or over the Donner Summit at 60 m.p.h., we tip our hats to those who came before us and struggled through with ox carts, sometimes dying in the attempt. So, why can the transportation industry believe fervently in the steady onward progress of technology, and yet still honor its teamster ancestors, but the chemists get all heebie geebie at the mention of alchemy?<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c3912392817056319460 title="comment permalink">8/7/13, 8:48 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the info. If science can succeed in defining itself in those terms, it'll be a lot easier getting it through the crisis years ahead. <br><br>Cherokee, one of the things that scientists are going to have to unlearn is the notion -- surprisingly common among them, at least here in America -- that having learned a lot about one narrowly defined scientific specialty, they are qualified to pass judgment on a dizzyingly wide array of issues about which they've never learned anything at all. Your comment about arrogance leads me to think this same problem also exists on the other side of the planet...<br><br>Sufiya, no, that's a different outfit. BTW, did you not notice my comment saying that posts trying to debate the validity of astrology, one way or another, would not get put through? <br><br>Bruin, if I understand the theory correctly, aliens from another solar system would have a completely different zodiac, possibly with a different number of signs. I think it was Carl Sagan who got a star map for the heavens as seen from Tau Ceti and drew on it a beautiful constellation of a six-legged unicorn, only to find out that without knowing it, he'd put the Sun (a moderately bright star from Tau Ceti) at a very undignified place relative to the unicorn's posterior!<br><br>Esther, I'm tolerably familiar with Steiner's work on that among other subjects -- my gardening style has drawn extensively on biodynamic theory, for example. Since I'm not addressing an audience of Anthroposophists here, I use a noticeably different vocabulary and approach!

In the distant past scientists like Kepler were astrologers for the imperial court and emperor, which in some sense had more in common with modern scientists working for the government. I have a bit of a problem with the metaphor of science and even the concept of continuous progress as a religion. Science ultimately concerns itself with things that can be objectively tested and repeated, from which practical knowledge can be derived (for making things that work). It concerns itself with how things really are as you say. I know of no religion that does that. Many people have tried to verify that astrology leads to repeatable and statistically significant results and the answer has always been negative (I had to get that in there). Even Jung took a stab at it and had to admit that the trickster got the better of him. The notion of constant scientific progress is an assumption that many people have and that may very well be wrong but I don't see how it is the same as a religion.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c2329682412262105886 title="comment permalink">8/7/13, 10:18 PM</a><br><br>

Perhaps individual fortune tellers can make a modest living, but its not because they need to consult science or actual observerable fact, but because they are sitting in front a person in pain and they can listen, so they might take the place of cheap therapy, and if the observatories have anything to do with it, it can be publishing basic data computed by the century, and that's not going to cover the costs of running an observatory.<br><br>But on the issue of science, the most basic science isn't theories but gathering endless data about how our world changes, like climate, or animal behavior and the like, and I guess that sort of work can be pretty low-tech at eye-level observation, but the NASA level is very high tech, and gathering insane amounts of data. At least climate change is something that affect us, but the biologists watching individual animal populations, diversity, and variability, like the dying frogs that don't matter to us, I admit it awes me that someone cares to do that, or someone can get paid to do that, it's hard to believe.<br><br>But back to your point, can science add "marketing" and find "high-market value" revenue to subsidize basic science observation? I guess I'd take that question backwards, and start with the idea of using the HIGH value efforts, like $100 million dollar weather satellites, and hope the scientists are actually building $10 million dollar satelites, and stashing away the rest for their operating budgets which can include wider research along for the ride.<br><br>Actually the biggest question for me now is to see how technology has created so much digital data of every sort, on the world, and our selves. I contrast this to the ideas like Daniel Quinn's "The great forgetting" so I guess the left brain will never have enough data to be happy, and the intuitive right brain (or whatever division you label to our fragmented sense of self), says we already know everything in the universe, have instant access to anything we need to know, at least that's the new age ideal. But the question goes back to "how do you know what you know?" so there's some hidden skill in separating wishful thinking to other sources of intuitive knowledge, and that's a lost skill in the mass-media distracted modern world.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c1347646418054398772 title="comment permalink">8/7/13, 10:32 PM</a><br><br>

I'd like you to consider the possibility that science, like all other human activities, is subject to the law of diminishing returns, and for that reason, that there's a hard limit to how much about the universe science can ever learn. Most scientists reject that suggestion with a great deal of heat -- yet science can certainly be practiced without believing that it's contributing to an endless improvement in knowledge. It's via the conviction that science must progress forever, and that by doing so it contributes to human progress, that the civil religion slips in. <br><br>Magifungi, good. I'd suggest that utgrowing the myth of progress would be as useful for astrologers as for everyone else. I've often wondered why it is that some modern astrologers get so deeply into the myth of progress -- chasing after the newest thing, on the presupposition that it must be better -- when the basic theory of astrology presupposes cyclic time in which everything repeats in endless combinations! <br><br>Ares, why on earth should observatories be limited to publishing data? It would be easy enough to have a staff astrologer and an assortment of grad students to provide the whole range of astrological services, and the ordinary starting salary of a professional astrologer is fairly modest, so it wouldn't even cost that much.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c3940694776711908860 title="comment permalink">8/7/13, 11:01 PM</a><br><br>

They make the best engineers and scientists.Sorry to say this obvious fact.<br> Science and engineering is not learned from books alone.There are lot of things learned from experience which are not being passed to new generations.The unwritten scientific procedures will be lost forever just like loss of traditional knowledge by old societies.The disconnect between students and teachers,prominence of ideologies in universities will do more damage to science in longer term.The constant praise of mediocrity in name of equality is dangerous in scientific research.<br> The other countries in world just could not replicate it except may be Japan,Taiwan and South Korea.<br> My country has 39 CSIR labs ,328 govt universities,thousands of scientists,millions of rupees in budget and their contribution to Indian science is negligible.We produce 2 million engineers per year,but their contribution to any worthwhile project is negligible.<br> The point i am emphasizing is:Whatever west has done in last 500 yrs,other countries just can't do it again.If modern science fades in west,it will fade even faster in other countries of world.<br> The way of thinking just can't be replicated.<br> On practical side,JMG,I did a project last year on making of traditional Indian beverages from tropical fruits.Our students made wines from cashew,mango,sapodila and jackfruit.Our cashew ,mango and sapodila wines (called feni) turned to be good .I could not use standard wine yeast cultures because of lack of facilities and our lab was non existent.I will continue more of my private research in this next summer when cashew apples and mangoes will be in supply.<br>May be if decline starts ,i will have some practical skill like selling wines and making soaps(I also worked as shift officer for soap manufacturing plant of a MNC.I also have enough knowledge of making purely herbal soap without adding synthetic soap).<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c2327728245664879897 title="comment permalink">8/7/13, 11:40 PM</a><br><br>

The demons of the progress narrative now have a solo show, with one's narrative of time mainly involved in how well the war is going.

When climate activists chose to rely on the prestige of science to back up a standard-issue scare campaign, in other words, they were making a serious strategic mistake, on which their opponents were not slow to capitalize."<br>Really?<br>There are fraud, corruption, and ethics issues in every form of human activity including politics, finance/banking, business, and yes also science, but surely the public should not consider science anywhere near the top of that list. What you are saying sounds more like what I read from climate change deniers. The reasons the public has not bought into the message of climate change are many, but at the top of that list is a massive misinformation campaign designed to push emotional and psychological buttons. By the way what should the climate activists use as a basis for getting their message out if not science? As for a "scare campaign" most scientists are pretty conservative and reserved about their claims so maybe they are not the best to use in this case.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c4296094544089232250 title="comment permalink">8/8/13, 12:38 AM</a><br><br>

As a painter – in the Western artistic sense – I am well aware of the narrative of progress couched in what we call Modernism. “Liberated” as it were, by photography to take up something other than mimesis, and reproduction, Painting moved “progressively” from one “ism” to the next. To be sure it was an exciting, inspiring, emergent phenomenon. Early on, a sense of exuberant idealism and optimism was pervasive. Wars and economic depression dampened that spirit, but was folded into the narrative all the same. Small ‘m’ modernism certainly had it’s second coming in the post-war era – especially this side of the Pond, which is where you find many of the major “isms” taking place in art. Meanwhile a version of the law of diminishing returns seems to have set in: Painting gradually gave way to multi media arts and no longer sat on the throne of “cutting edge”…And the term “modern” itself was pegged to a historical set of styles as the next “ism” manifested itself as nothing more than “Post-modernism”. This of course, gives the false impression that “modernity” was over, but in fact this age-of-fossil fuel /industrial phenomenon never went away, it was just getting into overdrive with the new globalism… But the narrative of Progress in this so-called post-modern era is indeed unfolding differently now thanks to the extreme degree of specialization and variety that you would expect from a society running on unprecedented amounts of energy…There is even, perhaps, a vague sense of the death of Progress in the air… mixed up with confused notions of entitlement and inevitability of technological salvation.<br>Now the temptation is to expect that the death of Progress, the beginning of contraction and descent, and the de-industrialisation of visual art might define the new cutting edge moment in the story of art. But of course the mistake is to use the language and narrative of progress to describe a completely different phenomenon taking place (regress). I suspect rather that so much of this will be teased out, and probably misinterpreted while looking in the proverbial rear-view mirror.<br>As an aside, interestingly enough, as a painter, I have gravitated to themes related to navigation, including astronomical imagery – essentially working with star maps as my guide. I am no astronomer, nor astrologer, but you’re right, there is an enthusiastic audience for this type of imagery.

The current post is more about science as an industry rather than the utility of the scientific method. I can see some resistance to what you are saying if people read this post in a vacuum.<br><br>Second, I'm curious about the examples in history of what science looks like when it is funded by private wealth as a view of the future. I suspect what you will see in the coming decades is that research universities will shrink down to the elite schools with large private endowments. However, most of this work will resemble the science of a few hundred years ago (at least my take on it- I need to look back at this history in more detail) when wealthy individuals would tinker around with ideas that they found personally interesting. Science for the sake of science was a hobby for the elite, not a part of the national agenda for a country.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c5778703512218875550 title="comment permalink">8/8/13, 6:03 AM</a><br><br>

I don't see the shunning of faulty science as a bad thing. While most lay persons could not articulate why they disagree with climate scientists, they instinctively know that something is wrong with their method and therefor their conclusions must be held as suspect. This is not to say that their claims are right or wrong, but they are suspect. <br>Even a blind squirrel sometimes finds the acorn. <br>I believe of all the different things that stop scientific progress in a particular field, the one common ingredient seems to be the inability to say out loud that we may be WRONG. Ultimately isn't that the main difference between science and religion. It's odd how we can use science for one thing and then ignore it on another.<br>While I agree with you that the religion of progress will collapse over time, I suspect I might disagree with how and why it will be replaced in our collective psyche as a people. Progress does not stop, it slows and becomes something else out of necessity. It doesn't need a fix. <br>Our problem is much bigger than progress. Progress is a symptom. I fear that the cure for this symptom will kill the disease. <br>No one wants to use logic, they all have faith and know who the devil is. There are only competing religions vying for what they see as, on one side the freedom of America and on the other side, the hate of everything that America Stands for. The arguments that occurred at the beginning of this nation are being discussed again. Obviously, it's more complex than this and neither side is correct, but essentially we all chose something close to one side or the other. Many in this day and age are choosing not to play. But as the saying goes even that is a choice. <br>We all think we are the god in this drama and the other side is the devil. One side will be correct. Probably they will never know that they were just the blind squirrel. Only time will tell if they got the acorn.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c1497861088037623182 title="comment permalink">8/8/13, 6:13 AM</a><br><br>

You could still look through state-of-the-art telescopes at midcentury. I can already hear the groans from scientists imagining the regress. Diminishing returns as you say; while we haven't completely exhausted the set of measurements to be made on such instruments, it has been much-depleted. (and what's left are, for the most part, things our intellectual ancestors didn't find too interesting) If astronomy is to survive it will have to become an art form, because it will quite shortly not be able to progress as an observational science in the way we're used to, once the grants for bigger and better telescopes start to dry up. <br><br>I imagine that the transition to art and entertainment, like the transition to Astrology centres, would have to wait for the death of the internet.

My point is that the survival of science depends on freeing it from the shackles of the dying religion of progress.<br><br>Realguy, mango wine sounds <i>very</i> tasty. As for soap, that's an excellent plan -- when the Soviet Union came crashing down, there were massive shortages of soap, because nobody remembered how to make it in the kitchen any more. (My spouse makes all our soap, and hers is considerably better than the commercial product.)<br><br>PhysicsDoc, notice the difference in the cost of further advances in physics between Lord Kelvin's time and ours. How much did it cost to find the Higgs boson, compared to the cost of the great advances in physics in the first two decades of the 20th century? That's your measure of diminishing returns. <br><br>Nicholas, well, yes -- I was speaking of public denunciations of economists, along the lines of the public denunciations of astrologers that play such an important ritual function in the scientific community these days. It doesn't surprise me that in the privacy of their own labs, scientists talk more freely!<br><br>KL, that might work, though it would take some careful stepping to keep the funding independent of government and academe. <br><br>Nicholas, I love the phrase "Dark Empiricists"! I trust they're going around in black cloaks making sinister gestures from the shadows. As for heresies in the Great War of Reason, that's standard for a dying cause -- as it becomes less and less possible to claim that anybody else is listening, fratricidal debate becomes the hobby du jour. <br><br>Juhana, I'll discuss in a later post why I think science is worth saving. As for barbarism, though, you're starting to sound like Robert E. Howard!<br><br>PhysicsDoc, then you're not paying attention. It's always comforting to insist that a movement's failure was all the fault of the other side, but that makes it impossible for supporters of the movement to recognize that they made critical mistakes that gave away the initiative and a range of other advantages to the other side. The collapsing prestige of science is a crucial issue these days, and to the extent that scientists fail to recognize it, they're condemning themselves to one defeat after another. <br><br>Wiseman, it's a class issue.

That the less practical sciences like astronomy and particle physics will continue to be supported to the degree that we support other human endeavors like the arts. These are beautiful things humans do, and benefactors, public interest, and spin off benefits will lead to continued support. Current funding levels for these areas of science are already tiny compared with support for biomedical, engineering, and geosciences.<br>Here is the NSF budget of which fundamental physics and astronomy is roughly 10%, <br>http://www.nsf.gov/about/congress/113/highlights/cu13_0409.jsp<br>but the National Institutes of Health budget is about 5 times larger than the NSF budget. If you include commercial R&amp;D budgets for engineering research, the total amount spent in the US on impractical science research is barely noticeable. <br><br>Another comparison: the total of the budgets of major orchestras in the US is larger than the NSF budget for astronomy and particle physics.<br>http://home.fuse.net/clymer/minor/orchbud.html<br>Granted, the orchestras get much less public funding, suggesting that there may be big changes ahead for impractical science. But the overall scale of funding seem not badly out of balance to me. The impractical sciences will just have to turn to private sources for more of their funding...maybe astrology? More likely wealthy executives from tech firms etc. will provide more of the support. Already, Kavli, Sloan, and other private foundations support a lot of impractical research. <br><br>And I would argue that public funding is also justified. Particularly in astronomy, which is becoming less impractical...asteroid hunting and comparative planetary science may become quite useful in the centuries to come.<br><br>Of course, you are expecting a long term contraction of the global economy which could put impractical science largely out of business. I expect that through a long and chaotic transition away from fossil fuels, a global industrial economy with low or no growth will emerge (with continued fluctuations) that will continue to support experts engaged in the arts and impractical sciences...particularly those good at marketing what they do.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c1454161627700313242 title="comment permalink">8/8/13, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

About all that was said was that alchemists' main concern was converting lead into gold ... but of course that's impossible by chemical means. It was a great way to marginalize alchemy and alchemists, to set ourselves as chemists apart as having progressed from our ignorant ancestors. It was also a way to uplift the rational over the irrational, to train out of us the idea that anything that isn't rational has value to the scientific enterprise.<br><br>I think a lot of scientists have been slow to understand how very little most of what we do matters. Take quantum theory, for instance. It's a great intellectual achievement, and it's needed for microelectronics. But movies, photography, telephony, motor vehicles, and most anything else that we use daily was either invented before quantum theory or else doesn't need it for its production and operation. I think we've lost touch with the practical roots of the scientific method, the way it offers us a means to dialogue with the natural world. Instead, we let ourselves become the gods of ever-advancing progress. It's been good for our egos, until recently, and it has allowed a lot of us to avoid growing into full human beings, as conversant with our non-rational aspects as we are with our rational brains. That will make our devaluing, the backlash against us and our work, unfathomable to us.

It seems to me that the adoption of many habits of thought from rationalism has made possible the economic and technological growth upon which the religion of progress has rested. And so it is easy to see them as one in the same. But I think that scientific rationalism will continue to be immensely useful after the religion of progress has become a time-worn and abandoned tradition. Those who rely on horoscopes, homeopathy, and inerrant ancient texts to guide them through the chaotic transition away from fossil fuel are likely not to navigate the process as well as those who combine our best understanding of how the universe works with the best traditions that humans have developed for managing themselves. The human part of this is the most important and you have rightly focused on the non-rational side of human management to balance many who try to ignore this. But in the whole picture, I think scientific, religious, cultural, political and even economic traditions will all be important in managing ourselves through the transition.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c1276853409331233218 title="comment permalink">8/8/13, 8:43 AM</a><br><br>

One aspect of modern science that has had me fascinated since I was a kid is paleontology, and specifically the search for evidence of humanity's evolutionary ancestors. In fact, I'm currently reading a book about that very subject. If astronomy may not be able to find means of support in a contracting economy, how much less will fossil-hunting expeditions to east Africa? That would be a real shame, because the knowlege gained from such expeditions gives us more insight about about US--one thing that we're all interested in!--and where we come from. It's certainly not esoteric.<br><br>The epithet of "irrational" that is hung on astrology, of course, is the same epithet hung on theism by the militant atheists like Richard Dawkins (since you mentioned him).

But I believe it leaves out an additional important reason for the demise of the prestige of science - indeed, in the American context, probably the single most important reason of all:<br><br>I refer, of course, to the irrevocable commitment of the mainstream scientific establishment to the doctrine of evolution, along with the sustained propoganda offensive that that same scientific establishment has maintained on behalf of that doctrine for three or four generations now. <br><br>Most assuredly, millions and millions of Americans are profoundly weary and fed up with this ceaseless propaganda barrage. As such, the scientific establishment would do well to dissociate itself completely from its function as the chief organ of propaganda for evolution. Were they to do so, it might go a long way toward mitigating the harsh future that you forecast for science by softening the hearts of those tens of millions of weary, fed-up opponents of evolution. <br><br>Nor would science lose much of substance by taking this step. The fact is that most of scientific research and practice does not require evolutionary presuppositions in order to be effectively carried out at all. More often than not, in fact, evolutionary presuppositions act as a hindrance to effective scientific research, especially in the social and behavioral sciences.<br><br>All of this follows from the fact that the doctrine of evolution is, in the last analysis, not scientific at all, but rather a matter of religious faith. So science would be sacrificing little if anything in concrete operational terms by abandoning its role as the high priesthood of evolutionary doctrines.<br><br>I know many readers of this blog post will react with fury to the assertion that evolution is not a matter of science but rather a matter of faith. However, JMG, based on some of your own remarks on the role of evolution in your religious convictions in recent weeks, I an not entirely certain that you would completely disagree with my assertion. If you would care to say a few words on this matter in response to my current post, I would be much obliged.<br><br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c3680814795003839689 title="comment permalink">8/8/13, 9:59 AM</a><br><br>

I've long suspected that, aside from traditionalist Christians such as yourself, most of the motivation for the various forms of creation science is that it's so fun to watch scientists, and liberals generally, fly into a Donald Duck frenzy when you challenge them on that subject. That said, in the sciences where I have a certain amount of training -- the life sciences, and ecology in particular -- evolution is indispensible for even the most basic understanding, so cutting evolution out of those would gut them, leaving very little behind.

In so far as mathematics does not apply to religion or spiritual matters it must mean that meaningful quantifiable patterns do not reside there. Even if this is true, this does not mean that these areas are not meaningful themselves. An example is the famous Jungian concept and phenomena of synchronicity.

That, in turn, depends on what empirical tests are available at that point in history to distinguish gold from all other metals, pure or alloyed. <br><br>Note that I have emphasized the word "entirely" -- no exceptions are allowed from a historical perspective. <br><br>For the last two centuries chemists have used the word "gold" only to refer to the chemical element Au, and they now have excellent ways to identify that particular element in a laboratory with certainty. But it was not always so.<br><br>My step-grandfather, who among many other things also dealt in precious metals from time to time, had no such laboratory. He tested "yellow metal" with far older tests. He applied concentrated nitric acid to it, he bit it, he rang it against his teeth, and he estimated its weight against its volume. On the whole, these tests worked quite well. With some difficulty, however, one could manufacture a counterfeit "yellow metal" object that would pass these four rough-and-ready tests of his. He knew that this sort of counterfeit could be made, and he allowed for the possibility in his business dealings.<br><br>Now move back six centuries or so into the later Middle Ages. They could make nitric acid ("aqua fortis") back then, though not quite as pure as we can make it now. Thus all of his simple tests were available to Medieval goldsmiths, minters and coiners. They had other tests also, such as the color the metal left when rubbed on a well-chosen touchstone, which my step-grandfather did not use. And here is the key point: anything that passed *all* of the available tests for gold was, at that time in history, literally "as good as gold" -- in fact, it *was* gold, as far as anyone could ever know back then.<br><br>And just as we can make alloys now that will pass some or many -- maybe all -- of these ancient tests for gold, there is no reason to doubt that some Medieval alchemists and goldsmiths could, in principle, do the same.<br><br>So it is simply bad history -- *very* bad history indeed -- for a historian of chemistry to say that an alchemist's process for making gold was necessarily a failure, a sham, or a fraud. When a historian of chemistry does make that claim, he is guilty of anachronism at best, of bad science and bad history at worst.<br><br><br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c1255367938082398714 title="comment permalink">8/8/13, 12:16 PM</a><br><br>

When it is slowly evaporated, this liquid yields beautiful golden crystals (one of the chlorides of gold). These crystals are water-soluble, and the solution of these crystals in water is also a beautiful golden color.<br><br>Now get some tin ore from Cornwall, powder it, dissolve it and filter out the residue that does not dissolve. The resulting liquid will usually contain some stannous chloride, a solution of which (apart from impurities) is clear.<br><br>Mix the golden liquid and the clear liquid. The result is a new liquid, suddenly and spectacularly colored royal purple: truly a suitable color to wring from gold, the noblest of metals.<br><br>Let this royal purple liquid stand overnight. The liquid will have become clear, and there will be a brown sludge in the bottom of your flask. (If I remember correctly, it suggests the color of faeces.) Filter out the brown sludge and let it dry. Put it in a small crucible and heat it.

They cannot for this reason envisage making a living casting horoscopes. <br><br>The problem is the same as for, e.g., incantational healing. If you do not sincerely believe that by uttering incantations over cancer patients you will send their cancers into remission, you cannot in honesty make your living by setting up a cancer-incantation-therapy service. <br><br>If some observatory person somewhere were someday to believe astrology true, then it would be fine for him or her to sell astrological services. <br><br>What would be an ethically licit way for observatory people to make a living? Monasteries used to live in a degree of (in some instances, mildly scandalous) opulence from agriculture. If I were running things, I would urge the establishment of observatory farms, somewhat in the monastic spirit. <br><br>The prospect of forsaking, for fifteen hours every working week, some such thing as daytime spectrogram reductions with IRAF under Linux for some such thing as running the beeswax melter, or cutting the organic cabbages, is not fully appealing. An early lesson of country living is that agrarian work is muddy, fatiguing, and urgent. <br><br>On the other hand, agrarian work is a little more appealing than the prospect of filling out forms for an NSERC or NSF grant, or of wading into Orwellian university politics. <br><br>Due attention to agrarian work would be a way of achieving a further thing desirable in a modern (21st-century) observatory, namely, a distancing of oneself from a dying empire's mind-games.<br><br>In making these agrarian points, I do note that the 77 hectares at the David Dunlap Observatory are not, for the most part, appropriate farming land.

This same 2008 material is reachable by putting into the YouTube search engine the phrase <br><br>Moving Day at David Dunlap Observatory <br><br><br>To allay confusion, I should remark that I although I am billed in the video as a "DDO Defender", I do not personally subscribe to the tenets of the organization now calling itself the "DDO Defenders", or DDOD (DDOD seeks 14 streets on our land), nor to the tenets of the RASC persons now conducting weekend infotainment from the dome (they make no objection to the would-be developer's envisaged 14 streets). <br><br>These points, or most of them, I made some weeks or months ago in a previous posting to this blog. But today I may as well add a long quote from what I have written elsewhere, outside JMG's blog, about the video, in reference to a person rather prominent in the action, U of Toronto police head Sam d'Angelo:<br><br>((QUOTE))<br>What, then, did not get filmed?<br><br>As I was on guard, Mr d'Angelo came up and asked, ever so casually, with an eye to my knapsack, "Tom, can you lend me a pair of scissors?" Fool that I was, I did not get his intent. Fortunately, however, I did not on that day have a pair of scissors in my knapsack, and so I truthfully said that I regretted not being able to help. I added that there should be a pair of scissors in the librarian's desk.<br><br>Mr d'Angelo then asked, "Well, do you have a knife?" I still thought, as a fool, that this constable was in need of help, being for some legitimate policing reason required to cut something like twine or cardboard. But as good luck would have it, I also had no knife in my knapsack (I must have packed a meal that required no real cutlery), and I told him this without giving the matter any deep thought.<br><br>The real intent of Mr d'Angelo's pair of questions became clear just after the convoy rounded the bend, as shown around 03:18 in the clip. I stopped filming and raced through the stand of Norway spruce, along the path where that past winter [aboriginal environmental activist] Grey Eagle had inducted his audience as "Rainbow Warriors", to intercept the convoy at the gatehouse. I was just in time to catch the very end of the convoy, picking up speed on its eastward trajectory along Hillsview Drive. At the very rear I believe I saw something I had not seen earlier in the day, a vehicle which I believe had been waiting on Hillsview Drive, parked, and had joined the convoy tail only at the end of the operation. This vehicle was white and box-like, too bulky to be a conventional van, and yet not bulky enough to be a truck such as movers would use. On its roof were some lights. I am 70 per cent certain that what I saw was an ambulance.<br><br>If the vehicle was an ambulance, the otherwise odd questions regarding scissors and knife would make sense. Mr d'Angelo, I suggest, had hoped that I would in all innocence produce from my knapsack some kind of cutting implement, such as a madman might use to slash a canvas, and that he could then apply the bracelets and call on the ambulance for support. Had I lost my composure at that point, Form One could be invoked under the Ontario Mental Health Act, yielding for him my compulsory detention in a secure psychiatric facility for 72 hours. <br>((/QUOTE))<br><br>The Age of Marauders: already playing here in Ontario, and coming soon to a theatre near you.<br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo <br>near Toronto, Canada <br><br><a href=http://www.metascientia.com rel=nofollow>www punkt metascientia punkt com</a> <br><br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c8218938321110556385 title="comment permalink">8/8/13, 1:34 PM</a><br><br>

I am a somebody currently in a science graduate program who day by day is increasingly disillusioned by the idea of going to academia.<br><br>I am a bit confused by some points you make, especially by your example of astrology. I do not want to steer the conversation over to the validity of astrology, but astrology and the idea that the alignment of the stars at our birth is a crucial determination of our lives' path – isn't this also rooted in another myth people have, of mysticism, something out of their power determining their faith? The myth of progress may dismiss astrology as being irrational, but the myth of religion and unmeasurables like god or personality can dismiss science as being too cold and unemotional. You most certainly aren't criticizing rationality, which is the basis not only of science but of a whole lot else in our lives, but astrology has also fallen by the wayside because it is way too difficult to figure out if your horoscope matters or not. <br><br>The most dismissive of my scientific friends will call astrology nowadays BS, while the more diplomatic complain astrology is too vague. Astrology and a whole lot of the science done in the early to mid centuries of the last millenium were under the heavy influence of the church, a lot like a lot of the science nowadays is slave to industrial funding. I think your point that people ignore climate scientists nowadays is due to two factors, neither of which is that research can be bought with a grant: first, climate change “deniers” have a lot of emotional buttons to push – it is arrogant to think that humans can change the world, it will kill the economy and YOUR way of life, etc. Second, it may also be due to the idea of an “ivory tower” - accusing professors/researchers of following their Kantian rational arguments without understanding how the real world works at all. As a result, these scientists have a certain cult/way of thinking.<br><br>The idea of progress is a super sexy one, that we are working to some end. I guess what I've found annoying is that our smartest people, the ones who demonstrate the best critical thinking in science classes are assumed to be on the track to grad school. As if this is the best place to send our critical thinkers. And you get there, and in order to secure funding and explain what you're doing, have to find some piece of the scientific puzzle no one has picked yet, and pretend you love it as a career. That's probably too unfair a view, but science has been scattered to the wind. It is really difficult for me to not yawn when hearing what exactly some comparative world literature or chemistry professors actually does with their free time. It is such a small piece of the puzzle that is yet argued at the beginning of every talk, the end of every grant, as necessary. I haven't become a professor or heavily a part of the scientific community quite yet, but if I could with a couple years of work and dedication, if I really wanted. I'll have to end up believing, to some degree, that what both I and the people around me are working on is necessarily essential. But it just ends up feeling like a smattering of small, amusing problems with code and the same complaints we grad students are on a rat wheel.<br><br>I think I'm rambling a bit here, so to sum up: astrology has fallen by the wayside, as has the idea of the ether, alchemy, religion because they don't fit in rationality – no evidence, or too difficult to support with evidence. Science found a niche in an evidence based world, but how we connect the dots – our scientific paradigms, theories, ways of thinking – those are less objective, and subject to corruption, whether by old ways of thinking, or money. Yet our culture has a certain reverence for useful science, at the same time scorning science that isn't so useful – computers and cancer/pharmaceuticals get TONS of money, but the humanities is becoming more and more ignored.<br><br>I could go on and on, but I will stop at this point.

I am likely not the only person taking chemistry who wondered, at least a little, about alchemy, what alchemists did that was similar to and different from what we did. That little taste of it that you offered is fascinating. Since my grad school specialty was spectroscopy I could tell you then what collodial gold is and why it has that color and not another. Maybe that adds to the experience - for me it did then, not so much now that I have forgotten most of the theory. But you reminded me of analytical chemistry and some of the ways we were taught to identify unknowns. It's a pity that chemistry doesn't take more notice of alchemy, along the lines that Bill explored in his comment and that you mentioned in yours.

I do have to say that I agree with Nestorian's view of the role of the scientific establishment in promoting Darwinism as an underpinning of their faith. But I pretty much give up on trying to get that across, much as it seems so completely obvious to me. Yes, many people have made their peace with it by interpreting the cosmos to include a conscious aspect, and these people are tolerated but with slightly less patience behind closed doors than they imagine.<br>Darwinism is the origins explanation for atheists, and if others are along for the ride, so be it, but for an atheist metaphysics, it is NECESSARY.<br><br>JMG, I don't know about how much certain antics may play a role in arguments over the plausibility of random processes to generate life and new life forms, but it is really not a likely motive for the authors of the books I read, mostly by professors and scientists in the field, who spend years carefully laying out their arguments.<br><br>As for your reply to Nestorian, I have now read two of your books, and I'd like to say that I have found little or nothing that is a problem. The way that ecosystems work, the interdependence of natural systems and species, and natural selection, R selected - K selected seres (which was VERY interesting by the way), none of these have much bearing on rejection of Darwinist type evolutionary models.<br><br>My rejection hinges on seeing with clarity the fundamental difference between chemistry and biochemistry, such that they behave differently as regards the second law, the staggering amount of linguistic-type, specified information needed to cause against-the-grade processes to create and maintain a cell. <br><br>I also agree with Nestorian calling it faith, simply because, once you really delve into the logistical problems with believing such a thing is possible, it really does require a tremendous belief in luck, and that utterly unknown processes simply MUST have occurred. A clue to its being a faith is the scolding that was once popular (not sure it still is) toward people's "incredulity" about evolution! Incredulous things should apparently be believed ... <br>I happen to value my own incredulity very much.<br>And, by the way, I do not think you have a religious interest in the topic.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c8696467948673161791 title="comment permalink">8/8/13, 3:05 PM</a><br><br>

Anarchists (at least the kind who are similar to the European kind) tend to hate libertarians because they consider them to be extreme capitalists - the kind that spout on about unleashing the free market so that brilliant types like themselves can achieve the riches they're entitled to without unnatural things like taxes, social security or dirty poor people in general getting in their way. To add insult to injury anarchists consider themselves libertarians but now have trouble using the word, on the internet at least, because these days it's shared with American-style libertarians. So they stole one of our favourite alternative names(who actually used the label first is neither here nor there to be honest) and now people mix us up with each other all the time. It's hard enough to get past the anarchists just want to throw bombs and stuff meme without having to deal with getting mixed up with libertarians too. <br><br>Libertarianism does seem to be attractive to both the rich and what I'd call the 'poor but on my way up the ladder' types but I think the hatred has more to it than that. Funny enough it's another one of those things that's more of an American issue, although the internet has been spreading American style libertarianism globally like a virus. <br><br>On an entirely unrelated note, if, say, you live in a country that will cease to be habitable if or when either the glaciers go or the thermohaline collapses, should you wait until you really have to move or should you go south to higher ground now? A strategy of waiting and watching feels very insecure and provisional. It's hard to invest energy, money or time in a place and a community when we, or maybe my daughter, may very possibly have to leave it all behind some day anyway.

When I started graduate school in cultural anthropology nearly half of our small cohort were fairly skilled Tarot readers.

There are plenty of examples of anthropologists finding the local shaman / oracle / healer to be an especially important informant. It wasn't just because they were often colorful and exotic. Any oracle worth their salt tended to have a very highly developed understanding of the social and psychological relationships around them - as well as being enough of an outsider to gain some perspective.

Success in finance is based on having superior knowledge, and there are two approaches to that position. Either "get smart", or try to help your competitors "get stupid".

Both North and South America lack recent large scale wars and the Europeans aren't actively killing each over. Africa is still rather violent and the middle east has some big wars going on. <br><br>I remember hearing that America has killed about 1,000,000 Arabs so far. Which is the same number of Gauls Julius Caesar claimed to have killed. Gaul had a far smaller population, so he killed proportionately more. <br><br>So in conclusion, the world is relatively speaking, peaceful. <br><br>As I understand the myth of progress, this great achievement would be ascribed to the simply passage of time "we have evolve passed war". The more realistic view is that it's a function of nuclear weapons. <br><br>Imagine if the Soviets and America fought the standard empire vs empire wars. Along with an American backed Japan invading a Soviet backed China. <br><br>They have been our greatest weapons of peace. Which should make things rather interesting as they disappear.<br><br>But the myth of progress in the "Green" and other spheres hides this and makes it look like we just got peaceful as time passed.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c1462511182845873048 title="comment permalink">8/8/13, 9:42 PM</a><br><br>

This is hogwash. They were the venerated high-status ancestors who lived in the palace with the emperor and sat at his right hand. There was nothing shady about these activities during their time. They were efforts to understand the natural and human worlds and their interplay, through observation and theory, and they were considered to be great and worthy intellectual pursuits by the intelligencia and nobility. Casting them as lowlifes is a rewriting of history at an Orwellian level.

While I understand that it is difficult to say exactly how these changes will play out, I would appreciate any thoughts that yourself or other posters could offer on the subject of the future of medicine in particular. What do you suspect that healthcare will look like in 10 years? 20 years? Will energy intensive medical specialists such as surgeons and radiologists even survive that long? When does the pharmaceutical complex break down? For any readers/posters in the medical field...what percentage of skills/knowledge being taught to doctors and nurses now will be of sustained use to future human communities?<br><br>Any comments would be appreciated.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c6636384688238871384 title="comment permalink">8/9/13, 1:05 AM</a><br><br>

Or, in fact, universities.<br><br>What we will need in the future from science will be such things as methods for machining high precision ball bearings without using CNC machine tools; or hand equipment for drilling water wells 200 meter deep; or developing drought-resistant varieties of perennial cereals. Exactly the fields where "Science" (Academia) is not working upon...<br><br>Nowadays there is very few cutting edge research of any real practical value for the survival of mankind in the next centuries.

I have a strong feeling you're right. This is a consequence of changes in the real world. But in turn there will be consequences of this turn back to generalists. In our modern societies we have this notion of specialization such that we individually get very competent at doing a limited array of tasks. You could argue that specialization narrowed our individual repertoire of skills. But this method of organizing our activities raised our general standard of living and our average life expectancy. Which was a good thing at least while it lasted. <br><br>You could also argue that the average ice age hunter, with his abilities at tool making, hunting and foraging, knowledge of wildlife, terrain, in other words a generalist, carried in his head more skills than today's urban condo dweller, you know, the type with computing/communications devices attached to every bodily orifice and appendage. Maybe you could say the same about the average neolithic farmer in comparison to today's urbanite. Not that I'm criticizing the urbanite. <br><br>My parents came from a country whose farming techniques hadn't changed much since the iron age. A large proportion of the population was engaged in growing food. So, while each member of a farming family could perform a large number of tasks (ie they were generalists) and grow food, the population as a whole was materially impoverished. Part of the impoverishment was because of exploitation by a landowning class whose interests were enforced by a violent authoritarian regime. But IMO a large measure of it was due to the lack of specialization. They all worked very hard. To stay alive you had to be on top of things, you had to be meticulous in your performance of daily tasks. And, yes, each family could make their own bricks out of mud and straw. It's much more efficient, however, if a brickworks made bricks all all day, every day with a team of workers who did nothing but make bricks. <br><br>If we're going down that road, ie generalists as opposed to specialists, back to the future, back to the days when we had a large proportion of farmers and back to more or less self sufficient families growing crops and raising animals and using beasts instead of tractors, we will no longer be generating sufficient surplus to indulge the whims of physicists and cosmologists. Because it all depends on agricultural surpluses. Everyone not farming depends on someone that is. <br><br>We take for granted the affordable food that appears on grocery store shelves. Say goodbye to all that. We'll all be getting a lot skinnier. Obesity? We wish. I agree with JMG, no more billions to whirl protons close to the speed of light to see what happens when they slam into one another. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But the priority will not be understanding subatomic subtleties but rather growing enough food and surviving the next crop failure or the next pandemic. <br><br>Too bad for science you say? Yes, I would agree and too bad for all of us.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c5347730777570773970 title="comment permalink">8/9/13, 9:36 AM</a><br><br>

Somewhere in the vicinity of 100 million Americans identify as "Evangelical" Christians, and a quite considerable subset of them are also ardent Creationists and anti-evolutionists. We are talking about literally millions and millions of people on whose behalf well-known creationist writers such as the late Henry Morris and Duane Gish spoke and wrote. Books by them and others of like mind have sold millions and millions of copies over the past 50 years in Christian circles.<br><br>What’s more, the vast American masses who make up this particular cultural milieu have also acquired strong political representation over the past four decades in all branches and levels of government. As just two examples, it wouldn’t surprise me if both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush were/are anti-evolutionists and biblical literalists on creation (though I could, of course, be wrong about these particular cases). <br><br>In sum, the anti-evolutionist fraction of the American population is both considerable on its own terms; and it wields influence in the chambers of political, judicial, and even military power that is probably even proportionately greater on that plane relative to its importance as a mass social force. <br><br>These are powerful sociological and political forces in American life, and they will probably grow even more, not less, powerful in the coming decade or two. As such, the scientific establishment will have to find ways of appeasing them if it hopes to continue to flourish over the course of the 21st century.<br><br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c4580502762682606153 title="comment permalink">8/9/13, 9:59 AM</a><br><br>

Specifically, last week's post left me wondering about the apparent conflict between good science, which requires intellectual integrity, and the stunning lack of intellectual integrity that most of the sciences display twisting their subject into knots so that it can fit within the narrative of progress. I didn't post because the matter needed time to ferment.<br><br> Upon reflection it occurred to me that this is always the case. Astronomers in previous eras have always viewed their research in the context of their cultural norms. The Heavens or the Gods or the Future. The problem is legitimacy. Right now legitimate scientists in pristine white lab coats do legitimate research at observatories that society views as totally legitimate. And somewhere out there, at this very moment, pseudoscientists in unholy black lab coats do pseudoscience on ESP quackery. The difference between the two groups has nothing to do with the scientific method. The former could have poor methodology and the later excellent. The elementary mistake that I see people, especially established scientists, make all the time is that science is about discovering how the world works and not stipulating how it should work. It is positive not normative.<br><br> Only disciplines that can't fit the narrative are immune. Astrology doesn't fit into our present worldview. It can't coincide happily with the other things that we believe and so it has been left alone. I know that our culture looks down on Astrology as being baseless and totally unscientific. OR, more to the point, it is based on things that our religion of progress is not based on. From within the tower of progress Astrology can be seen to have foundations but those foundations are deemed to be without merit. Still we pay for it. Horoscopes are a regular feature of most news papers.<br><br> And so I was a little bit surprised with this week's post. It appears that merely thinking about Astrology has yielded a profound divination. I suppose I could bill it to synchronicity, but as you know, that is acausal and therefore does not exist.<br><br> Speaking of school boy errors JMG. You made a dousie this week. You are quite right that Astronomers are not going take up Astrology even if it will keep the lights on so to speak, but nothing at all prevents Astrologers from doing Astronomy. It just might be the very best way to preserve Astronomy. One fine day in the not to distant future an observatory might go up for sale. The Astronomers really don't want to sell it it all but they can either sell it to some Astrologers who will use it to look at the stars and take notes or to a Chinese trillionaire will rip it up to make fancy bachelor pad.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c4989274176118488773 title="comment permalink">8/9/13, 12:20 PM</a><br><br>

Progress assumes, without evidence, that it will work and you assume that it will fail, with copious support, but it is still an assumption.<br><br> The reference is to a fusion researcher Q&amp;A page:<br><br>http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/12/04/11/0435231/mit-fusion-researchers-answer-your-questions<br><br> The jist of it is that fusion is not ~40 years away but ~80 billion dollars away. The hold up isn't time it's money.<br><br>http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/U.S._historical_fusion_budget_vs._1976_ERDA_plan.png/800px-U.S._historical_fusion_budget_vs._1976_ERDA_plan.png<br><br> Conclusion: at present levels of funding fusion will will never happen. For what it's worth I know that projections like this are idealogical. To prove it requires a successful run and to disprove it requires exhausting all possible possibilities. And it's possible that there is a possibility that we haven't thought of.<br><br> The anecdote is fun. I was eavesdropping on a conversation about lithium fusion. I was working so I couldn't give the speaker my full attention but I know enough about the theory to follow along. He was explaining the details to another, younger scientist. He was talking about cross sections and KeVs, and I wanted to know what the speaker thought about the future of fusion. I asked him which technique was going to win Tokamak plasma or laser pellet ignition and he surprised the heck out of me. He said "I've given up on fusion. The Sun is a fine source of power." I asked him who would win because I wanted to get a feel for what he thought about current research without offending him.

Grantwriting (or the lobbying of congress which supports the funding agencies), which is what professors spend most of their time on, is somewhat disingenuous. It is saying that the research will do all these supposedly wonderful things (cure cancer, produce more gadgets that will save labor and supposedly create more happiness, etc), which it probably won't and they aren't so wonderful when examined more closely. It is also lying because it implies that scientists do science for these humanitarian or commercial purposes. Most of them just like science, as some farmers like to farm. A more honest and sustainable arrangement on a finite planet would be for scientists to spend a large chunk of their time farming, blacksmithing, glass making, making medicine, etc and being self-funded or having their community fund them if they also want to learn and maybe do science, not because of any potential spin-off benefit. And just like everyone has some artistic creativity in them, most people have some scientific curiosity in them, so I don't think the scientists would need to justify doing and/or teaching a bit of science. But supporting a huge particle accelerator, fusion reactor, or expensive observatory is not sustainable, whether one has to lie or not in order to support it. <br><br>If I were an astronomer, I wouldn't want to offer astrology services not because I think astrology is bunk (I don't) but because I wouldn't be offering a real service except to a few people's egos. If they really wanted to get a good chart, they could do it by other much cheaper means and wouldn't need an observatory.<br><br>As a physicist, I could have also gotten a job working for the military, but I didn't want to contribute to empire building, or being supported by the empire. Instead I worked for the empire and was supported by it in less obvious ways by being a semiconductor engineer. At least I could be honest and do some physics in the evenings, on my own time. Being a pacifist who also appreciates a few things about military organizations (like offering an arguably constructive way for young men to express their aggressive energy), I look forward to the discussion of pacifism and violence.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c7441966540647145019 title="comment permalink">8/9/13, 4:47 PM</a><br><br>

Even if they're techno-triumphalist and think we'll keep pushing onwards and outwards, they have to admit that the pushing gets harder as we go.

The religious reaction to science can be very dangerous. One needs only look at what a resurgent and militant Islam did to learning in the Muslim world this past five or six hundred years.

Since (from my outside perspective) evangelical fundamentalism seems to be a white middle class phenomenon, and the white middle class is very much on the outs, I have my doubts. Even if it does, though, the rest of the world may stand a better chance of holding onto the knowledge--the same way Dar-al-Islam held onto classical science in the East as it faded in the West, and how the West took up the torch of learning as the Muslims put it down. <br>Many seem to be betting on a Second Spirituality in the Orthodox world.

I realized quite some time ago that Progress is essentially a myth, and I personally subscribe to a cyclical view of history. My views have been especially influenced by Oswald Spengler, as well as Arnold Toynbee, Lewis Mumford, Edward Gibbon, Edmund Burke, JRR Tolkien, Winston Churchill, Glubb Pasha, and ibn Khaldun. <br><br>Even though there have been periods of rapid technological development, social change and so on during certain periods in human history, they never last and usually go into reverse at some point. Moreover, the question of whether a particular set of social/ideological changes (same sex marriage, multiculturalism, the mass consumer society, etc) is a sign of progress is very much in the eye of the beholder. A great many people still believe that the examples just listed are signs not of progress but degeneration. Which of those points of view are true? Or is it all a matter of opinions and cultural preferences, which are subject to change depending on the circumstances? What is progress, and who defines what it is? <br><br>As for the question of progress in science and technology, I think it more likely that what we are seeing right now is the terminal stage of a relatively brief period of scientific discovery and technological development, much but not all of which was made possible by the cheap energy/fossil fuel economy. You yourself have alluded to this in several of your blog posts. To borrow a phrase from one of your earliest blog posts, welcome to Hesperotechnic Age.<br><br>There was a study a few years back which concluded that the rate of scientific discovery and technological innovation actually peaked in the 1870’s and has been steadily declining since. It pointed out that the last really big wave of scientific discovery and technological innovation ran from the mid 1950’s through the early 1970’s. The only really significant breakthrough since then was the discovery of recombinant DNA in the early 1980’s, and anyone who has been paying attention can see how the promised “biotech revolution” has failed to live up to the hype. All of the recent technological “innovations” which we see so overhyped in the mass media, such as smart phones, the internet, social media and so on, are simply recombinations and logical extensions of existing technologies that have been around for decades and some of which go back to the 19th century.<br><br>Law of diminishing returns, anyone?<br><br>This study concluded that if the present rate of decline continues, technological “progress” will come to a halt in the mid 21st century, making a mockery out of the pseudo-religion being peddled by Ray Kurzweil and his followers. In fact, this study made the case that if there is any such a thing as a technological singularity, it had already occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Of course, the Singularity as promoted by Kurzweil and company is really nothing more than the Rapture theology of Protestant fundamentalism in secularist drag, and the British science fiction writer Ken MacLeod once derided it as “The Rapture of the Nerds”. The American military historian Archer Jones, in his book “The Art of War in the Western World”, likewise pointed out that the rate of technological and social change in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was far greater than what we see now. As an example, he noted that the rate of change between 1885 and 1935 was much greater than the rate of change from 1935 to 1985.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c6578212603273759778 title="comment permalink">8/9/13, 6:08 PM</a><br><br>

All of the definitions of religion in Webster's Fifth Edition (1944) require the worship of a god. I fail to see that in any definition of progress - which is indicated by a movement ahead, or toward a goal. I really think it is a stretch to call a recognition of progress a religion; even a civil religion. Then you talk of the myth of progress as if it doesn't exist. You must have some hidden meaning or subtle approach that I, in my own stupid way, have been unable to fathom. Two examples of progress: 1) you have a blog-site on the internet and are able to potentially contact millions of readers, which was impossible in any previous civilization in history; 2) I have digital hearing aids that allow me to hear. I remember meeting my grandfather 67 years ago who used a funnel type horn to hear. Although it is quite probable that in the next two or three centuries neither of these items of progress will be available, it would be illogical to term these, and multiple others, as a collective myth. If you are describing progress as something that most humans think will continue, and I think you have, then I am with you. And, most future humans will be in for a big surprise when there is as reversal of fortunes. However, my wife and I are pleased with our progress: we live in a solar home that gets most of its energy from the sun.

And that, in my opinion, is not such a bad thing: even in the objectively-controlled world of technology, a key element is perspective and interpretation; and it seems to me, that is the key element in astrology and other interpretive arts. To be clear though, I don't think predicting the future is really what astrology ought to be thought of as offering; rather, a set of symbols, and long traditions, by which a person may gain some insight about oneself, the world (a la Jung, I guess).<br><br>But it would be interesting to read where you think science will push in the future, as the present energy-based system of objective material control of the world winds down.

I also have a sense of futility at work, but largely because neither the patients nor the medical institution have any real interest in health, and because I see the financial aspect of medicine as it is currently practiced as such a money pit. We will certainly have to be less wasteful, including the tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars we throw away on people who are in the dying process, or are in other ways nonviable. <br><br>Then, too, as you mention, the suits and pencil pushers have a very different idea of priorities, and have imposed almost endless paperwork and idiotic rules. I can spend two or three hours discharging a patient, when I am supposed to be taking care of the other five.<br><br>I long for the day when the pharmaceutical octopus loses a few suction cups.<br>The field of oncology in my opinion is the best example of what is wrong. Incredibly expensive, intuitively wrong approach to treatment, and false hope for the patients - and so much else suppressed that may be of real value.<br><br>I've had occasion to go to a couple of doctors in Ukraine, and was very impressed with their respect for and knowledge of nutrition, and their clinical skills as diagnosticians. This is becoming something of a lost art in America as we over depend upon testing, and of course drugs.<br><br>Much of the hand wringing over antibiotic resistant organisms may be merely the worry that the pharmaceutical strategy that, like Monsanto's, is approaching the inevitable end game of the unworkable methods they pursued. I'm not actually knocking antibiotics, but if we had used them wisely (like oil) it could have been so different. But, I am not at all sure that we have no other tools in the arsenal. Certainly the things I read are hopeful and interesting - IV vitamin C, IV hydrogen peroxide - which were once used in this country when doctors had the right to practice the art of medicine.<br><br>I really see a strong parallel between the big ag approach to growing food while considering the soil to be a medium for propping up the stems and ending up with things like colony collapse disorder as they take the poison approach to its GMO, roundup ready limits, and the pharmaceuticals till you drop while utterly ignoring what the patients eat, in fact serving them diet soda on every tray approach of modern medicine.<br><br>BUT - do not despair! You can always practice medicine and will be in a good position to stay abreast of the changes and be poised to do things differently and better. Perhaps less so if you are a radiologist, but even then.<br><br>The Ukrainian doctors I have experience with were perfectly able to perform surgery and prescribe antibiotics while at the same time also prescribing herbs! There are many healing modalities. Medicine as we go forward may not be as snazzy, but it might in fact be better. So much of what is wrong in our society comes from giving a free hand to greed at the expense of nearly every other worthwhile value. Along with many other kinds of waste, a lot of rules and regulations and paperwork might not be affordable, you might have more time with your patients. There might be somewhat fewer specialists, but more good practitioners of internal medicine that treat the whole patient and are embedded in their communities.

It was also a factor of lack of options and it wouldn't have taken much in the way of a few trinkets to historically breed dissent in such communities.<br><br>Perhaps we have taken specialisation too far in the other direction. The idea of office fauna in a cubicle farm is horrifying to me, although I have also lived that life. hehe!<br><br>Too often as specialists we outsource basic things / services and this is to our detriment because as a society we tend to think in terms of efficiency as a positive thing. Food is one thing that comes to mind in relation to this.<br><br>I've always noticed that when people bring food around here it is always much harder for me to wash up the dishes (done manually, don’t even mention a dishwasher around here). We cook with olive oil which has a low melting point, but animal fats / trans fats have a much higher melting point so it is much harder to clean that stuff. Ever wonder why it clogs people's arteries?<br><br>I find it to be vastly amusing that people think it is funny to bring meat products over to a mostly vegetarians household! I eat the food with aplomb and quietly respect the animal that had died for my dinner! hehe!<br><br>Anyway, as for the landed gentry living like a rentier class. It happens even today. Why is that people in relatively affluent times work such fixed long hours? Well, you're giving up your one and only life to indulge a wealth pump that is so obvious, that it is difficult to see - all for a few trinkets more.<br><br>As to brutal overlords, a good defence is reading, writing and arithmetic. Serious. They would owe a measure of obligation to the community, otherwise their source of income evaporates. It has to reach an equilibrium sooner or later.<br><br>Most peasant farmers would work less hours than people in industrial countries anyway. I think that it is a myth that such existences were brutal. I think the difficulties were that they were subject to the whims of nature, which can be very hard and also that they were largely monotonous. That is why it is important to exercise your spiritual dimensions?<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c7950665540538676258 title="comment permalink">8/10/13, 4:51 PM</a><br><br>

Generic drugs can be a nightmare but also are a great boon in societies that can afford some regulation and can have quality control for low cost manufacture. <br><br>I hope that medics worldwide can continue to obtain a better understanding of Public Health (and its failures) and of vaccination and its R&amp;D base, and vitally the role of diet in epidemiology, and can help define the frame for protective health care. There are continuing possibilities for very large cost benefits ratios. Is safe-birthing and infant rearing inevitably so expensive? This could be an important question. Better maternal and infant survival seems to play a key role in bringing and keeping fertility rates down to 2.0 or below and represents a huge gain in ‘economic return’ as well as welfare in communities living in marginal austerity. <br><br>@Wiseman has pointed out that co-existence of what we think of as ‘advanced’ technologies (and R&amp;D) with very low levels of purchasing power is not only possible but is very likely to continue worldwide for many decades or even centuries. <br><br>Medical priorities and the skills to sort them out will be a major issue, IMHO. Future introduction of ‘lifeboat technologies’ and using them as substitutes in the USA where currently there is helpless reliance on over-costly systems, itself would need to be ‘knowledge-based’. Medical ‘knowledge’ is not uniformly reliable and is easily skewed when it is embedded in a commercial system. There are reasons why US health care can be more than twice as expensive per capita just now as systems achieving better results elsewhere. Unfortunately it seems to me that an otherwise useful intuitive response to this situation tends to favour ‘alternative’ health nostrums and dietary fads also bedevilled by commercial priority, and tends to attract ‘brand loyalty’ of more than religious intensity, with scant regard for ‘knowledge’.<br><br>I find these links (below) give an increasingly explanatory view of the balance of chronic and transmissible disease in different societies worldwide, and of the etiology of much chronic disease trending during periods of transition.

I suspect there was more than one process -- current alchemical lore talks about at least two, one starting with lead, the other starting with antimony. <br><br>Toomas, yes, but my point was precisely that the contempt for astrology common among astronomers is itself a very interesting thing, worth attention in its own right. <br><br>Max, it's only from within the walls of the ivory tower that astrology or religion have "fallen by the wayside" -- both are thriving today, and in fact a case can be made that they're in better shape than institutional science is! Still, I think you've missed the point of this post, which was to use the scientific hatred of astrology to cast a light on the ways that contemporary science is beholden to the myth of progress, and may not survive its end. <br><br>Onething, duly noted. I do have a religious interest in evolution, for reasons discussed in an earlier post -- if evolution didn't happen, one of the core teachings of Druidry would have to be interpreted in purely symbolic terms, which is not the end of the world but gives the teaching in question a good deal less immediate impact. In scientific terms, though, it's hardly relevant that the very sketchy outline of some ecological concepts that I present in some of my books doesn't obviously demand evolution! In context, the evolutionary process is implicit in the whole structure of ecological science. BTW, are you aware that Darwin never offered a hypothesis about the origin of life, and the final pages of <i>The Origin of Species</i> -- in which he briefly addresses the issue -- does not insist on a natural rather than a supernatural origin of life? Once again, you really need to sit down and read Darwin yourself, rather than backdating the current debates. <br><br>Mallow, I was speaking of the way anarchism and libertarianism sort out in America -- yes, I know the rest of the world has more sense than to get caught in the idiotic circular reasoning that's so popular here. As for the potential impact of climate change, in your place I'd give serious thought to relocating sooner rather than later. <br><br>Ian, that seems perfectly reasonable to me!<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c8032677509563240943 title="comment permalink">8/11/13, 2:26 PM</a><br><br>

If I were in institutional science myself, I'd find that frightening. As it is, I'd like to encourage you to find ways to pass on your knowledge of the scientific method to people outside institutional science -- they're the ones who need it most right now, and they're also the ones who are going to guarantee its survival if anyone is. <br><br>Sufiya, scientists go out of their way to insist that astrology equals what appears in the daily paper, because that makes it easier for them to pursue their failed crusade. You might already know, and if not you might be interested to know, that <i>Objections to Astrology</i>, the main rationalist screed against the subject, is required reading in some American schools of astrology; one read through the book is all it takes to convince the students that the critics of astrology literally don't know the first thing about the subject. <br><br>Andy, that's fascinating. In my experience, the vast majority of what goes on in a divination or "psychic reading" consists of engaging a client in a conversation, using symbolic images as a starting place, that will help the client to find the answers to his or her own problems with a little canny help. <br><br>LatheChuck, you know, your explanation of why economics is not a science may be the best one yet. What it suggests to me is that the people who publish economic theories are those who aren't smart enough to come up with theories that will allow them to get rich themselves!<br><br>Paul, that's quite reasonable. Thanks for the link! <br><br>Juhana, exactly. Without the myth, there's no incentive to keep pouring money into the current grab-bag of scientific specialties. <br><br>Leo, good. It's also worth noting that long periods of peace have happened before -- notably the great European peace of 1815-1914. Quite a bit of the same "war is obsolete" talk you hear nowadays was being mouthed before 1914, too. You'll doubtless recall what followed in due time. <br><br>Bill, I think a lot of what's going on here has to do with the transitional period, when science was being supported by the rich and middle classes while the poor by and large still turned to astrologers and the like. The class prejudices absorbed during that time remain fixed in place. Is there more to it? Quite possibly, and I'll see what I can dig up as time permits. <br><br>6c03etc., that's a subject for an entire post to itself, which I'll try to find room for in the near future. The short form is that I expect the money tap to dry up in a big way, and a very large number of health care businesses to go messily bankrupt. Those physicians who are trained in the most generally useful specialties, and are willing to work for the sort of modest fees that people will be able to afford out of pocket, will have jobs afterwards; those who don't and aren't had better hone up on their burger-flipping skills. More down the road a bit!<br><br>MawKernewek, for what it's worth, antimony and lead seem to have been the most common metals used back in the day.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c5837577785791192866 title="comment permalink">8/11/13, 2:49 PM</a><br><br>

Let's try this again. <i><b>I am not saying that fusion power is impossible. I'm saying that we've already determined, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that if it is possible, it will be unaffordable.</b></i>. That's been my point all along: the last forty years of experiments have proven that none of the cheap methods work, and economies of scale aren't anything like significant enough to make up for the gargantuan cost of a fusion reactor. I have no objection if you disagree with me, but for heaven's sake could you please take the time to notice what I'm actually saying? <br><br>Unknown, good. I've suggested in earlier posts that there are three kinds of science -- the scientific method; the body of facts and theories more or less substantiated by the method; and the institutions that have grown up to apply the method and generate the body of facts and theories. If you want to describe the last of those as a priesthood and the second as doctrine, a case could be made! <br><br>Iuval, government-funded science is a very recent innovation, all things considered, and probably not a sustainable one. I'll be talking about how scientists used to be supported down the road a bit -- yes, and the vexed issues surrounding war and peace. <br><br>Cherokee, good. Scare tactics don't have anything like the clout they once did, as the climate change movement found out the hard way. <br><br>Enrique, excellent -- and I'm impressed that anybody anywhere remembers the title of that very early post! "Rapture of the Nerds" sounds like a great title for a movie, by the way -- more generally, the Singularity is begging for a good satiric movie. <br><br>S P, that's an excellent point -- the metastasis of specialization will likely be a major factor in the implosion of a great many useful things. One note to health care practitioners -- learn how to be a generalist, with cheap and readily available treatments, and you may just have a job after the rubble stops bouncing. <br><br>Russ, please go back to my earlier post <a href=../../2013/04/the-fate-of-civil-religion.html rel=nofollow>The Fate of Civil Religion</a>, and you'll find a detailed discussion of the concept of civil religion, which is widely used in sociology. If you have a quarrel with that, fine -- go down to the sociology department of your local university and pick a fight with them. Trying to be a dictionary troll will get you no mileage here. <br><br>Chris, oh, granted, but my point was that contemporary astronomers would sooner dine daily on live tarantulas than consider learning how to cast a horoscope, even if by doing so they could fund their observatories in perpetuity.

Political identities just are very different here in the Old World. Blind faith in markets, as expressed by libertarianism, is practically non-existent here. Capitalism is just one tool among others in the toolkit, not somekind God given perfect model for commercial transactions. Strong nationalism is diffrent matter, as befits persons whose direct ancestors have lived here from 8000 BC onwards...this is OUR country, no matter what brand of government is forced upon us. Many respected historians here believe that embryonic forms of poems in Kalevala were conducted during neolithic Stone Age.

I actually was active trade union member back in the day myself, and bonds of loyalty to that direction are still strong. Problems of governing system for West, build after Worl War Two, are exactly what you described. Ruling elite is creating "internal proletariat" at very fast pace now, and only hope is going to be somekind demagogue, protector of plebeians, to wrestle power away from old aristocracy.

More awe-inspiring and mind-blowing than any myth or religious story - but different in that, as far as we know, it's true. Brought to you by science - along with the internet, anaesthetic, photovoltaics and polio vaccine. Destructive technology is due to the system we live under, and the control of science by money instead of philosophy - which I am totally against. I don't think that economic growth, GM crops or fracking represent progress. But those things are down to our political and economic systems. Blaming science is just shooting the messenger.<br><br>However, science gets too big for its boots, and it's the job of philosophy to keep it in line. Unfortunately, science is being steered by money at the moment, and that's where the problem lies I think. We need scientists to find out stuff, otherwise we're just scrabbling around thinking that the sun goes round the earth, like idiots. Philosophers don't solve stuff, they just talk about how stuff isn't actually solved when scientists think it is. Scientists tell us that when they reconcile relativity with quantum physics, we'll have a theory of everything. Yeah, right. Scientists should do what they do best - science - and leave philosophy to philosophers.<br><br>It's the job of philosophy to look into the validity or otherwise of claims like 'the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides', or 'astrology works', or 'Santa Claus exists', or 'the earth goes round the sun'. That's how we measure the value of different beliefs - with philosophy I think. By thinking and discussing. What other way is there?<br><br>You're spot on about economics, except that it's not 'arguably' a crackpot pseudoscience, it definitely is. Progress isn't about economic growth or technological advance, that's for sure. But I firmly believe that wisdom is better than the lack of it. So if you gain a bit of wisdom by reading a book, having a discussion, meditating, walking in the woods - whatever - that's progress, I think. And if you don't agree, that's totally fine - philosophical discussions don't have to culminate in conclusions or agreement. However, I think that understanding some things are crucial to our well-being:<br><br> Lobbying - the richest people in the world paying for access to and influence with our elected representatives. It's not a secret - it's done openly.<br><br> Political donations - the richest people in the world buying our elected representatives.<br><br> The revolving door (retiring politicians walking into cushy, well-paid jobs with banks and corporations) - the richest people in the world giving lots of money to our elected representatives at the end of their political careers.<br><br> The richest people in the world owning the delivery service for most people's news, and paying for think tanks and academic research to support their viewpoint.<br><br> The richest people in the world controlling the world's food and energy supply.<br><br> And yet we are massively in debt, through our mortgages and credit cards, to the world's richest people. So for the privilege of living in this world, of being their slaves, we have to pay them most of our money.<br><br>Now, changing any of those things would be progress, I think. <br><br>Dave<br>www.lowimpact.org<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c181204701495578077 title="comment permalink">8/12/13, 5:54 AM</a><br><br>

You can break down your skills into many areas, and there are lots of other places you can apply them. Computer skills, technical skills, writing skills, teaching skills, statistical and analytical skills, research skills, all can be applied in many other ways. Think about what parts you do enjoy -- maybe field work, maybe library research, maybe travel, maybe giving presentations, maybe none of it. <br><br>As for me I decided to learn a basic trade -- much cheaper than getting a graduate degree and takes much less time. I splurged on going to a top-notch trucking school, stepped out of it into a good company, earned back my tuition in my first month out, and made as much money in my first year trucking as in my last year post-doc-ing. Other trades I have picked up since and use regularly but do not at the present get paid for are carpentry (finish and framing) and household electrical systems. If a trade is not your style, consider what does appeal to you. In particular you might think about things that are needed anywhere, not just in college towns or big cities. That way you have flexibility in where you live. Beware of current occupational fads; those tend to become oversupplied.

But FWIW, if you don't already know how to save rather than spend money, start learning now. Not spending money turned out to be the key thing in my not having to practice science for money after I quit. I might also suggest finding a pastime or hobby for which the scientific method makes a positive difference that you can do in a low-energy world. In my case that's gardening. JMG's book likely has a lot of other possibilities. If you can't do science for pay, and assuming it's in your blood as it seems to be for most of us, you can at least do it as an avocation. If it offers positive benefits, other people might want to learn the scientific method too. Maybe that would help it get through the decline.<br><br>I was the one who brought up the provocative point about quantum theory not being *needed* for *most* of what surrounds us in daily life, and I stand by that opinion. I didn't say that it hasn't been helpful. Photographic film, for instance, got a lot better once the details of how light interacts with silver halides and dyes were better understood, and it takes quantum theory to do that. But lots of good photographs, iconic ones in fact, were made in the 1800s before quantum theory was developed. My larger point in bringing up quantum theory is that the applications for which it is *necessary* also depend on a large energy surplus, the sort we got through oil. With that energy surplus going away, scientists really need to think hard about how the profession and those of us who practice it must change. Don't get too caught up in saying these changes can't happen, that *someone* will step in. They can, and he/she won't. The level of arrogance that allows scientists to keep on thinking that what we do is so important as to be immune to the ravages of peak energy is, if I understand correctly, one of the reasons that JMG is concerned that the scientific method, and scientists as we understand them, may not survive. That's why we who use the scientific method should be at least considering how to help it keep going in a lower energy, poorer in both money and materials, world.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c319181410092048032 title="comment permalink">8/12/13, 12:19 PM</a><br><br>

Even if you go into something (like I did) that only requires a high school degree, you will likely find that your better-practiced math and other analytical skills will help you. So long as you don't come across as arrogant and thinking you are better than your coworkers. And you will find no ceiling at all to advancement, if you can do the job and want to climb in the hierarchy. <br><br>So I'd advise against remaining in an environment where you will be treated as a failure and a flunky, and go somewhere that will take you at face value and pay you for what you can do regardless of your titles.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c7553312674842576990 title="comment permalink">8/12/13, 2:53 PM</a><br><br>

I could have continued in that field and likely would have eventually attained a faculty position. Something at the time made me think I did not want to do that, maybe it was the politics I observed I am not sure. Instead I started working in more applied engineering fields first a postdoc at IBM then various pseudo faculty positions at universities and finally industry positions. Something in me wanted to do more applied work and make things. Although I sometimes question my decisions or wonder what if (I stayed in academia) mostly I am very happy and likely have done more technical work (including continued learning) than if I had become a faculty member (which often sounds more like a manager of a small company that continually looks for funding). I have also steered clear of working for the defense industry or other less ethical choices, and have avoided managerial roles (and they me) which paradoxically seems to have given me more freedom (if less power), and allows me to keep that side of our culture at arm’s length. Anyway I guess my message is that a PhD does not necessarily mean a faculty position or something completely different. The choice to avoid a faculty position is, however, usually a one way valve so one should consider it carefully.<br><br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c3885923361171965479 title="comment permalink">8/13/13, 1:21 PM</a><br><br>

One of those is how transition towns and other such movements will defend themselves once centralized authority starts to collapse and we see the resurgence of brigandage, warbands and the like. I think that too many people in the transition and related movements somehow assume that peace will break out and we’ll all join hands and sing Kumbaya and we shall all live happily ever after in what amount to sustainable hippy communes once the present system implodes. This is highly unrealistic, as even a cursory look at history shows. Even the pacifist hippy communes and Amish villages can only exist because there is a central authority that has few inhibitions about using force to keep the peace and restrain criminal predators. Without either a central state to enforce social peace or a willingness to defend themselves by force if necessary, they are just setting themselves up to be easy victims once things start to break down.<br><br>There are a few authors in the Peak Oil and sustainability movements that have taken a serious look at this issue, such as Jeff Vail and John Robb. One problem that a lot of people living in rural and suburban areas are going to face is that isolated settlements and people are easy targets for bandits, marauders and criminal gangs. This is one of the reasons why historically most people lived in villages and towns. Even in rural areas, most peoples lived close to one another in villages that were surrounded by agricultural lands, and went out to work in the fields by day. The idea that people should live in isolated homesteads or in their own little world in the suburbs is really quite anomalous, and for good reason. It’s much easier to defend yourself if you’ve got a few dozen, a few hundred or a few thousand neighbors who are also armed and can turn out in the event of an emergency. This was also why many frontier cultures, like 19th century America, Canada and Australia had local militias that were formed to defend against attacks by bandits and hostile natives, and could also supplement the regular army and navy in time of war. <br><br>I might add that it is profoundly unhealthy from a social and psychological view to have such large numbers of people who are effectively isolated from one another because they are living in their own little worlds or living in small, isolated nuclear families whose members are frequently alienated from one another. This seems to be particularly prevalent in the United States. I think that when all is said and done, the cult of atomistic individualism and the rise of the selfish ideology that says “greed is good” will turn out of have been one of the most catastrophic mistakes that Western civilization ever made, and considering the sheer number of disastrous mistakes that the West has made, that’s really saying something.<br><br>I would like to give a hat tip to Leo. His blog ranks right up there with The Archdruid Report, The View From Brittany and Jim Kunstler’s site as one of the best and most intelligent Peak Oil related websites on the Internet.

It is in Columbia, in a drug war zone. I wonder how many historical examples there are of such communities. For example I wonder if all indian villages had a military group to defend them before the british empire colonized them. <br><br>From a pragmatic point of view, if your village or community is being productive and offers things of value, it may be more valuable for hungry, pissed off people to let you live and teach them how to produce food and other things that are good for life. But that is not guaranteed and I do not claim to understand the mentality of barbarian hordes, though I think I do understand the mentality of Empire (sorry about the capital E, but I don't agree with JMG that there is no such meme and that it is only an external mode of extracting wealth--in other words I think Empire is also a psychological state). Perhaps the motivation to pillage peaceful, value producing villages is more a function of Empire psychology (which can exist even before or after the fall of an empire). I would rather spend resources doing outreach and preventing the anger that leads to people wanting to pillage in the first place. What fraction of monasteries got pillaged throughout the ages? What fraction were armed or defended by armed forces? The effect of arming oneself might actually have the reverse effect of what you are hoping for (security). But of course, if you don't pay attention to your neighbors and try to help them, or even piss them off, it would be better for you to be able to defend yourself when they try to kill you.<br><br><a href=not-written-in-stars.html#c8850133670008469231 title="comment permalink">8/14/13, 12:11 PM</a><br><br>
