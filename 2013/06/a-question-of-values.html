<div dir=ltr style="text-align: left">
Oswald Spengler, whose theory of historical cycles was discussed in last week’s post, was far from the first scholar to propose that the future of modern industrial civilization might best be understood by paying at least a little attention to what happened to other civilizations in the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Back in 1725, as the industrial revolution was just getting under way, an Italian philosopher named Giambattista Vico traced out "the course the nations run"—the phrase is his—in the pages of his masterpiece, <i>Principles of a New Science Concerning the Common Nature of Nations<i> (</i></i>for obvious reasons, scholars these days shorten this to <i><i><i>The New Science</i>). </i></i>Since then, it’s been rare for more than a generation to go by without some historian or philosopher pointing out to readers that every previous society has followed the familiar arc of rise and fall, and ours seems to be doing exactly the same thing. <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Spengler was thus contributing to an established tradition, rather than breaking wholly new ground, and there have been important works since his time—most notably Arnold Toynbee’s sprawling <i>A Study of History</i>, twelve weighty volumes packed with evidence and case studies—that carried the same tradition further. Vico spent his whole career laboring in obscurity, but Spengler and Toynbee were both major public figures in their day, as well as bestselling authors whose ideas briefly became part of the common currency of thought in the Western world. They and their work, in turn, were both consigned to oblivion once it stopped being fashionable to think about the points they raised, and you can read any number of hefty studies of the philosophy of history and never find either man mentioned at all.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes this disappearance fascinating to me is that very few critics ever made a serious attempt to argue the facts that Spengler and his peers discussed. There was never any shortage of disagreement, to be sure, but nearly all of it remained weirdly detached from the issues the theorists of historical cycles were attempting to raise. There was a great deal of quibbling about details, a great deal of handwaving about fatalism and pessimism, and whole armies of straw men were lined up and beaten with gusto, but next to nobody tried to show that the basic concept of historical cycles doesn’t work—that the patterns traced by the history of China, let’s say, contradict those displayed by the history of ancient Egypt—and the few attempts that were made in this direction were embarrassingly weak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By and large, those who disputed Vico, Spengler, Toynbee, et al. either brushed aside the entire question of patterns of historical change, or conceded that, well, of course, those other civilizations of the past might have followed a shared trajectory, but ours?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Never.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s still the predictable response to any suggestion that the past might have anything useful to say about the future, and regular readers of this blog will have seen it deployed countless times in critiques posted by commenters here: in words made famous in any number of speculative bubbles, it’s different this time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a wry amusement to be had by thinking through the implications of this constantly repeated claim. If our society was in fact shaking off the burdens of the past and breaking new ground with every minute that goes by, as believers in progress like to claim, wouldn’t it be more likely that the theory of historical cycles would be challenged each time it appears with dazzlingly new, innovative responses that no one had ever imagined before?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead, in an irony Nietzsche would have relished, the claim that history can’t repeat itself endlessly repeats itself, in what amounts to an eternal return of the insistence that there is no eternal return. What’s more, those who claim that it’s different this time seem blissfully unaware that anyone has made the same claim before them, and if this is pointed out to them, they insist—often with quite some heat—that what they’re saying has nothing whatsoever to do with all the other times the same argument was used to make the same point down through the years. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are deep patterns at work here, but it’s probably necessary to tackle the different-this-time argument on its own terms first. Of course there are differences between contemporary industrial civilization and those older societies that have already traced out the completed arc of rise and fall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each of those previous civilizations differed from every other human society in its own unique ways, too. Each human life, to use an analogy Spengler liked to cite, differs from every other human life in a galaxy of ways, but certain processes—birth, infancy, childhood, puberty, and so on through the life cycle to old age and death—are hardwired into the basic structure of being human, and will come to every individual who lives out a normal lifespan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The talents, experiences, and achievements that fit into the common sequence of life will vary, often drastically, from person to person, but those differences exist within a common frame. The same thing, the theorists of historical cycles suggest, is true of human societies, and they offer ample evidence to support that claim. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Furthermore, these same scholars point out, modern industrial civilization has passed so far through all the normal stages of social existence appropriate to its age. It emerged out of a feudal setting all but indistinguishable from those that provided the cradle for past civilizations; out of that background, it developed its own unique view of the cosmos, expressed first in religious terms, and later in the form of a rationalist philosophy; it passed through the normal political, economic, and social changes in the usual order, and at the same broad time intervals, as other civilizations; its current political, economic, and cultural condition has precise parallels in older civilizations as far back as records reach. Given that the uniqueness of modern industrial civilization has so far failed to nudge it off the standard trajectory, it’s hard to find any valid reason to insist that our future won’t continue along the same track. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Claims that it’s different this time usually rest on one of three foundations. The first is that this is the first global civilization on record. A difference of scale, though, does not necessarily equal a difference of kind; the trajectory we’re discussing appears in Neolithic societies limited to a single river basin and continental empires with thriving international trade networks, as well as every scale in between. While it might be argued that the greater size of contemporary industrial society amounts to a difference in kind, that claim would have to be backed up with evidence, rather than merely asserted—as, so far, it generally has been. Furthermore, when the slower speed of earlier transportation technologies is taken into account, the "worlds" inhabited by older societies were effectively as large as ours; if your fastest means of transport is a horse-drawn chariot, for example, ancient China is a very big place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second foundation for claims of our uniqueness is, of course, the explosive growth of technology made possible over the last three centuries by the reckless extraction and burning of fossil fuels. It’s true that no other civilization has done that, but the differences have had remarkably little impact on the political, cultural, and social trends that shape our lives and the destinies of our communities. The corruption of mass politics in the modern industrial world, for example, is following point for point the same patterns traced out by equivalent phenomena in ancient Greece and Rome; the weapons of war have changed, similarly, but the downward spiral of a failing empire trying to cling to fractious but strategically vital borderlands is the same for America in Afghanistan as it was for the Babylonians in the Elamite hill country in 1000 BCE. Our technology has given us new means, but by and large we’ve employed them for the same ancient purposes, and reaped the same consequences. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third foundation is newer, and appears these days mostly in those corners of the blogosphere where the apocalyptic faith discussed in <a href=../../2013/05/the-politics-of-times-shape.html>an earlier post in this sequence</a> has become standard. This is the claim that the global disasters that are about to wallop industrial civilization go so far beyond anything in the past that there’s no basis for comparison. Now of course that argument is very often based on the well-worn tactic of heaping up an assortment of worst-case scenarios, insisting that the resulting cataclysm is the only possible outcome of current trends, and using that imagined future as a measuring rod with which to dismiss what really happened in the past. This is the sort of thinking I critiqued in <a href=../../2013/05/the-pleasures-of-extinction.html>a recent post</a> about claims that humanity will inevitably go extinct in the next few decades: if you cherrypick a set of extreme scenarios backed by less than five per cent of current climate change research, and treat those highly speculative hypotheses as though they’re incontrovertible facts, it’s easy to paint the end of industrial civilization in colors as extreme as you happen to like. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What tends to be missed in the resulting discussions, though, is that ecological disasters of the sort we’re actually likely to face featured repeatedly in the collapse of earlier civilizations. Clive Ponting’s excellent <i>A Green History of the World</i> is a helpful corrective for this myopia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The collapse of classic Mayan civilization, for example, was triggered in large part by catastrophic droughts, caused in large part by deforestation and farming practices that wrecked the hydrologic cycles on which Mayan life depended. Anthropogenic climate change, in other words, was just as destructive to Mayan civilization as it promises to be to ours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While climate change in Mayan times was more localized than the present equivalent, it’s worth remembering that the Mayan world was equally circumscribed by its geographical knowledge and transport technologies; from a Mayan perspective, the whole world was being ravaged by climate change, as ours will be in its turn. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The downfall of classic Mayan civilization unfolded over a century and a half, and involved the loss of irreplaceable cultural treasures and scientific knowledge, the abandonment of nearly all of the Lowland Mayan cities to the encroaching jungle, and dieoff so severe that postcollapse populations bottomed out around 5% of the Late Classic peak. It’s by no means impossible that the decline and fall of modern industrial civilization could involve losses on the same scale, and it’s a source of endless fascination to me that this suggestion—based as it is on the one source of useful evidence we’ve got, the experience of a previous society going through an equivalent process—should be dismissed by one set of disbelievers in historical cycles as too pessimistic, and by another set as too optimistic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s exactly this twofold dismissal that points to the deeper, nonrational dimension underlying the whole discussion of possible futures. It bears repeating that the belief in progress, and the equal and opposite belief in apocalypse, are narratives about the unknowable. Both claim that the past has nothing to say about the future, that something is about to happen that has never happened before and that can’t be judged on the basis of any previous event. Whether the thing that’s about to happen is a shining new age of wonder, along the lines of Joachim’s Age of the Holy Spirit, or a sudden end of history, along the lines of Augustine’s version of the Second Coming, it refutes everything that has come before. This is what lies behind the endlessly repeated (and just as repeatedly disproved) insistence, on the part of believers in both narratives, that it’s different this time: if it’s not different this time, if the lessons of the past reveal the shape of the future, then both belief systems come crashing down at once.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, the belief in progress and in apocalypse are both matters of faith, not fact. The same is true of every set of beliefs about the future, however, or about anything else for that matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No system of logical inferences, however elaborate and exact, can prove its own presuppositions; dig down to the foundations, and you’ll find that the structure rests on assumptions about the nature of things that have to be taken on faith. It probably has to be pointed out that this is just as true of rationalist beliefs as it is of the most exotic forms of mysticism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To say, as science does, that statements about the universe ought to be based on observation assumes, has to assume, that what we observe tells us truths about the universe—an assumption that the old Gnostics would have considered laughably naive. To claim that there are many gods, a few gods, only one god, or no gods at all is to insist on something about which human beings have no independently verifiable source of information whatsoever. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s tolerably common these days, outside of the surviving theist religions, to affect to despise faith, and you’ll find plenty of people who insist that they take nothing on faith at all. Of course they’re quite wrong. None of us can function in the world for five minutes without taking a galaxy of things on faith, from the solidity of the floor in front of us, through the connection between another person’s words and their thoughts, to the existence of places and times we will never experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Gregory Bateson pointed out, in a series of papers that have vanished as thoroughly from the literature of psychology as Spengler and Toynbee have from that of history, that an unwillingness to take anything on faith is at the core of schizophrenia; that’s what lies behind the frantic efforts of the paranoiac to find the hidden meaning in everything around him, and the catatonic’s ultimate refusal to have anything to do with the world at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Faith is, among other things, the normal and necessary human response to those questions that can’t be answered on the basis of any form of proof, but have to be answered in one way or another in order to live in the world. The question that deserves discussion is why different people, faced with the same unanswerable question, put their faith in different propositions. The answer is as simple to state as it is sweeping in its consequences: every act of faith rests on a set of values. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We’ll probably have to spend a good deal of time talking about the difference between facts and values one of these weeks, but that’s material for another post. The short form is that facts belong to the senses and the intellect, and they’re objective, at least to the extent that anyone with an ordinarily functioning set of senses and no reason to prevaricate can say, "yes, I see it too."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Values, by contrast, are a matter of the heart and the will, and they’re irreducibly subjective; to say "this is good" or "this is bad," or any other statement of value, does not communicate an objective fact about the thing being discussed, but always expresses a value judgment from some irreducibly individual point of view. More than half the confusions of contemporary thought result from attempts to treat personal value judgments as though they were objectively knowable facts—to say, for example, "x is better than y" without addressing such questions as "better by what criteria?" and "better for whom?" </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The prejudices of modern industrial culture encourage that sort of confusion by claiming a higher status for facts than for values. Listen to atheists and Christians talking past each other, as they normally do, and you have a classic example of the result.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The real difference between the two, as the best minds on both sides have grasped, is a radical difference in values that defines equally profound differences in basic assumptions about humanity and the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Behind the atheist vision of humanity as a unique but wholly natural phenomenon, in the midst of a soulless universe of dead matter following natural laws, stands one set of value judgments about what counts as right and true; behind the Christian vision of humanity as the adopted child of divine omnipotence, placed temporarily in the material universe as a prologue to eternal bliss or damnation, stands a completely different set.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The difference in values is the heart of the matter, and no amount of bickering over facts can settle a debate rooted in that soil. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the classical world, in an age when values were given at least as high a status as facts, debates of this sort were conducted on their natural ground, and systems of thought appealed to potential followers by presenting their own visions of the Good and calling into question the values presented by competing systems. Nowadays, such clarity is rare, and indeed it’s embarrassingly common to hear people insist that there’s no way to judge among competing value claims. It’s true that a value can’t be disproved in the same way as a fact, but values don’t exist in a vacuum; any statement of value has implications and consequences, and it’s by assessing these that each of us can judge whether a value is consistent with the other values we happen to hold, and with the universe of fact that we happen to experience. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We all know this, at least in practice. The reason why doctrines of racial inequality are widely and rightly dismissed by most people in the modern industrial world, for example, has little to do with the shoddy intellectual basis offered for such doctrines by their few defenders, quite a bit to do with lynch mobs, ethnic cleansing, concentration camps, and other well-known consequences of value systems that deny the humanity of other ethnic groups, and at least as much to do with the conflict between the values expressed in these consequences and other values, such as fairness and compassion, that most people embrace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is an extreme example, but the same principle applies more generally: when a statement is made about the unprovable, it’s always wise to ask what the consequences of believing that statement have been in the past, and what other values are consistent or inconsistent with the claim. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We can thus apply the same logic to the faith in perpetual progress and imminent apocalypse. One consequence of accepting these beliefs, and embracing the values that underlie them, is clear enough: both reliably yield false predictions about the future. Believers in progress like to claim the opposite, but you have to read descriptions of the future from before 1960 or so to grasp just how few the hits have always been compared to the flops. For all its failures, though, the faith in progress has a better track record than the faith in apocalypse; across the centuries, whenever anyone has insisted that the world was about to end, he or she has always been dead wrong. Aside from speculative bubbles or the quest for perpetual motion, it’s hard to name a more reliable source of utter hogwash. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For faiths that focus on the future as intently as these do, this inability to foresee the future is not exactly encouraging. It’s possible to go further, though, by noticing the values embodied in the progressive and apocalyptic faiths. Both of them insist that the world we know must shortly be swept away, to be replaced by some better age or annihilated in some grand final judgment. Both of them anchor their entire sense of meaning and value on an imaginary future, and disparage the present by contrast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Both faiths are thus founded on a rejection of the world as it actually exists</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To borrow one of Nietzsche’s phrases, both are Nay-sayings to life, attempts to posit an unreal "real world" (the shining future of progress, the world after apocalypse) against which life as it actually is can be judged, condemned, and sentenced to death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The mere fact that the executioners never do their job, though it’s an inconvenience to the believers on either side, does nothing to alter the furious zeal with which, over and over again, the sentence is handed down.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The religion of progress and its antireligion of apocalypse are by no means alone in their Nay-saying to life. The same world-condemning attitude has had a pervasive role in most (though not all) branches of Christianity, the theist faith from which these secular religions covertly derive a good many of their ideas and images.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In an upcoming post, we’ll discuss the way that this attitude in its many forms has helped send contemporary industrial society slamming face first into the wall of crises that shapes today’s headlines and will be defining our history for a good many years to come. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For the time being, though, I’d like to leave my readers with this reflection: what would it mean to found a set of values, and a corresponding set of presuppositions about the world, on life exactly as it is? In the course of opening that can of worms, and getting the worms inside more comfortably situated in their proper soil, we’ll begin the process of circling in toward the question at the center of this series of posts—the quest for a philosophy of life, and perhaps even a spirituality, that can make sense of the human reality of the Long Descent. </div>

As the central distribution channels for food and other resources break down, the rabble outside the "city walls" -- the DMZ's surrounding the elites -- are going to be too busy feeding themselves to make muskets. If they want to get rowdy, they'll buy elite weapons on the black market, but they'll be expensive, and possession will be a capital crime.

I will continue to ponder.<br><br>On the concept of faith in it's many forms, what I observe today is people are so dogmatic about whatever they believe in greater or lesser parts because they don't want to be wrong. Be it the ability to have the bible tell you a truth that is unassailable, or be it facts that should be, in theory, undebatable. Honestly, I don't know how different this was from the past, but it seems different to me. It seems people are more unwilling to be open to new thought and ideas because to change is somehow to lose. I'm unclear on what is lost or to whom, but boy do people not want to lose. My experience is that plays a big role in why "faith" is such an all or nothing thing for many people. <br><br>What you describe as faith seems semantically different that what that word means in todays culture.

Nowadays, such clarity is rare, and indeed it’s embarrassingly common to hear people insist that there’s no way to judge among competing value claims. It’s true that a value can’t be disproved in the same way as a fact, but values don’t exist in a vacuum; any statement of value has implications and consequences, and it’s by assessing these that each of us can judge whether a value is consistent with the other values we happen to hold, and with the universe of fact that we happen to experience."<br><br>One of the most important discussions of value for the last century was the one that took place between Eisenman and Alexander in 1982:<br><br>http://www.katarxis3.com/Alexander_Eisenman_Debate.htm<br><br>Later Alexander's values have been supported by huge amounts of provable facts:<br><br>http://www.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/UAT-description.pdf<br><br>Still, Eisenman's ideology, completely disconnected from science, has conquered the world.<br><br>"For the time being, though, I’d like to leave my readers with this reflection: what would it mean to found a set of values, and a corresponding set of presuppositions about the world, on life exactly as it is?"<br><br>Here I would like to quota Alexander's vision of A New Kind of World:<br><br>- A world in which we experience, daily, our unity with the universe<br>A world which is made like nature – and in which we are daily making nature. <br><br>- A world in which the daily process of making, adapting, and deepening is a vital part of our lives.<br><br>- A world in which there is something to believe in – not a religious thing – but a believable vision of God as the unity behind all things which guides us and impels us to act in certain ways. God not conceived of as a construct of any organized religion, but as a fact of nature and its wholeness.<br><br>- A social and political world which contains (and explicitly provides) the freedom for us to act in this way – something we rarely have today.<br> <br>- A world in which we feel the cultural trace of human beings before us who made and loved every part.<br><br>- A world in which we value ourselves according to the beauty of the places we have carved out, and modified, and taken care of, and in which we have woven our lives together with that of other people, animals, and plants.<br><br>- A world in which buildings are shaped according to these principles, and laws governing the shaping of buildings in this way, are the laws most precious to us, and those to which we give most weight.<br><br>- A world in which we have an entirely new understanding of what it means for the world to be sustainable: not a technical matter, but a matter in which respect for the whole governs.<br><br>- Above all, there is a world in which meaning exists. The deadly and frightening state in which we do not know why we are here, is replaced by a world in which there is a natural and accurate and truthful picture — an answer to the question ‘why am I here’ – one that is not made up, but that stems from and accords with the true nature of things. - Christopher Alexander<br><br>http://www.natureoforder.com/library/a-new-kind-of-world.htm<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c2459622571282979221 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 12:56 AM</a><br><br>

It is a fact that people differ. Everything will end one day is a truism, even for a “perpetual growth” believer who at the bottom of his heart there is one qualification: perpetual growth within a time frame that matters. Doomsayers in the past failed just because we are still around; but that doesn’t mean we will still be around tomorrow – meaning that one day they will have the last laugh!<br><br>In the past decades or so, historians like Susan Naquin, did a lot of research on the numerous millenarian rebellions in the last Qing Dynasty of Imperial China (aided by disclosure of imperial Qing documents both in Beijing and Taipei). The interesting thing is that despite repeated quick failures (sometimes within days), these religious leaders (usually associated with White-Lotus Buddhism) kept creating new ones (with as little as less than a thousand followers), because each believed his was the right moment. The Qing Dynasty finally collapsed in 1911, not by these rebels and not by Imperial western powers who wanted to divide China among themselves in those days. The turn of history never seemed to follow a well-defined path. The Qing Emperor wanted to keep their regime in perpetually (and the Kim family in North Korean wanted similarly nowadays). Whether or not they believed in the ideology of “perpetual growth” is quite irrelevant in the order of things. <br><br>The stock market will collapse one day, but people differ as to when. And for the stock market to fulfill its resource allocation function, people are encouraged to be different (for the sake of discussion, assuming that there is no market failure). And I believe it is similar with life itself. Perpetual growth or apocalypse beliefs may have a point sometimes, depending on a particular reality at a particular moment, or life as what is exactly is – definable only at a particular moment. <br><br>“God is dead” can also mean “we humans can live happily without any presupposition”.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c7756994255810956906 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 1:10 AM</a><br><br>

That's almost as good as "the sun will never set on the British Empire". <br><br>As regards a set of values and presuppositions about living in the world exactly as it is, two initial thoughts. One foundational challenge will be to revive the personal skills and practices to become more conscious of our own unconsciousness, to challenge our mental pre-suppositions or our ego or whatever else you want to call this bundle of automatic reactions that we live with in our heads 24/7. Of course, there are many spiritual and philosophical frameworks for doing this, several of which you've touched on in your posts, so we're not short of tools or methods. I don't think we would need to pick just one approach. But we would need to raise the priority of internal inquiry as a lifelong practice, rather than just wait for people to tumble into a meditation practice after a mid-life crisis. And part of raising the priority of this would be the need to tune out disruptions - a ban on commercial and political advertising would be fun to implement. <br><br>I see this personal contemplative practice as foundational for finding greater depth in a simpler lifestyle as well as more purposeful public debate and group decision making.<br><br>Second, rebuilding our comfort with and closeness to nature would be key. So much of what we do today seems to be to dedicated to avoiding contact with the natural world as it actually is. Nature can help with much of what ails us, but we need to change our relationship to it. Understand that we are part of it, subject to it, not in control of it. <br><br>So we could go on forever on this topic. Quite the can of anacondas.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c6018276414812432941 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 1:43 AM</a><br><br>

Mind you China was fairly isolated, so I don't know how much that matters. <br><br>The neofeudal system would have to be communal. On the stationary defensive, a single person with a gun is just too vulnerable, since humans are evolved as predators (both eyes forward) and our ears are shaped for communal defence, that's why they can't swivel. <br><br>Also depends on what kind of guns can be manufactured. From what I understand of it, a fair few of the advances didn't require more energy/resources or a higher tech base, just having the idea. So they'll likely be of high quality compared to most historic examples (so they won't explode and will be accurate). <br><br>Gun warfare's pressures are very different than sword or bow warfare, cavalry won't have the same place. It'll also mean a difference in how raids or barbarian invasions work out, since guns are fairly powerful on the tactical defensive (so militia), so a equipped town could repel an invasion or raid fairly easily.<br><br>And so on.

The morphological view requires an aesthetic or intuitive appreciation of your object of study, not a "fact-based", empirical method of repeatable experiments. The latter approach is not possible in the study of history, and so in a bid to stay at least ostensibly "scientific", historians have consigned themselves to a role as chroniclers of past events, who don't try to say anything about large-scale or general trends and most certainly don't claim to predict anything about the future.<br><br>And Spengler would of course say that this kind of myopic faith in facts and incapability of a more metaphysical kind of thinking is to be expected of the current stage in the life cycle of our civilization, but I'm not sure to what extent he would've foreseen the possibility of his own work being dismissed and forgotten as Faustian civilization declines. If I recall correctly, he did say that the ability to take a "Copernican" view of history would be something fairly unique to us, because of our developed sense of history and appreciation for personal fates, but I'm not sure if he thought of it as something our civilization would eventually preserve and pass on to other cultures.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c4654567577337224427 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 2:54 AM</a><br><br>

I feel like Tom Thumb.<br><br>JMG wrote<br><i>“This is an extreme example, but the same principle applies more generally: when a statement is made about the unprovable, it’s always wise to ask what the consequences of believing that statement have been in the past, and what other values are consistent or inconsistent with the claim.”</i><br><br>History sometimes is so close – piped water came late to our Parish but those first installations now need a lot of attention, and we who live with the mistakes of original local understanding (especially with regard to handling of foul water processing), must now deal with them <i>inter alia</i>, in the context of present (somewhat changed realities), institutional, financial and technological and personal constraints. Last I heard most of our water supply company is owned by some billionaire outfit in Hong Kong, which may or may not matter over relevant timescales. Sounds like my life; though naively I used to think these clean water &amp; WC matters were solved in principle long ago and needed just some priority. Like we had achieved some Progress!<br><br>A passing thought for us hominids: we understand that we probably derived our present genetic form by about 100,000 to 150,000 BP. We have seen little differentiation since we became that particular unusual primate; very long-lived long distance endurance runners and walkers with much reduced sexual dimorphism and a most unusual breeding strategy (flexible but default colonial monogamy), and one or two other distinguishing features like being wholly dependent on large culturally inherited ‘stored’ adaptive skill-sets – right from the days of our emergence. It would be nice to compare our social behaviour range with that expressed by other hominids, but that is denied us. <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i> is believed to have evolved a bit earlier about 200K years ago, which is about two ice ages and two inter glacials ago, but seems to have been more narrowly specialised. <br> <br>Just a thought: development of feudal social systems for example seems more typically to have been absent for the first 100,000 years or so. There is some suggestion in the ethnographic literature that extant small-band foragers consciously have to work hard at social mechanisms to reject the feudal tendency – because presumably it is obviously counterproductive to their survival. (See for example <i>Getting to know Waiwai</i>, Campbell, 1995. As he put it: “no <i>Lord of the Flies</i> fantasy here”) <br><br>My own anecdotal experience of ad-hoc ‘buddy systems’ very much supports the idea that social response can ‘flip’ to default organisation with benign result. Perversely, aggressive sub-groups can borrow some of the ‘buddy’ behaviours in developing dominant institutionalised structures. Well, that is how farming became increasingly organised round here even while it was 'still horses' and 'organic', into recent times; England especially 1750 to date – a kind of ‘super-feudalism’ imposed on the older ownership and financial organisation, but with strong morphological similarity. But there we go; we are into those value judgements you are continuing to talk about!<br><br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c4817933142485933324 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 5:16 AM</a><br><br>

Rather, the base assumption without which "Science" cannot function is that the universe is rationally intelligible.This cannot be proven by employing reason itself, but must be accepted as an (very profound) act of faith. It is in fact quite a plausible indicator of the existence of God. As is also the definition given by the Stephen Hawkings of the world that the Big Bang is that about which it is invalid to ask "what came before?". The Big Bang we are told, is that event, that phenomenon, which has no cause. Sounds like God by another name. Of course, rational intelligibility cannot be proven a priori but there are modes of consciousness that provide ample empirical evidence. The problem for "Science" is that those sources are not acceptable to the institution and tend to support a numinous world view. "Science" can never look at its underlying assumptions without undermining its own authority and credibility.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c1298753218687169221 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 6:04 AM</a><br><br>

The msn writers aren't being racist; rather, they assume that shifts in racial demographics impact our nation politically - alter our national 'values' if you will. They are, no doubt, correct. The fact is, examples of multi-racial societies in which there has been relative social, political and economic equality among the various racial populations are few and far between.<br><br>Race matters. But not strictly for cultural reasons; evolution plays a huge role. Any determination of how our values - both individual and shared - will shake-out as our industrial civilization unravels must take into account the fact that humans are, first and foremost, visual creatures. Like all arboreal descendants, we rely so heavily on our incredibly keen eyesight that we are largely unaware of its importance - like breathing and sleeping, it is simply the way things are.<br><br>This biological attribute can result in the oddest of assessments: a tiny logo printed on a sport shirt can quadruple the retail value of that shirt over the exact shirt sold sans-logo. A metal leaf pin of less than an inch in diameter, affixed to the shoulders of an otherwise visually distracting military uniform, will delineate a major from a colonel simply by the hue of its finish. A person who displays a skin tone and certain minor structural facial and bodily characteristics that are common to non-whites will be viewed with veiled suspicion (however suppressed) by even the most politically-correct white liberal. The fact that human racial variants account for only a tiny portion of DNA and are thus otherwise biologically insignificant will make no difference. We are humans; we rely on what we see. We are animals - without heavy inculturation (and often with) we react from the gut.<br><br>Not only our visual acuity, but all of our biological propensities will need to be taken into account as the construction of a new post-collapse ethos is attempted. Otherwise the hard-fought victories of high culture over our savage nature will be exposed as mere patina, to be wiped away in the fray of survival.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c3500303122842380969 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 9:21 AM</a><br><br>

I mean, yes, I agree with you - we can't help but take things on faith. As Kant pointed out, even our sensory experiences are necessarily based at least as much on the nature of the human mind (or soul, if you prefer) as on the outside world. So, what are we left with? Even "life exactly as it is" is therefore dependent on things taken on faith, which include pre-existing human values. Even a value system based on "life exactly as it is" will come with values already baked in from your mind. This new value system would be built as much on sand as reason, as Buddhism, and as industrial progressivism/apocalypticism. There's no such thing as "life exactly as it is". It's values all the way down.<br><br>This is a genuine concern of mine, Mr. Greer. I'm not trying to troll anyone, or denounce your diagnosis of a deindustrial future and your prescription for what the common man is to do. I think you're right on the money! I just don't see any way of having a non-arbitrary morality or conception of the universe. And saying "Tough. You'd better have one, or you'll turn schizophrenic!" really isn't enough. As Plato pointed out, those who know the real universe may well appear insane to those who don't. And, in general, we don't determine the truth or falsehood of an idea by looking at the consequences to the holders of an idea - even if that idea is a value system. If we did, then persecuted religions would be trivially false. <br><br>I would love - really love - to have some kind of non-arbitrary value system. Heck, I'd settle for a non-arbitrary metaphysics. Even a non-arbitrary science would be pretty nice! If anyone could show me such a thing, I'd probably immediately vote them "Greatest Philosopher in Human History".

No, this time is exactly the same: destroy the species' habitat (where it practices agriculture) and the species dies out.

In the comments on Spengler that I've read there seems to be a tendency to place values on attributes he assigned to various phases. I'm thinking about some comments here and the article a couple of people linked at nationalinterest.org. It's tempting to see the characteristics of a declining, or at least past-prime, civilization as "bad" or at least causal to the decline. It will await some studious reading for me to have an opinion as to whether Spengler had that opinion.<br><br>At any rate, we have the focus on feminism in the article and the use in a lot of quarters of terms such as "decadence" to characterize those... values.

But something you wrote raises a question of definitions:<br><i>The downfall of classic Mayan civilization involved ... dieoff so severe that postcollapse populations bottomed out around 5% of the Late Classic peak.</i><br><br>You go on to say that this estimate is dismissed as too pessimistic by some and <b>too optimistic</b> by others.<br><br>Too optimistic? In what universe does a 95% population loss in 150 years NOT count as a secular apocalypse?<br><br>Granted, I have met some folks who are convinced of the imminent extinction of humanity, but I have never been able to take those people seriously, and they seem very much in the minority even among doomers.<br><br>(Granted there is also an entire contingent of folks who think that some flavor of god is going to reach down and turn off the lights on us. I'm largely ignoring them because they don't really speak to what I'm trying to understand.)<br><br>I am left puzzled, because I know that you dismiss the doomer contingent as unreasonable and failing to take lessons from history. But based on my travels in those circles, I would say that relatively few of them are worried about human extinction. The majority of them seem to be worried about a failure mode roughly in line with a 95% dieoff. That's not the end of the species, but it certainly is the end of civilization and the end of all (non-salvaged) technology.<br><br>The fabricatory depth required by civilizations (even relatively primitive agrarian civilizations) mean that you need a certain level of population to sustain anything more complex than a hunter-gatherer society. While we might be able to maintain civilization with populations that low, I very much doubt that we can adapt to such a rapid change in population, while keeping any of our original social, political, economic, or infrastructural systems intact.<br><br>In my estimation, a 95% dieoff (from a high population, high tech starting place) most likely leaves us with small bands of survivors picking through the wreckage, living essentially a hunter-gatherer tribal lifestyle (which includes gathering old technology, but no maintenance or replacement of same). It's not the end of the species, but it's the end of everything else we have done in the last five millennia. The so-called Dark Ages look like (and are) high culture by comparison.<br><br>So: Do you believe that we can sustain anything that looks at all like civilization in the face of a dieoff that severe? Or do you not consider people who fear that scenario "doomers" (in the pejorative sense that they are failing to learn from history, etc)? If it's the latter, then I respectfully suggest that your positions are not so very far from those you dismiss as excessively pessimistic, because that sort of scenario is exactly what most doomers seem to worry about.<br><br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c2152387280698258992 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 4:51 PM</a><br><br>

We can accept that every cultural unit has a life-cycle too but making predictions about where we are in the cycle is a lot more messy when there is a smaller sample size of previous cultures to study and a great deal of uncertainty in how to categorise things.<br><br>What we really want is to get a realistic sense of where "our" culture is in its life-cycle - that is where peak oil/everything theory and study of the Mayans or Easter Islanders can help us. <br><br>The problem for prediction is that there are many wild-cards: several readers have mention one of them: nuclear weapons: we have never had the potential to destroy life on the planet like this before, and we can only wonder as to how long a civilisation can hang on for when enemy groups or breakaway units from within the civilisation can be threatened with the biggest stick ever. <br><br>Re: values for the world as it is: I prefer to think instrumentally: I want values that lead to long term sustainable human survival, with minimum suffering: this means religious indoctrination at a young age for all people into a system that:<br><br>Holds life sacred and does not kill without a serious process: e.g. even farm animals are honoured.<br><br>Encourages mindful states: group prayer, meditation, ritual dance... whatever.<br><br>Probably encourages awareness of individual mortality and ones own place in the cycle: first you are a child: you are initiated and are then an adult, you contribute to the group and have children, you are old and offer counsel and watch your grandchildren grow... you die and [insert useful myth of choice]<br><br>Takes a pantheistic view of life: trees have spirits, rivers have spirits etc. everything is in its place: thus making changes should not be done lightly. <br><br>Probably makes the extended family the central organising unit (and incorporates sacred family myths etc.): this is in harmony with our own natural tendencies to love and favour our kin and will be difficult to avoid in a chaotic world anyway....<br><br>Whatever values people come up with I think we should reflect on the way that they could actually be inculcated in the general populace: this is why I mention indoctrination at a young age: we can't wait for everyone to figure it all out in their own time, meanwhile causing further chaos...<br><br><br><br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c2439843935164518257 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 4:53 PM</a><br><br>

For the last 2500 years or so, the standard way to create a set of values is to imagine a world that doesn't exist, define a set of values that are relevant to that world, and then denounce the real world for its failure to live up to your demands. My suggestion is simply that this has worked very, very poorly, all things considered, and we might want to try basing values on the world we actually experience -- knowing that different people will inevitably define those in different ways. The logic of dissensus is as relevant here as elsewhere!<br><br>Yupped, excellent! I see your crystal ball is in working order. Yes, we're going to have to talk about both of those as we proceed. <br><br>Leo, exactly. Most of the first round of historical civilizations had little or no contact with other civilizations -- they had, as we do, a penumbra of outside societies that paid tribute and got very little in return. As for guns and all, that's going to take a future post, or a series of posts, to sort out. <br><br>Repo, I think that's very likely part of why Spengler's been forgotten; still, the visceral revulsion of believers in progress to the concept of decline also has a lot to do with it. <br><br>Keith, I read <i>The Chalice and the Blade</i> when it first came out, thought it was a hamfisted polemic, and haven't read anything else by her. Is there something you'd recommend among her later works? <br><br>Phil K., you know, that had never occurred to me. You may be right. <br><br>Richard, excellent! I rarely give out two gold stars in a day, but I'm going to make an exception here. Exactly; the end of modern industrial civilization isn't the end of the world, or the end of humanity -- it's just the perfectly normal decline and fall of one more civilization, somewhat bigger than previous examples. <br><br>Leo, the papers are worth a look, and so is the jawdropping hubris of the blogger!<br><br>Phil H., like a great many of the features of high cultures, feudal systems require certain material preconditions -- agriculture, for one, and military technologies complex enough to give a massive advantage to those who can afford them, on the other. Feudal systems also aren't necessarily counterproductive -- in a time of chaos following the collapse of a civilization, which is normally when they emerge, they're very nearly the only thing that can reestablish the rule of law and restore some semblance of social peace. Of course they have their downsides, but their benefits also have to be noted. <br><br>Yossi, no, <i>no</i>, NO! The age that's coming isn't a "better age" -- to judge by many past examples, it's far more likely to be a time of brutal violence, universal impoverishment, imploding public health, and other highly unwelcome things, and the new civilization that rises out of its ashes -- perhaps a thousand years in the future -- will be different from ours, but almost certainly no better. That's what I've been saying all along, and it baffles me that so many people can't hear it!<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c4497198852987169512 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 5:00 PM</a><br><br>

Do practices that connect you with the Divine every day. Then you will appreciate what you have and life won't suck as much. The Messiah may come eventually, but don't hold your breath."<br><br>Jewish religious law governs most aspects of ordinary life. One of its objectives is an embodied mindfulness, unlike the disembodied mindfulness that is the object of some meditation practices.<br><br>Take for example the elaborate rules that define observance of the sabbath. The sabbath is a twenty-four hour period once every seven days during which it is forbidden to do the work of one's livelihood, or domestic work other than necessary child and animal care. This is not a penance but a way of making time.<br><br>The sabbath begins with prayers and a family dinner that includes wine and the best food the family can afford. Husband and wife are encouraged to have sex when they retire; they can look forward to a day of leisure. The next day is for communal prayer, taking walks, reading, conversation, time spent with children, and so forth, until the Sabbath Queen is ceremonially bid farewell at sunset.<br><br>The permitted activities are high on Maslow's hierarchy of needs. One of the explicit purposes of Sabbath observance is to give people a taste of the afterlife in the here-and-now.<br><br>Most educated people would not accept accept the way classical Judaism frames these practices, as commandments from a deity who is both lawgiver and the creator of the universe. Why would the being who created the stars care what I wear or whether I have rabbit for lunch?<br><br>However, there is a sound psychological basis to encouraging people, alone and in groups, habitually to do specific small acts, acts which cultivate gratitude and awareness of a larger whole. This technique can be adapted for a particular culture and adjusted to circumstances. Because most of the practices are part of household routine, they need to be taught but do not require a full time priesthood or an advanced material support system.<br><br>Ideas do not become sufficiently internalized to inculcate values or support a spiritual life unless they are put into action. Sometimes symbolic action is a good start.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c5802426502766217163 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 5:15 PM</a><br><br>

I learnt about peak oil towards the end of my student life, and it was a huge relief because somehow I felt that my own inner skills would have some value in this life instead of living the canned life of an office drone. There was a fair bit of panic too... I was a huge science fiction fan, and I did it in part to avoid comfronting the real world, but I have never been very sanguine about a future controlled by machines. So the idea of imminent civ. collapse was both a comfort and also a big anxiety, since the future became again something totally unknown.<br> After a few more years living in the real world, and being blessed with an economically viable professional branch, I have a lot more nuanced view of the Long Descent. And living an office drone's life has very immediate material advantages. Reading Jim Kunstler's blog I was tempted more than a few times to just watch civilization collapse comfortably from my office chair. But first the show was hardly interesting - a lot of blabla about debt, lots of isolated bombs blowing off in remote countries - and I gotta say, more than a few times your blog helped me calm down and try to take more hindsights on things. That is why I also gave a tip in the cooking jar a while back. I have come to realize that Jim Kunstler's predictions have good litterary values - and predictably fail to predict, not least because they are even more negative than reality itself, and also because they are so precise in their timing.<br> Now I have finally started to grasp - emotionnally, not just intellectually - what Malraux referred to as "the human condition". I watched your videos about green wizardry at The Red Room and Witchtalk. That also helped me. Nowadays in my homeland we face a strange predicament - the legacy of a once prosperous industrial nation, which has focused itself on nuclear and defense industry, aeronautics, building roads for the cars everywhere... and a hugely centralized state concentrating most of the wealth in the city of the Proud Tower (a lot more than half of high qualification jobs are there). For a young man like me, it is hard to envision a future when a decent property home is increasingly out of reach, and where most of the surviving higher class jobs will get concentrated towards a conurbation which is increasingly hard to live in (too many cars, crowded public transports, insane commutes, soaring costs of real estate).<br> In this context, and as part of my personal coming of age, I want you to know that the ideas you are discussing are always appreciated at a time when both the personal and the global sphere look pretty scary, even more than the prospect of global extinction. Since I live in Western Europe your posts do feel North-American, and I know they hardly apply to my own personal reality. That's life... You can't always have someone pointing out all of the way for you ! And I am impressed with the quality of the debate on the comments - I am sure we all share some comfort through the sharing of polite conversation.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c8001180946584420535 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 5:50 PM</a><br><br>

The point I'm trying to make is simply that the habit of grounding values in an imaginary future may not be the best options we've got. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Joseph, that's why I speculated on some sort of neofeudal arrangement when responding to Leo. The change brought by guns is a drastic lowering of the bar -- it takes a lot less in the way of control over resources for a group of peasants with guns to be able to compete with your platoon than it takes for an equivalent group of peasants to be able to compete with armored knights, samurai, etc. Of course there will likely be some form of warrior class, but it may be notably less exclusive. More on this down the road; I'm really going to have to do a series of posts on Dark Age America, aren't I? <br><br>Toomas, I find Spengler more congenial and more readable, but it's purely a matter of personal taste; if you prefer Toynbee, by all means. <br><br>Myriad, good. You're quite mistaken, as I intend to show as we proceed, but at least you're grappling with the seriousness of the issues I'm trying to raise. <br><br>Marcello, given the number of people in America today who know how to build, maintain, and use a flintlock -- check out your local reenactment groups sometime -- I don't see much likelihood that firearms technology will slide any further than, say, 1800. I grant that a Lee-Enfield is another matter -- but a Kentucky long rifle is a simple, robust, reliable technology well suited to local manufacture.<br><br>Ozoner, did you mean to post a link? If so, please repost -- I'd be interested in reading your piece. <br><br>Karim, excellent. Those are certainly values worth bringing into the conversation. <br><br>Georgi, please reread <a href=../../2013/05/the-pleasures-of-extinction.html rel=nofollow>my post on the near term extinction fad</a>. I said in so many words, in that post, that humanity would certainly go extinct someday, and could do so quite soon. My quarrel was with those who insist that it's inevitable in the next few decades -- and it fascinates me that nearly everyone who's quarreled with me on that point has insisted that by saying that extinction's not certain, I'm claiming that it's not possible. That weird bit of paralogic is one of the things that shows me that what's going on here has much more to do with myth than with reason.<br><br>Dmitry, there are also potent sources of negative feedback in the global climate system that nobody in the extinctionist scene has even tried to address -- you might, for starters, look up the role of oceanic anoxic events in the Jurassic and Cretaceous in terminating greenhouse events (and not incidentally laying down some 70% of today's known petroleum reserves). Of course human beings will go extinct someday -- as I pointed out to Georgi above, I've been saying that all along -- but the heaping up of hypothetical worst case scenarios not supported by most of the relevant science, in order to prop up a claim of imminent, inevitable human extinction is exactly the same kind of logic that's been used to defend one failed apocalyptic fantasy after another, ever since science elbowed aside religion as a major source of apocalyptic rhetoric in the modern world. <br><br>Moshe, well put. I haven't seen the film but I'm aware of the phenomenon. <br><br>Ian, I think you've gotten confused -- what Georgi is talking about is human extinction, not the collapse of industrial society. By the way, "dog-tucker" is a good lively phrase!<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c6792021934968560671 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 5:52 PM</a><br><br>

I also have altruistic tendencies, and coming from a humanistic jewish culture, where I have been taught early on that sometimes I need to adapt to the world, but other times I need to promote change in the world. I see the spiritual value in saying yes to the world no matter what, but I also see problems with that, which become obvious in extreme scenarios of injustice such as concentration camps, but can be applied in other less extreme examples as well.<br><br>I do see philosophy and values influencing the trajectory of history. I think part of the problem with the industrial revolution is that it focused fanatically on only two values: efficiency and comfort (at least for the beneficiaries of empire). I think that was a mistake and that if we take other values into consideration, such as ecological sustainability, individual freedom, human potential, community, and the right to productive work, then small groups of people (but unfortunately not single individuals, and probably not whole nations or civilizations) could choose something different. That is what my main work is in the past 7 years, to create an alternative based on these values. I haven't made that much progress, but haven't given up either. If I had accepted the world as it is, I would have stayed an engineer at Motorola and had a comfortable, but probably miserable life. Are these values based on a non-existent world? Partially, but also on pieces that have (or still) exist(ed), such as medieval villages in europe, native villages in the new world, democratic town meetings in New England, the Possibility Alliance in Missouri.<br><br>But I am very interested in radical acceptance as a spiritual practice.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c4081549664377639546 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 5:53 PM</a><br><br>

Spengler wasn't entirely immune from the tendency to make moral judgments of historical events -- very few people are -- but the habit of treating decline as a Bad Thing expressed, among other things, by that National Interest article is a dubious application of Spengler's thinking. Different people will have their own assessments of the changes that come with the later phases of the historical cycle, and those value judgments are relevant -- to the individuals who make them. On a broader scale, it seems to me, it's more useful to distinguish between facts and values, and try to grasp the facts as they are. <br><br>GreenEngineer, there are plenty of people who consider me wildly optimistic -- do a little web browsing and you can find plenty of people who've been denouncing me in spluttering tones for suggesting that humanity isn't going to be extinct by 2030. To respond to your broader question, I think a 95% dieoff is possible; I'm not sure that it's likely, though we're certainly going to have to shed a lot of population as the fossil fuels run short, and I can think of no way that's going to happen that won't involve horrific events. Taking plausible worst case scenarios as a possibility, and trying to figure out how to hedge against them, is sensible; it's when people insist that we will <i>inevitably</i> suffer this or that extreme future that, as I see it, they've stopped talking sense and started spinning mythology. <br><br>Bozack, granted, a morphological approach to the history of societies has to rely on a limited sample and deal with a great diversity of variables. I suggest, though, that it's still a better idea than insisting that the future will be utterly different from the past, and using that insistence to define the future in terms of pop culture fantasies that rest ultimately on medieval mythology (Augustine's or Joachim's, take your pick). <br><br>Jean-Vivien, thank you! Of course you're right that everything I say is biased in a North American direction -- that can't be helped, as I've never lived anywhere else, and like everyone else I've been shaped by my culture and upbringing. This is one of the reasons I encourage people who live elsewhere, come out of very different life experiences, or both, to address these same issues from their own perspectives.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c8174504521963840943 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 6:07 PM</a><br><br>

But in most posts that you write, the proper balance is lost and you mostly talk about how history is cyclical and this will be just another round of the same. As a result one can easily get the impression you do in fact dismiss the possibility. <br><br>That's what I was referring to. <br><br>I personally am not at all convinced we simply have to go extinct at some point. All the species on the planet (and all the organisms for which the species concept does not quite apply) reside on twigs of the tree/bush/net of life representing lineages that have not gone extinct and can be traced back at least to the last universal common ancestor and possibly even further back (depending on what philosophical point of view you adopt regarding life before that). That's billions of years. There is no biological reason why human have to go extinct any time soon. But in order to prevent that to the extent that we can, we have to take the possibility very seriously. <br><br>Also, the historical cycle point of view treatment of the current situation contains the inherent danger of overlooking the fact that any future civilization will inherit a planet on which most resources needed for the development of the knowledge base we currently posses have been depleted. And that knowledge base is our best evolutionary asset into the future. It is highly doubtful that it will be ever restored again on this planet if it gets lost as it will almost inevitably be during the collapse of the current civilization given how fragile the infrastructure on which it depends for its continued existence is. It's basically one and done for a technological civilization on each planet, if you fail, you don't get a second chance. I am personally not at all happy about that, and not because there is anything good about a technological civilization of the kind we have been running, but because the knowledge it generates is extremely valuable.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c8864241856415431398 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 6:10 PM</a><br><br>

Basing values on the world as it is doesn't mean being passive in the face of the world as it is -- as you would have been if you'd stayed at Motorola, for example.

Thus I challenge the "one and done" concept -- it seems to me that it takes far too narrow a view of the possible range of technic societies.

It would be worthwhile to more robustly define spirituality, I think, to see if we're even talking about the same thing.

Previous editions of the historical cycle do not give much hope - most of the intellectual legacy of the Greek/Roman world was lost and whatever survived did so because the eastern part of the Mediterranean did not collapse as badly. And that knowledge was not particularly sophisticated or difficult to preserve. This time collapse is global and the cutting edge in science is so esoteric that very few people are real experts in any given area, with some fields being in much worse position than others, and unfortunately, it is the more fundamental fields where the situation is the worst (math, theoretical physics, evolutionary biology). Mathematics is the most extreme example - it currently exists as a collection of several hundred sub-sub-fields with just a few dozen people and in some times even single individuals that really know what's going on in each, and it's often difficult even for people from nominally close sub-sub-fields to understand what those people are talking about (you may have seen the reports in the popular media about the supposed proof of the ABC conjecture, that's a perfect example). Now, you may dismiss that situation as diminishing returns on investment and an example of how science has reached its limits, but it's not that simple - a lot of the progress in theoretical physicists' quest towards understanding the foundations of space and matter depends on the advances in those esoteric sub-sub-fields of mathematics so it is vital to preserve them. But how are you going to do that in practice? You need a minimum number of people in each area of science in order to keep it viable. How is that going to be organized in the absence of concerted society-wide effort to do so? There isn't going to be such an effort for the simple reason that as you very accurately point out most people don't like to hear about these subjects.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c4591926601758243752 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 9:29 PM</a><br><br>

The professors always drew a triangle with one at each corner, and I thought not much of it. But now, it's quite clear, that if I only remembered the triangle, I really got it wrong. It's much better to imagine reality as an infinite space, much bigger than the chalkboard (which one might call "our world"), in which there is a bubble of thought, which intersects with a bubble of language.<br><br>The language is essentially communal, and cannot be otherwise; in language is a shared consciousness. Personally, our own language bubble is much smaller than our own thought bubble; but collectively, the language bubble is much bigger than our personal thought bubble; nevertheless, the collective thought bubble remains much larger than the collective language bubble (thankfully - I'm really glad to only hear the thoughts people wish to share).<br><br>I think all the varieties of spirituality are ways of communities, and individuals, trying to deal with time and material change - to match the inner world to the outer world. Interestingly, I would surmise that the eastern traditions are really quite better adapted to descent, and the western to ascent, of relative levels of material prosperity. As evinced by how many ecologically-driven people on average are more buddhist or hindu inclined, at least in the West, bears this out. Yoga and meditation just fit better, when the fun and games of cars and airplanes and spaceflights get played out.<br><br>What's missing so far from this account of spirituality is "others". At that point there can arise some problems because, if our approach to time (spirituality) is too pragmatic, too much about life exactly as it is, in a time of decline, that basically means, be self-reliant, independent, employ practical wisdom in the day-to-day of survival. It also very easily tips over into chaos and the dissolution of community. That's pretty common in times of decay, considered historically anyway.<br><br>But I would be concerned that a spirituality centered around the life exactly as it is, may not be much of a challenge to the entirely natural and predictable human ethic of dog-eat-dog in times of descent. People will need a shared sense of their project in the future (which is another definition of religion) to avoid descent to animality.<br><br>Despite my previous comments and its current anchorage to capitalism in the West, Christianity is really a fundamental challenge to the capitalist ethos that created this whole economic, resource and climate mess, and could be a good response to the notions of profit being more important than life, if it went back to its roots. So, despite the ass-kicking that Christianity deservedly gets by anyone who's not wholly bound up in its spell of certainty about the future, Christianity does have a lot to offer, which is important mostly because a lot of people think Christianity is important. I agree.<br><br>Last point: probably the biggest thing that could hasten a revival of Christianity closer to its roots (the roots being well summarized I think in the Beatitudes and Jesus' challenge to the money changers), is the collapse of debt. This debt now just cannot be paid back, there isn't the energy available. And Christianity has a lot to say about debts, not much of it good. The time of the collapse of debt, perhaps in the next 20 years or so, maybe sooner, will tell a lot about spirituality<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c2608327636797298053 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 9:33 PM</a><br><br>

Now, there's an author who seems able to accept the eternal goodness *and* badness of human beings with a kindly and compassionate attitude. In his endless saga -- what is it, 24 books and counting, if he lives long enough to complete yet another? -- individual persons try to act in community and with honour, not to make the world perfect but to do the right thing as and when they can. There are bad-guys galore, some of whom are just plain bad, and some of whom are sometimes almost good :-) There are good-guys (and gals of course) who are cranky, irritable, eccentric, egotistical, and at the same time heroic and well-meaning and occasionally successful.<br><br>Imperfection -- human nature, social aberrations, inequality, cheating, lying, stealing, all the rest of it -- is just accepted, and lived or struggled with as necessary. It's the opposite of an apocalyptic vision *and* the opposite of a beatific vision. There's never a great big Resolution after which everyone lives happily ever after -- in fact, at times the author dishes up some rather savage mockery of such tropes. Somehow, when we talk of a philosophy that deals with the world as it is, its own messy and gorgeous self, I think of the comfort I often get from reading Terry Pratchett when the world is weighing on me a bit too heavily :-) I realise, with a moment of slight embarrassment, that in a way he's actually one of my own personal spiritual texts!<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c1690923292831911122 title="comment permalink">6/13/13, 9:45 PM</a><br><br>

Most of the detailed knowledge, especially in abstract and esoteric fields such as advanced mathematics, is almost certainly going to get lost, and will have to be slowly and painfully rediscovered in future centuries. My intentions are considerably more modest -- I want to get the basic concepts and practices of the scientific method, ecology, and a handful of extremely useful practical skills such as organic gardening, low power shortwave radio, and the making and running of printing presses, through the bottleneck. No, it's not that much, but if those can get through and combine with the usual random assortment of books and artifacts, the renaissance may not be as long delayed or as difficult as it's often been in the past. <br><br>Chris, one of the things we'll be talking about down the road a bit is the way that everyday life has been redefined as dog-eat-dog savagery by comparing it with an idealized fantasy.

However, I reckon it is understood intuitively and allows people to dismiss points of view that clash with the speakers personal values and life. The climate change scientist writing the thoughtful piece which you linked to a few weeks back was getting a glimpse of the more practical applications of this supposition and recognised that it didn't look good for them as a profession.<br><br>In the last part of your essay, I'd suggest that in working out the problem of how do I best fit in with nature here has really rammed home this key point. Large scale industrial farming looks to extracting maximum returns, whereas I'm looking for maximum resiliency. The differences are stark and nature will inevitably win that battle, guaranteed.<br><br>You know, I see this attitude with bee-keepers in that they tell me do this and do that just to get the maximum products and services from the bees here. They fail to see that their very actions may actually be stressing the colonies out and making them susceptible to disease and predators. Many of those people have had their colonies die, but they're still all too happy to beat me over the head with helpful advice. It's annoying... I’ve read books on the subject by organic apiarists and they admitted their failings on that colony stress front from a position of hindsight and I'll follow their advice.<br><br>PS: How’s your quince tree going, I hope you are getting lots of growth and blossoms? They’re very hardy trees. I’ve been so enamoured of fresh walnuts this season, so much so that I put in an additional three walnut trees today, plus some pecans and chestnuts just for good measure. There are lots of chestnut orchards around here, but whilst the established trees are very drought hardy, the young trees need lots of protection from the sun and I only learned this by killing a few of them and observing which ones survived and why. There’s great hope for the macadamia nut trees here too as a farm not too far from here had some fruit on their trees. The almonds are doing their weird thing again this year in that some are going deciduous whilst others are still in leaf.

In the Kilmichael Ambush in 1920 small farmers with limited training and no battle experience took on and wiped out a force of elite British Auxiliaries (the elite British force made up of former officers all of whom had served in the first world war). Barry's tactics were based on long marches, getting very close to the enemy, fighting short decisive actions and avoiding long range, long drawn out fights. The British troops had all the advantages of experience, training, marksmanship and logistics. Barry famously summed up his battle tactic as "there is no such thing as a bad shot at 10 feet". In his greatest victory at Crossbarry in 1921, he took on a British force that outnumber the IRA by 13 to 1 and beat them. Barry used the terrain to maximum advantage, and the toughness and endurance of the west Cork small farmers and their intimate knowledge of the terrain to out march and out smart the British.

I agree that most arguments that it's different this time are specious. One from the apocalyptic camp I think is relevant is that it truly is global and that there is nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide. This has nothing to do with the dynamics of the collapse, mind you, but everything to do with the recovery, as there will be no unspoiled reserves or alternate civilizations (unless they are of little green men). The other real apocalyptic difference is that our nuclear weapons truly do have the capability to destroy the world. As you have said, that threat will not be forever, and the chance of their actually being deployed is remote, but it is still possible.<br><br>But Phil K points out another way it may truly be different this time.

I hope to join the discussion more in the future, but I just have a quick comment on one of the issues raised this week.<br><br>There have been several comments about a 95% die-off as completely apocalyptic. I have no doubt that the period of the die-off (however long that took) would be very difficult for the people living through it. However, what people may forget is that our 7 billion population is a relatively recent phenomenon. It is estimated that we only hit 1 billion at around 1850, so 99.9% of human existence has been with less than 1 billion people (about a 90-95% reduction). So ultimately, a 95% reduction in population could be less of an apocalypse, and more of a return to a sustainable number. Again, I emphasize that living through the period of population contraction would probably feel like an apocalypse, although it may be stretched out long enough to just be awful, or perhaps merely miserable, instead of apocalyptic.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c26988725860485430 title="comment permalink">6/14/13, 6:36 AM</a><br><br>

Here is a paragraph from my book, "The Laws of Physics Are On My Side" (2013, pp.12-13), which I hope puts Spengler in perspective. The paragraph ends a discussion of Alfred Kroeber, who saw culture as an entity he called the Superorganic.<br><br>"Many people cherish determinism. There are plenty of high-profile researchers and authors who insist human behavior is determined by genes or organic compounds in the bloodstream. In a world of nincompoop bureaucrats, nasty drivers and incompetent salespeople, it is quite seductive to just imagine people cannot help themselves. Restraint is so much more difficult than just giving in to gratification of desire. In the first part of the twentieth century, when Kroeber was writing and doing research, nationalist myths were in the ascendant. Even the concept of culturally-determined decline was popular and Oswald Spengler’s Decline of the West (1918, revised 1922) was much discussed on both sides of the Atlantic. This two-volume examination of history asserted a recognizable pattern in cultural florescence culminating in civilization and followed by decline. According to Spengler, cultures pass through recognizable cycles of rise and fall that last about a thousand years. Unlike the economic determinism of Marx, Spengler’s notion was that cultures are life-forms themselves and so must be born, develop and inevitably die. There is more than a little similarity to Kroeber here."<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c1510989666961234981 title="comment permalink">6/14/13, 8:22 AM</a><br><br>

Ethnic, racial, sectarian and familial allegiances are almost always the formats around which more localized governing bodies (however base) emerge. The Lebanese civil war, and the Slavic civil war following the fall of the Soviet Union are two of many horrifying modern examples of the kind of mayhem that can come in on the heels of the collapse of a larger order. Even Nazi Germany serves as an example. Though it was, for a time, a comprehensive government rather than a local one, the Nazi regime emerged in an atmosphere of massive economic and political breakdown. Nazism appealed to the Teutonic tribal myths of a population desperate for a workable identity.<br><br>Genocide ruled the day in all of these conflicts, and the world stood by in shock that societies of relatively high standards could descend into raw savagery with such ease. Civilization should be made of sterner stuff...apparently it is not.<br><br>Social contracts are not arbitrary contrivances - ultimately they exist to either support or to suppress instinctual motivations within the human heart, depending on what a parent society deems useful to the larger order and to the security of its ruling class. Such contracts tend to form organically, often based on motifs borrowed from other societies. Typically, they will find their way into the parent society's law and religion. The tendency of societies, both large and small, to adopt similar social contracts dealing with like issues of basic human relationships speaks to the true origins of same.

This made me think about values that I have, and why I have and live by them.<br><br>For example, I strive in my life to live ecologically, in part by not unnecessarily using excess resources and energy. Sometimes people argue about the importance of my lifestyle choices, by saying something along the lines of, "Does what you do and don't do really matter in the long run? What difference are you really making in the future by avoiding airplane travel? Whether or not you have a car is not going to affect the overall outcome of industrial society. At this point, an individual decision not to use air conditioning or a dryer is not going to affect the general direction society is headed, etc."<br><br>I notice that they are treating my lifestyle, not as a expression of a value system, but as a fact that they're attempting to falsify (by arguing it's not making any noticeable impact on the future). While I do do the things I do, in part, because I do care about the future (that is, a likely future of decline, not a unlikely future of continual rising industrialism or mass green revolution), much of why I make certain choices is because of my values in the world as it is. Sure, my not flying an airplane is not going to have any mass impact on the future of society. But, it is living according to my ecological values, and therefore whether or not it affects the future in any noticeable way doesn't really sway my decision to live this way. Also, it is within my power to make many lifestyle changes in the world as it is; I don't have to wait until an imaginary future to enact such changes, so why not act in such a way in the present?<br><br>People sometimes criticize lifestyle changes as not changing the world in any revolutionary way, but I look at it other ways.

I get the impression you're missing the point of this week's post...<br><br>Melson, many thanks.<br><br>Cherokee, excellent -- the apiarists who keep on pushing advice on you probably haven't reflected on the values they're expressing through their approach to beekeeping, which is why they get results they don't want. As for the quince, it's growing -- not yet flowering or fruiting, since this is only its third year, and in this climate it'll be five or six years before it reaches maturity.<br><br>Irishwildeye, thank you! The best response to a theory about the future is almost always "well, what happened the last time?" The Irish War of Independence is a good example of one of the kinds of things we'll be facing.<br><br>John, the nearest equivalent I can think of is in China, where the rise and fall of dynasties was a known phenomenon, and philosophers used to draw on historical examples to figure out what was happening next. This may have a lot to do with the extreme resiliency of Chinese civilization! It's a good point, though, and there aren't a lot of other comparable examples.<br><br>Adam, that's a good point, of course. A 95% decline in human population would still leave the world with 350 million, or about as many people as there were on the planet at the time of the Renaissance.<br><br>Walter, you might want to take the time to find out what I'm actually suggesting -- or, for that matter, what Spengler was saying -- before posting an attempted rebuttal. As it is, you've given quite a beating to that straw man of yours.<br><br>Greg, as I mentioned in response to an earlier comment, I expect the approaching decline of global population to involve horrific events, and the division of populations along a dizzying series of lines will doubtless be part of that. That hardly justifies the claim that the culturally constructed category of "race" will play a larger role in that than any of the other fault lines that run through modern societies.<br><br>Jim, thank you for seeing the distinction between what's technically possible and what's economically, politically, and socially possible! It's a source of wry amusement to me to see how many people never manage to grasp that.<br><br>Beneath, excellent. Yes, that's exactly the distinction I'm trying to make here. You're doing the right thing because it's the right thing, not because of any specific impact it might have on the world of fact; Epictetus would have approved.<br><br>GreenEngineer, exactly -- and as a student of the history of ideas, I'm paying attention to the way that certainty derives from, and leads to, much-repeated patterns in popular culture, which leads me to see the whole thing as a collective expression of cognitive dissonance rather than a reasoned reaction to the facts on the ground.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c5625088039472555634 title="comment permalink">6/14/13, 10:21 AM</a><br><br>

But still, I feel it's well worth while to refrain from slaughtering my neighbour.

And if after trying you find they are too many to overcome and too mad to listen, you can still refuse to participate. No?

Instead of thinking deeply its easier just to say 'they are evil, and anything they say is just propaganda' (I myself have done this in the past...."<br><br>I've done that too, and I think this is a bigger topic than it might seem. People tend to weigh relationships as we dispense or withhold judgments about others. It feels safer to demonize someone outside an in-group than to run the risk that one's tolerance for heresy may elicit censure from within the group. That risk assessment is pretty subjective, but people do tend to be more cautious about threats that come from nearby.<br><br>This is functional on a biological level. Whether it is on a social or civilization level is debatable. Threatening is the primary mechanism at work in advertising, and maybe that has something to do with our culture's obstinate devotion to the toxic values promoted by our retail establishment.<br><br>Of course, people vary in their application of this proximity-weighted judgment dynamic. In my experience, people who are relatively self-actualized are less likely to engage in demonizing and more likely to delve into comparisons between value systems, to look into the structure of their own values, and to deviate from dysfunctional norms.<br><br>I know the concept of self-actualization (roughly as articulated by Abraham Maslow) is itself bound to some specific value system, but that doesn't render it meaningless by dint of philosophical relativity. I believe the ideal of autonomy in mind and spirit is vital and beautiful. I also have to admit that's an article of faith, but I sure don't like calling it that.<br><br>While looking over the wikipedia article on Maslow, I note that among his list of qualities shared by most self-actualized people is "Dichotomy-transcendence".

Even a modest decline in world population will be experienced as a pretty convincing version of apocalypse. Japan during World War 2 had about a 4-5% decline, the Soviet Union something around 12-15%. And I know JMG that you are well aware of this, and doing a damn fine job keeping people level headed about the future. I appreciate the difficulty of the balance you are trying to maintain and the necessity for doing so.<br><br>Second, to your cliffhanger of the week. The founding of wholly new modes and orders is a matter of fortune and virtue. Fortune presents you with a suitably biblical opportunity. Perhaps once in a thousand years do the works of man cry out so desperately for remaking. As for virtue, well here I think Zarathustra’s eagle and serpent are as good a guide as any! For of course politics and philosophy are not compatible and pride will always carry away one’s wisdom. Are not all imagined republics also a repudiation of life exactly as it is? <br><br>Finally, if you are to talk about facts and values and snuggling worms into their soil, isn’t time to discuss that soil which binds facts to values?

This civilization's global reach is novel, but there are still billions of people on the planet who live largely outside its grasp. Climate change and other environmental limits will bite down hard, but even 1% to 10% of 7 billion is still quite enough for a future round of cultural flowering.<br><br>Applying the metaphor of the human life cycle to the shape of time of cultures is useful. In this context, belief in progress looks like a human in middle age expecting to become immortal as a 25 year-old, while belief in apocalypse looks like a person expecting to die next Tuesday of some horrible accident rather than grow old and slowly fall apart. Sure, in some sense both are possible, but neither is terribly useful as a foundation for a solid plan for the future. More likely is the typical pattern of old age, failing health, senility, and death, followed by the execution of the will (or, in this case, the forfeiture of assets to various creditors and the theft of most things not nailed down). <br><br>--<br><br>While I'm very much enjoying this series and your implication that it's getting to the core of your perspective, I'd like to second your suggestion to Joseph that you do a set of posts on Dark Age America some time.

You and your readers have well reasoned thoughts and ideas. When you began this series I dug out my Philosophy 101 volume and looked up St. Augustine just to make sure. He defined history as two cities (i.e., one of satan and one of god) that were (and will be) always in conflict. My margin notes indicate this as "pure hogwash" and 65 years later my life experience has not changed this thought one whit. Obviously I will never reach salvation within his definition. Further, there is no credible evidence of the existence of a god (biblical readings included) or a life hereafter. Unlike some folks though I'm quite willing to change my mind if there is a compelling argument with sufficient evidence. Before college my parents had given me a copy of Toynbee's "Civilization on Trial" and this began my inquiry into history. Now, 20 years post retirement, I have the time to read all that stuff I missed while trying to earn a living. You and your cohort are supplying me with references and ideas. Thank you. In the meantime my wife and I are preparing for the eventual collapse of this wonderful experiment called 'civilization'. A century or so from now those living humans might change our genus name from 'homo sapiens' to 'homo stupidus'.

Richard Abels sounded sufficiently even-handed and knowledgeable. <br>Quote: <i>“It is telling that the most “feudalized” societies of the twelfth century were Norman England, Norman Sicily, and the Crusader principalities, all polities established through conquest. William the Conqueror’s distribution of lands to his followers was on the basis of fiefs. Domesday Book describes the lands of England’s tenants-in-chief in 1087 as held de rege (“from the king”), and Henry II’s Cartae Baronum of 1166 enumerates the military obligations attached to them fifty years later. Whether Normandy (or Anglo-Saxon England) was “feudal” or not in 1066, it is indisputable that William structured the Norman settlement of his newly acquired kingdom upon the principle of dependent military tenures.” </i><br>To some extent Britain might have been an anomaly. Those parts of Britain that were previously a prosperous part of the Roman Empire went through Dark Ages having become dominated by pagan Germanic tribes who to an extent replaced previous inhabitants. These folk had little use for Roman ways, including pottery, and devoted themselves to their kind of farming and to highly developed metallurgy and high arts. The country could not support anything like the population that had peaked during the Roman period. My point though is that these Dark Ages were essentially over, and Britain was Christianised again before Britain got feudalism. Last week I happened to be reading again an account (WG Hoskyns, 1966) of the great assessment of 1334 of personal property across English counties shortly before the Black Death. Population in England was back to ‘Roman levels’. This assessment for the purpose of taxation superseded tax levies of the previous 13th C and was said at the time to deal with corruption in the immediately previous 1332 assessment. Using your comparative morphological methodology, I sense that I am looking at modern Britain, or at least the Britain I knew as a child; pragmatic and elastic application of law using existing property rules, but negotiable with local wealth structures, in those days essentially agricultural wealth, and recorded in detail. <br>My sense of recognition prompted me last week to coin the term ‘super-feudalism’ for the kind of big farming I am looking at outside my window now (post Agricultural Revolution, Britain 1750 to date). Within living memory this same big farming was done using horses, and only a century ago was mostly ‘organic’; needs must.

Though the rise and fall of both can be co-incident, trading empires seem generally to have shorter lives than generic knowledge bases and other assumptions accumulated by a civilisation? Though of course much of value is lost with the dross when history or accident tears out a page or two from the story, meta-structures remain necessary for larger settled societies, as is an agreed basis for trading and some degree of ensured continuity and security, even if it is just to get the planting done and the harvest in and stored. Military security can trump everything else, but is a tricky balance, and military advantage a dangerous card to play especially in agrarian societies? I am thinking of our modern versions as they globalise and butt up against and transform other societies?<br><br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c4383284695007491262 title="comment permalink">6/15/13, 2:59 AM</a><br><br>

But I often wonder if philosophy can ever lead me to a new spirituality and spiritual practice. 'Practice' is what I'm most interested in. How can we turn all this lovely philosophy into practice, something that's lived?<br><br>Further up in the comments BeneathTheSurface wrote something which I've read on your blog before; how we live our lives is an expression of our value system. A simple and a lovely idea and when I first read the same thought as expressed by you on your blog some time ago it marked a real lynchpin moment for me in my journey from marrying understanding to practice again.<br><br>But there are many more miles to go. Ritual and a spiritual community are two beautiful aspects of spiritual practice that I have yet to welcome back into my life… but I'd like to.<br><br>I suppose I could invent my own religion and rituals and then go find like minded individuals to practice with me.<br><br>Or I could keep investigating the religions that are out there in the hope of finding one that speaks to me and then join it.<br><br>Or I could pick a religion that is close enough and, as the god of victory has been shouting at us these past few decades, just do it. She's probably right as I'm pretty sure that I could stand here in the yellow woods indefinitely considering all my options and never actually pick a path.<br><br>I understand 'spirituality' is a term that means many things to many people. It's a deeply personal thing. I look forward to where your future posts may take us and thank you for venturing into these waters.<br><br>Finally… many of your readers compliment your use of cliffhangers at the end of your posts. Because of the deeply personal nature of spirituality, and as you continue to reveal more of your own core values… perhaps 'striptease' is a better metaphor :)<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c3276548244216209262 title="comment permalink">6/15/13, 7:38 AM</a><br><br>

If JMG is right that the bottom of the descent is around 300 years away and the next high culture is around 1,000 years away then we are 12 and 40 generations removed from those events. A child born at the bottom of the curve in 300 years would have 2^12 ancestors (2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great grandparents... ~4,000 ancestors) to trace there genealogy back to the present. Although, some of those ancestors would probably appear more than once i.e. her great great great grandfather on her mother's side is also her great great great great grandfather on her father's side. And for 1,000 years out she would have 2^40 ancestors (just over a trillion) to trace back to our time. Although, most of those ancestors would, of necessity, be double counted many times. <br><br> Also, the difference in minimum population between a drop to a billion people and a minimum of 5% of the current population is a 1% decline per year and a 5/8% decline per year. Of course it will not be a smooth decline but a jagged stair step down. The large number of ancestors serves to dilute the influence of any one ancestor, especially the older generations. The stair step decline with its long grinding hardships and sharp discontinuities is not a fertile environment for investing time and energy in anything that doesn't pay its own way. There will be a relentless triage on the way down and the only things that will survive it are the ones that have resources allocated to them in a demanding environment.<br><br> The challenge of getting knowledge to the future is more daunting than it seems. I know almost nothing about my family from 12 generations ago much less 40 generations ago. There are very few intact institutions that have survived that long with some degree of continuity. And there are a vanishingly small number of original written documents that have made it 40 generations. If you go back further, say 80 generations, to Rome's heyday we have only two sources. One, what was kept by the church (Catholic and Orthodox) and the Muslims. And two, what archaeologists have found digging in the ground. For Ancient Egypt we have very limited accounts of late Egypt from the Greeks that survived through the Roman church channel and archeology. For the Indus Valley civilization we have essentially nothing. No records, no second hand accounts, and archaeologist can't decipher their language (which was sparse, never more that 15 characters long on an engraving).<br><br> It may seem that we know a great deal about the Romans and the Egyptians but as an exercise compare what we know about them against what we know about our own civilization. Can we fill a Library of Congress with their culture? Could we rebuild a Pyramid? We can't even figure out how Greek fire was made and we have chemistry. If you run the thought exercise the other way where a future civilization knows only as much about us as we do about the Romans of Egyptians what would be missing?<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c7385798218993660551 title="comment permalink">6/15/13, 9:00 AM</a><br><br>

Norman England was indeed an anomaly of sorts, since the 1066 conquest allowed something much closer to pure feudalism to be imposed all at once; elsewhere (for example, France and Germany), it evolved over generations, and thus adapted to the situation on the ground. Still, I'd encourage you to widen the scope of your reading a bit, and consider Japanese feudalism of the <i>sengoku jidai</i> period, Homeric and post-Homeric Greek feudalism, etc. -- it's a very common pattern, though it takes a great many forms based on local conditions and cultural themes. <br><br>Russ, oh, granted, but it might be a nod in the direction of truth in advertising laws to change the species name to one that literally means something a little less hubristic!<br><br>Gwizard, very logical.

It would appear that they can't actually run the thing without a very large workforce, which--from a purely statistical perspective--will include the occasional reckless young person of principle willing to risk all for the freedoms of his fellow citizens.<br><br><br>In this context, Nafeez Ahmed has an illuminating blog in the Guardian's environment section. While the story he tells of US domestic military planning and surveillance is not entirely new to those of us paying attention, it, like Snowden's revelations, is quite chilling. The blog entry is well worth reading in its entirety, but I will quote some highlights here: <br><br><br>Just last month, unilateral changes to US military laws formally granted the Pentagon extraordinary powers to intervene in a domestic "emergency" or "civil disturbance":<br><br>"Federal military commanders have the authority, in extraordinary emergency circumstances where prior authorization by the President is impossible and duly constituted local authorities are unable to control the situation, to engage temporarily in activities that are necessary to quell large-scale, unexpected civil disturbances."<br><br><br><br>After then discussing how those emergencies and disturbances are explicitly related to environmental catastrophe, food shortages, or economic stress, he then quotes a senior defense contractor as saying:<br><br><br>"An increased focus on domestic activities might be a way of justifying whatever Army force structure the country can still afford."<br><br><br><br>Which, of course, begs the question of who he thinks is paying for that structure! Presumably the increasingly oppressed masses--but, I guess, it has always been thus.<br><br><br>Anyway, I've become quite a fan of Ahmed's because his blog synthesizes current events in a way that is philosophically very similar to the Archdruid Report.

Peasants have a physical and mental toughness that make them formidable fighters.<br><br>If a peasant army has the support of the people, every movement of the occupying power is observed and noted and the peasant army always have the edge in the intelligence war. In County Cork during the War of Independence less than 1000 IRA fighters (mostly small farmers and farm laborers), tied down 12,500 British troops and several thousand police. And still County Cork was ungovernable. British forces withdrew from large parts of West Cork leaving large areas under the control of the IRA. The greatest tribute to how effective Cork IRA were was that by the end of the war the British Army were copying their tactics, organising their own "Flying Columns".<br><br>In the more recent war in Northern Ireland a very small number of Provisional IRA fighters in South Armagh (perhaps 25 to 30) were so successful that the British Army didn't dare move on the ground, all movement was by helicopter. Large numbers of troops, watch towers on every mountain top and the best electronic surveillance equipment that money could buy could not stop a small number of IRA fighters (mostly small farmers) from operating at will. At the Narrow Water Ambush in 1979 South Armagh IRA killed 18 elite British Paratroopers in one day, the regiments worst day since Operation Market Garden in 1944.

If we can claim objective fact then perhaps we can trump the other, or just beat them over the head with it. Values are so highly touted in words, but I rarely see them honored in practice.

They deported the Israelites in two stages, first the elites, then most of the commoners a couple of years later, which was clever of the Babylonians. The Israelites griped about it but weren't able to do anything, and most of them assimilated into the Babylonian population and lost their national identity (the famous Ten Lost Tribes). The remnant got a chance to go home centuries later when the Persian Empire conquered the Babylonians. Most stayed put, because it was easier to make a living between the Tigris and Euphrates. <br><br>The Romans chucked all the Jews out of Judea after they got fed up with repeated revolts that required large armies to put down. The outnumbered rebels in all these revolts hoped for other provincial uprisings to distract the Roman forces, but their hopes were in vain. <br><br>The United States government used forced relocation to great effect against many Indian tribes.

We practice faith in the same way one practices the piano...in order to strengthen an intrinsic and necessary confidence necessary to lead an active life…which, IF directed towards a correct proposition…will lead to the creation of value*. Such a view of faith means that one needs to experience the creation of value in order to confirm that the proposition or object of one’s faith was correct. This is a positive feedback loop...with value creation leading to stronger faith. This is why Buddhism emphasizes practice over belief. It is natural that in the beginning of one's practice the only faith present is that intrinsic confidence that enables us to lead sane lives (trusting that the floor will not collapse, etc)...just enough curiosity to experiment. It is actual proof that one subjectively views as a result of practice that leads to stronger faith.<br><br>Above, the poster name Primitive, said “What you describe as faith seems semantically different that what that word means in today’s culture.” <br><br>I think religions that emphasize the benefits of practice in the here and now tend to define faith in the JMG and Buddhist way, whereas religions that emphasize the benefits of practice in the hereafter tend to define faith as a belief which is a prerequisite to obtaining benefits. The second definition of faith is what I think Primitive is referring to a “semantically different” from the JMG definition.<br><br>This difference concerning the definition of faith, in my opinion, is another reason atheists and theist seem to talk past one another. I have found it helpful when discussing religion to first spend ample time arriving at a common definition of faith. If a common definition of faith cannot be achieved then at least both parties have been put on notice that they will have to be very good listeners in order to achieve anything resembling a dialogue.<br><br>*Value as either Beauty, an esthetic value that enhances specific aspects of the individual's life; Gain, anything that concretely enhances the entirety of an individual's existence; or Good, being that which enhances the life of an entire community or society.<br><br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c6119695244580626276 title="comment permalink">6/15/13, 9:30 PM</a><br><br>

Glad to hear they made something interesting of it. Congrats on the new arrival!<br><br>Slowly, what's going on here in the US is very simple, though next to nobody's talking about it. For decades now the US and its allies, using "non-governmental organizations" owned and operated by US interests, have been manufacturing revolutions in countries whose governments do things we don't like -- the current business in Syria is simply the latest example. Those same techniques have already been borrowed by some of the nations that don't think much of the US claim to world dominion, and it's pretty clear that the groundwork is being laid for a "color revolution" here in the US, paid for by foreign money, to embarrass, cripple, and if possible overthrow the current US governmental system. Our government is aware of that, and is preparing to oppose such a revolution with force, in exactly the same way that Assad is doing in Syria.

Mind you, your saying that "love is a person" makes about as much sense to me as "colorless green ideas sleep furiously;" to say that a principle is a person is rather like claiming that love is eighteen inches long and is bright orange! On the other hand, if you want to say that the person in question, being divine, embodies the principle of love in its fullness, we'll at least be talking a common philosophical language -- or you can always go back to Tertullian's <i>credo quia absurdum</i>, which is also an answer. <br><br>Casamurphy, am I guessing correctly that the definition of value you've appended is from Daisaku Ikeda's writings?<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c5220452494196137728 title="comment permalink">6/15/13, 10:44 PM</a><br><br>

Philosophy of history has been quite untreated wilderness for me, and these posts have served as useful guide. Finding areas of knowledge new for oneself is always humbling experience, and much needed through entire lifespan of human being. <br><br>All I have read here just confirms my belief that after civilization has grown into sophisticated and interconnected Moloch of current size, it cannot change its predestined course. Pressure groups and interest lobbies are just too influential.<br><br>When there is contradiction between map and terrain surrounding map reader, wise thing to do is to notice that map is wrong one, and start to make observations based on current environment. Leadership and also general public of industrial world has decided otherwise; if map does not describe current surroundings, it is obligation of terrain to metamorphose into what is described by the map... <br><br>To admit mistakes and change habits accordingly is rare quality among individuals and totally unknown quality among civilizations.<br><br>As democratic make-up hiding faces of industrial oligarchies wears of, panem et circenses spectacles are offered instead. But in Syria conditions are dangerously analogous to those in Balkans during early 20th century. <br><br>Russians are right now very upset about current Obama plans towards Syria. There is no understanding whatsoever for this current imperial muscle flexing of US. So it is just possible that cake is too big to swallow this time, like it was in the Balkan region almost exactly hundred years ago. There is lots of resentment and open hatred sloshing around because this bonding between US and Sunni rebels. SCO, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, is not entity to be ignored or played around if you ask me, but none is asking of course :). It is just interesting to observe as impartial bystander how other side's black turns into other side's white and vice versa. It is always somewhat surreal experience, to witness total and uncompromising paradigm shift between two mighty camps.<br><br>JMG, is Fior di Battaglia familiar manuscript for you? If it is, how does Academie de l'Espee relate to it, excluding obvious fact that latter is Baroque era tradition? Flower of the Battle describes rough-and-ready martial style, and I have always thought Baroque era schools were weaker and lesser descendants of once mighty fighting systems of Middle Ages, like modern wrestling is weaker and less manly version of catch wrestling.

I grew up on Spengler back in the 70's when he was even less well known than he is today. However, I suspect your veneration for Spengler may have inclined you to mitigate some of his more deterministic and categorical pronouncements.<br><br>Re: the former, if you look in the back of Volume 1 of the Decline, you will see tables of civilizations, including our own, laid out 'contemporaneously'. It is clear that Spengler foresaw our descent into the latter forms of 'Civilization' (Caesarism, Second Religiousness) occurring shortly after the year 2000--not 2100, as you wrote. Spengler termed the 19th century the death throes of the Western culture, and predicted that Democracy--i.e., the reign of money, would prevail until the coming of the caesars in the 21st century. He was quite deterministic about this, and it was doubtless both a selling point (the horror) and the cause of most of the visceral criticism the book earned. Indeed, many readers of the time misunderstood Spengler and thought his warnings of decline were imminent.<br><br>Re: the second, Spengler wrote that all music since Wagner was "impotence and falsehood"; he would hardly have accorded much importance or respect to the African-influenced musics of Jazz and Rock, though I believe by the time he wrote Hour Of Decision in 1936 that he respected Jazz's ability to reconnect to our corporal lives. But the idea that Spengler would have welcomed the primitivism of Rock is pretty dubious, I think.<br><br>Now, as for the African-influenced, or at least folkloric music you might have mentioned (and didn't) which Spengler in time would probably have appreciated, there are, most famously Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, but more subtly his Histoire Du Soldat and Symphony of Psalms, Bartok's 4th and 5th quartets, Music for Strings, Percussion &amp; Celeste, and Concerto For Orchestra (Bartok's works have a strong Magyar flavor, while combining influences of the greatest western composers, Bach and Beethoven), Ives' two piano sonatas (with their ragtime influence). I don't think Spengler would have appreciated Schoenberg's and Hindemith's over-intellectualism--let alone Webern's or Varese's or John Cage's abstraction. But Stravinsky and Bartok--and Ives and perhaps Copland on a smaller scale-managed to reconnect with nationalist or folkloric currents which had sprouted in the 19th century, as well as wrote many works in the approved sonata forms of Haydn and Beethoven, and so attempted to fit into the western canon, of which Spengler approved.<br><br>While you might feel that Spengler was at heart a conservative on artistic matters--and his characterization of Expressionism and Cubism was far from complimentary--I think my scenario (his welcoming Bartok and Stravinsky to the canon) is at least as likely as your scenario (his welcoming Jazz and Rock as replacements for Berlioz and Wagner). In any event, Spengler would have seen through the commercial aspect of modern music, which has been evident since Tin Pan Alley. In a private moment he might have liked a Gershwin song more than a modern atonal piece of music, but would probably have recognized that the latter was still aiming for more...<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c3845559360705724157 title="comment permalink">6/16/13, 3:55 AM</a><br><br>

I do think that there is some objective, common values possible. One that even unites atheists and theists is, What is good is that which promotes life and health, including emotional health and resilience.<br>Unfortunately though, if you dig a bit deeper into this value, there is a huge difference, in that morality for the atheist evolved as what promotes life for the group via the individual (speaking of humans) and thus we have altruism and compassion and so forth, but there is no real need to truly internalize the golden rule in a more universal way; from an evolutionary standpoint, genocide makes sense and that is why Darwin predicted it.<br><br>2. As regards one god, many gods and no god/s, it may not be objectively verifiable, but logic goes to one God. The reason has to do with the source of existence. Existence itself is quite a puzzle. The most basic definition of God, and therefore a necessary one to qualify, is that being or element capable of being the cause of existence. That there could be more than one independent and different cause to existence seems silly on its face, and indicates that you have not hit bottom. That existence is utterly uncaused, though many people profess to believe it, is also silly. <br><br>That there can only be one TYPE of cause, and therefore all things that arise ultimately unfold out of that cause gives a logical foundation to the common mystical realization that all is one. <br><br>One doesn't have to do any anthropomorphizing beyond that.<br><br>3.

Thibault's work is far more specialized -- it's a manual of rapier combat, not a general martial arts treatise like the <i>Fior de Battaglia</i>. The best work in traditional Western martial arts I know of these days is mostly focused on the late medieval German systems, which cover everything from wrestling up to Lichtenauer's longsword methods and a variety of polearms; if that's of interest, though, a competent teacher is essential, and I have no idea what might be available in your part of the world. <br><br>Jason, I didn't say that Spengler would have approved of rock and jazz, merely that he predicted -- accurately -- that the only artistic traditions that would have any remaining vitality in the West would draw their inspiration from other cultures. Your classical examples are other examples of the same process. As for 2100, of course you're correct -- a typo on my part; it's merely the conclusion of the descent into Caesarism that takes more time, and that we haven't quite completed yet. <br><br>Mansoor Khan, fair enough. Obviously I disagree with your claims, but that's the nature of dissensus. <br><br>Onething, a consensus of subjective opinion, about values or anything else, does not make the topic of that consensus into objective fact. The logic of monotheism is considerably less solid than it looks -- have you taken a look at my book <i>A World Full of Gods</i>, which argues this point? It must have occurred to most people by now that the universe looks like something designed by a committee... As for accepting the world as it is, your response is absolutely standard; I'll be discussing that further as we proceed.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c4754190476907632381 title="comment permalink">6/16/13, 11:54 AM</a><br><br>

That existence is utterly uncaused, though many people profess to believe it, is also silly.”</i><br><br>Casamurphy’s reply:<br><br>Aristotle is generally considered to have been quite logical and serious (not silly) and he is often attributed with the “invention” of the unmoved mover concept which you claim must be the singular cause of existence. But aren't you aware that Aristotle himself believed that the universe was eternal, “Let this conclude what we have to say in support of our contention that there never was a time when there was not motion, and never will be a time when there will not be motion.” Aristotle; (trans. Hardie,R.P. &amp; Gaye,R.K.) (7 January 2009). "VIII, 2". Physics. The Internet Classics Archive. <br><br>He also believed in multiple unmoved movers, “It is clear then that there is neither place, nor void, nor time, outside the heaven. Hence whatever is there, is of such a nature as not to occupy any place, nor does time age it; nor is there any change in any of the things which lie beyond the outermost motion; they continue through their entire duration unalterable and unmodified, living the best and most self sufficient of lives… From [the filament of the whole heaven] derive the being and life which other things, some more or less articulately but other feebly, enjoy.” Aristotle (J.L. Stocks trans.) (7 January 2009). "De Caelo" [On the Heavens] I. The Internet Classics Archive. I.9, 279 a17–30. Notice he said “they” when referring to the unmoved movers.<br><br>Existence is indeed mystical, but can be understood through experience. For example when you are not angry, does your anger nature exist or not? While in its state of potentiality, some would say it does not exist, while others would say it still exists. All kinds of potentialities manifest and then recede into dormancy all the time. Yet we can see a consistency underlying all that change. These consistencies, I believe, are what Aristotle would have called the unmoved movers and the forms. In Buddhism together they are called the law and the essential identity of phenomena. <br><br>Therefore I must say that un-caused existence isn't “silly”, indeed the opposite appears to be true: that the need for a cause for existence is silly. And in the spirit of silliness, I have composed a poem touching on this theme and of course, love (what else is poetry for if not for expressing love).<br><br>If Aristotle Had Loved Women*<br><br>Aristotle, though wrong, is not to blame <br>for suggesting an endless series to be insane**. <br>He never had the pleasure of your acquaintance <br>nor the metaphors of modern science.<br><br>If He had known that your every molecule <br>dies and is reborn in seven yearly intervals. <br>He’d rejoice with me as we proceeded <br>to imagine your body caressed and heeded.<br> <br>And to notice the wondrous insufficiency <br>as seven years passed much to quickly. <br>With so many points of beauty left untouched <br>I’m sure he would gladly concede as much:<br> <br>That an endless series can hold comfort <br>eternal past and future but a moment <br>captured when lovers gaze intently <br>and the universe collapses gently.<br><br><br><br>* Perhaps he did, but when stereotypes can be played, poets will play them…and certain strains of Greek culture are definitely misogynistic. <br>**of course he never suggested such a thing, but Christian theologians like to con us into thinking he did.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c8789958529788907215 title="comment permalink">6/16/13, 10:04 PM</a><br><br>

This music is not influenced by African, or even folk forms. (Schoenberg, who developed the 12 tone approach to composition, claimed to have been influenced mainly by Bach and Mozart). Bartok and Stravinsky were admired, and Jazz had finally come of age and had earned some respect, while Rock was still the rebellious music of adolescence...and hadn't earned much respect among the cultural commentators.<br><br>I believe that Spengler was conservative even for his time, and rather unique in thinking that music written after his own birth was decadent (Spengler was born in 1880 and his hero, Wagner died in 1883). Spengler placed great emphasis on "being in form", and quickly denounced not only artistic forms but politics and science for not being "in form"--adhering to convention. Hence, it is possible he might have approved of a classic 12 bar blues more than a more ambitious but formless classical piece; the former he might think had more vitality. But this is impossible to prove, as nowhere did he comment on popular music. <br><br>JMG:<br>Your classical examples are other examples of the same process. As for 2100, of course you're correct -- a typo on my part; it's merely the conclusion of the descent into Caesarism that takes more time, and that we haven't quite completed yet. <br><br>~~~~~~~<br>Using a Spenglerian analysis, could you venture to guess how far along we are in the process of abandoning the outworn forms of democracy and adopting caesarism? Could you predict that by mid-century (2050) we will have definitely completed the transition?<br><br>The reason I ask is because I suspect that while early readers of TDOW made the mistake of thinking the transition, or descent into caesarism was imminent, contemporary readers might commit the opposite error and think we have more time than we do. This is borne out by the fact that the formless of which Spengler warned--which can be seen in the arts, jurisprudence, politics, literature and media--has become quite evident. Even science--to the extent that it is money-driven and has become political--is not immune. The Second Religiousness has become quite evident in America, if not in Europe, if you compare today with 50 years ago.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c6612962085570903085 title="comment permalink">6/17/13, 2:33 AM</a><br><br>

Shingler</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>John Michael, how is the Long Descent not simply a slower version of apocalypse? Like other apocalyptic narratives, it finds fault in the way the world is now (the Industrial Age), promises an end to that (with no small measure of hellfire and brimstone moralizing about blind greed, irresponsible squandering of resources, and faith in perpetual improvement), and promises a future that is different than the present (no more airliners, no more space exploration, no more internet, no more anything that depends on complex supply chains).<br><br>The principle difference that stands out for me is that the few other apocalypse stories I can call to mind at the moment predict a future that never existed before, whereas the Long Descent is a story of a future that becomes very much like the pre-industrial past. That doesn't indicate a truly <i>cyclical</i> form, though, since it's a fair certainty that we're not going to repeatedly have fossil-fueled industrial empires rising and falling once the fossil fuel era is done and over with. We're truly talking about THE END of the fossil fuel era, as permanent an end as any other apocalypse.<br><br>Nonetheless, you have as unfavorable a view of belief in apocalypse as you have of belief in progress, so there must be something huge I'm missing that, for you, sets apart the Long Descent from other tales of big, final, righteous endings of an evil age. What is it?

As an aside, I happen to think that the most clever people I know are that observant and the most powerful people I know are compassionate to boot. <br><br>What I'm interested in at the moment is our individual and collective relationship to values and fact. I wonder about the motivation to dismiss values and attempts to fit those values through a back door into a seemingly fact-based argument, whether that motivation is conscious or unconscious, and from what source this patterns springs. It's odd, too, because sometimes the most compelling part of an argument lies within values that are well expressed. With the facts we may then have data or even knowledge but are missing, at least to my mind, some important imagery and wisdom that could be had if we led with our values in an honest and forthright way. Values and fact together seem like they would create the most resilient thinking, or maybe it's that the most resilient thinking allows for both.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c6352565844581266084 title="comment permalink">6/17/13, 5:35 AM</a><br><br>

Scholars accept that Julius Caesar existed. Yet none of them ever set eyes on him. How do they know who actually wrote Commentarii de Bello Gallico? <br><br>You're right, there's a lot of people talking past one another. Scientists bristle with scorn for religious types because science, you see, is based on evidence. But religion isn't. So what about "thou shalt not kill"? Because it seems to me that "thou shalt not kill" comes from a truth that's not based in evidence and therefore a truth that science has little or nothing to say about, mainly that each human life is unique and therefore invaluable and irreplaceable. <br><br>Having said that, it doesn't sound to me that writers of religious scripture were consumed by worry over verifiable historical or scientific fact. It just wasn't their thing. But is religion only a matter of values? Is religious faith based solely on, er, faith? <br><br>Did Jesus exist? What about St Paul? Are the written accounts all fabrication? <br><br>Isn't it so that law courts consider as evidence the testimony of witnesses to an event? <br><br>So what did Saul see and hear on the road to Damascus? We have the biblical account. Is it all fictional? On the other hand, what basis is there to say that it was all a howling lie? Is the biblical account of Paul bullet-proof? Maybe not. It may not pass muster in a physics lab but it's still evidence.<br><br>How can we know what Moses actually saw on the mountain? The biblical account talks about a burning bush and a voice. Is this irrefutable evidence of a deity? Maybe not. Is it an accurate recounting of what someone saw and heard or what they said they saw and heard? It possibly is. I would say it's at least some evidence of an unusual occurance. And so is the story of Saul on the road to Damascus. <br><br>So you have narratives from religious texts. It seems to me that some of them aren't in the slightest meant to be a recounting of actual events. Like the biblical story of creation. As for the rest, whether or not you accept them as true isn't so much a matter of "faith" as it is of "trust". What did Moses see and hear? What did Saul see and hear? Do you trust the writers?

The US is potentially vulnerable to violent regime change, funded by a foreign power, by way of a manufactured mass movement of the sort that the US has been manufacturing and funding in other countries for decades now; the torrent of antigovernment propaganda that's all over the internet these days strikes me as potentially the first stage of that process. <br><br>Stephen, I can't edit posts; all I can do is approve or reject them. As for profanity, yes, there are cultural differences -- references to Beelzebub's current whereabouts, for example, are okay only in discussions of theology. <br><br>Jason, I've read your first point three times now and am completely at a loss as to how it relates to anything I said. As for the second, that's a matter of what Spengler called "incident," so can't be predicted exactly in advance; still, the very nearly messianic rhetoric that got splashed all over Obama in his first presidential campaign suggests that it may not be far off. <br><br>Wayne of the many aliases, yes, you're missing the point. The big, final, righteous ending of an evil age is exactly what I'm <i>not</i> discussing; our age is no more evil than any other, and what's coming down is simply the ordinary processes of history as usual.

You get this morning's gold star, for summing up a couple of the key points I've been trying to make. <br><br>Onething, "promoting life" may be your value and the value of those who agree with you; that doesn't make it an objective reality, and there have been any number of people and traditions down through the centuries who wouldn't have agreed with you. Equally, while you're perfectly within your rights to claim that the committee that created the world isn't the ultimate reality, can you prove that? Of course not; it's simply a statement of faith on your part, and as such, unfolds from your personal values. <br><br>Roger, you've got one set of scriptures, Mansoor has another, and so do any number of other readers -- and all of them contradict one another in many ways.

As a scientist I was inculcated in the atheistic value system you described, one in which faith is not looked on with any favor.

I am reminded of Karen Armstrong's book on Islam, which she published just before the 9/11 attacks—at the peak of American imperial predominance and prosperity. <br><br>Armstrong is here writing the history of an entire cultural project, so she is forced to paint with much broader strokes than most academic historians are now accustomed to wielding, and (not surprisingly) is struck by the pattern of expansion and contraction, consolidation and fragmentation that marked the Persian, Mongol and Ottoman polities. She acknowledges this pattern as inevitable, but only—and here is the kicker—in "pre-modern agricultural societies" that did not base their civilization, as we do, "on technology that enables us to reproduce our resources indefinitely."<br><br> (She repeats the wording here if you would like to source me: http://www.bookbrowse.com/author_interviews/full/index.cfm/author_number/423/karen-armstrong)<br><br>I respect Ms. Armstrong very much, so I was genuinely shocked to find her making a claim that could only be validated by the recent invention of a perpetual motion machine, a magical cold fusion reactor, or molecular level nano-engineering. <br><br>I'm perfectly open to the claim that somehow—this time—it's different: that we are fast approaching a post-scarcity society. But it wrinkles my nose that all I ever seem to get is promissory notes, and vague claims that "because human ingenuity has solved lots of problems and overcome many physical constraints it will eventually solve every problem and abolish all physical constraints", or, as in Ms. Armstrong's case, the bland pronouncement of an open absurdity.<br><br>Whenever I try to get into the nitty gritty, I am diverted by one well meaning optimist or another down some sweet-smelling but irrelevant garden path: "look here" they say, "consider Moore's Law, consider the raising of battleships after Pearl Harbor, consider the Marshall Plan, consider the Panama Canal". I'm willing to acknowledge that they are all impressive feats of engineering, but they are also curiously distant from the claims I am interested in evaluating, namely: "does technology yet have an answer to the fact that our planet is running out of STUFF very very fast? Are we really ever going to be able to indefinitely reproduce our own resources?" I'd love to sign on for Dyson Spheres and cryo-sleep—I was raised on those images. But no one ever wants to talk hard data and realistic projections, and boy does that smell of rat.<br><br>Interesting that the question of polytheism is starting to be tabled. While I am eager to avoid any normative and ontological bogs surrounding this question, I am continually struck by what an excellent model polytheism provides for the human condition in a purely descriptive sense. <br><br>My recent posts have been dedicated to recovering the cosmic architecture of Greco-Roman polytheism as a model for describing human reality—defined as the condition of a biological organism that seems compelled to dedicate itself to something beyond biological homeostasis.<br><br>http://thesacrificinganimal.blogspot.com/<br><br>Divine Life in Human History<br><br>In which I raid the pantries of Kant, Cicero, and Gregory of Nyssa, Gordon Ramsey finds himself unsatisfied, I continue to propound a pompous and overblown theory in the history of philosophy, and David Foster Wallace proves once again that he is always right about everything—curse him.<br><br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c1366951467437754263 title="comment permalink">6/17/13, 5:15 PM</a><br><br>

I doubt it, for the very reasons John has been discussing in his latest, brilliant, articles, but it certainly would have changed what came after.<br><br>As for the drones, they and the guided weapons they deploy have a key weakness, even a great (though fading) industrial power like the USA finds them ridiculously expensive to deploy against peasant troops armed with AK47s (another item I expect to still be manufactured in a thousand years).<br><br>A hold-out, hi-tech enclave hand building a few drones and their weapons a year is just not going to be able to afford to deploy them in meaningful numbers.<br><br>No, what I think the microchips will be mostly used in is telecommunications.

For an interesting placing of Christianity in a historical context, see "Those Incredible Christians" by Hugh Schonfield, himself a messianic Jew.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c6398574065875446724 title="comment permalink">6/17/13, 8:11 PM</a><br><br>

Do we really need one more ideology that confuses evolution with progress, and blinds its followers to the reality of the present by dangling a fantasy of eventual godhood before their eyes? <br><br>SLClaire, glad to hear it. It's unfortunate that a good word like "faith" has been misused so often. <br><br>Heraclitus, I hadn't seen Armstrong's plunge into absurdity, but I've seen close equivalents in any number of otherwise intelligent people. That's the power of the myth of progress -- it causes even keen minds to switch off. <br><br>Russell, exactly. The difference between what's technically possible and what's economically viable is something that gets missed remarkably often. The technology to maintain Roman roads and pottery factories existed straight through the Dark Ages, a fact that didn't keep the roads from going to ruin and wheel-thrown pottery from becoming a lost art in some parts of the post-Roman West. In the same way, while integrated circuits (for example) might be modestly useful in telecommunications in a deindustrial age -- though you can get nearly all of the same things done with much simpler radio gear and trained human operators -- the economics of maintaining the supply chains, manufacturing technologies, and application technologies are most unlikely to work out, not least because it will be so much cheaper to make the simpler gear and train radio operators to run it. <br><br>Iuval, Christianity's an extremely diverse group of religious movements, and the outline of its early development you've suggested -- a standard Protestant outline, interestingly -- really doesn't do justice to the complexity of the thing.

It's called Christian Neoplatonism, and it was one of the standard forms of Christian belief for many centuries; Lewis drew much of the raw material for his space trilogy from Bernard Sylvester, an important 12th-century Christian Neoplatonist.

Over the ages since their inception they acquire broad societal acceptance, partly because people are by nature herd animals and do what everyone else is doing and partly because these values work to our collective and individual advantage.<br><br>We say and do and think things without, well, thinking, so deeply inscribed are these values (and because we're busy and have things to do). And religious scriptures had a hand in shaping them. No wonder then that we have such an easy time accepting as "true" scriptural narratives that helped shape those values in the first place. As an aside: interesting that so many people that sniffily describe themselves as "secular" (and that disdain religion) deny that the values that they subscribe to, like compassion, mercy, forgiveness, respect for human life, had their origins in religious thought. Why not just be honest and accept it? <br><br>You're also right that values don't exist in a vacuum. As you said they have implications and consequences. After all, values, to be of any use to us, have to translate into action and so by necessity have to live within historical and social and economic conditions. Or within a universe of "facts" as you put it. <br><br>We are, behaviourally and cognitively, very flexible and adaptible creatures. Just look at the broad range of cultures existent in the world. Our minds are not made of concrete and so we judge whether a value is consistent, as you said, with a universe of fact as we experience it. So that when a set of values grind up against that universe of fact and stop working for us, they come into question. If push comes to shove we ditch them. <br><br>For example, at the present moment we accept the value that medicine is there to extend human life and to relieve suffering. But boomers are aging and getting sick and putting a strain on social security and socialized medical systems. <br><br>We'll see if there's a broad shift in values from helping to extend human life to "mercifully" helping to end human life (and in so doing relieving "suffering" depending on how you define "suffering") especially as money gets short and collective patience wears thin. No doubt that a quick end via needle or cup of poison will find support in the ever developing field of medical ethics. There no doubt will be long, learned tracts on the issue and then thickets of legislation and jurisprudence. Maybe there will be new strains of thought in the religious sphere that get behind it too. In the end people will do what they figure they have to do and they will find reasoning to justify it. <br><br>We'll see how we modify "thou shalt not kill". Thou shalt not kill, except maybe old people, if they or their families or their doctors sign the required forms. For now. And later, depending on the state of things, maybe even if the forms aren't quite signed. And then maybe we'll see off younger people (and especially infants) if they're sick or disabled and maybe with or without their or their parents' consent. We'll play it by ear.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c2371082610101714729 title="comment permalink">6/18/13, 11:04 AM</a><br><br>

I don't find myself in the Augustinian camp often, but your description of the Mayan collapse brought something to my mind: All previous social collapses have included a fair bit of emmigration. In the Mayan example, while the lowland was decimated by climate change, the uplands surrounding the Yucatan saw a uptick in immigrants and a relatively stable population, in comparison. The fall of the USSR saw the same exodus, and I'm sure other examples exist. In terms of a global ecological and climatological disaster, however, there's not really anywhere to emmigrate to, exluding other planets, as you wisely have done. This, by it's nature, makes it much worse, and closer to the extreme examples of the die-hard Augustinians. It just means we can't walk away from the consequences of our actions as many in previous societies have. There's no lush rainforest highland for us to flee to.

You belong, which is need number one for us humans.<br><br>2. “..: the Royal Secret of equilibrium governs all things and all beings”: What’s your take on a narrative such as Brian Swimme’s The Universe Story which tells how life on earth went through a series of quasi extinctions and new starts, including one provoked by blue green bacteria whose oxygen-releasing metabolism led to their own downfall and to the advent of those oxygen-using cells we are composed of?<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c8093714124637552078 title="comment permalink">6/23/13, 1:29 AM</a><br><br>

The repetition of key phrases and words, the tenor and cadence, and the gesture and movements of the body wrapped snugly in austere grey. It was also the grand setting [I spent some time in the Nuremberg stadium before it was razed - an arena both chilling and powerful].<br><br>It was the graphics and the brass band and thousands of uniformed marchers. It was about Wagner and his Teutonic pantheon. Hitler was reported to have said, "understand Wagner and you will understand National Socialism."<br><br>Nazism was never really a political movement; I'm not aware of a Nazi Manifesto as such. It was pure aesthetics, and it was brilliantly executed. Remember, Hitler's background was art - not politics. Like all artists, he knew the power of pattern recognition within the human psyche. Strong patterns foster cohesive groups. He screamed, "Ein Wille, Ein Volk, Ein Fuhrer"<br><br>Looking back, we can see that most great leaders were performance artists. Jesus was an exception. He wasn't particularly popular during his lifetime; he was too much the minimalist egghead. But after his death the literary boys stepped in, and his influence soared! Luke's biographical novel and John's Greek tragedy were masterworks. And the writing skills and marketing genius of Saul of Tarsus helped embed the Jesus saga into the Roman world forever.<br><br>Though Jesus and Hitler were quite different in most respects, they agreed on one critical point - the gullibility of the masses. ...<br><br>Hitler: "Tell the people the biggest lie; they will believe the big lie over the small one."<br><br>Jesus: "The people swallow a camel but choke on a gnat."<br><br><br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c2959389727573059354 title="comment permalink">6/25/13, 2:43 PM</a><br><br>

But I was trying to follow your stated directive:<br><br>"Thus I’d like to suggest that from now on, any claim about the future needs to be confronted up front by the two hard questions proposed above. What happened at other times when people made the same prediction, or one that’s closely akin to it? What happened in other situations that are comparable to the one the prediction attempts to address?"<br><br>In the past, people have suggested that the horror of war had made WW1, the "War to End All Wars" and yet the next war was much, much worse. And in comparable situations, empires with world wide logistical capabilities, there were world wars in which all the weapons at hand were used.<br><br>Your arguments to the contrary are plausible, but do not fit the (limited) historical pattern. It should be noted that there are enough nuclear weapons on hand that the war need not start as some combination of direct U.S., Russia, or China conflict as the starting point. A major power nuking an ally of a major power (Israel, India, Pakistan, N. Korea, Japan, etc.) would be sufficient to get the ball rolling.<br><br><a href=a-question-of-values.html#c7140481633779997485 title="comment permalink">7/14/13, 5:55 PM</a><br><br>
