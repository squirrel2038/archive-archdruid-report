<div dir=ltr style="text-align: left">
When you think about it, it’s really rather odd that so many people nowadays should be so hostile to the suggestion that history moves in circles. Central to the rhetoric that celebrates industrial civilization’s supposed triumph over the ignorant and superstitious past is the notion that our beliefs about the world are founded on experience and tested against hard facts. Since the cyclic theory of history gave Oswald Spengler the basis for accurate predictions about the future—predictions, mind you, that contradicted<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the conventional wisdom of his time and ours, and proved to be correct anyway—wouldn’t it be more reasonable to consider the suggestion that his theory applies to our civilization too?
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Reasonable or not, of course, that’s not what generally happens. Suggest that industrial civilization is following the same arc of rise and fall as all previous civilizations have done, and shows every sign of completing the rest of that trajectory in due time, and outside of a few circles of intellectual heretics on the fringes of contemporary culture, what you’ll get in the way of response is an angry insistence that it just ain’t so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The overfamiliar claim that this time it really is different, that modern industrial civilization will either keep soaring ever higher on the way to some glorious destiny or plunge overnight into some unparalleled catastrophe, is wedged so tightly into the collective imagination of our age that not even repeated failure seems to be able to break it loose. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That last comment is anything but hyperbole; the repeated failures have happened, and are happening, without having the least effect on the claims just mentioned. Glance back over the last half century or so, to start with, and notice just how many prophecies of progress and apocalypse have ended up in history’s wastebasket.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From cities in orbit and regular flights to the Moon, through fusion power and household robots who can cook your dinner and do your laundry for you, to the conquest of poverty, disease, and death itself, how many supposedly inevitable advances have been proclaimed as imminent by scientists and the media, only to end up in history’s wastebasket when it turned out that they couldn’t be done after all? Of all the dozens of great leaps forward that were being announced so confidently in my youth, only a few—notably the computer revolution—actually happened, and even there the gap between what was predicted and what we got remains vast. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s indicative that the humor magazine <i>The Onion</i>, which makes its money by saying the things nobody else in American life is willing to say, ran <a href=http://www.theonion.com/articles/nation-starting-to-realize-new-era-of-american-inn,32156/ >an edgy piece a few months back</a> announcing that Americans had begun to grasp that the shiny new era of progress and innovation promised so many times was never actually going to happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No doubt sometime soon they’ll run a similar story about the claims of imminent cataclysm that fill the same role on the other side of the spectrum of industrial society’s folk beliefs about the future. Year after weary year, the same grandiose visions of destiny and disaster get dusted off for one more showing,; they resemble nothing so much as a rerun of a television show that originally aired when your grandparents were on their first date, and yet audiences across the industrial world sit there and do their best to forget that they’ve watched the same show so often they could close their eyes and plug their ears and still recall every tawdry detail. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, over the same half century or so, a very different story has been unfolding here in America and, to a significant extent, elsewhere in the industrial world. Cheap, easily accessible deposits of the resources on which industrial civilization depends have been exhausted, and replaced with increasing difficulty by more expensive substitutes, at steadily rising costs in money, labor, energy, and other resources; the national infrastructure and the natural environment have both been drawn into an accelerating spiral of malign neglect; standards of living for most of the population have been sliding steadily, along with most measures of public health and meaningful education; constitutional rights and the rule of law have taken a beating, administered with equal enthusiasm by both major parties, who seem incapable of agreeing on anything else even when the welfare of the nation is obviously at stake. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In other words, while one set of true believers has been waiting hopefully for the arrival of a bright new golden age of scientific and technological progress, and another set of true believers has been waiting just as hopefully for the arrival of the vast catastrophe that will prove to their satisfaction just how wrong everyone else was, history ignored them both and brought what it usually brings at this season of a civilization’s life: that is to say, decline.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even so, our collective fixation on those two failed narratives shows few signs of slipping. It’s uncomfortably easy to imagine an America a century from now,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in fact, in which half the sharply reduced population lives in squalid shantytowns without electricity or running water, tuberculosis and bacterial infections are the leading causes of death, cars and computers are luxury goods assembled from old parts and reserved for the obscenely rich, and space travel is a distant memory—and in which one set of true believers still insists that the great leap upward into a golden age of progress will get going any day now, another set insists just as passionately that some immense cataclysm is about to kill us all, and only a few intellectual heretics on the fringes of society are willing to talk about the hard facts of ongoing decline or the destination toward which that decline is pretty obviously headed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s no shortage of irony here, because modern industrial culture’s fixation on fantasies of progress and apocalypse and its irritable rejection of any other possibilities have contributed mightily to the process of decline that both sets of fantasies reject out of hand. Since the early 1980s, when the industrial world turned its back on the hopes of the previous decade and slammed the door on its best chance of a smooth transition to sustainability, every attempt to bring up the limits to growth or propose a useful response to the impending mess has been assailed by partisans of both fantasies; the rhetoric of progress—"I’m sure they’ll come up with something," "There are no limits to the power of technology," and so on—has been precisely balanced by the rhetoric of apocalypse—"Jesus will come soon so we don’t have to worry about that," "It’s too late to save humanity from inevitable extinction," and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thirty years on, the breakthroughs have proven just as elusive as the catastrophes, but the rhetoric still plods onward. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Behind both sides of that rhetoric, I’ve come to believe, is a habit of thought that’s deeply ingrained in contemporary consciousness—the habit, mentioned toward the end of last week’s post, of postulating an imaginary "real world" that contains some set of desirable features the actual world lacks, and then condemning the actual world for its failure to measure up to the imaginary one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Few corners of modern have escaped that habit of thinking, and fewer still have avoided being harmed by it.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Take politics, which used to be the process of finding acceptable compromises among the competing needs and wants of members of a community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These days that process has been all but swamped by supporters of an assortment of fictive worlds—consider the heavily fictionalized pre-1960s America that features so heavily in Christian fundamentalist rhetoric, in which Christian faith was universal, happy families all prayed together on Sunday mornings, and gays, atheists, and other deviant types were safely quarantined in New York City, for example, or for that matter the assorted utopias of political correctness to be found on the other end of the political spectrum. People who are struggling to make the actual world conform to some imaginary one are rarely prepared to accept the compromises, the negotiations, and the quest for common ground that make for functional politics, and the result is the stalemate between entrenched factions that pervades politics on nearly all levels today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
From public health to personal ethics, from dietary choices to the management of the economy, the words are different but they’re all sung to the same old tune.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Abstract theories about how the world ought to work are treated as descriptions of how the world actually works, and heaven help you if you suggest that the theories might be judged by comparing them to the facts on the ground. All the usual contortions of cognitive dissonance then come into play when, as so often happens, measures that are supposed to improve public health make it worse, moral stances intended to improve the world cause more harm than good, diets that are supposed to make people healthy actually make them sick, economic programs proclaimed as the key to lasting prosperity run one economy after another straight into the ground, and so on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s the alternative? Simply put, it involves setting aside our own desires, preferences, and sense of entitlement, and paying attention to the way things actually happen in the world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s important not to overthink what’s being said here. Philosophers since ancient times have pointed out, and quite rightly, that human beings have no access to absolute truth; the world as we experience it comes into being out of the interaction between the "buzzing, blooming confusion" of raw sensory data and the structures of the individual consciousness. Whatever its relevance to the deeper questions of philosophy, a subject I don’t propose to address here, the world as we experience it is as close as we need to get to reality to apply the proposal I’ve just made. In the world as we experience it, some things happen reliably, other things happen unpredictably, and still other things never seem to get around to happening at all—and it’s not hard, even across cultural and linguistic barriers, to find common ground concerning which things belong in which of these categories. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That quest for common ground among the vagaries of individual experience is among other things the basis of modern science. The theory of gravitation is an elegant mathematical way of summing up the fact<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>that billions of individual human beings have had the experience of watching something fall, and each one of those experiences had important features in common with all the others, as well as with such apparently unconnected things as the apparent movements of the Sun in the sky. The kind of knowledge found in the theory of gravitation, and the whole range of other scientific theories, is not absolute truth; it’s always at least a little tentative, subject to constant testing and reformulation as more data comes in, but it was good enough to put human bootprints on the Moon, and it was gained by setting aside narratives that played on the preferences of the individual and collective ego, in order to listen to what Nature herself was saying. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Suggest that this attentiveness to what actually happens is a good idea when dealing with falling rocks, and you’ll get little debate. It’s when you suggest that the same approach might be usefully applied to falling civilizations that the arguments spring up, but the principle is the same in both cases. Over the last five thousand years or so, scores of societies have risen and fallen, and their trajectories through time, like those of falling rocks, have had important features in common.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It’s easy to insist that because contemporary industrial society differs from these other societies in various ways, those common features have nothing to say to our future, but what follows this claim? Inevitably, it’s yet another weary rehash of the familiar, failed narratives of perpetual progress and imminent apocalypse. If the present case really is unprecedented, wouldn’t it make more sense either to suggest some equally unprecedented model for the future, or simply to shrug and admit that nobody knows what will happen? Both these responses would make more sense than trotting out what amounts to scraps of medieval theology that have been dolled up repeatedly in pseudosecular drag since the market for religious prophecy turned south in the eighteenth century.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d like to suggest that it’s high time for both narratives to be put out to pasture. No, I’ll go further than that. I’d like to suggest that it’s high time for all our stories about the world and ourselves to be tested against the yardstick of what actually happens, and chucked if they can’t meet that test.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What I’m suggesting here needs to be understood with a certain amount of care. Knowledge about the world takes two broad forms, and the connection between them is rather like the connection between a pile of bricks and lumber, on the one hand, and the house that will be built out of the bricks and lumber, on the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first form of knowledge is history in the broadest sense of the world—a sense that includes what used to be called "natural history," the careful collection of observed facts about the world of nature. Before Isaac Newton could sit down in his Cambridge study and work out the theory of gravitation, hundreds of other investigators had to note down their own observations about how things fall, and tens of thousands of astronomers down the centuries had to look up into the sky and notice where the little moving lights they called "wanderers"—<i>planetoi</i> in Greek—had turned up that night. That was the gathering of the bricks and the milling of the lumber that would eventually be used to build the elegant structure of Newton’s gravitational theory. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Long before Newton got to work, though, his brick-hauling and lumber-gathering predecessors had picked up quite a bit of relevant knowledge about how rocks fall, how planets move, and a range of similar things, and could explain in quite some detail what these things did and didn’t do. The theoretical models they used to explain these regularities of behavior weren’t always that useful—I’m thinking here especially of those medieval mystics who were convinced that rocks were head over heels in love with the Earth, and would fling themselves in the direction of their beloved whenever other forces didn’t prevent them from doing so—but the regularities themselves were well understood. That’s the kind of knowledge that comes from a close study of history. Once enough historical data has been gathered, that empirical knowledge can often be summarized and replaced by a coherent theory, but that’s not always possible; if the subject is complex enough, the number of examples is small enough, or both, a meaningful theory may remain out of reach. In that case, though, the empirical knowledge is well worth having, since it’s the only real knowledge you have to go on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The trajectory of human civilizations over time is an immensely complex subject, and the scores of societies that have risen and fallen during recorded history still forms a small enough data set that strict theoretical models may be premature. That leaves the empirical knowledge gathered from history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s impossible to prove from that knowledge that the same patterns will continue to happen, just as it was impossible for one of the medieval mystics I mentioned to disprove the claim that now and then a rock might have a lover’s quarrel with the Earth and fall straight up into the sky to get away from her. Still, when known patterns are already at work in a given society, it’s reasonable to accept that they’re likely to continue to their normal end, and when a given theory about the future has failed every time it’s been proposed, it’s just as reasonable to dismiss it from consideration and look for alternatives that work better in practice. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is what I’d like to ask my readers to do. Each of us carries around an assortment of narratives about what the future might be like, most of them derived from one or another corner of popular culture or from various older traditions and writings. Each of us uses those narratives, consciously or otherwise, as templates into which scraps of information about the future are fitted, and very often this is done without paying attention to what history has to say about the narratives themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead, I’d like to suggest that it’s worth taking a hard look at those narratives whenever they surface, and checking them against the evidence of history. Has anything like this happened before, and if so, what results followed? Has anyone ever believed something like this before, and if so, how did that belief work out in practice? These are the kinds of questions I encourage my readers to ask. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m aware that this is a heavy burden—much heavier than it may seem at first glance, because it involves discarding some of our most cherished cultural narratives, including those that have become central to a great many modern religious traditions. Those of my Christian readers who believe that their scriptures predict a total overturning of the order of history in the near future may feel that burden more sharply than most. To them, I would point out that the belief in an imminent and literal apocalypse is only one of several ways that devout Christians have interpreted the scriptures. A great many believers in Christ have seen his words on the Mount of Olives as a prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 AD, and the Book of Revelations as a prophecy—put in symbolic terms to get past Roman censors—of the impending decline and fall of the Roman Empire: both events, it bears noting, having far more immediate importance to their audiences than, say, a cataclysm in the distant twenty-first century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>My Jewish readers will have to fill me in about the range of accepted<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>interpretations of the prophecies concerning the Messianic kingdom—it’s not a subject I know much about—but I’d be very surprised, given the ebullient nature of rabbinic debate, if there weren’t plenty of options as well, including some that don’t require history to be stood on its head. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
My atheist readers will have an easier time of it in one sense but, in at least some cases, as hard a time in others. To believe that the universe is mere matter and energy without purpose or consciousness, that humanity is simply one more biological species to which evolution has granted a few unusual gifts, and that nobody is peering anxiously down from the sky to observe our species’ foibles and bail it out from its mistakes, might seem to offer few obstacles to the sort of realism I’m proposing. Still, I’ve met an embarrassingly large number of atheists who accord humanity the same privileged status and glorious destiny that prophetic religions claim for their believers. It might seem odd to portray humanity as the Chosen Species while denying that there’s anybody to do the choosing, but such is the nature of the return of the repressed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To those of my atheist readers who indulge in such imaginings, I would encourage attention to the presuppositions of their own beliefs, and a particularly close study of past claims of progress and apocalypse that didn’t happen to include a god as one of the stage properties. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To those of my readers who share my Druid faith, or any of the other movements in today’s inchoate but lively field of nature-centered spirituality, I hope I may speak even more frankly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>For those who recognize the ways of Nature as a revelation of the powers that create and sustain the cosmos, as Druidry does, the notion that the world will abandon her normal ways and jump through hoops like a trained seal to satisfy our sense of entitlement or our craving for revenge is really pretty absurd. To study nature from a Druid perspective is to learn that that limitation is the first law of existence, that what looks like a straight line to us is merely part of a circle too large to see at a single glance, that every movement generates and is balanced by a corresponding countermovement, that what systems theory calls negative feedback and an older way of thought calls the Royal Secret of equilibrium governs all things and all beings, with or without their conscious cooperation. In such a cosmos—and all things considered, a strong case can be made that this is the kind of cosmos we live in—there’s no room for the paired fantasies of perpetual progress and imminent apocalypse, except as exhibits in a display of the odd things human beings talk themselves into believing from time to time. </div>

I hope that at least some of my readers will be willing to attempt that task, though, because it’s far less abstract than it might seem at first; it has practical applications that bear directly on the hard work of preparing for the difficult future ahead. We’ll discuss that next week. </span></div>

The vicissitudes of life and history would mean being overly attached to anything is unwise as it just leads to suffering.<br><br>And that leads to the logical outcome of such a perspective. If you don't want to suffer (the whole point of Buddhism is to discern the causes of suffering and eliminate them), don't be attached to impermanent things.

Radios and telegraphs change command structures, its easier for a central power to know what's going on for example. Sailing has been improved dramatically to allow global travel. The metric system has completely rewritten the rules for measurement and how it effects society. The water turbine was perfected in the 20th century and vertical windmills have seen dramatic improvements (see low-tech magazine). <br><br>And so on, there are many more examples. Some have large effects, some small and a fair few counteract each over.<br><br>Then there's how history affects these changes. Our societies still have roots from a sword wielding feudal age, the roots from a gun wielding feudal age will be different. At the moment we have a global civilization, but later on their will be multiple civilizations that aren't isolated (due to sailings improvements). And then theirs the fact that our current status is largely shaped by Europe's temporary military, technological and economic superiority, later on that sort of global imbalance won't exist. <br><br>A lot of these things only matter in the details, some don't.

Although I would add a further dimension to that and say that natural cycles never start and end at the same point but rather more resemble the turns of a spiral as we manoeuvre (or at least appear to do) our way through time. I'm not sure if you have mentioned that before but you may have done. So we could say that our doings and beings, rather than being cyclic, are more spirallic. Is that a word?<br><br>One further point if I may, at the risk of being misunderstood as someone who doesn't get what you are saying, when I am actually quite in agreement with you on these things. The point concerns the difference between the terms decline, collapse and catastrophe, some or all of which are dear to, I suspect, a great many of your readers including myself. <br><br>Say we define the cycle of civilisations as having three phases forming a continuum of growth-peak-decline. If that is a valid assessment then there are a range of possible viewpoints that members of the society could take at certain points in the process.<br><br>At the start of a civilisation for example, the sky is the limit. There is no telling, at least in the minds of those participating, as to how far they can go in terms of growth. However, the further along the curve you go towards the peak point, at which stage the society is directionally flatlining and nothing is very clear to the members as to which way things are going to go next, the less likely it is that that paradigm still holds. It may still appear valid of course to some, through grim determination even after the peak, in the face of ample evidence to the contrary. <br><br>Throughout this rising part of the process, only those members who hold beliefs in the seemingly impossible would adhere to an apocalyptic point of view.<br><br>The roles are reversed during the downward (decline) phase. <br><br>My point is that decline, collapse, catastrophe (note that I do not include apocalypse) are all downward trends, the only real difference (possibly) being the length of time between the start (peak) and end points and also the rate of downward trend which is functionally linked to the height of the peak.<br><br>Can we not agree, for my sake and I am sure for numerous other of your readers, that when we talk of cyclic progressions that the actual shape of the rise and fall curve for civilisations could be anything other than a half circle but more resembling a bell curve whether unskewed or skewed to either left or right? In which case there could be cases where the terms decline, collapse, catastrophe might legitimately appear interchangeable, could there not? <br><br>I know that this is some way removed from your valid concerns around the two prevalent extreme belief systems that you are discussing but it might serve to placate or align our views even further.<br><br>Incidentally, I have read your The Long Descent but it was a while ago. I may have to revisit to see if you have discussed such thoughts there already.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c6374559101012001670 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 2:09 AM</a><br><br>

So, for example, when I'm out in the garden dealing with pests and problems I tend to be more practical and respond to reality as it is, versus reading about various theories of garden pest control on the Internet. So a bias for working with physical reality is key, and this has obviously taken a bit of a beating in the Internet age. <br><br>I think I'm through with the progress vs apocalypse habit now. My belief in progress went first, institution by institution. After that I did spend a year or so in the church of doom. But I've been back in a more measured equilibrium for a while now, accepting that we're all going to be walking a hard road down, with many bumps along the way. I tend to want to do practical, productive things in difficult times as a coping mechanism, so that can help some. <br><br>One thing I continue to hold on to, though, are perhaps sentimental ideas that might make the hard road a little easier to bear. For example, the possibility that people, once they have "woken up" could actually be easier to deal with/more practical/more realistic/even more loving (rather than panicking and going off the rails). One side of me knows that a lot of acting up and craziness is going to flow from all this, and I will have to take situations and people one at a time. But I still find myself wanting to focus more on the potential positive behaviors of people once they have become more conscious of our reality. <br><br>Would be interested in your thoughts on the proper relationship between discernment of reality, moment by moment, versus a bias for positive thinking as an overall mental framework?<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c7357802309452173780 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 3:52 AM</a><br><br>

This applies not merely to questions of value, but even to questions of truth, as the following quote shows: <br><br>"Philosophers since ancient times have pointed out, and quite rightly, that human beings have no access to absolute truth."<br><br>That is certainly the case with regard to SOME ancient philosophers - the Sophist Protagoras, for example - but it is most definitely not true of all. Just for starters, none of the three most famous philosophers of antiquity - Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle - were relativists. On the contrary, the first two of these three figures are best-known for their staunch anti-relativism, both concerning value and truth. <br><br>The fundamental problem with all forms of relativism is their self-refuting character. When it is asserted, for example, that "Human beings have no access to absolute truth," that assertion is itself meaningful only if advanced as an absolute truth claim. The meaningfulness of the claim thus presupposes the very state of affairs it denies. To deny the existence of any and all absolute truth is to advance a claim that is itself an absolute truth, if true in any meaningful sense. <br><br>If, on the contrary, one wishes to assert this claim in a manner that lays no claim to the status of an absolute truth, then why assert it in the first place? In thus advancing the claim in a relativistic rather than an absolute sense, one is granting that none of one’s interlocutors is objectively obliged to assent to it. (I.e. “It is true FOR ME that human beings have no access to absolute truth, but that does not necessarily make it true FOR YOU.”) <br><br>But then why advance the claim in the first place, except as a debating trick to catch one’s interlocutor’s unawares in their naïve adherence to objectivism in matters of truth? That is, in fact, the very purpose of propositional language: To advance absolute truth claims, in the underlying conviction that the private beliefs thus express objectively warrant assent by others as well.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c7938600778682118785 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 5:07 AM</a><br><br>

Right on the mark. Of course some of the categories are not mutually exclusive. Depending on definitions one can be an atheist and adhere to the Druid position.

I have an objection!<br><br>The success of material science, indeed, comes from "setting aside narratives that played on the preferences of the individual and collective ego". And sure, anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism gave us shoddy or even foolish conceptions of how Nature works. But why did we have anthropocentrism in the first place? Why do human beings generally attribute personality and motive to natural forces, until they are informed otherwise?<br><br>The philosophical reasons for this run deep, but I propose that basically, it is good to live in a world that it is itself living. The ancient pagans saw life absolutely everywhere; life in every corner of Nature, regardless of whether they could see it or not. Here's a memorable passage from "The Ancient City":<br><br><i>[The Roman] leaves his house, and can hardly take a step without meeting some sacred object — either a chapel, or a place formerly struck by lightning, or a tomb; sometimes he must step back and pronounce a prayer; sometimes he must turn his eyes and cover his face, to avoid the sight of some ill-boding object. ... He never leaves his own house without looking to see if any bird of bad augury appears. There are words which he dares not pronounce for his life. </i><br><br>The early Christians and Epicureans were right to label this behavior as "superstition". They understood that Nature is not literally full of human-like beings that feel scorned and slighted if you fail to pay them respect. But the Christians won out over the Epicureans, because they still saw some life in this old world. Not everything necessarily adhered to mechanical laws; there was still room for miracles, and believing this, they performed a great number of miracles which visitors to Europe still marvel at today.<br><br>Observing Nature "objectively", we see gravity, chemistry, and other mechanical laws that are neither good nor bad. They are plain dead. Yet the world contains both good and bad; it contains life. Therefore, this "egoless", "objective" attempt to view the world without any personal interests at all, like a ghost staring from an Archimedean point, must end somewhere. The world must have principles that have nothing to do with mechanics. The only alternative, a clockwork world, is a world that is entirely dead, through which the dead wander meaninglessly, that is to say, Hell. <br><br>Religion, including the "Royal Secret", cannot be built on physical or historical laws. The "Divine Law" is of a completely different character from physical laws, and if systems theory tries to draw an analogy between the two, it is to nobody's benefit.<br><br>We must start by leaving the Archimedean point behind. This is the paradox at the heart of your historical project: what you are trying to outline, by asking people to work from objective historical parallels rather than personal principles, is a rough attempt at science, but nowhere does science actually give us impetus to do things. That impetus comes from our own, personal principles, which <i>must</i> stand above and beyond historical and scientific developments. Science, history, and other technics are only tools towards reaching our goals.<br><br>In fact, if what we are trying to work towards here is a long-term sustainable worldview that will survive centuries of decline while maintaining the courage to cast off the burdensome delusions of both progress and apocalypse, I think we must leave Spengler behind, despite his unquestionable brilliance. Where he buried historical teleology and all other Faustian technics, at the foot of his Second Religiousness, is where we begin, standing at the shores of an unknown ocean.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c5550736385371734181 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 7:26 AM</a><br><br>

I recently picked up an abridged (sigh) copy of Toynbee's "Study of History." I'm most of the way though it, and am reading the section about the disintegration of civilizations now. While Toynbee seems to be a pretty perceptive historian, he largely discounts the notion that Western Civilization is disintegrating. I understand that he published "Study" in the late 1940s, so he 'missed out on' the last 60 years or so of history, but it seems to me that a lost of the symptoms of disintegration he describes are happening here and now. What are you thoughts on Toynbee's theory? Do you find it interesting in an academic way, or do you think his study has useful things to say about our current predicament?<br>Alas, the local library did not have a copy of Spengler, abridged or otherwise...<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c6883625402622830884 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 8:09 AM</a><br><br>

I did so because I failed to find your e-mail address.<br><br>What I would like to say is that I found your blog two weeks ago. I could not stop reading your entries from the first to the most recent, usually up to until late at night. At first, I focused on the entries about more technical subjects, such as your theory on catabolic collapse. Afterwards, I moved to the more politically related ones, such as those concerning the imminent demise of the American Empire. Later, I turned to the fictions, such as 2050-2100-2150. Finally, I read your posts concerning the nature of magic.<br><br>Your thoughts changed my way of looking at the world. Although I have to admit I was already suffering a kind of unease, feeling that something was wrong with my worldview, the specifics of it were unknown to me and for years I failed to clarify them, having studied many different analysis of the current state of our civilization and society. I am not saying that all my doubts and questions have been answered, far from it, but something new entered my mind, thanks to you: I am aware of the fact that our civilization will soon suffer the effects of Peak Oil, and, to make sense of many social illnesses and phenomenons, I will have to take that into account.<br><br>There is also more to it than that. On a even more personal level, being aware of Peak Oil has changed a few things. I am not aware of how many things, and neither of how much did changed. I will tell you this: suddenly, I no longer like cars. Mind you, I learn to read by making efforts to read by myself a car magazine when I was five, because my father was too tired already of reading it all to me. The first thing I did when I turned eighteen was to go get my drivers license. I once told one of the few non-drivers I know, a professor of mine, that one of the reasons I loved to drive was that I really enjoyed the feeling of having a few hundred horsepower under my control. I used to drive fourteen hours a week without feeling tired, just for the thrill of it. And now I no longer enjoy cars. I might just sell mine. <br><br>Secondly, I have started thinking about changing careers while I still can, from a corporate job to something else healthcare related (I believe healthcare is vey resilient to crysis. I would like to hear your thoughts on this, though).<br><br>My apologies for the long e-mail. And further apologies for any grammatical or syntax errors I might have committed - English is not my native language (I am Brazilian).<br><br>Kind regards,<br>Jose Coces<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c541796627005315927 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 8:31 AM</a><br><br>

They gradually entrusted the role of defending the Empire to barbarian mercenaries who eventually turned on them. Gibbon held that Christianity contributed to this shift by making the populace less interested in the worldly here-and-now because it was willing to wait for the rewards of heaven."<br><br>* Trading of civic virtue for personal comfort<br>* National defense entrusted to third parties with dubious motives, no effective supervision over such parties<br>* Populace unable to recognize societal decline due to wishful thinking<br><br>Philip K. Dick posited in "VALIS" that the Roman Empire had never ended, but that instead the two times, 2nd century Rome and 20th century USA, existed simultaneously as different representations of a single essentially violent archetypal matrix which he called the Black Iron Prison. A program is defined as a sequence of instructions, written to perform a specified task. The task to be completed by the world program is to ceaselessly order the events and phenomena which comprise a civilization into a sequence of birth, maturity and ultimate destruction. To break out of the destructive program or at least cause it to relax its grip on us, the Gnostics implored people to "recognize what is in front of their faces", i.e. deal with reality. For that, the Gnostics were killed off and their legacy almost destroyed. So must we assume, based on historical precedent, that the same is in store for those who now openly call for a way of life less invested in imaginary realities? And more importantly, is there no way to truly break the cycle of violence?<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c3709548000129227972 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 8:51 AM</a><br><br>

However, I think it also important to be aware that people who wrote that history believed in narratives of their own, coloring the accounts of the events they were recording. Perhaps one way to compensate for that bias is to separate the statement of fairly basic facts from interpretation. There will always be a signal from the past to listen but the noise present in each will vary according to the transmitter and the receiver.

Here is a corrected version.<br><br>Some thoughts on the use of the term cycles, in physics and engineering a cyclical signal is a periodic signal with a duration time longer than one signal period. That is the minimum time duration is one signal period say going from a minimum to a maximum back to a minimum. It seems that population dynamics can be periodic but are often also modeled or approximated by a function with a single global maximum. Our modern industrial civilization has grown by about 6 billion people in the last 200 years (~600% growth). Assuming we are near the peak one assumption is that the decline will occur over a similar time scale that is 6 billion people over the next 200 years or an average decline rate of 30 million per year. That seems staggering to me even if it is not NTE. Global climate change may break the symmetry in that curve and increase the decline rate. It may not be NTE as some people describe but it is sobering. Of course some other factors could cause the decline to be much slower, nobody really can predict the future. Another thought is that we are using up fossil fuels which is irreversible. This suggests that out population dynamics cannot be periodic in the strict sense although future variations in human population are inevitable.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c9090859398809452050 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 10:25 AM</a><br><br>

I've often thought that of that as the perfect image of the future: Sure, most people will be "impoverished" materially, as the Massai herdsman is. But they'll have access to fragments of industrial technology, and they'll be able to create or re-create traditional social structures. So it won't be so bad, after all.<br><br>I think there's something to that, but considering your challenge in this post, two things occur to me:<br><br>1. That picture was not an image of the future, but of the present. I mean this literally of course-- the picture was taken at some point during the first decade of the twenty-first century. But more than that, it may be that this decade represents the high watermark of the global technological system which connected the African tribesman to the American college student. The following decades may look very different.<br><br>2. I had thought of this image as my version of a hard-nosed, realistic version of the future. Yes, we'll all be materially "poor," but we'll have access to two things that will allow us to live in relative comfort-- modern technology (the cellphone) and traditional communities (the tribe). It occurs to me that there's nothing hard nosed or realistic about this vision-- It's actually my personal version of utopia! Certain periods of my life have resembled that vision rather closely (or as close as a white North American can get); now I've strayed from the course quite a bit, and I'm not happy about it. So I have to ask myself-- To what extent what I latching onto the idea of the technologically connected tribesman as something the Future was obligated to give me as a way to keep from doing the hard work myself?<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c3970988262545563020 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 10:26 AM</a><br><br>

What does it indicate?<br><br>I am 57. I live in British Columbia, Canada. When I was in high school I had a friend whose Dad was an appliance dept. manager of a local department store. The mom stayed home to run the house...and yes, they had a bought and paid for home. Flash forward to today and that same Dad would be making minumum wage (or close to it) and would be paid for 32 hours per week to remain part-time, but would probably work more uncompensated hours than what officially was recorded. They would rent rather than own, etc. <br><br>I could go on about the salmon decline, the loss of old-growth temperate forests, the shutting down of all sawmills and most pulp mills, the growing population and crowded recreation sites, but everyone knows this story. I do know people have more stuff, more electronics, and it is poorly made with temporary applications. All things are way too complicated, lifestyles are hectic, and satisfaction has declined. Real opportunities have been replaced with consumer goods and in most ways families are poorer than they were just 40 years ago. But they do have more 'stuff', and debt, and this disguises the real decline.<br><br>If I were to gaze into the future based on what I have experienced I would say a few will be wealthier, but most will be poorer. Food and clothing quality will continue to decline. Fewer people will actually own their homes outright and many will not be able to afford heat or cooling as the seasons change. People will be dumber as they read less and watch screens more, (video games and sports), schools will be for credentials and teachers will continue to be bashed/scapegoated when educational expectations and opportunities aren't fulfilled or line up with opportunity. There will be lots of blame.<br><br>Spiritual hunger will increase as people search for meaning and community. Politicians will continue to lie/mislead and ask for trust. Wars will be fought to promote the agendas of those who influence the Empire. The financial system will increase its corruption and influence in all things until one day it finally collapses and there is no more blood to be squeezed out of the middle and working class.<br><br>As to how people will react to these circumstances, I have no idea. Apparently, people don't mind being under surveillance and accept their loss of liberty is for their own good. No corrupt bankster has yet to be jailed or left unsupported by the politicians they own.

Whatever its relevance to the deeper questions of philosophy, a subject I don’t propose to address here, the world as we experience it is as close as we need to get to reality to apply the proposal I’ve just made. In the world as we experience it, some things happen reliably, other things happen unpredictably, and still other things never seem to get around to happening at all—and it’s not hard, even across cultural and linguistic barriers, to find common ground concerning which things belong in which of these categories."<br><br>I am chastised!<br><br>Anyway, I have a question for anyone who will answer. In European history, we see a civilization reduced to extinction by its decline &amp; fall. The Classical world was completely replaced by Western Christendom (in the west &amp; north) and by Islam (in the east &amp; south). While both have inherited a great deal from the Classical world, it seems absurd to call any part of either a <i>continuation</i> of it.<br><br>On the other hand, in ancient Egypt, in China, and in Persia, it looks (to my amateur eyes) like the cyclical nature of history works on a less culturally devastating scale. Ancient Egypt saw countless cycles of rise and fall through its multi-millenial history, as has China, and it looks (again, to my amateur eyes) like even Islamic culture in Iran didn't completely replace the older traditions, the way that Christianity did in, say, Italy.<br><br>Why is this the case? And which model seems likelier for modern Western/Industrial civilization? Some hypotheses:<br><br>• China and Egypt featured less of the tremendous <i>völkewanderung</i> that coincided with the fall of Rome. This allowed for a stability of populations and ethnic groups that work(ed/s) in favor of cultural continuity. Is the same true of Persia/Iran? I don't know. It certainly has a long history of conquering invaders from the steppes, deserts, and mountains to the north, from the Parthians to Tamurlane. Hm...<br><br>• Stability of resources. Egypt was dependent on the clockwork-regular flooding of the Nile for its survival; the core of China has a moist-temperate climate like the eastern U.S. where the rains never <i>completely</i> fail. Rome was centered on the Mediterranean, with a more arid climate, and with many steep hills and mountains where erosion is inevitable. Persia/Iran seems to be an outlier again. The Iranian plateau is even more arid than the Mediterranean, and equally mountainous. Are all my theories junk, or does Persian history feature less stability than my layman's view would indicate?<br><br>• Yeah, that's all I got off the top of my head.

Lerwill</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>I think I like the label of “intellectual heretic”, it has a nice ring to it. We choose to think outside the box.<br><br>There is a serious amount of cognitive dissonance between the real world and the realms in which people think they live, how can we expect otherwise? Milk comes from plastic cartons, not cows. Fruit and vegetables are in season 365 days a year, rather than a reflection of the cycles of nature. To travel halfway around the planet means being mildly inconvenienced for a day, not a month or more. We pay landscapers to cart away our lawn clippings, and then purchase fertilizers for the plants that suffer in the nutrient-deprived soils. We pump so much smog into our air that being able to see the mountains a few tens of miles away is a pleasant experience; one that causes an intake of breath –not from the majesty of nature –but because we know that if we can see the mountains, a lungful of air hurts a lot less.<br><br>Add to that the difficulty the world faces in living up to the Hollywood dreams we are fed on, day after day, where “progress” is represented by the lives of the rich and famous. What incentive is there to look away from the TV and see the world for what it is, a place we’re not getting out of alive and probably with some suffering between here and there. <br><br>Where we work we have the myth of infinite progress, even though the evidence points to slow, grinding decline. Of course, there’s a digital product on the horizon that will rescue us from reducing revenues, save our customers going out of business, and allow our communities to return to the model of infinite growth that fuels many people’s dreams – and nightmares of a few intellectual heretics. Meanwhile, all the important numbers drop consistently and we figure ways of re-tasking things to be more efficient – a catabolic collapse playing out one day, one contract cancellation, one pink slip at a time. <br><br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c7582883069251837211 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 1:01 PM</a><br><br>

Similarly there is a school of Christian theology which reads the "Kingdom of God is at hand" as meaning that the state of blessedness is right here, right now, within our grasp, in our own hearts -- not that it is some radical historical rift which is about to happen, transforming the outward world.<br><br>So even within the traditions we associate with the Messianic and Apocalyptic narratives, there is a dissenting interpretation which rejects violent change-of-state predictions and interprets the mythos instead as a guide to inner transformation.<br><br>There are rabbis who will tell you that we are waiting for the Messiah to come, not as some dramatic historical figure, but into our own hearts, transforming each of us into the Messiah.<br><br>Anyway, just a couple more illustrations that decouple the mythos of linear history ending in a Great Transformation from any particular creed; as JMG and others have pointed out, the apocalyptic narrative (whether it be doomy or heavenly) transcends particular faiths. Devoutly atheistical Communists can believe in linear Progress to a state of bliss just as fiercely as dogmatic Dominionists; but devout Christians and Jews can also reject the linear-Progress-to-happy/dismal-ending story.<br><br>Octavia Butler, iirc, in one or more of her novels posited a future post-lapsarian culture in which a new religion had emerged which worshipped the principle of Change. Not change for the better, not change for the worse, just the inevitability and power of perpetual Change. I found it a bit dull as the foundation of a religion, but it makes more sense than many of the ones we already have, and I have to confess that some of my more religious/spiritual moments have occurred when simply observing the power of change, often cyclical change, in the world -- storms, tides, waves, erosion, volcanic action, the migration of birds...<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c2510918241505242056 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 1:10 PM</a><br><br>

Here in America, a lot of us will be facing the same experience as our empire goes the way of Britain's. <br><br>Shakya, the Chan tradition is particularly well suited to harsh times, in that it embraced the practice of utter poverty more cheerfully and pragmatically than other Buddhist monastic orders. I'd definitely encourage you to get yourself the necessary qualifications to found and run a temple, and get 'er built! <br><br>Odamaki, not sure why your comment appeared in duplicate form! Still, thanks for the Onion story -- I'd missed that, and yes, they're just as good at making fun of the other end of the binary. <br><br>Leo, of course that can happen. In fact, it already has -- the emergence of field agriculture and urban centers transformed an older and rather different set of cycles, one that can still be seen at work in tribal village cultures, into the historical arc of rise and fall we know from history. I'll talk later on about some of the conclusions that can be drawn from this. <br><br>Miles, good. I promise you I'll get there at some point, though neither you nor I will know when. ;-)<br><br>Beetleswamp, most funny. Thanks for the link!<br><br>Notsomethingelse, of course the rate of decline can vary due to specific circumstances. It can also vary from place to place during the course of a given decline -- those parts of the Roman Empire that were directly in the way of the Huns, for example, experienced a far more sudden collapse than those that weren't. Those variations in space and time are among the things that differentiate the way civilizations fall in the real world from the abstract fantasy of apocalypse. <br><br>Yupped, that's where fact gives way to faith, to use the distinction I drew in last week's post. You can decide, as an act of faith motivated by your values, to focus on the potential for positive change, and maybe even get some to happen; just don't confuse that act of faith with a prediction of fact. <br><br>Alex, welcome to the blog! I have a number of readers from the Balkan Peninsula, but I think you're the first commenter from Romania. I'll be interested in your perspective, as your corner of the world has seen quite a few empires collapse over the years. <br><br>Digger, I've talked about conspiracy theories in previous posts, and of course you're right -- blaming the failure of your belief system on some nefarious "Them" is always a popular dodge. <br><br>Andy, if you mean "benevolent" in the sense of "sentimentally kind," no doubt.

However, we were never trained on how to use them, and the skill is slowly being lost. If you read the literature the claim is that there is no evidence for them (which may be true). But the real fact is that we cannot afford them anymore. I also watched as the cardiac care unit of my training hospital was shut down, and basically in my 3 years of residency things went from bad to worse.<br><br>I sometimes peruse textbooks from the 80s. All of the medical knowledge is basically there, and in fact, the books were clearly written by physicians who were better than the current crop, many of whom rely on the internet just like everyone else. All but the most basic generic meds are getting unaffordable and downright unavailable. It takes weeks and months for consultant reports rather than days to weeks.<br><br>Not to mention my patients...who, no matter what I do for them, are universally in terrible shape, mentally and physically. Yet we pretend that they are one more drug or procedure away from being a 22 year old healthy and happy adonis.<br><br>In sum, medicine has been through a peak and is also in decline.

Beetles are such exquisite creatures! Many thanks for the link -- much food for thought there. <br><br>Nestorian, I'd wondered who would fall into that trap first. Your claim that my "relativist" stance is self-refuting rests on two fairly simple fallacies. First, relativism in the simplistic sense is not what I'm proposing here. Rather, it's what Nietzsche called perspectivism, the recognition that every statement about truth is inevitably a statement by some speaker, from that speaker's own irreducibly personal viewpoint. I'm quite sure that there is such a thing as absolute truth, but neither you, nor I, nor anyone else has any certain means of determining the correspondence between our personal views and the absolute truth; the best we can do is to give it our best shot from within the limits of our own perspective, recognizing that any resulting statement is always at least a little bit tentative, and subject to later review. <br><br>Second, from a perspectivist standpoint, my statement "human beings have no access to absolute truth" is perfectly consistent, since it presupposes that this is my personal perspective, based on the information available to me, and suggests that others might want to consider how my statement relates to their own experience. That leaves you free to claim to have privileged access to absolute truth, should you want to -- but it also leaves everyone else free to roll their eyes and suggest that you'd better be prepared to present some mighty convincing reasons why your claim to know the absolute truth is more correct than the thousands of competing claims that contradict yours in every particular. <br><br>Edde, thanks for the tip! <br><br>Russ, no question, a lot of people are going to be shocked. <br><br>Tideshift, fascinating. That's a field in which I've done very little reading, so the heads up is welcome. <br><br>Sunyata, well, I was reading Shankaracharya and a range of Zen Buddhist writings in my teen years, and have gone on from there, so yes, I have some exposure to nondual philosophies! As for Steiner, <i>A Philosophy of Freedom</i> is to my mind far and away the most useful of his books, and his thought has had some influence on mine, partly directly and partly via Owen Barfield's work. <br><br>Trippticket, nicely summarized! <br><br>Avery, nah, you've stumbled across the division I drew last week between faith and fact. No Christian or Epicurean ever pointed a numenometer at a Roman doorpost to prove that Janus wasn't to be found there, and it would have been a waste of time to do so, because -- if I may risk a multilingual pun -- the <i>numina</i> are also <i>noumena</i>: things known by the mind rather than being experienced by the senses. To reverence one's surroundings as full of gods, as the Romans did, is an act of faith and thus an expression of values, not a statement subject to factual verification or disproof. <br><br>Sooner or later in the life of a civilization, its rationalist philosophies run headlong into the limits of what can be known by the reason, and after a certain amount of struggle, those limits are accepted. It's precisely then that the Second Religiosity begins, because once the boundary between fact and faith is clearly delimited, reason and religion can coexist with perfect grace, each on its own side of the line, and individuals can come to their own varied relationships with both. I'll be discussing this in much more detail as we proceed.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c5453167313433998269 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 4:23 PM</a><br><br>

It's very promising that the Haitians were willing and able to ask for the help they wanted, rather than having an outside notion of "help" imposed on them. <br><br>Ben, the abridged version of Toynbee has all his more edgy discussions of the future of the Western world neatly edited out. That's one of the reasons why I have the complete version on my bookshelves. <br><br>Jose, thank you! Health care, well, a lot depends on local conditions -- I don't happen to know how health care is funded in Brazil. Here in the US, it's the last place you want to be, because it's become a hugely overfunded, unwieldy, corporate monstrosity of an industry that is probably headed for massive bankruptcies in the very near future. If that's not the case where you are, and you can get into a field where there's a steady demand and people who will be willing and able to pay, it may be a good approach. <br><br>Lahevend, er, Dick was writing science fiction, you know, not serious historical analysis. I wouldn't recommend <i>VALIS</i> (or any other of Dick's novels) as a basis for a study of history!<br><br>Sekenre, thanks for the link. There are ways around those barriers, but the habit of preaching to the choir has to be abandoned -- and that means you have to speak to people in their own mental language, which can be very difficult for those who think their own opinions are absolute truth. <br><br>Will, there's no guaranteed way to do that -- though a willingness to read and think about books you disagree with, and books that disagree with one another, is a good place to start. <br><br>Michael, see my response to Will immediately above. <br><br>Pat, not passive at all. I'll be addressing that next week, in fact. <br><br>PhysicsDoc, granted. Every phenomenon in history and in nature combines features that are unique with features that copy past phenomena; no two stars, summers, crickets, or cosmic ray bursts are exactly the same -- but there are regularities that can be extracted from the data, and used to get some kind of a handle on what can be expected in the future.

A good satirical novel is always a sensible starting place for thought in an absurd time. <br><br>Escape, too funny!

It can be hard to realize that "despairoin" is just as addictive, and just as pointless, as "hopium." <br><br>Jeffrey, I'm not arguing. <br><br>Unknown Mark, good. I've discussed the differences between those societies that collapsed and recovered, and those that just plain collapsed, in a couple of my books, especially <i>The Long Descent</i> and <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>; the very short form is that it depends on whether the basic means of food production and other subsistence activities are stable over the long term, or not. China got overrun with as many barbarian tribes as Rome did, but Chinese agriculture had settled down into an immensely stable and resilient pattern, while Rome let its agricultural system turn into something very similar to today's absentee-owned agribusiness farms, and that went belly up when the Roman economy did. <br><br>Orc, faced with something as vast as the end of a civilization, we all have a variety of choices. My choice is to do what I can to preserve certain things that I consider profoundly valuable, that will likely be lost forever if nobody takes action. It's not a matter of limiting human suffering -- one way or another, a lot of people are going to live wretched lives and suffer miserable deaths; it's simply that, speaking solely for myself, there are things that I want people in the future to be able to have, and I couldn't live with myself if I let them be lost without raising a finger to do something about that. That's my choice. What do you choose to do? <br><br>Harry, that's exactly what catabolic collapse looks like, complete with the delusion that it can't really be happening. <br><br>DeAnander, Butler didn't make that up, or if she did she was following an ancient path without knowing it. One of the most popular deities in Hellenistic times across the Greek-speaking end of the Mediterranean was Tyche, "pure dumb luck." <br><br>Alex, it's a typical sales pitch by the wind turbine industry, backed by international banks that will make billions off turbine sales. <br><br>Bill, too funny! You may have noticed, though, that I didn't use the term "Neopagan," and that was in large part because my experience has been much the same as yours; a huge number of people who claim to worship Nature haven't taken the time to learn the first thing about her. Some of the old-fashioned Druid orders, the one I head among them, are taking steps to remedy that, or (in our case) to return to an orientation toward nature study that existed a while ago in our traditions, and got partly misplaced more recently.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c231741689960304745 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 4:58 PM</a><br><br>

I'd heard rumors that it was getting that bad, but it's helpful to have those confirmed. May I suggest that you might consider studying how to treat illnesses and injuries with things you can make yourself, from commonly available sources? I'm coming to think that the entire US health care system may be only a decade or so away from financial implosion, and afterwards, it would be useful to have people who know how to provide essential health care without benefit of vat inputs of resources and money. <br><br>David, I think you mean a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix rel=nofollow>helix</a> rather than a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral rel=nofollow>spiral</a>.

Every Yuga is marked by an epochal event where god appears and vanquishes evil.<br><br>Life and Birth are cyclical too, you are supposed to go through this never ending cycle of life and death unless you achieve 'Moksha' (with which you must be familiar). The general meme being that life is miserable and avoiding the life-birth cycle is a reward.<br><br>I am guessing it's a defence mechanism among humans to cope with the uncertainties of life. Trying to imagine that life sucks right now but was better earlier (in our case) or that it will get better later (western materialism).<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c3857691840549767638 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 9:52 PM</a><br><br>

Sure, other civilisations and societies have suffered resource depletion and other damage which is happening now but not environmental degradation on this scale or rapidity.

The climate shifts now under way have close analogues in the prehistoric past -- huge CO2 releases from volcanic action in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods are among the examples -- and those examples don't justify the apocalyptic rhetoric being flung around by believers in near-term extinction.

But I'm also thinking on the Science-Fiction sub-genres Cyberpunk and how its sentibilities have been bleeding into the popular culture for the past 30+ years. I think the cultural narrative may be slipping away from the perfection/apocalypse dichotomy. Not quickly, to be sure, and notwithstanding your enumeration of the host of increasingly shrill proponents for either scenario, but I think it is slipping.<br>Cyberpunk reviewed the antiseptically clean world of Star Trek and other future world TV and movies applied the punk awareness that much of life (in the 1970s) was not living up to its billing per the 1950s; we had stagflation, unemployment, social unrest and the happy, groovy world of the Age of Aquarius was nowhere to be seen. Doug Copeland (Generation X) described coming of age in the late 1970s as like being on a beach after a huge party the night before that you weren't invited to, where you cut your foot on a broken bottle in the piles of trash and get yelled at by a cop for making a mess. Cyberpunk rescued science fiction by having a future of advanced technology in a grimy world still full of poverty and disparity, which is pertty much what we have now. Even as every month or so, the frontiers of what is technically possible with electronics and engineering produces some astounding new development, yet we are grinding down and decaying and the possibility of space travel becomes more remote.<br>As you trace out our inevitable future in these essays, Hollywood and LA has been producing entertainment that, while they still take place out there, amongst the stars, or in some technologically advanced version of our world, have lost that shiny, clean perfection of Hugo Gernsback's pulp novels, and replaced it with a more gritty image of carrying poverty and disparity and crime along with us even if we eventually leave the planet. Some of the best writing in the past two decades had only a tiny fraction of our population getting off this (or their) planet at all, leaving a polluted mess behind and stepping forward into poverty, albeit with the requisite hope for a better future... eventually. (e.g. Babylon 5, Firefly, and the 2005 Battlestar Gallactica remake).<br>I can see the popular narrative changing from the perfect future worlds as seen in the original Star Trek and Forbidden Planet to something closer to what we experience in reality. Maybe this is the first step to popular cultue facing the fact that, as Yogi Berra said, the future isn't what is used to be.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c1436395849082144913 title="comment permalink">6/20/13, 11:27 PM</a><br><br>

Are people tearing themselves apart from familiar influence groups yet? Here in Europe I have got impression that this Tea Party movement has been thus far only truly new and radical reaction model to changing environment over there. As populist movements are practically tearing established political infrastructure into bloody mess in large parts of Europe, this perceived stability of your country seems astonishing.

CO2 levels are unprecedented in human history (written or actual) and that applies to the whole world. Temperature rises are much more rapid that at any time in human history. Anoxic areas in seas are more extensive. And on and on. I don't think you can compare what is going on on a global scale with what a single society might have experienced on a local scale.<br><br>I'm not referring to near term extinction here; I don't think the evidence is there for that but we really have no historical guide for what to expect for the environmental destruction we have wrought, all powered by a one-off abundance of energy that is also unprecedented.<br><br>I really don't think I'm reacting to the narrative here. I look at the scientific information that comes out. Remember that the IPCC said, a couple of decades ago, that a temperature rise above 1 degree C could elicit rapid and abrupt changes to the climate (and since then the science has moved on, with risks becoming higher and increasing numbers of scientists trying to drive the message home). We're at 0.8, right now, with well over 1 degree already built in, given the level of CO2 already in the atmosphere. This is not narrative, it's science.

Responding to some things you said upstream to Avery in the comments:<br><br><i>No Christian or Epicurean ever pointed a numenometer at a Roman doorpost to prove that Janus wasn't to be found there, and it would have been a waste of time to do so, because -- if I may risk a multilingual pun -- the numina are also noumena: things known by the mind rather than being experienced by the senses. To reverence one's surroundings as full of gods, as the Romans did, is an act of faith and thus an expression of values, not a statement subject to factual verification or disproof.</i><br><br>This rings false as historical description. Even Neoplatonists debated each other over precisely how to understand theurgy and spiritual presence which suggests that the fact/value, noumena/phenomena distinction couldn't be taken for granted. Your everyday Roman probably had a fairly literal notion of spirit being in things.<br><br>As for pointing to the numenometer and declaring Janus absent...well, that really was a common technique of Christianity; they adopted that strategy from rabbinic Judaism's anti-idolatry toolkit.<br><br>I say this, too, because religiously I've been close to the contemporary African diaspora traditions and they don't tend to make the sort of phenomena/noumena distinctions you describe. They point to this or that object and it's the spirit, they go to this or that place because it is where x spirit lives there, and so on. Consecration (and its contrasts, desecration and profanation) are incredibly important because the spiritual and material are seen as fused in sacred things and places. I suspect the theological subtleties (and they are subtle) of the Afro-diasporic faiths are comparable to the Roman ones. <br><br>(I know, I am theologically and philosophically really kooky.

First, to assert something will never happen because it never has happened is similar to the proverbial claim that there are no black swans. As an observer, I look at what CAN happen and try to guess the odds of it happening; this is not a "practice," it's just my personal way of coping with uncertainties.<br><br>I would agree that the odds of the two extreme scenarios you mention (utopia and apocalypse) are quite low. However, odds must be considered in relation to some time scale.<br><br>For example, what is the probability of another Carrington event happening in the next five years? I expect it would be quite low. But in the next 50 to 100 years? I expect it would be considerably higher. And, depending on the severity of the CME, it could easily be a world-changing catastrophe, considering our dependence on the electrical grid.<br><br>This leads me to another point: I have to grant the possibility that this time really IS different, or that some time in the future really WILL be different. <br><br>Here's a gloomy example, and I really hope someone can prove me wrong on the facts: Mankind has already built a fail-safe doomsday machine. It's called the nuclear power infrastructure. It is believed that one massive CME hitting North America would take down most, or all, of the grid. That means no diesel fuel would be delivered to hundreds of nuclear plants after the 2-week emergency reserves are depleted and the coolers quit working. I need not explain the consequences to every living thing downwind. Not incidentally, this is a 100,000-year problem. We have to keep the grid alive that long, unless someone figures out how to safely dispose of the stuff. And I consider the odds of the latter happening extremely low. We had our chance, and now the resources are gone.<br><br>Further, we have been told there were actually times during the nuclear age when madmen with their launch codes came close to incinerating the northern hemisphere. No one can know what the odds were during those tense moments, but they weren't miniscule.<br><br>Admittedly, I am imagining a future scenario that no one would be able to prevent and that few could survive, even the most well prepared. So why do I trouble myself with such things? Perhaps this helps me appreciate the sweetness of life in this very moment. <br><br><br><br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c2903353150989085638 title="comment permalink">6/21/13, 8:46 AM</a><br><br>

The current population on the earth is about 1 million times larger so the current population density of the earth is about equal to the max population density of Easter Island. Easter Island took about 200 years to reach that population and then declined back down to near initial numbers in the same amount of time.

Nuclear war is one example, having the worst case scenario in the collective consciousness probably makes it a lot less likely to happen. If a society with nuclear capabilities started forgetting about those risks, then I'd worry more about a nuclear war actually happening.<br><br>As far as the nuclear waste issue, I still see that along with all the other environmental pollutants as one with no close parallels historically. We can see plenty of examples of climate change, land degradation, wars, famines, pandemics, etc to compare to, but none of us really know the long term effect of all the persistent chemicals we have put into the environment and will put during the remaining time industrial society has left. Older societies had access to things like lead, arsenic, mercury, and asbestos, but I don't see that as comparing to the thousands of never before seen chemicals that contaminate the industrial world, not to mention the potential for radioactive contamination.<br><br>You make a good point with this quote, " If the present case really is unprecedented, wouldn’t it make more sense either to suggest some equally unprecedented model for the future, or simply to shrug and admit that nobody knows what will happen?"<br><br>I guess that's the point I'm at with regards to the toxicity coming from industrial society. It doesn't fit into an apocalyptic model at all, as much of the damage from radioactive waste and chemical pollution happens with delayed effects, even sometimes playing out over generations as exposure in the womb or as a small child can be much worse than as an adult. The impacts on human vitality from these contaminants already is probably much worse than most people think, it's just that the replacement of human power with fossil fuels has masked the growing weakness of humanity itself. I can't rule out a worst case scenario that results in the eventual extinction of humanity (and who knows haw many other species) through simply more deaths than births over a number of generations due to illness from these toxic substances.<br><br>I think that worst case scenario is very unlikely, and it's also possible that the effects will end up being relatively minimal compared to everything else going on during the long descent except in localized areas. However, there are many possibilities in between, and I wonder just how much environmental contamination will make things different this time. For instance, your reasoning in favoring areas of the US east of the Mississippi compared to the west makes a lot of sense, east of the Mississippi does have a lot of geographical and climatic advantages. However, overall it also has a much greater density of nuclear plants, as well as other contaminants that go along with more densely populated areas. Montana and Idaho might end up being a better spot than Ohio and Tennessee. I'm not saying that for sure, just that it's a possibility considering all the unknowns about the long term effects of our pollution.<br><br>continued in another post<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c7694333586051560220 title="comment permalink">6/21/13, 3:58 PM</a><br><br>

Population would later rebound in some of those areas as the mid range isotopes dwindled, others slowly leached away and ended up in deeper sediments and less accessible places, evolution favored those more resistant to radiation and cultural patterns that adapted to its presence.

This transition was marked by many abrupt temperature rises of several degrees followed by large partial reversals (e.g. the Younger Dryas cold spell, which lasted 1300 years but both started and ended in only a few decades). <br><br>What isn't known is how well human civilization can take climate change of that rapidity - agriculture didn't develop until we entered the current, relatively stable climate regime that began about 10,000 years ago and is likely coming to an abrupt end. There have been a number of civilization declines and collapses brought on at least partially by local climate change, but those local changes will pale in comparison to the changes that will be brought on by a global ~4 C temperature rise. Furthermore, this will be by far the hottest period ever experienced by Homo sapiens. <br><br>I suspect humans will survive even the more severe climate change scenarios (at least among the ones that don't feature limitless fossil fuel reserves leading to CO2 concentrations &gt;800 ppm).

However, leaving that aside, I'd say to you and Bill that I doubt humans survived past environmental catastrophe "just fine" (as Bill wrote), though they certainly survived it, but I think we're talking about humans societies and civilisations. There is no historical precedent for what is happening, environmentally, coincident with human civilisations, on a global scale. None. If there is, please point to the research which shows this. If that still doesn't impress, consider tipping points. These are hypothesised and even theorised. If the scientists are right about tipping points and right about what is currently happening to our planet at an unprecedented level in human history, is it likely or even possible that such tipping points will be reached in the near future? Again, I'm not talking about near term human extinction but I'm talking about rapid deterioration of what supports all life, all societies, all economies on this planet. A centuries long deterioration of our global civilisation may need to get through an environment that is shrivelling before our eyes. I don't say it's impossible but I think unlikely.<br><br>Of course, as collapse plays out, over any time period, there will be some for who collapse plays out very quickly.

Google found the FEMA and NASA briefings on "a modern day Carrington Event" for me, and the worst-case scenarios are indeed dire. A world without electricity for several years! Without electricity, we can't pump water, which we need to drink, to flush away our waste, and to cool our nuclear facilities. We can't run our refrigerators! <br><br>But to get to the worst-case scenario, we require the grid operators to NOT respond to the evolving event, and just sit back while their transformers burn out. At this time, we have satellites staring at the sun, watching for just such an event. (Of course, these satellites have finite operating lives, and to replace them will require scarce government funding, so it's crucial that we all know just how important they are. [Nice grid ya' got there; too bad if somethin' were to happen to it...]) If the satellites see the CME coming, they provide about a day's warning. A third satellite, positioned between the Earth and the Sun, senses the CME as it sweeps by, providing more detailed information as the impact nears. (You can monitor conditions yourself through the Space Weather Prediction Center.) The grid itself is equipped to sense ground-induced currents, and includes circuit-breakers to automatically disconnect the grid before damage occurs. <br><br>But yet, there is a certain element of human judgement involved: if I were a grid operator, would I voluntarily shut it down for a few days, guaranteeing the inconvenience of my customers, but the safety of my equipment? Or would I wait to see if it's really going to get "that bad", and put equipment at risk? Where do I set the threshold? In the long run, will we maintain the vigilance needed to issue the warnings? Will grid operators be punished for responding conservatively to false alarms? (When a storm knocks out residential power, we lose a few days of refrigerated food. I don't know what happens to an oil refinery, or aluminum smelter.) If their prudence in shutting down on a warning is punished (legally or financially), they may take greater risks on successive events.<br> <br>By the way, CME-induced currents would have no effect on household electronics, even in the worst case scenario, unless the grid thrashed around a bit on the way down. The risk is to high-voltage transmission transformers connected to miles and miles of wire.<br><br>There are technical ways to isolate the transformers from ground-induced currents, but implementing them would cut into utility corporate profits with no certainty of pay-off. Will they be implemented?<br><br>My conclusion is that this will be a manageable danger for many years to come, if we maintain the ability to manage it. If managed properly, we may still go off-grid for a few days. Whether that turns out to be a catastrophe or a novelty depends on our personal preparations.<br><br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c6444921242640993809 title="comment permalink">6/21/13, 6:41 PM</a><br><br>

The fact that humanity hasn't been in exactly this situation before doesn't change the fact that we've been through other climate shifts, that civilizations have been through similar ecological crises, that the planet has been through similar CO2 spikes, etc., etc., etc. -- and all of these provide us with useful information.

Thanks for unintentionally reminding me of it!<br><br>As to catabolic collapse, I am hearing fairly substantial rumours that the major Observatory I once worked for is in grave danger of being shut down. It was founded in the 1880s, and by the time I arrived in the 1980s it seemed an institution almost as august and solid as the British Museum; its extensive archives featured heavily in the UC Library Special Collections, and it was a "flagship" feature of the UC chain and vastly popular with the general public. I've been retired just a few years, and now I hear that the institution in whose service I spent much of my adult life is, basically, on the chopping block.<br><br>This doesn't surprise me, in times such as ours. Libraries are being closed and reducing their hours, roads are going unmended, public transportation is being cut back just as poverty is increasing and affordable transport is more needed. But it's my very own "flaming arrow with a note wrapped around it" from the liquidators managing the catabolysis. It tells me on a gut level that the world I knew is over. This I knew intellectually, and I've known it for years with increasing emotional clarity; but this brings it home in a new and saddening way.

Question: how do their model(s) relate to Polybius' anacyclosis? (Actually, I'm being lazy here -- I should investigate this myself.)<br><br>I'd like to expand the perspective of these models; from a quick look at the Wikipedia articles on Spengler and Toynbee, it seems that they consider only the "major civilations", and in particular only those that have existed in the most recent few thousand years (it's only recently that we've learned something of cultures that left no written record). What would we see if we could examine, say, 100 thousand years of the history of human cultures? Is it possible that Spengler &amp; Toynbee's models are based on an unusual time period in human evolution? (Although of course that time period includes our lifetimes, and likely the lifetimes of several generations beyond us.)<br><br>This brings up the nature of human evolution. By this I mean, in part, the process that has turned a primate into "modern man", and is presumably still at work on our organisms. I haven't read enough in this area to say anything definite about it here. I will speculate, however, that evolutionary change of human cognitive processes, and corresponding changes in cultural behavior, might result in a change in the nature of the cycles that human populations go through. (John Michael's work in culture conservation might be a component of this kind of evolution at work.) Another speculation: might the presence of severe climate change, coupled with the technics and cultural knowledge that survive, create a situation that will cause cycles of significantly different characteristics?<br><br>Further expanding the perspective: I referenced C.S. Holling's and H.T. Odum's models for cyclic behavior in complex systems, in a comment on the March 21, 2012 post ("America: Crossing the Line"). <br><br>So, maybe Holling's <a href=http://www.resalliance.org/index.php/adaptive_cycle rel=nofollow>Panarchy</a> and Odum's <a href=http://prosperouswaydown.com/principles-of-self-organization/energy-hierarchy/pulsing-paradigm/ rel=nofollow>Pulsing Paradigm</a> could be viewed as extensions of Spengler, anacyclosis, etc. into the natural world. (Or maybe, the latter could be viewed as specializations of Holling's and Odum's models.) <br><br>Both Odum and Holling treat cycles occurring on multiple scales, and the interactions between scales. Also, Odum derives pulsing from his energy principles, thus providing a model that says why cycling occurs, rather than just that it does. This model also includes the possibility of the preservation of information across pulses, thus enabling growth on a longer scale.<br><br>An especially interesting study using Odum's work is Tom Abel's look at the <a href=http://www.tabel.tcu.edu.tw/r_China_Cultural_Evolution.html rel=nofollow>Cultural Evolution of China</a>. Here, he shows a longer scale change (in the form of growing population) across multiple cycles.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c7890292070150644913 title="comment permalink">6/21/13, 11:00 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks. <br><br>One can puzzle over why the choice to pay attention to what actually happens is so difficult for so many. I think a deep current in this confusion is the fact that humans have a deeply ingrained moral imagination. We don't conceive of the world as a sequence of events, but as a sequence of good and bad events. People are too complex to understand, so as a shorthand we quickly label them as good or bad. We are very likely to do the same thing with animals (think puppy or mosquito) or future possibilities (think flying cars or economic decline). It is the response you compactly called 'warm fuzzy' and 'cold prickly'. The 'world as it is' is really complicated. It is much simpler to conceive of an imaginary world where things are ordered by moral criteria. Over evolutionary time, this trait seems to have been useful. When you face the 'buzzing blooming confusion', you need a simpler imagined world to think in. It seems to me that much of human intelligence can be understood as an evolutionary response to a world that is too complex to fully comprehend. (Of course that understanding itself is only partial since it is circular.) Religious systems are attempts to formalize and build coherence out of the moral worlds that we naturally inhabit in our minds. <br><br>A great question that will determine much about the human future is whether large groups of people find ways to synthesize a focus on the world as it is with an embracing of the human moral imagination as it is. Modern science easily embraces the world as it is. A strong grasp of inter-disciplinary science does a lot to reduce the 'buzzing blooming confusion'. But it leaves us without a moral framework. The best it offers is an uninspiring pragmatism: you ought to do what achieves your goals (or your groups goals or your species goals or your ecosystems goals, etc) but no one knows what the goals ought to be. A divine goal giver is a very nice solution to this problem. If only the goal giver were evidenced in the world as it is and not only in the human moral imagination.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c8117516957134754279 title="comment permalink">6/22/13, 2:56 AM</a><br><br>

I agree that we have much to learn from the instabilities of earlier civilizations. But in addition to the cycles that can be seen in the rise and fall of civilizations, there are other parts of human history that don't fit at all well in Spangler's story. The invention of agriculture and domestication of animals changed human society such that the majority of humans have never returned to a hunter-gather lifestyle. Evolutionary history is full of other such changes--multicellularity, photosynthesis, mobility on land, flight--all changed the future in ways that had no clear precedent. Many of us suspect that at least some parts of the scientific-industrial-communications revolution of the past 500 years have no precedent and make the future much harder to predict than Spengler believes. I suppose he might argue that he is modeling large scale social organization patterns and sees repeating patterns and so examples before the advent of large scale civilizations are irrelevant. But that is unfortunately close to the argument that this time is different...that large scale civilization patterns repeat while biological evolution and evolution of hunter gatherer groups do not. One could equally (falsely) claim that one is modeling the future of industrial civilization and examples from before the industrial revolution are irrelevant.<br><br>I think you have to be careful with that kind of interpreting of history. The rise and fall of systems of political organization may well be inevitable. And standards of living will certainly decrease at some point in the future rather than always rise. But the prediction of a return to the technology and way of life from before the revolution of modernity seems to me to be a failure to grasp some ways in which this time is indeed different.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c853577000702907869 title="comment permalink">6/22/13, 3:52 AM</a><br><br>

Good luck with that. <br><br>A lot of the time, maybe most of the time, the way things happen isn't at all obvious. Sometimes what's required is patient observation and reflection. And people are social animals. Do I believe what I believe because I'm honestly convinced by objective facts? Or do I believe what I believe because everyone else believes it?<br><br>Perceptions and beliefs get bent and shaped by social pressure. Lebensraum they said. And so citizens of the most educated country in Europe parked their moral and intellectual faculties. I've seen films of Adolf giving a guts-out speech to a group of middle aged German businessmen. And within five minutes these paunchy, grey-haired men (who should have known better) were up on their feet, giving the straight-armed fascist salute and screaming "Seig Heil". How do you explain things like this? OK, well, how many times have you heard people say "we were all caught up in it".<br><br>Sometimes the price of admission to the club is a profession of belief in more benign things than Nazi-ism. But things that you secretly know can't be true and can't say so for fear of exclusion. You can't lose in tech stocks, right? No brainer, right? Well, no, as events showed, not right. But, if you didn't subscribe to certain investing fashions, you weren't on-side. And you were foolish and you didn't "get it". Everyone was doing it after all. It takes some bravery to risk derision by saying there's nothing to "get". <br><br>Sometimes admission to the club requires that you suffer in public by mouthing obvious nonsense. The more evident your discomfort the more enthusiastic the applause. You suffered in front of everyone and so you earned your membership. You get admiration, warm congratulations, handshakes, hugs and a slap on the back. The warm glow of acceptance is your reward. <br><br>John McCain looked into the camera and said that the 9/11 terrorists came through Canada. Which was baloney. Janet Napolitano said the same thing. They must have known it was baloney, yet they said it nonetheless. Maybe saying something like this marked them as rock-ribbed Americans. They proclaimed their membership in the tribe of rock-ribbed Americans and they waved the tribal flag. <br><br>I'll bet that a substantial percentage of rock-ribbed Americans who profess belief actually harbour doubts (like about WMDs in Iraq) but don't dare say so for fear of ostracism. Ostracism hurts. It hurts when people that you once associated with, whose friendship you value, no longer invite you to dinner parties and who now only give you a curt nod and a hello, if that. <br><br>Some people, in the face of overwhelming evidence, publicly deny the fact of evolution. Acknowledging this obvious thing is impermissible in their own social and political circles. <br><br>So, people on the "right" are knuckle dragging science-deniers? Well, just a minute, some people on the left decline to have their children vaccinated. How long before polio makes a come-back as a consequence? I'll bet that many of the science-deniers in these opposing camps know their positions to be based in nonsense. No matter, people value their tribal membership. <br><br>For the longest time I thought of Americans as empiricists led by hard-headed, practical types. Maybe it was a figment of my imagination but I seem to remember an America of small towns with clear eyed Jimmy Stewart types who got up and said what was what and did what had to be done.<br><br>America, after all, got to where it's at by doing what works. You don't set foot on the moon otherwise. But what I've been seeing is straining my belief. Maybe I'm an old man that's guilty of the same accusations that I'm making, that is, that I believe what I WANT to believe and what's convenient and comforting to believe.

My understanding is that the evolution from the hominid background was complete by about 150 to 100 thousand years ago. This is borne out by the close genetic identity across the dispersed populations, each having very small changes in genotype / phenotype. The biggest change might have been an interpolation from Neanderthal genome in the human population that gave rise to European lineages, but it does not show. This link with another hominid would have occurred after the main global dispersal of our species. <br><br>In effect, we grow our brains during development, varying a bit under environmental and social influences. There are also epigenetic effects over two or three generations. Selection pressure has resulted in different skin colour and other relatively minor adaptations for example, but had little effect it seems on the species genome. <br><br>I read in Thomas C. Patterson that Darwin seems to have been also a 'Social Darwinist'. That 19thC discussion, however, seems to have had very little basis in biology over the 100 thousand year human time-scale.

This shows how things went on 2008-07-24, the day UofT removed our oil paintings and other art.<br><br>Our current position is as follows:<br>(a) 72 hectares now in ownership of real-estate developer Metrus/Corsica, 5 hectares now in ownership of Town of Richmond Hill; (b) 1.88 metre telescope (still largest in Canada, but now perhaps only in the largest 200 or so worldwide) as of 2008-07-02 not used for spectroscopy research, but merely for public outreach; (c) legal fight continuing at Ontario Municipal Board, with Metrus/Corsica and its allies seeking eventually to build a lane, 14 streets, a runoff-water sump, and approx 530 homes (with some of these proposed homes to have lots reaching within 150 metres of the telescope dome). <br><br>The future arrives sporadically, in different ways, in different places. In one sense, the future arrived in Britain ("Britain LEADS THE WAY") in the summer of 1914; in another, it arrived in Detroit, from 1967 or so onward; and our own little 77 hectares hints at yet another way in which the future arrives. <br><br>Do please encourage your colleagues to contact me, as Toomas dot Karmo at gmail dot com, if I can somehow help in your conservation fight. Our own fight is liable to go on to 2020 or 2025, with outcome presently uncertain. <br><br><br>Sincerely, <br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>in Richmond Hill, near Toronto, <br>about 2.5 kilometres' walk from the DDO gates<br><br><a href=www.metascientia.com/ rel=nofollow>www dot metascientia dot com</a><br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c6447253381810387396 title="comment permalink">6/22/13, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

One reason I retired early and retreated to a hands-on life in the provinces was that I began to feel very uneasy about the real value of what I was doing. Was the expensive pursuit of abstract knowledge about distant galaxies really a high/valid calling, in a world so full of impending disasters and remediable suffering? Was I expending my life-years and brain-hours in a way that satisfied my conscience? Was I really doing anything more meaningful than building a new-fangled pyramid for a pseudo-democratic Pharaocracy? So that's one side of my heart talking: who cares if such vanity projects get shut down?<br><br>But the other side of my heart says that the pursuit of non-profitable knowledge is not *only* a form of conspicuous consumption that signifies the wealth of nations or individuals (remember that the Obs was founded by the private legacy of a minor megalomaniac, whose body is interred beneath the 36 inch refractor). It's not just a monument to national or individual ego. It's also a valuation of something for its own sake -- knowledge of the universe -- that if it doesn't produce food or shelter, is also not useful for killing people or extorting profit out of them. It's a reflection, in its own geeky way, of non-market values, and as such I have a deep affection and respect for it that conflicts with my sense of its relative uselessness in alleviating any of the suffering ramping up all around us.<br><br>And then of course there's the emotional attachment of decades of collegial teamwork, common struggles and victories that would mean nothing to anyone outside "the shop". And the warm fuzzies of volunteering on Visitors Nights in high summer, and seeing "the public" appear in numbers, excited and cheerful and thrilled to look through a Real Big Telescope and attend a basic lecture on astronomy.<br><br>There's a mean-mindedness to the great empire in its collapse. You can hear it in the vindictiveness expressed by the rightwingnuts towards the poor, you can hear it in the timidity of the so-called left as it fails to condemn the erosion of civil liberty and the pursuit of endless war. For a while, the Obs stood for something more generous, more public-spirited, more concerned with a long civilisational legacy and the accumulation of information rather than filthy lucre. It doesn't really cost that much to run, as compared to the endless subsidies for sports arenas and highway construction etc ad nauseam. <br><br>The erosion of all these generosities of a relatively wealthy empire -- the defunding of health care, public transport, education, the arts, parks, you name it -- leaves us with a still-wealthy empire that is viciously stingy, the rich hugging their wealth to them like Smaug's hoard and giving not a snap of their fingers for the proles (other than a persistent desire to punish and humiliate them even further). As the empire gets less wealthy, I shudder to think how this meanness of spirit and praxis may escalate. All this is the warp of my sadness over the closure of the institution that shaped so much of my own little life -- across it runs the fluffier woof of my own personal sentiment and the melancholy of middle age.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c4579584937524122027 title="comment permalink">6/22/13, 10:51 AM</a><br><br>

Best summed up by the old saying "never let the facts get in the way of a good story". Humans like stories, they are simple, straight forward and clean, while reality is messy, complex, often difficult to comprehend, and even more so to understand. The beauty of the two competing narratives is they are both wonderful, dramatic, easily understood stories. We have been telling ourselves stories since we learned to speak, their power is deeply rooted in out collective minds and unlikely to go away any time soon.

I've recently found materials relating to it online. Although he states we're far into overshoot and expects a global collapse, Randers' forecast for the first half of this century seems somewhat less dire than the mid-term prognostications put forward by yourself, Dmitry Orlov, and other like-minded thinkers. For instance, Randers foresees that a lame semblance of growth will limp along for quite some time in the "developed" world, albeit increasingly offset by environmental costs. This seems to contrast with your predictions of an extremely severe depression. Also, Randers does not anticipate severe widespread resource shortages before 2052 - except for those who can't afford to pay for them, mainly in what are already the currently poor parts of the world. He claims that the really rough stuff is likely come in the second half of the 21st century, as a result of CO2 emmissions and consequent climate change. <br><br>Since Jorgen Randers is one of the authors of the 1972 Limits To Growth, which you have often cited in this blog, I'm curious to know what you think of the forecast made in his more recent book. Sorry if this is somewhat off-topic for the week, but it certainly seems to relate to the general subject matter at hand. <br><br>Somewhat irritatingly, Randers predicts that the technologies of virtual reality will be with us for quite some time, and will even become more prevalent: whereas I was hoping it would go away fairly soon.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c4355326710243834916 title="comment permalink">6/22/13, 11:02 AM</a><br><br>

(An elderly colleague had brought it in that day as a historical curiosity.)<br><br>I understood standard High German then (still do, though I'm quite rusty by now), as well as a bit of Low German. Hitler's dialect, however, was quite another thing: I could get the gist of less than a third of what he was saying.<br><br>And of course, I knew a good deal about what Hitler had done. And I have always despised totalitarianism of any kind, leftward or rightward. And Hitler's racial so-called "science" was unscientific nonsense.<br><br>None of these things mattered at all while that recording was playing. They wouldn't have mattered even if I had understood less than I did of his speech. By the time it ended I was, for a very short while, wholly under the spell of that man's voice. <br><br>The power of Hitler's speech had almost everything to do with the rhythms of the speaker's voice, the cadences and patterns of sound and the things that are subtly conveyed thereby. His actual message had nothing to do with that power, for me; neither did social pressure. <br><br>They did, of course, have something to do with his rise to power in Germany -- some thing, not most things. <br><br>Having heard that man in full flood of his speechifying, I am certain that neither social pressure nor ideas and ideology can fully account for Hitler's rise to power. He was a superb master of his own voice, far better than any other political speaker I have ever heard (even the late Everett Dirksen). He knew how to use that mastery to get what he wanted, which (IMHO) was raw power. In short, a formidable predator.<br><br>We have to take such things into account as we try to figure out the shape of the future.

Still, a paper slide rule is a very nice addition to the kit. <br><br>Ganv, excellent! You've grasped the immensity of the challenge that Nietzsche was trying to address: how do you make sense of the cosmos in an age when traditional myths and taboos can no longer be accepted by most people in a boneheadedly literal sense? More on this as we proceed. <br><br>As for the impact of changes such as agriculture, I'd point out that changes in technology and subsistence don't necessarily equate to changes in historical process. The military technologies used by Babylonian imperialism were very different from those used by the British Empire, but the same patterns of rise and fall appear in both cases. How much of the revolution of modernity will survive the exhaustion of the fossil fuels that made it possible in the first place is another question very much open to discussion, and one I'll be addressing as we proceed. <br><br>Cherokee, thank you, and of course I'll check out the latest news!<br><br>Leo, here in the US I expect the future language to be either a descendant of Spanish or an English-Spanish hybrid, due to demographics and the most likely course of mass migrations.

Now to get people to make use of that...<br><br>Jose, not a thing. You'll have to ask somebody Canadian. <br><br>DeAnander, this is one of the reasons I've been encouraging people with an interest in astronomy to support amateur astronomy with as much time and energy as they can spare -- as the officially funded institutions have their funds cut off, it's among those who do without the funding that these things will survive, if they're to survive at all. <br><br>Irishwildeye, I'm not sure I agree with that last point -- why is it, if that's the case, that utopian and dystopian novels alike have modest popularity, while the great epics of ours and every other time are very often set in an age of decline, with the protagonists struggling to save something from the long slow wreck? My take is that catabolic collapse is a much better story -- it's just that accepting it means you can't keep on driving your SUV three blocks to the grocery. <br><br>DeAnander, it's usually about the third hundred-year storm in a decade that starts to knock people out of their complacency. As for the panjandrum, that's just classic -- thank you!<br><br>Kevin, a detailed response would require a post all to itself. My take is that Rander's wrong in important ways; in a society that rations resources by price, of course the only people who will be impacted by resource shortages will be those who can't afford to pay for the resources, but that group of people is already expanding rapidly here in the US, and the only "economic expansion" that's happening at all these days is an expansion of hallucinatory paper wealth. Climate change is going to be a mess, no question, but it's not the only source of real trouble.

He was loud in the way that an actor who projects well can be heard throughout a large theater. Mostly, though, I remember that his voice was utterly compelling and magnetic, implying enormous power inherent in the man himself -- a thing quite apart from the content of his speech or his program.

Perhaps any of Hitler's speeches could serve as an example. I don't know; I only ever listened to that one. Find some on the web and let me know how they strike you. As a long-time student of magic, I'm curious about the power of voice, and I've always been puzzled by this.

This means an event that is "expected" to happen on average once in 100 years at a single point. Not once in 100 years somewhere, anywhere on Earth. To put it really simplistically... if you have 1000 watersheds (North America has a lot more than this) in any given year on average you expect to see 10 "100 year floods," two "500 year floods," and one "1000 year flood." This is every year, a 1000 year flood, somewhere. And this is assuming that the models that extrapolate the 1000 year flood from 50 years of records is accurate. Even at any given point, two 100 year floods in a decade actually has a 10% chance of happening, and 3 in a decade has a 1% chance. So among these 1000 watersheds, in any given decade 10 of them on average will have experienced three 100 year floods -- three in the same watershed within one decade, with no increase in the actual frequency of extreme events.<br><br>Now even just a few decades ago, you would have only heard about these events if they happened close to you. But now you hear about them when they happen anywhere in the world. So of course the media have 1000-year extreme events to report on just about every week somewhere. This does not per se mean they are becoming more frequent. <br><br>The actual statistics on the frequency of extreme weather are much less dramatic, suggesting barely significant modest increases, no massive upheaval of all we know from the patterns of the past. Not yet, at least.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c5971303223506085689 title="comment permalink">6/22/13, 4:26 PM</a><br><br>

Bill thinks humans survived severe climate changes "just fine", but didn't define "just fine". As I've said, I'm not a believer in near term human extinction but I do note climate science data which show a huge spike (almost vertical) in CO2 concentrations over the last 30-40 years and a similar spike in underlying planet warming (not just surface warming and with corrections built in).

Assume that Donald Trump has a heart attack. He goes to the hospital, they do some quick imaging, find the blockages, shove stents into his blocked arteries, and in a week he'll be able to go back to browbeating Apprentices for another twenty years.<br><br>The reason they can do all this is that the mass market for flat-screen televisions and digital cameras has created mass-production facilities for all the components that go into the scanners; the mass market for precision-molded plastic parts has created the ability to produce stents at all; most importantly, the mass market for cardiologists created by insurance and Medicare has put a reasonably competent cardiologist on every street corner.<br><br>Fast-forward to a future where there are no mass markets for flat-screen televisions, plastic thingamajigs, or cardiologists, and guess what? Even if The Donald were ten times as wealthy as he is, or a hundred times as wealthy, that heart attack is going to kill him.<br><br>It's funny to me, the way that demand is apparently a complete blind spot in economic thinking. The futurists you complain about are all tied up in the supply side of the equation: oh, we'll figure out how to mine asteroids, and use cold fusion for energy, etc. Fine. Let's just give them that.<br><br>Who's buying all the stuff we can now produce? There's a theoretical limit on demand, based on 100% of the world population shopping 24 x 7 on the Internet, and "outsourcing" (and paying for) every possible human activity, from child-rearing to wiping your own bottom. There's a <i>practical</i> limit on demand, based on the distribution of discretionary wealth and the free time to spend it. If only the 400 richest people in the world can afford Chinese take-out, there will be no Chinese take-out: 400 people can't eat enough Chinese take-out to support the industry.<br><br>Even people who are paid to project demand simply refuse to be honest. I can't tell you how many times I've seen or heard of quarterly sales projections that will only come true if phytoplankton grows legs and develops capitalism. It's just too scary to go to the executive team with the news that there are no new markets for the Flanged Widget, so the good news is that we'll have a zero percent growth this year -- unless (hopefully) one of our competitors goes under, and then maybe we can pick up their business.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c3931480691009767275 title="comment permalink">6/23/13, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

It is hard for the lone individual to build and maintain a telescope with an aperture of more than 0.4 metres or so, because a permanent pier and a permanent observatory building become increasingly desirable as apertures increase. <br><br>With increasing aperture, there is also an increasing requirement for daytime engineering. A point is eventually reached (perhaps at 1 metre or 1.5 metres?) at which there have to be at least two such specialists, separately educated to B.Sc.-equivalent or beyond - one, a mechanical-optical engineer, the other an electronics-and-cyber engineer. The latter engineer is needed because to get good astrophysics, one nowadays prefers a semiconductor CCD camera, and that camera needs to feed into some such cyber data-reduction system as the USA-developed, free-for-anyone, but intricate, IRAF.<br><br>Astrophysics in an age of decline should be pursued in part through groupings of part-time amateurs, under some part-time professional guidance, at duly conserved observatories with telescopes in the 2-metre class or better. This makes it possible for limited resources to be pooled. <br><br>Leaving aside lone heroes such as Evans and Levy, what can we hope to achieve? One possibility is the photometric study of exoplanets - difficult for the lone worker, but feasible for a team equipped with a scope in the 2-metre class or better, with electronics good enough to get measurements to a precision of (say) plusminus 5 millimags. Such work could be undertaken even at a light-polluted suburban site. <br><br>It has been pointed out in Sky&amp;Tel that a programme of exoplanet transit timing-perturbation searches could potentially identify rocky, Earth-sized, moons of gas-giant exoplanets, including exoplanets whose orbits are confined to the liquid-water zones of their host stars.<br><br>For a good exoplanet project, one would ideally have for 20 hours/month a Principal Investigator trained to M.Sc.-equivalent or Ph.D.-equivalent, and for a total of 20+20 hours/month two B.Sc.-equivalent persons to check data reductions, and those two specialist engineers (again, say, 20+20 hours/month), and a group of people with no formal science training, willing to take occasional seminars from the B.Sc.-equivalents, each willing to commit to 10 or so hours a month. <br><br>Some inspiration can be had from the Debian Linux project - one of the oldest Linux projects, and the basis for several prominent Linux distributions (most notably Ubuntu), and yet operated by volunteers under an explicitly noncommercial charter. <br><br>Inspiration can similarly be had from the history of amateur radio. It was the amateurs who spearheaded the development of the HF bands in the 1920s, funding themselves. <br><br>The importance of volunteer work, albeit outside science and technology, is additionally illustrated by the volunteer-driven, perhaps only precariously funded, organizations Greenpeace and Amnesty International. <br><br>(signed)<br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>near Toronto, Canada <br><br>(2.5 km walk <br>from David Dunlap Observatory gates) <br><br><a href=http://www.metascientia.com/ rel=nofollow>www dot metascientia dot com</a> <br><br>PS: I write here, a little carefully, "Ph.D.-equivalent" (etc) rather than merely "Ph.D." (etc) because we have to keep in view the possible eventual decline of universities. We may eventually be back to the situation in the 1890s, in which I suspect significant numbers of people, at least in Britain, were self-trained to a Ph.D. capability while holding only minor degrees. <br><br>PPS: Some decades from now, as our decline progresses, electronics will prove out of reach for all but military and the government. Then what? Well, we go back to measuring spectral lines on those tiny chemical-photography plates, duly hypered in gas-tight ovens.

Here I found only two authors, Spivak (as one would predict) and one other, Tom Apostol. Apostol, available in several copies at in UofT libraries, proved first rate. Last night I managed to order both volumes of the main Apostol book, in hard covers, through abebooks.com, for a total of around 70 USD. (Caution: It is easy to fall at Abe into the trap of getting a paperback.

It's entirely possible that humans lived in relative stability with their environment for the first 100,000 years of their existence. <br><br>The key point to notice is that it doesn't require a different kind of human being to live sustainably. It does require a very different way of living.<br><br>What makes Spengler and Toynbee relevant is not that they speak for the human species, but that they speak for the way of living that we currently practice: the way of civilization and empire. If we're going to live in civilized empires, then we are going to see rises and falls; growth, overextension and collapse.<br><br>It seems to me that the relevant question is when (or whether) we will get off this civilizational merry-go-round. We won't see another Age of Oil in the history of the species, but I don't think there's any reason we can't see empires rise and fall for the next hundred thousand years or three. The US emulated Rome. Rome emulated the Babylonians. The Babylonians emulated the Akkadians. Or draw your own connection between the dots.<br><br>The point is that we still call these "peaks" of civilization, not "troughs" of ecological insanity. As peaks, they are to be admired and emulated. And so we shall continue to do, with whatever resources are available.<br><br>We don't have to do it this way. We could adopt a more sustainable system, where the peaks and troughs are much smaller, and much shorter in duration -- bad seasons rather than bad millennia.

I think it is very difficult to know the right thing to do and so I spend a lot of time contemplating, so that the times to act end up properly motivated. What I contemplate about (using thought experiments, internal dialogue, simply being open to whatever insight might come):<br><br>- I am not the center of the universe.<br><br>- Limiting desire is essential to peace and right judgement<br><br>- Value all things for what they are, and not for what I wish them to be (relates to limiting desire)<br><br>- Appreciate what is (could be a sense of awe inspired by the rings of Saturn, the organization of an ant colony, or the twinkle in my wife's eye ;-).<br><br>All of the above have interactions with other people as the primary focus, with broader existence also important but secondary.<br><br>Also, 9 tenths of all those interactions are within our own family (I have a wife and three kids). Huge is, just because we want something, doesn't mean we should have it (we're not wealthy but are fairly well off so this is a constant battle on all levels). Huge also is mutual respect, you'd think it'd be easy but my goodness!<br><br>Another thing I'm in search of and ponder often is a bridge between druidry and Christianity. I've read "Mystery teachings of the living earth" but need to re-read it.

The reading of which I suppose could go under the contemplation heading somehow.<br><br>- Playing/singing!

To wit:<br><br>Civilisation "conquers" the perennial problem of variations in resource supply -- dearths and plenitudes, fair weather and foul -- by developing incredibly clever systems of irrigation, grain storage, administration and power structures to enforce and maintain the above, legal and accounting systems to keep track of all the enforcement and maintenance, etc etc. This provides a measure of stability and security to people living during the growth phase of a civilisation: in lean years, the authorities distribute grain from the centrally-controlled granaries; professional soldier maintained at state expense protect the boundaries of the polity, and so on. It seems to flatten out the wiggles of fate.<br><br>BUT. What has really happened is that civilisation has extended the time scale, and possibly raised the amplitude, of the variation in resource supply. Instead of having random periods of plenitude and dearth, the civ gobbles up resources at an increasing rate, growing all the while, more or less guaranteeing some kind of fairly steep and sudden collapse of resources which will also be *deeper* (wrt the population, which has grown to exceed its resource base) than previous famines, droughts, etc. So the period of relative calm and stability and security is bought by extending the time scale... which hauntingly echoes all kinds of basic physics about energy, time, and work :-) Many little wiggles become one darned big wiggle.<br><br>I'm then cross-indexing this way of thinking about civ collapse with other scale/radius problems such as the mistaken notion that exporting wastes beyond a certain radius makes them "go away". One more echo is found in Buber's concept of morality as a function of the radius at which Us becomes Them, or the I-Thou relation becomes the I-It relation -- if you have a very tight radius, then your behaviour towars anyone who isn't blood kin is liable to be predatory; if you have a very large radius, then every human you meet is to be treated like kin; and if you're a devout Jain, you respect insects as your brothers and sisters in life, and sweep them gently from your path rather than step on them.<br><br>Last example in this set that somehow gloms together in my mind: earlier interchanges here about slavery, and the illusion that slavery is abolished in the modern world; what has happened is that slavery takes place *further away* from the people who think it's been abolished, someplace foreign and exotic where they don't actually see it happening. Radius again.<br><br>Scale (in distance and time) seems to be everything when it comes to our perceptions (and our ethics). Scale in time, distance, and amplitude feels like a central concept: systems which scale up beyond a certain point don't escape entropy, they just delay it and possibly deepen the pit into which they fall? I scribble in haste here, so pls forgive, all, if this is a bit incoherent.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c3083581487657251384 title="comment permalink">6/23/13, 4:37 PM</a><br><br>

It's unfortunate, but that's what happens when empires fall. <br><br>Mkroberts, yes, I figured you'd come back with "but there aren't any exactly, precisely, in every detail equivalents for the present situation!" So? There have been plenty of civilizations that have overshot their ecological bases and crashed, including some that did themselves in via anthropogenic climate change; there have been plenty of periods of rapid climate change, some of them faster and more drastic than anything currently predicted by reputable science; there have been plenty of greenhouse events in the past, etc., etc., etc. The fact that none of them is exactly like the present is irrelevant to whether or not they can be used to make sense of the present. You might as well insist that no previous civilization had Khloe Kardashian, and therefore the current situation is unprecedented -- and if I could prove to you that she had an exact clone in ancient Sumeria, doubtless you'd find something else to back up the "it's different this time!" meme that your narrative requires. <br><br>Joseph, of course, but there's a fair amount of demand destruction that can take place before a given technology can no longer be supported by the demand that remains. It's in the lag time between when demand starts dropping and when it can no longer support the infrastructure of supply that rationing by price is a major issue. <br><br>Toomas, I'm not trying to see to it that new discoveries get made. I'm trying to see to it that the telescope and the art of making and using it don't become lost. New discoveries come second. <br><br>As for slide rules, yes, Clason's book is great. Isaac Asimov's "An Easy Introduction to the Slide Rule" is also very good. I'm delighted to say that a lot of good slide rule books, including Asimov's, are now available for free download from <a href=http://sliderulemuseum.com/SR_Library_Books.htm rel=nofollow>the online Slide Rule Museum</a> -- I'd encourage everyone interested in slide rules to download whatever strikes your fancy, and learn how it's done. <br><br>Joseph, I've come to think that the cycles Spengler discusses may even out somewhat over time -- as in, over the next hundred thousand years or so -- just as agriculture became much less vulnerable to crashes after its first half dozen millennia or so.

It is always different, every time. This is true of anything and everything in the world, they are all different. The sciences (social and natural) look at patterns that occur within this omnipresent difference. Without that we just have a world of incomprehensible chaos. And of course, even chaotic systems (using the scientific definition) are predictable in a statistical sense, if not in a strict deterministic sense. <br><br>Extreme weather -- as I said, the data show modest increases. What I am talking about is the general perception of wholesale upheaval, and the attribution of any and every extreme event (no matter how UN-unprecedented) to drastic climate change. <br><br>We had a 1000-year rain and flash flood event here in middle Tennessee in 2010, which directly affected our homestead; some of our friends and neighbors lost their houses, one died. It was of course unprecedented in the 140 years of weather records for the region, smashing previous extreme rainfall totals by a factor of two or more. But here is the thing: The area that experienced the 1000-year-rain comprised about 10% of the total area of the state of Tennessee, and about 0.1% of the area of the 48 contiguous states. So, in fact, it is just about what you would expect to have seen in the state once in a Century, and about once a year in the Lower 48. The sorts of changes that have been observed (so far) suggest that this 1000 year rain might be becoming more like a 500 year rain; not a 10 year rain or even annual event, which is the end-of-the-world scenario that the media and mass psychology seem to be promoting. <br><br>But of course, we are early in the process, and we may well see total shifts in the climate patterns in the coming centuries. There seem to be some odd things happening with the general northern hemisphere circulation, where patterns that were once uncommon are showing up regularly, and patterns that were once the norm fail to appear for months on end. BUT hyperbolic declarations of weather patterns having been already turned completely on their heads are no help at all in understanding what is really going on, which is what I am addressing.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c8080570496032942715 title="comment permalink">6/24/13, 5:54 AM</a><br><br>

My father died when I was a teenager and my mother had a complete nervous breakdown, so I stepped up to the plate, made the arrangements, called the family, etc, and did so dry-eyed because I had a passel of younger siblings suddenly depending on me. I've always looked clearly at what's coming and realized it would suck, but that I'd better get on with preparing for it.

As demand ceases to increase at the desired rate, companies try to compensate by "cutting costs," usually through sacrificing redundancies, then capital. The redundancies are their safety margins. The first capital to get the boot is accumulated knowledge and institutional memory, through layoffs -- who needs that stuff, anyhow? Capital equipment upgrades are first delayed, then the delays become indefinite. Capital equipment maintenance goes next, followed by capital replacement. Engineering works out "more efficient" (less redundant) ways of producing the product, again to save costs.<br><br>All of this is largely invisible to the customer -- what they see is stable or even decreasing prices, trying to woo what demand there is, and maybe a slight (or even substantial) degradation in product quality. What used to be a solid steel bracket is now a flimsy plastic bracket, that sort of thing. But what is happening behind the scenes is a full-scale ravaging of the entire supply-chain, bringing it down to an emaciated skeleton that is riding at the edge of maximum "efficiency," meaning there are no margins for change or error.<br><br>Hard goods are commonly manufactured on a JIT (Just In Time) basis, meaning that the parts aren't ordered until the finished-good order is in-hand. The company has no extra cash to pay for the parts -- that's done through a line-of-credit with a bank. The parts suppliers are doing the same thing. Every point in the supply chain becomes vulnerable to disruptions.<br><br>I managed engineering for a short time in a small manufacturing company. Senior management -- my boss -- came from the sales and marketing side, meaning her core beliefs saw technology as magic: any engineer who said, "You can't do that," was just being lazy and needed to be fired. We were constantly pushing the JIT boundaries at the whim of sales, demanding "expedited delivery" on virtually every raw material we needed to meet some customer order. The cost multiplier was horrendous, which indicated to me the magnitude of the burden these "rush jobs" placed on our suppliers. Sometimes, they just turned us down, flat.<br><br>Demand destruction in a free market causes industrial osteoporosis: internal catabolism. Price rationing doesn't happen. Instead, businesses stretch until they suddenly break, or get bought out by their competitors. This frees up some demand, which provides temporary relief to the companies that remain. But the decreasing demand pressure remains, so company after company folds.<br><br>Eventually, they stop making Twinkies altogether.

I am about halfway into the introduction to the first volume of Spengler, and should really probably wait until I have a little bit more understanding of his model, but at the rate I'm going, that might be a while! Really shouldn't take up something like this during the growing season.<br><br>I think you touched on this in an earlier post, but I still don't have a grasp on it. Spengler talks about "The West," and your term for the current civilization that is in decline is "industrial." I'm having a hard time understanding how those terms relate to the types of civilizations that seem to be the subject of his research. He states somewhere that these cultures start out in a geographical locality and remain in some way connected to it throughout their existence. He seems to be describing groups bounded or at least describable in geographic, belief, cultural, or perhaps ethnic terms, though I suppose that latter one might have problems. Thus far his examples (alluded in the intro) seem to fit that description. Egyptian, Chinese, "Classical," etc. Somehow, "industrial" civilization doesn't seem to fit.<br><br>I know you're getting some flack because some can't seem to get that something as global as the level of technology we now have could ever be lost. I don't really doubt that it could with the loss of the energy resources needed to animate the technology, but does that technology really describe a culture?<br><br>I wonder if what you are talking about could be described as the Anglo-American Empire, beginning maybe with the defeat of the Spanish Armada, or, if you don't want to ignore the French, maybe Waterloo.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c4592397329013116318 title="comment permalink">6/24/13, 10:29 AM</a><br><br>

But keep in mind, this blog discussion is not about climate change (the Archdruid, despite his many virtues is not, and doesn't claim to be a climate scientist). It's about the way our perceptions can be distorted by the narratives and models we reason with. There's an old saying that, "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence." For the purposes of this discussion, however, we might say that ordinary (or at least overly familiar) claims require extraordinary evidence. Of course it's possible that climate change will be an extinction-event - the worst case scenarios allow it - and so doomsayers'll turn out (in retrospect) to be right. However, that is beside the point. I don't want to put words in his mouth, but if I understand JMG, he is arguing that that our focus on that particular scenario is a result of our apocalypse narrative rather than our prescience and genius with the data. <br><br>And the fact that we get wiped out later doesn't make him wrong in the least.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c7809891329978868801 title="comment permalink">6/24/13, 10:50 AM</a><br><br>

Maybe I'm wrong about this but it is it not so that the people that support the theory and who deny any role for a Creator and who scorn people on the opposite side of the issue never seem to publicly discuss the actual scientific worthiness of the THEORY that purports to EXPLAIN evolution. So, do they go to the barricades in defence of a theory with minimal explanatory power and that hasn't even got the benefit of logic behind it?<br><br>Boo, hiss, lies! These are forbidden thoughts and forbidden words. Am I wrong? Ask yourself: what is the biochemical mechanism, whether it's part of the actual DNA molecule or embedded in the cellular machinery containing DNA, that creates new proteins and new bodily structures, that drives innovation in populations of organisms? Have you ever heard it described? No? I haven't either. Is it because that none of the defenders of the theory have got the foggiest idea of what it might be? What creates new species? Random mutation is too slow. Natural selection doesn't innovate but rather does the opposite, it's the mechanism that culls. <br><br>The theory has got gigantic holes? Be quiet, discussion of these shortcomings is not welcome. That would be conceding ground to the enemy. <br><br>This is an issue of "us" against "them". The theory of evolution isn't even the point any more. The point is that you belong to a group. Do you want to be a member? Well, there are certain requirements as the price of membership.

You're paying attention. There are two intertwined things falling right now. One of them is what Spengler called Faustian civilization -- the civilization of western Europe and the European diaspora in the Americas and Australasia. The other is the particular form that civilization took, industrial civilization, which as I've argued elsewhere is the first and most wasteful form of what might be called technic civilization -- a mode of human social life in which energy sources other than human and animal muscle power provide a significant fraction of the energy used in day to day existence. Those two are intertwined, and they're ending together, but the forces driving their respective falls are somewhat different. Does that clarify things a bit? <br><br>Roger, hmm. Yes, evolution has become the focus of a lot of tribal identity issues of late; at the same time, the science behind it is a great deal more solid than you seem to think. You might start by reading Darwin's <i>The Origin of Species</i> -- if you're going to critique a theory, it's helpful to understand it, and Darwin was a very capable writer, much easier to read than most scientists these days. <br><br>Tyler, of course agriculture is going to get harder -- I expect industrial monoculture, in particular, to become a losing proposition within a few decades at most, as variable temperatures and rainfall make it impossible to find any one crop to which you can devote 1500 acres at once! Small-scale intensive polyculture is much more flexible, thus will take up some of the slack, but there are going to be some very hungry times ahead. The gap between that and "we're all going to die!" is precisely the gap between what actually happens and what feeds the apocalypse myth.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c6868353560617899273 title="comment permalink">6/24/13, 11:18 PM</a><br><br>

Modern humans did, as you say, enter in the late Pleistocene when things were cooler. Maybe more importantly modern civilization developed during the Holocene interglacial period (within the last 10,000 years or so) when the climate was relatively mild and stable. This may have played a significant role in allowing a large scale agricultural civilization to develop which in turn set the stage for the industrial revolution and our current situation. Now we seem to be simultaneously eliminating our easily accessible fossil fuels while at the same time messing with the climate that helped us get to this point. All with a planet loaded with 7 billion people and counting. I am not in anyway saying that total doom is imminent but things are interesting. By the way you have probably said all of these things in many of your previous blog posts.

The past many hundreds of millions of years of the Earth's history, though, indicate that stabilizing negative feedbacks are very strong in the climate system. There has been much variation, but in the biggest pictures and longest time scales it has actually remained amazingly stable, even in the face of large changes in the energy output of the sun and big shifts in atmospheric chemistry. <br><br>A hallmark of positive feedbacks is that when you make a perturbation, the deviation increases at an accelerating rate. If you look at the time course of atmospheric methane, CO2, and temperature, you don't at the present see an acceleration. CO2 and methane trends are remarkably linear in the last decade plus; before that, methane actually showed a slowing in its rate of increase for a decade (before resuming its linear increase). Global land-based air temperature has increased steadily, linearly, by about 1C in the last 3-4 decades. Global sea surface temperature has actually been increasing more slowly in the last 10-15 years than it was before then, and the total increase is about half as much.<br><br>So, there is not the barest hint of even a suggestion of an undercurrent of any positive feedbacks happening in our ongoing warming trend. Sure, arctic methane releases may be ramping up, but they aren't steepening the slope of the global trend. What all this looks like to most scientists is that we will see gradual (not runaway) increases in gases until we stop generating so much of them, and in response the climate will gradually shift to a new, warmer system. There may well be some big blips on the way -- sudden ice melting events, realignment of ocean currents, etc., with corresponding sudden changes in regional climates. But global catastrophe? Again, not a hint. Lots and lots of economic and ecosystem stress for many decades to come? You betcha. But we have been living in a warming world and a declining empire for 4 decades already; we just need to look out the window to see what that looks like. Global warming and economic decline ain't the future, they are the present that nearly all of us have spent most or all of our lives in. <br><br>Agriculture... anyone who has gardened knows that monoculture means hunger. Every year is different (always has been), some things will flourish, some will fail, and it won't be the same things every year. Monoculture societies collapse. A society with diversified crops and practices is resilient.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c919475960147410373 title="comment permalink">6/25/13, 8:49 AM</a><br><br>

I've been trying to look within myself to see if my views of what is happening in the world are influenced by the apocalypse narrative. I've said several times that I'm not currently a near term extinction believer, and I discount every apocalypse event that comes to the fore from time to time, recently with assistance from JMG. So I don't think it's the narrative influencing me here. What influences me are the plethora of environmental degradation scientific studies, with climate change being just one aspect (though a vital one). It's hard to imagine these things not influencing the future path of our interlinked global societies (as the environment underpins everything), with the potiential for that influence to be collapse inducing (indeed, that is quite possibly already underway, though I'm thinking about the speed of that process). If I'm not being influenced by the apocalypse narrative (though I accept that I may be doing that subconciously), is it possible that those who think I am, may themselves be under the influence of the counter narrative, that there is nothing new under the sun and therefore we can pretty much tell how the collapses will play out from looking at past collapses?<br><br>There could be a bit of both here but I guess we may never tell until it's all over (in one case, I may still be around, in the other, I won't be).<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c9142682798181809439 title="comment permalink">6/25/13, 7:35 PM</a><br><br>

But these narratives serve (at least) two masters. One is to give us a tool to better understand how the world actually works - which is what the blog has been talking about with its comparative morphology of the life cycles of civilizations. All well and good. I'm convinced it does help us see. But these narratives also serve a second master - which is to give our world meaning, value, and psychological resonance in all sorts of ways. For example, I think people who deal in these historical morphologies often find a deep personal satisfaction in the patterns they identify - and they have to be suspicious of that satisfaction, because it may be leading them astray from the first project of better understanding the real world. They may impose that pattern in places where it doesn't really belong. Just as you and I have to be especially suspicious of our motivations for gravitating to a catastrophe scenario. <br><br>Catastrophes happen, so maybe one will in this case. But as JMG has pointed out, they are much, much more often predicted than realized - and that has everything to do with people's attachment to the narrative.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c128444413110749503 title="comment permalink">6/26/13, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>

Not being a scientist, least of all one versed in evolutionay science, I'm not trying to insist that I understand more than I do. What I'm trying to say is that my strong impression is that scientists understand less than people think about how populations evolve and maybe even less than they themselves like to think. <br><br>Hello JMG. I have read some stuff. I feel a bit sheepish. I exaggerated a wee bit. Realistically the field of evolution can't be ALL tribalism and rigidly enforced Stalinist conformity. And yes there must be SOME foggy notion of what biomolecular mechanisms are behind evolution. You say solid science. Yes, no doubt, there is much solid science. To me "science" is as much about the investigative process as it is about the end result. Can there ever be an end result? I think it's dangerous to close the book on any topic. <br><br>I know that there is active research. I remember an interesting article in New Scientist in the Jan 19/13 issue about some new advances in DNA research. It was about so-called "orphan genes" and how various processes in the DNA/RNA mechanism may generate these beasties. One idea being that they may come out of sequences of so-called "junk" DNA. I don't remember the word "evolution" in the article though. So the question in my mind is whether this is one of the mechanisms of evolutionary change. <br><br>If I recall correctly I think it was this same New Scientist article that made the proposition that DNA in the testis is probably a more effective generator of innovation because it is loosely wound and therefore relatively exposed to molecular machinery that can get at it to pick up sequences of base pairs so as to generate new types of genes. <br><br>But my impression from reading is that these are initial steps. It seems to me that what we have here is a topic of immense complexity and decades of work to be done. Again, I'm not a scientist, just an interested layman.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c6134741788400133603 title="comment permalink">6/26/13, 8:56 AM</a><br><br>

And there is no teleological drive to generate "innovation;" there are processes that create genetic variability (mutation, diploid genomes, sexual reproduction, etc.)." OK, well, my own impression from my own reading is that they are just scratching the surface as far as understanding these processes ie how DNA functions to give rise to a functioning organism, how DNA interacts with surrounding cellular machinery, epigenetic mechanisms, etc. Again, maybe inadequate exposure on my part to a field that requires years of intense study to acquire some kind of mastery. <br><br>But having said, that it's my further impression that people that say they understand the evolutionary process really don't. Mountains of work yet to be done, a lot in this theory of evolution as yet to be filled in. 3 billion base pairs?! And nobody really even knows how many genes we have at least according to what I've read. 20 thousand? 30 thousand? You tell me. <br><br>"Massively studied" you say. Well, it seems to me that there is a fair bit of study going on but "massive"? This isn't book-keeping we're talking about. This is multi-disciplinary subject matter that not every Tom, Dick and Harry can possibly have the intellectual heft to conquer nor the personal interest. Not that there's anything wrong with book-keeping. But nature's ways, especially at the molecular level, are not easy to tease out. <br><br>I'm not arguing in favour of teleological mechanisms. What I'm saying is that it appears to me that that this theory as it is cannot explain the things it purports to explain and that it looks to me that there are biomolecular mechanisms as yet undiscovered that account for what actually happens. I am arguing in favour of active inquiry and in favour of humility on the part of the scientific community ie not overstating what is actually known. The expression that bugs me the worst is "settled science". <br><br>And I am AGAINST entrenched orthodoxies that oppose new ways of thinking and looking at problems. I'll give an example: the Clovis First theory. For how many years was it risky to explore the idea that maybe it wasn't Clovis First? I've read that, in the past, archeological digs would stop when certain geological strata were reached to avoid the possible career stopping finds that might be contained below. <br> <br>Lynn Margulis died not too long ago (R.I.P.). She was a prof at UMass. I read that she was laughed at in scientific circles in the US but that her ideas were/are much more respected in Russia and Europe. She came up with that idea of symbiosis being a driving force in evolution ie genes of one species being incorporated in the genome of another. If I remember right she gave the example of how maybe the genes that determine the spiral structure of the inner ear may have been imports of genes of spirochete microbes that were incorporated into our own and probably that of other species. Some outside the box thinking. More people with her spine sorely needed.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c8066128020213545258 title="comment permalink">6/26/13, 9:01 AM</a><br><br>

The use of viruses to combat bacterial infections was black balled until recently because it was something the Soviets looked into for example.<br><br>But sometimes that isn't the reason. For example, science (not the people) is inherently agnostic. In Occam's Razor, a proper wording is 'the simplest workable, accurate theory wins', using god/s/ess/es fails at the workable stage.<br><br>It's an unknown, can't be quantified and how do we know which of the various contenders is correct, after all Hinduism could be accurate or a long dead religion. As far as science is concerned say a creator did it is equivalent to saying magic fairy dust or flying invisible hippos are the cause. The have equal chance of being correct and the same amount of explanatory value, which is none as far as science is concerned. (this is the simplistic form, but we have limited space here).<br><br>The divide here is not tribal, but an acknowledgement (which should be more known) that religion and science are entirely separate. Religion can't be used in science (outside sociology and neuroscience) but the scientific method can't be used to test the existence of god/s/ess/es. Unless the believers make claims about the physical world that can be tested and predict something,in which case that's now part of science's domain.<br><br>Besides for evolution you can make predictions if intelligent design was correct. Since we're the only intelligent beings we know (can't prove or disprove god exists remember), then we would guess that intelligent design would look similar to how we design things and exhibit similar traits. It doesn't, evolution follows patterns that are different to how humans design things. Now you could go and say that the creator/s's intelligence is different to ours, but this is similar to saying God is inscrutable (we can't say anything about that different intelligence) and put's him in the same category as the magic fairy dust above. <br><br>Your also exhibiting a bad behaviour that is part of the reason it's got to the point that creationists are simply dismissed. it's also a logical fallacy but I can't remember the proper name. Your asking for unnecessary detail and if the detail was provided, you'd (going by the standard behaviour) simply ask for more.<br><br>Fossils are a good example, an optimistic guess is that 1 out of 22 species leaves a fossil. It is slanted towards hard-bodied, river plain dwellers and some other characteristics, so are view is even more limited. So when someone says there's not enough linking fossils to prove evolution happened (say human evolution), they can be asking the impossible and if a linking fossil is found, simply refute it by asking for more detail. <br><br>You are simply asking for more detail than is necessary and exhibiting a behaviour that in the past leads to impossible demands.<br> <br>You are also flat out wrong. Given the standard idea (not entirely correct, but close) that separate species appear over geological time frames (read hundreds of thousands to millions of years), random mutation is a perfectly satisfactory explanation. Natural selection is the sorting process, since any innovation has costs. There's a bit more, but again limited space. <br><br>The field is not 'settled' but it is fairly solid.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c1633064654325761990 title="comment permalink">6/26/13, 6:11 PM</a><br><br>

Her career actually is a good example of how scientific thought really evolves. She proposed a lot of radical ideas. One of her hypotheses is now generally accepted as correct and has made its way into those basic biology texts -- the endosymbiont origin of organelles. The others have not been widely accepted. Is this because the ruling dogmatists all met in a smoke-filled room and decided this? No. It is because that one hypothesis was supported by additional information, including things that were not known at the time it was first proposed. The others have fallen by the wayside because this has not happened with them. <br><br>We even now see a growing acceptance of a sort of revived Lamarckism, with the discoveries that epigenetic genome modifications that are acquired during an organism's life can be passed on to offspring. The supposed "taboo" against Lamarckian thinking (inheritance of acquired traits) has been evaporating steadily once there was actual evidence that it really occurred and a demonstrated mechanism by which it happens. <br><br>It can be slow and sloppy, but in the end empiricism does eventually win and paradigms do shift, sometimes radically.<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c4417970256521844313 title="comment permalink">6/26/13, 7:32 PM</a><br><br>

It may turn out that they actually can't, that the cornucopians and apocalyptarians alike will continue to endorse their beliefs and act on them as surely as the yeast in a petri dish follows a predictable trajectory of growth and change. <br><br>Maybe it's precisely part of the very engine driving a social milieu's cycle of growth and decay that some if not many of its members will endorse crazy worldviews that don't square with the facts and stick to them. If so, it's probably pointless to persuade them not to do so. Unless, of course, one chose likewise to view one's own attempts to persuade them as in some way an inevitable part of the whole milieu's development.<br><br>My point is that sometimes it might be a good idea not to condemn a worldview just because it doesn't square with 'reality'. If it doesn't, should we dump it or should we seek to CHANGE 'reality'? The reality of the human world is that lots of people are greedy, spiteful, selfish, ignorant etc. Do we say, "This is the reality of the human world," and accordingly dismiss as sheer folly any worldview that believes it can be otherwise -- that humans can be caring, cooperative, wise etc?<br><br><a href=what-actually-happens.html#c8214950675642599937 title="comment permalink">6/29/13, 8:10 AM</a><br><br>

What Roger said is quite true: evolution hasn't been able to explain everything (about life). No scientific theory, after all, has ever been able to explain everything. Many scientists and intellectuals of reputable standing have continued to be dismissive of evolution. (Check out the volume of essays, 'Uncommon Dissent'.) And let's face it: no scientist or team of scientists has been able to cause a pond of water with some amino acids in it to give rise to all sorts of animal and plant species. Not even in a computer simulated model.<br><br>Neither do I see Roger as exhibiting any form of 'bad behavior'. Going through his post I never found him insulting anyone on this blog. And he was prepared to give the benefit of doubt to others.<br><br>It's fascinating how those who subscribe to evolution seem to have this kneejerk reaction towards any who dare to express any doubts about it. A few years back I expressed such doubts on my part at a certain message board (in perfectly civil language) and I received responses like 'you are a moron'. So much for detached, rational thought.<br><br>Finally, as to science and religion being strange bedfellows, it depends on how you define the two, which is by no means a settled issue. Certainly there have been respectable people like Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin who have very seriously tried to wed the two.<br><br>I anticipate this diversion on evolution vs intelligent design is probably going to devolve into another flame war again.

For one, I only have a sense of the x, and I am completely ignorant of the y. Not to say that he isn't x nor that he does y, but just that I don't know enough about either to argue with somebody else about it, lol.<br><br>Regarding Evolution:<br>We know a lot, but sum it all up and it's barely anything. I was firmly in the evolution camp until one day I did a thought experiment, basically constructing the mechanisms and environments that would have to exist for abiogenesis to occur. Everything was going swimmingly, and followed very logically, until I suddenly realized none of it was possible! (at least given what we know now). In short, there are some gargantuan gaps, the bridging of which could result in a revolutionary change of thinking about the whole subject.
