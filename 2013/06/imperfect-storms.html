<div dir=ltr style="text-align: left">
Last week’s post on the need to check our narratives against the evidence of history turned out to be rather more timely than I expected. Over the weekend, following hints and nods from the Fed that the current orgy of quantitative easing may not continue, stock and bond markets around the globe did a swan dive. In response, with the predictability of a well-oiled cuckoo clock, the usual claims that total economic collapse is imminent have begun to spread across the peak oil blogosphere.
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As I write these words, the slump seems to have stabilized, but it’s a safe bet that if it resumes—and there’s reason to think that it will—the same claims will get plenty of air time, as they did during the last half dozen market slumps<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If that happens, it’s an equally safe bet that a year from now, those who made and circulated those predictions will once again have egg on their faces, and the peak oil movement will have suffered another own goal, inflicted by those who have forgotten that the ability to offer accurate predictions about an otherwise baffling future is one of the few things that gives the peak oil movement any claim on the attention of the rest of the world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, worries about the state of the world economy are far from misplaced just now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the wake of the 2008 crash, financial authorities in the US—first the Department of the Treasury, backed by Congressional appropriations, and then the Federal Reserve, backed by nothing but its own insistence that it had the right to spin the presses as enthusiastically as it wished—flooded markets in the US and overseas with a tsunami of money, in an attempt to forestall the contraction of the money supply that usually follows a market crash and ushers in a recession or worse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The theory behind that exercise was outlined by Ben Bernanke in his famous “helicopter speech” in 2002:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>keep the money supply from contracting in the wake of a market crash, if necessary by dumping money out of helicopters, and the economy will recover from the effects of the crash and return to robust growth in short order. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That theory was put to the test, and it failed. Five years after the 2008 crash, the global economy has not returned to robust growth. Across America and Europe, in the teeth of quantitative easing, hard times of a kind rarely seen since the Great Depression have become widespread. Official claims that happy days will be here again just as soon as everybody but the rich accepts one more round of belt-tightening (also a feature of the Great Depression, by the way) are increasingly hard to sustain in the face of the flat failure of current policies to bring anything but more poverty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Meanwhile, the form taken by quantitative easing in the present case—massive purchases of worthless securities by central banks—has national governments drowning in debt, central banks burdened with mountains of the kind of financial paper that makes junk bonds look secure, and no one better off except a financial industry that has become increasingly disconnected from political and economic realities. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the boom is coming down. On the 18th of this month, Obama commented in a media interview that Bernanke had been at the Fed’s helm “longer than he wanted,” an unsubtle way of announcing that the chairman would not be appointed to a third term in 2014. Shortly thereafter, the Fed let it be known that the ongoing quantitative easing program would be tapered off toward the end of the year, and the general manager of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), one of the core institutions of global finance, gave a speech noting that central banks had gone too far in spinning the presses, and risked problems as bad as the ones quantitative easing was supposed to cure. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Markets around the world panicked, and for good reason. Most of the cash from quantitative easing in the US and elsewhere got paid out to large banks, on the theory that it would go to borrowers and drive another round of economic growth. That didn’t happen, because borrowing at interest only makes sense when growth can be expected to exceed the interest rate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whether it’s 18-year-olds taking out student loans to go to college, business owners issuing corporate paper to finance expansion, or what have you, the assumption is that the return on investment will be high enough to cover the cost of interest and still yield a profit. In the stagnant economy of the last five years, that assumption has not fared well, and where government guarantees didn’t distort the process—as happened with student loans in the US, for example—the result was a dearth of new loans, and thus a dearth of new economic activity. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Unused money in a bank’s coffers these days is about as secure as it is in the pocket of your average eight-year-old, though, and for most of the last five years, the world’s speculative markets were among the standard places for banks to go and spend it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That helped drive a series of boomlets in various kinds of speculative paper, and pushed some market indices to all-time highs. The end of the quantitative easing gravy train very likely means the end of that process, and for an assortment of other fiscal gimmicks that have been surfing the waves of cheap money pouring out of the Fed and other central banks in recent years. A prolonged bear market is thus likely. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Could that bear market trigger a run on the investment banks that, under the cozy illusion that they’re still too big to fail, have become too arrogant to survive?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Very possibly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The twilight of “Helicopter Ben” and his spin-the-presses policies also marks the end of the line for a coterie of economists and bankers, most of them associated with Goldman Sachs, who came to power after the 2008 crisis insisting that they knew how to fix the broken economy. They didn’t, and they are now in the process of discovering—as the neoconservatives found out before them—that while the American political class has almost limitless patience with corruption and venality, it has no tolerance at all for failure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I expect to see a fair number of prominent figures in the nation’s financial bureaucracies headed back to the same genteel obscurity that swallowed the neocons, and it’s by no means unlikely that Goldman Sachs or some other big financial firm may be allowed to crash and burn as part of the payback. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And beyond that? One way or another, the end of quantitative easing bids fair to trigger a wave of harsh economic readjustments, government defaults, corporate bankruptcies, and misery for all. An immense overhang of unpayable debt is going to have to be liquidated in one way or another, and there’s no way for that to happen without a lot of pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That may well involve a recession harsh enough that the D-word will probably need to be pulled out of cold storage and used instead. Will the remaining scraps of democratic governance in Europe and America, and the increasingly fragile peace among the world’s military powers, survive several years of that?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s a good question, to which history offers mostly unencouraging answers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, these deeply troubling possibilities aren’t the things you’ll hear aired across the more apocalyptic end of the peak oil scene, if recent declines in global stock markets continue. Rather, if experience is any guide, we can expect a rehash of the claims that the next big economic crisis will cause a total implosion of global financial systems, leading to a credit collapse that will prevent farmers from buying seed for next year’s crops, groceries from stocking their shelves, factories from producing anything at all, and thus land us all plop in the middle of the Dark Ages in short order. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s here that the issue discussed in last week’s post becomes particularly relevant, because there’s a difference—a big one—between the imaginary cataclysms that fill so much space on the doomward end of the blogosphere and what actually happens. Financial history is full of markets that imploded, economies that plunged into recession and depression, currencies that became worthless, and all the other stage properties of current speculations concerning total economic collapse, and it also has quite detailed things to say about what followed each of these crises. Without too much trouble, given access to the internet or a decently stocked library, you can find out what happens when a highly centralized economic system comes apart at the seams, no matter what combination of factors do the deed. The difference between what actually happens and the whole range of current fantasies about instant doom can be summed up in a single phrase: negative feedback. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the process by which a thermostat works: when the house gets cold, the furnace turns on and heats it back up; when the house gets too warm, the furnace shuts down and lets it cool off. Negative feedback is one of the basic properties of whole systems, and the more complex the system, the more subtle, powerful, and multilayered the negative feedback loops tend to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The opposite process is positive feedback, and it’s extremely rare in the real world, because systems with positive feedback promptly destroy themselves—imagine a thermostat that responded to rising temperatures by heating things up further until the house burns down. Negative feedback, by contrast, is everywhere.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s not something you’ll see referenced in any of the current crop of fast-crash theories, whether those fixate on financial markets, global climate, or what have you. Nearly all those theories make sweeping claims about some set of hypothetical positive feedback loops, while systematically ignoring the existence of well-documented negative feedback loops, and dismissing the evidence of history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The traditional cry of “But it’s different this time!” serves its usual function as an obstacle to understanding: no matter how many times a claim has failed in the past, and no matter how many times matters have failed to follow the predicted course, believers can always find some reason or other to insist that this time isn’t like all the others.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>happens that I’ve been doing plenty of thinking about negative feedback recently, because I’ve fielded yet another flurry of claims that my theory of catabolic collapse must be false because it doesn’t allow for the large-scale crises that we’re evidently about to experience. Mind you, I have no objection to having my theory critiqued, but it would be helpful if those who did so took the time to learn a little about the theory they think they’re critiquing. In point of fact—I encourage doubters to read <a href=http://www.ecoshock.org/transcripts/greer_on_collapse.pdf>a PDF of the original essay</a>—the theory of catabolic collapse not only assumes but requires large-scale crises. What it explains is why those crises aren’t followed by a plunge into oblivion but by stabilization and partial recovery.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The reason is negative feedback. A civilization on the way down normally has much more capital—buildings, infrastructure, knowledge, population, and everything else a macroeconomist would put under this label—than it can afford to maintain. Crisis solves this problem by wrecking a great deal of excess capital, so that it no longer requires maintenance, and resources that had been maintaining it can be put to more immediate needs. In addition, much of the wrecked capital can be stripped for raw materials, cutting expenditures further. Since civilizations in decline are by and large desperately short of uncommitted resources, and are also normally squeezed by rising costs for resource extraction, both these windfalls make it possible for a crumbling society to buy time and stave off collapse for at least a little longer; that’s what drives the stairstep process of crisis, stabilization, partial recovery, and renewed crisis that shows up in the last centuries of every historically documented civilization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That sequence is so reliable that Arnold Toynbee could argue, with no shortage of evidence, that there are usually three and a half rounds of it in the fall of any civilization—the last half-cycle being the final crisis from which the recovery is somebody else’s business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our civilization, by the way, has already been through its first cycle, the global crisis of 1914-1954 that saw Europe stripped of its once-vast colonial empires and turned into a battleground between American and Russian successor states.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>We’re just about due for the second, which will likely be at least as traumatic as the first; the third, if our civilization follows the usual pattern, should hit a battered and impoverished industrial world sometime in the 22nd century, and the final collapse will follow maybe fifty to a hundred years after that. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course there are plenty of people these days insisting that industrial civilization can’t possibly take that long to fall, just as there are plenty of people who insist that it can’t fall at all. In both cases, the arguments normally rest on the blindness to negative feedback discussed above. Consider the currently popular notion, critiqued in<a href=../../2013/05/the-pleasures-of-extinction.html> one of last month’s posts</a>, that humanity will go extinct by 2030 due to runaway climate change. The logic here follows the pattern I sketched out earlier—extreme claims about hypothetical positive feedback loops, combined with selective blindness to well-documented negative feedback loops that have put an end to greenhouse events in the past, propped up with the inevitable claim that the modest details that distinguish the present situation from similar events in the past mean that the lessons of the past don’t count.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Current rhetoric aside, greenhouse events driven by extremely rapid CO2 releases are anything but rare in Earth’s history. The usual culprits are large-scale volcanic releases of greenhouse gases, which<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>boosted CO2 levels in the atmosphere up above 1200 ppm—that’s four times current levels—and thus drove what geologists, not normally an excitable bunch, call “super-greenhouse events.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If massive CO2 releases into the atmosphere were going to exterminate life on Earth, these would have done the trick—and super-greenhouse events have happened many times already, just within the small share of the planet’s history that geologists have enough evidence to study. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What stops it? Negative feedback. The most important of the many negative feedback loops that counter greenhouse events is the shutdown of the thermohaline circulation, the engine that drives the world’s ocean currents. The thermohaline circulation also puts oxygen into the deep oceans, and when it shuts down, you get an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Anoxic_event>oceanic anoxic event</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ocean waters below 50 meters or so run out of oxygen and become incapable of supporting life, and the rain of carbon-rich organic materials from the sunlit levels of the ocean, which normally supports a galaxy of deepwater ecosystems, falls instead to the bottom of the sea, taking all its carbon with it. It’s an extremely effective way of sucking excess carbon out of the biosphere:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>around 70% of all known petroleum reserves, along with thick belts of carbon-rich black shale found over much of the world, were laid down in a handful of oceanic anoxic events in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Oceanographers aren’t sure yet of the mechanism that shuts off the thermohaline circulation, but it doesn’t require the steamy temperatures of the Mesozoic to do it. At least one massive oceanic anoxic event happened in the Ordovician period, in the middle of a glaciation, and there’s tolerably good evidence that a brief shutdown was responsible for the thousand-year-long Younger Dryas cold period at the end of the last ice age. Not that long ago, global warming researchers were warning about the possibility of a shutdown of the thermohaline circulation in the near future, and measurements of deepwater formation have not been encouraging to believers in business as usual. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, other patterns of negative feedback are already under way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Across much of the tropical world, increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere are helping to drive bush encroachment—the rapid spread of thorny shrubs and trees across former grasslands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Western media coverage so far has fixated on <a href=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/nature-up/2013/jun/21/blind-starving-cheetahs-climate-change>the plight of cheetahs</a>—is there <i>any</i> environmental issue we can’t reduce to sentimentality about cute animals?—but the other side of the picture is that shrubs and trees soak up much more carbon than grasslands, and in many areas, the shrubs involved in bush encroachment make cattle raising impossible, cutting into another source of greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, the depletion of fossil fuels imposes its own form of negative feedback; as petroleum geologists have been pointing out for quite a while now,
<a href=http://www.resilience.org/stories/2009-12-07/uns-future-scenarios-climate-are-pure-fantasy>there aren’t enough economically recoverable fossil fuels in the world</a> to justify even the IPCC’s relatively unapocalyptic predictions of climate change.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Apply the same logic to the economic convulsions I mentioned earlier and the same results follow. The reason a financial collapse won’t result in bare grocery shelves, deserted factories, fallow fields, and mass death is, again, negative feedback. The world’s political, economic, and military officials have plenty of options for preventing such an outcome, most of them thoroughly tested in previous economic breakdowns, and so these officials aren’t exactly likely to respond to crisis by wringing their hands and saying, “Oh, whatever shall we do?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>For that matter, ordinary people caught in previous periods of extreme economic crisis have proven perfectly able to jerry-rig whatever arrangements might be necessary to stay fed and provided with other necessities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Whether the crisis is contained by federal loan guarantees and bank nationalizations that keep farms, factories, and stores supplied with the credit they need, by the repudiation of debts and the issuance of a new currency, by martial law and the government seizure of unused acreage, or by ordinary citizens cobbling together new systems of exchange in a hurry, as happened in Argentina, Russia, and other places where the economy suddenly went to pieces, the crisis will be contained.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The negative feedback here is provided by the simple facts that people are willing to do almost anything to put food on the table, governments are willing to do even more to stay in power, and in hundreds of previous crises, their actions have proven more than sufficient to stop the positive feedback loops of economic crisis in their tracks, and stabilize the situation at some level. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
None of this means the crisis will be easy to get through, nor does it mean that the world that emerges once the rubble stops bouncing and the dust settles will be anything like as prosperous, as comfortable, or as familiar as the one we have today. That’s true of all three of the situations I’ve sketched out in this post. While the next round of crisis along the arc of industrial civilization’s decline and fall will likely be over by 2070 of so, living through the interval between then and now will probably have more than a little in common with living through the First World War, the waves of political and social crises that followed it, the Great Depression, and the rise of fascism, followed by the Second World War and its aftermath—and this time the United States is unlikely to be sheltered from the worst impacts of crisis, as it was between 1914 and 1954. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the same way, the negative feedback loops that counter greenhouse events in the Earth’s biosphere don’t prevent drastic climate swings, with all the agricultural problems and extreme weather events that those imply; they simply prevent those swings from going indefinitely, and impose reverse swings that could be just as damaging. If the thermohaline circulation shuts down, in particular, there’s a very real possibility that the world could be whipsawed by extreme weather in both directions—too hot for a few more decades, and then too cold for the next millennium—as happened around the beginning of the Younger Dryas period 12,800 years ago. Our species survived then, and on several other similar occasions, and the Earth as a whole has been through even more drastic climate shifts many times; still, it’s a sufficiently harsh prospect for those of us who may have to live through it that anything that can be done to prevent it is well worth doing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

Yet it’s the imperfect storms, the ones we can actually expect to get in the real world, that ought to feature in predictions of the future—if those predictions are meant to predict the future, that is, rather than serving as inkblots onto which to project emotionally charged fantasies,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>excuses for not abandoning unsustainable but comfortable lifestyles, or what have you. </span></div>

The period 1914-1954 is given as the first wave. But almost all of the world's petroleum consumption to date occurred after 1914, and more than 85% of it since 1954. So that I can visualize how your theory of catabolic collapse works, I have a few questions.<br><br>In your view, is oil exploitation and the economic boom it produced part of the unsustainable, but still temporarily effective, methods of keeping Western civilization going between the first and second waves of catabolic collapse? If so, do you interpret the the second wave as starting at the peak of conventional oil production in late 2005 and proceeding through the Great Recession of 2007-9, the present shaky plateau, and so on until we reach the point where only ~15% (if that) of the world's conventional oil that will be extracted remains, somewhere around 2050? <br><br>Finally, what sorts of systems could sustain a low-petroleum society for 50-100 years in the aftermath of the second wave? Are you thinking that some combination of energy sources like solar PV, wind turbines, coal, and biofuels will allow some semblance of Western society to persist for another century or so until a third wave strikes?<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c9025534794577241948 title="comment permalink">6/26/13, 9:58 PM</a><br><br>

Three or four decades of rapid global warming followed by a shutdown of the thermohaline circulation and a plunge into near-Ice Age temperatures would pretty much guarantee a huge death toll. My point is that there's a great deal of territory between business as usual and the end of the world, and that territory is where our future will be. <br><br>Heraclitus, my guess is Caesarism -- more or less authoritarian states centered on a charismatic leader, probably without the party and ideological apparatus of Fascism or Communism. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Thijs, exactly -- it's only in the US, which was almost absurdly sheltered during the 20th century, that the thought of going through the forty years following 1914 over again seems mild. As for nukes, it's always possible that some could be used -- but if I lived as close to the Ruhr as you do, I'd be worried, too. <br><br>Grebulocities, my guess -- and it's a guess -- is that the version of industrial society that comes out of the next round of crisis will be what I've called scarcity industrialism, and will involve drastically lower standards of living for most people, as well as a sharply lower population. That could be supported in some countries, for a while, on remaining fossil fuels plus biofuels plus other renewables. The final period before the ultimate collapse would then see the same thing, with even lower standards of living, contracted to a very few countries, and without the fossil fuels. Long before that happens, most of what's now the industrial world will have reverted to peasant subsistence economies, padded out with a bit of salvage.

Although you are focusing our attention on negative feedback for good reasons (it is not as sexy as it's positive counterpart), I would argue that positive feedback is also ubiquitous. Oscillatory patterns in nature that are not due to simple decaying resonance (e.g. a ringing bell: resonance plus negative feedback) involve driven systems that include positive feedback. Essentially the positive feedback continues until some point at which saturation occurs and/or a critical threshold is crossed at which time the positive feedback loop stops or is replaced by negative feedback. In my world positive feedback in op-amp circuits is used to make oscillators. The saturation process can be due to opposing negative feedback mechanisms as you mention. There are some systems, however, that undergo irreversible state flipping through positive feedback although the initial states are often unstable or metastable. The classic example is a pencil balanced on its tip, hence the concept of a tipping point.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c518866640804457999 title="comment permalink">6/26/13, 11:03 PM</a><br><br>

I think of Orlov's description of the population reduction (not trivial) that took place after the fall of the USSR. iirc, he said that it wasn't all that spectacular: after a while you might notice that you had been attending a lot more funerals than christenings -- something like that. <br><br>it made me realise that a human die-off doesn't have to mean piles of corpses in the streets, mass graves being filled with quicklime by grim crews of FEMA workers, etc. it could be as simple as an ambulance service that used to get you to the ER on time not doing that any more; or a gradual abandonment of the policy of prolonging the lives of very ill, very elderly people into the vegetable state and beyond. or increased child and infant mortality, which imho is already happening in the US (the US had the 12th lowest infant mortality rate in the world in the 1960's -- now it's the 34th: either other countries are catching up and surpassing US health care standards, or US health care standards are slipping; I suspect the latter, particularly for the poor who just plain can't afford any medical care.)<br><br>I reflect rather dismally that tens, maybe hundreds of millions have died in Africa from one cause and another -- massacres, AIDS, famine, drought, civil wars -- during my lifetime, and yet there are still African states, languages, etc. ... despite losses and tragedies that seem pretty apocalyptic in scale. collapse, I guess, looks like Africa: brutal resource extraction, concentration of wealth, corruption of government, immiseration of ordinary people, reduced life expectancy. it was either B Sterling or W Gibson I believe who quipped "Sooner or later, everywhere becomes India."

The concept of annihilation is so compelling that it assumes disproportionate weight in reasoning about events to come. <br><br>A simple example of this principle is that the odds in Russian Roulette are 5 to 1 in favor, but the value of payoff is so weighted towards the bad that it's baffling that anyone would play it at all. Proponents of imminent doom have been psychologically captured by the tendency to contemplate the worst; but should you point out that there are still 5 empty chambers, they impatiently dismiss such evidence-based reasoning by reiterating the dreadful nature of the worst outcome. Thus are they protected against counterargument...<br><br>One unrelated, but fussy, technical point: when you say <i>"The opposite process is positive feedback, and it’s extremely rare in the real world, because systems with positive feedback promptly destroy themselves"</i>, I have to take issue. <br><br>Positive feedback is ubiquitous, not rare. Everything that swings, buzzes, rustles, vibrates, waves or hums is, after all, exhibiting positive feedback. Negative feedback is just as ubiquitous as positive, and ordinarily a little bit more: this is, if nothing else, a characteristic of our thermodynamic world. <br><br>What I presume you meant to say is that systems <b>dominated by</b> positive feedback do in fact blow themselves to bits. Forgive my fretful pedantry, but misstatements such as this - especially from such a careful writer as yourself - tend to take on a life of their own.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c5024216066287860115 title="comment permalink">6/27/13, 3:03 AM</a><br><br>

There are plenty of people, the vast majority probably, who both want and assume that the current system to continue. And so it will continue for a good while to come, shifting shape on the way down but trying its best to look like business as usual. Many rules will be changed to support this, until some crack appears too big to be papered over. <br><br>God knows when the next big crack will come along though: sometime between today and just after it happens I suppose. That's the frustrating part - not being able to have a clear picture on timing. This causes some of us to make predictions on timing that we have no business making. We want certainty, but we can't have it, so we tell stories about it. And sometimes we call these stories analysis.<br><br>wrt to the financial markets, what has happened since 2008 is that the rules have been changed to encourage markets to go up. And so they have gone back up, substantially so. If you were expecting a mass outbreak of hyper-inflation or sudden debt deflation, based on your understanding of the rules, then you will have been disappointed. Who would have predicted that the Federal Reserve would have bought bonds and expanded liquidity on the scale that they have? Insiders probably did. But external critics didn't, for the most part. Those who trusted the insiders and the business as usual bias did well, I'm sure.<br><br>And how long can this continue on? Probably for quite some time I'm guessing.

My own personal sense of what collapse is likely to look like come out of my own anthropological work in Kazakhstan. A not-so-bad scenario is Almaty in the mid-nineties. The normal economy had collapsed, but society held pretty much together. There was a significant die-off underway for most of a decade- mostly people dying early for lack of medical care, young people not having babies, and men killing themselves with alcohol and every form of recklessness. Mass migration out of the country as well. The other side of the spectrum was the fact that when you spoke with anyone over the age of 60, they had direct experience of famine and war. They (and certainly their parents and grandparents) had experienced personally hunger, exile, mass deportations, gulags, pogroms, and being at the mercy of a dysfunctional, unpredictable, even lunatic state. The people of this city were the survivors of that, and everyone knew individuals and families who hadn't survived it.

Many with very good reason. The middle class has been sacrificed at the alter of the reserve currency and globalization. Folks can't help but notice when one by one their neighbors and friends get tossed off the middle class wagon. <br><br>But the tools to understand what has happened aren't available to many of them. The entire concept of financialization and what that means to productive industry has not and won't be explained to them. So you get liberals and conservatives pointing at the same mess, misidentifying it, and then deriding the other side for creating it. <br><br>A complete reset of the economy would do the trick but we missed the opportunity to do so 5 years ago. The course has been set. <br><br>I would disagree on one point though. Those losses which needed to be cleared from the economy are, at least in large part, now on the books at the central bank and the GSEs (which were used as fall guys to siphon up toxic MBS). The central bank is not going to put them out on the market they are going to sit on them and digest the losses for the banking system over the next 20 to 30 years. F&amp;F are going to try and do the same, taking their losses and bailouts in piecemeal fashion over a long time horizon. <br><br>The taxpayer will be slowly drained. There will be no sudden collapse that wipes out the banking system. The biggest danger is a rejection of US debt and currency on the global market. That would be catastrophic perhaps, but the dollar is being decommissioned as we speak. It may take decades to play out as well. <br><br>Will<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c1659482949529315703 title="comment permalink">6/27/13, 6:28 AM</a><br><br>

This creates several distortions, one of which is to compress the time scale in which we imagine these events will play out. We also seem to be drawn to those scenarios that seem like they can play out in that timespan. We imagine these things happening to us and how we will react, I suppose because it makes us feel insignificant to think we won't get to see how it works out. <br><br>This distortion masks how fast things really are changing. If you went back in time even a dozen years and showed people the headlines of today they would be dumbfounded. <br><br>It is certainly true that dramatic and traumatic events happen to individuals, so some (many) will be caught up in major disruptions and to them it may feel like Armageddon at the time, but there are others who are not and are struggling mightily to persevere. So things change fast but not everything changes in an instant, or in one lifetime.<br><br>One of the other distortions is to superimpose the arc of our own lives onto the events of the world outside. To old men the world seems to be falling apart at a rapid pace, while to young men nothing seems to happen fast enough and everything should be possible. It is really hard to imagine what life would feel like living through history's major changes, but as you have pointed out before many never knew that they were – they were too busy living their lives.

It is reasonable to expect these to be wantonly burned in coming decades as the energy situation becomes increasingly desperate - even if the energy pay-off in the end barely justifies the trouble.<br><br>In neither forum (ASPO or Age of Limits) was my point in this regard adequately addressed. I therefore conclude that the Peak Oil community has yet to think through the implications of the abundance of potentially burnable very-low-grade carbon reserves in any kind of considered way. <br><br><br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c4489718235276301715 title="comment permalink">6/27/13, 7:40 AM</a><br><br>

What's more, these will still be sufficiently substantial at that time to permit the US to exercise world domination for another generation or so after that. <br><br>If you doubt this is true, just consider that world domination by a single power was an entirely realistic possibility at the time of World War I in the early 20th century, based on resource consumption levels that are a small fraction (just a few percent) of what they are now. It will thus likely be more than a century before energy resources are constrained to the point that the world domination project is no longer viable due to resource limits. That puts us into the early 22nd century – more than a generation after the conclusion of the second wave of crises of world industrial civilization posited (very plausibly, in my view) by JMG.<br><br>All that is required for the scenario entailing continued US global hegemony in 2070 to come to pass is for US elites to exercise the raw destructive power they wield with sufficient ruthlessness in coming decades. Obliterate North Korea in a sufficiently wanton way, for example, and even Russia and China would be filled with the fear of God. <br><br>For it continues to remain very much open to question whether they are in a position to stalemate the US on the basis of the Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) scenario that prevailed during most of the 20th century standoff between the US and the old Soviet Union. If they were, then I doubt the US would be encircling those powers on every side and in every other part of the world as aggressively as in fact they are.<br><br>To cite just one example where the conventional wisdom concerning increasing parity among world military powers seems badly off, the ongoing revelations associated with the Snowden affair strongly suggest that the US is far and away ahead of everyone else in the area of cyberwarfare, in both a quantitative and the relevantly qualitative senses. It therefore becomes increasingly implausible to suggest that cyberwarfare will serve as an equalizing arena for today’s major world powers, leading in the long run to effective military parity. Snowden’s revelations imply, to the contrary, that the US has quietly been acting to make itself unsurpassable in the area of cyberwarfare for quite a long time, and with a great deal of success.<br><br>What’s more, the belligerent tone currently being adopted by the US government against Russia and China in connection with the Snowden affair suggest that US elites are increasingly moving in the direction of thinking along the wantonly aggressive lines I am suggesting. They would not, of course, blow North Korea to smithereens in an awe-inspiring demonstration of their destructive power - and their wantonly reckless willingness to use it - in order to secure custody over Snowden. However, they will prove very much willing to engage in such chilling acts of destructiveness when the stakes are sufficiently high in coming years and decades.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c9124970905574817913 title="comment permalink">6/27/13, 7:45 AM</a><br><br>

This practice has been "successfully" implemented for 10 000 years, but it is doomed to end with ecological collapse, resulting in the planet becoming uninhabitable for large mammals.

While there are always those who posit more extreme scenarios, the consensus seems to be generally within the same range of possibilities that you propose. I don't equate the processes of what are often more open forums 'working the problem' as an endorsement of a particular outcome. Most sites have their own variations on 'negative feedback', including yours; their own cast of characters, so to speak. Some sites allow for a broader range of discussion than others. I think this is useful. <br><br>I often take a position somewhat beyond my base of beliefs simply to stir the pot, see what comes up (as I'm sure you've noticed). I do this when I cook as well, not always successfully, but, in time, I tend to gain more than I lose. I take neither my cooking nor my views about the future too seriously. I'll never make a living doing either.<br><br>I haven't declared NTE as an impossibility, though it is quite low on my list of probabilities. What is clear is that humans are able to adapt to a wide range of conditions, and I don't see much point in dwelling on Nature's final solutions. Beyond that, the question of how long nature will tolerate humans repeating the same mistakes, again and again, is a valid one, IMO.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c7234243778416127293 title="comment permalink">6/27/13, 8:07 AM</a><br><br>

It got pretty rough in the 90s (pretty much the same economic hardships since the 80s, when Ceauşescu's regime imposed austerity in order to pay for the country's external debt) as the transition towards market economy was under way. I grew up in the 90s, and some things are better now but others are worse. <br><br>I could only have dreamed of something like today's internet back then. Me and my parents lived in a two-roomed flat, we had a black and white TV set, no car (we never ever owned one) and no telephone either. Not even talking about owning a washing machine, microwave oven, or a computer. It was a modest but more than bearable life. <br><br>Stuff began changing in 1994-1995, when we got cable television. I owe the fact that I can speak fluent English mostly to watching Cartoon Network in my childhood, since back then it wasn't translated and I also had English class at school. We still had the black and white TV for a couple more years. <br><br>Today I am one of many people in this country who has more than one family member working and living in Western Europe, and I am considering following that path myself. My country has been doing its best to copy the West, for the better and worse. As far as human rights and political freedom are concerned, we're better off now because of conditions imposed by the West for joining their political, economical and military blocs. But also, more and more cars are filling the streets (and sidewalks, for that matter - we're not very good at parking spaces), more and more big and ugly suburban-type neighborhoods are popping up around the periphery of urban areas, and our culture is being drenched in a ugly mix of Balkan bling-bling gypsy music and a Western-copied decadent pop culture. There are a few creative and talented exceptions, but mostly it's like that. Also, huge churches are being built all aver the place.<br><br>I'm not saying that we lost some past glory. We were always a peripheral people, subject to someone else's imperial ambitions in the region. The very creation of Romania in the 19th century is owed to French political support. Which is why our attempts to follow the West go way back. And why during communism, Romania was not as obedient as Moscow would have liked it to be. But I notice that some things that you people in the West are trying to learn, we've always done and considered normal. Like preserving food in pickle jars. Or buying food from local markets, at least fruits and vegetables. And if you owned a house, having your own garden was pretty much an obvious choice, even in the city, and poultry or farm animals as well. Near the block of flats where I used to live there was a house, and people there raised pigs. It wasn't at all unusual to see cows and horses grazing the grass near the tramway lines, but that's another story. :D (that sort of thing still happens once in a while)<br><br>In this new suburban sprawl here you don't see that gardening stuff. Of course I buy stuff from big supermarkets myself, because some are cheap. But I can't help noticing that a lot of things are being built and an ever increasing rate, while our population is in a serious decline and our culture is being turned into this bland nothingness. <br><br>I'll end this long comment with a song which you may like.

What's more I don't think it is necessary to desire that they be. In fact, I think it may be counterproductive.<br><br>For whatever reason, I have come to realize that *I* am different than most. That is, my values are not shared by the many.<br><br>This has been a great source of anxiety for me as I pondered whether something was wrong with "me or them." What I have come to realize, is there is nothing "wrong" or "right" with either. <br><br>At a base level, we are who we are simply because of wiring (this does not preclude choice, however, as I'll get to later on).<br><br>If you think about it, breeds of dogs have different personality traits, for example, one breed being very aggressive, another being very docile.<br><br>It stands to reason that many of the personality traits we consider to be part of us by “choice” are no more chosen than they are by a breed of dog. Each of us falls on a continuum between competing traits, some of which are:<br><br>Risk phobic – Risk philic<br>Compassion – aloofness<br>Social – Isolantionary<br>Controlling – easy going<br>Docile – Aggressive<br>Conformist – Non-conformist<br>Etc…<br><br>That these traits are “wired” into us, however, does not mean that a fatalistic attitude should be adopted - that is it doesn't matter what I do, things are as they are. In fact, the opposite is the case!<br><br>Discover who you are, and be it with Gusto! This is a choice of great importance. Also, in this process, you will have input, and choices must be made between varying traits as they come into conflict, forcing you to place higher value on some rather than others. <br><br>Why is that relevant here?<br><br>I think that it is safe to say that the majority of the people reading this blog are outsiders. As outsiders, it is a considerable challenge to learn who you are and to be comfortable with it as there will be very little positive feedback from society.<br><br>For myself, I have accepted that I have been born into the wrong time if my desire is to live in a society that shares and rewards my values. If JMG is right, that time is coming sometime in the future, but I will be long dead before it does!<br><br>Be that as it may, I must be who I am, because it is me. Whether or not it is materially relevant is beyond the scope of what I can choose.<br><br>Here’s the rub. Learning who you are and being true to it is valuable in and of itself. To put it plainly, there may be no practical benefit to choosing to be true. The world may or may not be a better place as a result! At least in a material sense (you could even lose your life, while your enemies laugh the whole while).<br><br>The world will certainly be a better place for at least one person, however. And that is a great and profound thing.<br><br>(Warning, I’m about to say what appears to be the opposite of what I’ve said so far.)<br><br>There is a huge paradox, however, and that is that being true to who you are, does have the potential to *change* those around you, making them (inspiring them) to be more like you - re-wiring them, so to speak. This is also a great and profound thing. <br><br>The effect of changing others is largely local though, and for any who desire to change the world on a grand scale (besides failing because such a desire is false to the self) will fail unless they have been blessed with a heroic spirit (which spirits come very seldom, and not by their owners choosing!).<br><br>Anyway, being “true” for the sake of changing others is to be false, so it is impossible to affect others by desiring to do so! This is how you know whether you are on the path to being true to yourself: you stop desiring others to be other than they are. They can no more be different than they are than you can, though both can pretend to be. <br><br>Pretending prevents the honest work that actually matters.<br><br>Again, FWIW.<br><br>Peace<br><br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c4668323524289562798 title="comment permalink">6/27/13, 10:15 AM</a><br><br>

There are good reason for such pattern.<br><br>"Obliterate North Korea in a sufficiently wanton way, for example, and even Russia and China would be filled with the fear of God."<br><br>That's a neocon fantasy. The US pretty much obliterated all that there was to obliterate in North Korea in 1950-1953, with about 650,000 tons on bombs and napalm dropped on pretty much everything from cities to villages and any bit of infrastructure that could be of use to the CPV or the KPA.

First of all the USA has always encircled Russia and China. Western Europe, Japan, Turkey, Iran, South Korea etc were bases or potential bases for US bombers and missiles. If anything the 50's and early 60's were the worst period as the soviets had not yet deployed reliable and numerous intercontinental weapons, while the USA had both them and many more shorter range ones that could be used from the afore mentioned forward bases. In fact I suspect that the USA might have well managed to incinerate the USSR losing maybe a couple of cities or so in exchange in that period.

(hint: it is not the USA). It is going to leave Afghanistan and in order to do so it is willing to talk to the same talibans it kicked a decade ago. <br>It has managed some penetrations in Asia in the former soviet sphere and can push back the chinese a bit in Africa.

Still, duly noted, and we'll be back to the core theme of this series in the coming week. <br><br>Nestorian, first, you need to look at the economics of burning really low-grade carbon. If the cost of extraction is higher than the profit to be made by burning it, taking into account the whole system costs involved, it won't be extracted and burnt -- and that works whether costs are counted in dollars, joules, or what have you. Furthermore, as Gail Tverberg has been pointing out for a while now, if your total net energy gain isn't enough to maintain today's sprawling energy infrastructure, that in itself puts a hard lid on how much can be burnt. <br><br>As for your second point, I spent much of last year explaining why the US is far weaker and more brittle than it looks, and its chances of getting through the next few decades with its empire intact are minimal at best. As I recall, you disagreed with me then, too. Now of course you have every right to do so, but I've seen no reason so far to change my view that the US today is in the same position as Britain exactly a century ago, and is facing the same fate -- except that we don't have a friendly power ready to bail us out and take over our empire, as they did. The current toothless bluster of the US government over the Snowden case is hardly evidence of any great national strength! <br><br>Laughing, no argument there. A complete unwillingness to deal with the laws of thermodynamics is responsible for a lot of folly these days. <br><br>Con-science, no, it's a classic example of the kind of too-linear thinking that pervades modern culture. Quinn's taken a complex historical and ecological reality, flattened it out into a simplistic conflict between Good and Evil, and sent his wind-up Evil doll lurching along a linear course toward total destruction. Negative feedback in this case is taking the form of bush encroachment, rapidly evolving pesticide and herbicide resistance, climate instability, and all the other factors that are making agribusiness increasingly brittle and vulnerable to breakdown. <br><br>Rita, thank you. Amish life, by the standards of most of the world, is pretty luxurious; we'd be very fortunate if that's the kind of lifestyle Americans can have at the bottom of the curve. <br><br>Ghung, well, as I've been saying all along, it's certain that humanity will eventually go extinct, and it's always possible that something will do us in sooner rather than later. My quarrel is with those who insist that such an outcome is inevitable -- and use the rhetorical gimmicks outlined in this post to do it. <br><br>Moshe, oh, I'm sure you can think of a country that has a lot of spare US dollars, no love for the US, and ambitions to replace the US as the next global hegemon. I don't claim to be able to prove that, of course, but if you compare what's going on in the US to the run-up to color revolutions elsewhere -- the systematic delegitimization of the government among all major citizen blocs via social media and the internet generally, for example -- it does look remarkably similar.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c3035109067241319357 title="comment permalink">6/27/13, 1:42 PM</a><br><br>

To take your smallest point, the US can no longer afford to “[o]bliterate North Korea in a sufficiently wanton way,” because North Korea is now a nuclear power, and the blow-back on key Asian allies could not be sustained—by the US! As for Russia and China, both have been aware for years that the US is crazed, greedy and ruthless, but what of it? That is just everyday politics, and has not prevented either country from achieving strategic victories. One worth mentioning is the Russian defeat of the US in the Georgian War of August 2008. The Russians used main force to repulse Georgian occupation of South Ossetia, and the US found itself both unable (insufficient forces in-theater) and unwilling (the propaganda war was lost and escalation too risky) to support the Georgians. That defeat in turn put an end to NATO expansion. <br><br>Despite seeming omnipotence, the US has been losing its recent wars. Iraqi oil production is largely back on line, but the oil flows east, to China, not west to the US, nor do the American oil companies get a cut of the profits. The US is withdrawing troops from Afghanistan by airlift, (spiking and) abandoning its military equipment—which it lacks the means to extract and save! Again, if the US did indeed induce the Taliban to reverse its position on opium (originally they were against it) the opium money now flowing is not flowing to the US. The Syrian revolution seems over almost before it started and the idea of backing the insurgents (actually foreign mercenaries) with a no-fly zone seems dead-on-arrival in the face of a flat Russian determination to back the Syrian government with effective anti-aircraft weaponry. Again, the US does not have the forces in-theater to do what would need to be done. <br><br>The US tantrum over Snowden is a sign of incompetence and weakness, not omnipotence. Everything Snowden has said in public has been known to the Russian and Chinese governments—not to mention countless bloggers—for years. It was only the American public in particular and the larger world community in general that was unaware of what the NSA was doing. This is a huge propaganda defeat, and now that the cat is out of the bag the US wants revenge: They want to catch Snowden and torture him. But this in turn just exacerbates the bad propaganda, and calls more attention to the NSA's misbehavior. <br><br>It is one thing to wield terrifying power. It is quite another to wield it in a way that achieves goals and objectives. The US wields its power ineffectively and thus actively accelerates its decline. <br><br>--Gaianne<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c6678400007686405261 title="comment permalink">6/27/13, 1:48 PM</a><br><br>

Your global thinking abilities are unparalleled. In fact, there was a paragraph there when you started going off about finance and I wondered, did somebody else write this week's post? But then you threw in a "bids fair" and I breathed a sigh of relief-- I knew it was you. (I'm teasing that you're the only author I know who uses the phrase. Shows how little I read.)<br><br>I recently finished reading the Tao Te Ching. I guess it went way over my head. I really have no idea why you recommended it as a book on systems thinking. I saw it totally as a mystical/ spiritual book (maybe it was the translation I had, R.B. Blakney).<br><br>As for this week's topic of negative feedback, maybe a couple months ago Kunstler had a podcast interview with Orlov. In it, when describing how Russia is today, Orlov more or less said everything's great now (I'm paraphrasing). He seemed to be contradicting his entire point of the Soviet Union's collapse. I wanted to ask him, "Well, did they collapse, or didn't they? I don't get it." Maybe collapse doesn't mean apocalypse.<br><br>I think most folks (myself included) get stuck in binary thinking, even when we're aware it's happening. We can follow an upward trend line or a downward trend line, but why is it so hard to combine them? The stairstep curve shouldn't be that hard to understand. I think it may have something to do with human expectations and perception, but I'll have to think about that some more.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c8264059396074977920 title="comment permalink">6/27/13, 1:55 PM</a><br><br>

And that the citizens are noticing, at least subconsciously, that things are heading downhill, and they blame it (rightly) on the leadership, or lack thereof. Foreign money may be flowing to a few paid internet trolls, but that requires very little money, thus could come from much more numerous minor players. And it has a significant effect only if it hits a chord with the audience, i.e., it can only amplify existing social currents.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c9160052274913085213 title="comment permalink">6/27/13, 2:00 PM</a><br><br>

A very interesting read.<br><br>One thing I notice in this model is lack of a pathway from the waste stream to the resource stock. That is, recycling is not explicitly represented. Implicitly, it seems to be incorporated into the rate at which capital stock becomes waste, or perhaps as a component of the resource replenishment rate. I'm not sure this accurately models the recycling or "scavenging" process, because it provides no means by which the resource replenishment rate can be affected by the existing capital stock or the cost of maintaining it.<br><br>I would think that it is exactly this process that is enhanced during a depletion crisis. When resources are plentiful, why recycle? But when resources become scarce or economically unviable, scavenging becomes commonplace. Witness the cannibalization of building stone to create new and simpler structures during and after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. Should we view the recycled stone a resource or as an addition to the existing capital stock at the cost of some existing capital stock?<br><br>If it is treated as a resource, one can see how a depletion crisis could cause a stage-like collapse. The recycling of the stone both reduces the existing capital stock and increases the resource stock, leading to an equilibrium state at a lower level of capital stock. At some stage -- as dictated by the law of diminishing returns -- this recycling process becomes uneconomic. A new depletion crisis then ensues: the society must adjust to yet another and lower level of resource availability (the scavenging component has dried up) and capital maintenance cost (the second law of thermodynamics suggests a lower capital stock during a catabolic process). A new round of scavenging then becomes feasible. The cycle repeats until scavenging cannot significantly affect the rate of resource regeneration. The depletion crisis becomes, in effect, a maintenance crisis, possibly at a severe depletion level.<br><br>As a second refinement, I would think that lumping in human labor with other forms of capital is problematic. Humans differ from other forms of capital in that motivation is an extremely important factor in the value of that particular capital resource, whereas it is non-existent in, say, a machine that automates some process. Motivation is highly dependent on the prospect of some reasonable share of the capital being produced accruing to the human whose labor is involved in producing it. The "requisite share" is, in turn, affected by the degree to which that share satisfies the human's basic needs and then wants. There is a feedback loop in there which might be a useful enhancement to the model.<br><br>Just some food for thought...<br><br>Thanks JMG for yet another thought-provoking article, and to JF for taking an initial stab at modeling these processes.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c6011880332649579810 title="comment permalink">6/27/13, 2:22 PM</a><br><br>

That apocalyptic and utopian thinking are a part (but just a part) of human culture, in particular Judeo-Christian traditions is without doubt, but fast collapse as a dynamical process could be just that, a dynamical process dependent on present conditions of dependency.<br><br>I have elsewhere tried to define collapse of our complex civilisation as a ‘relatively’ sudden collapse in societal complexity as might be measured by exergy use/ mass of complex society- or more directly, a major drop in the ability of civilisation to usefully use energy (and other resources). Further, that such a drop would force a radical re-structuring of how needs and wants were met. It does not mean ‘hero-to-zero’ in one foul swoop! It does not mean certain doom for all and sundry. Our civilisation could experience global collapse, or multiple collapse phases; and/or forced localisation and localised collapse. Properly defined, fast collapse is not incompatible with catabolic collapse.<br><br>But why ‘fast’ collapse, what is ‘relatively”? The Western Roman empire, the Maya, or the Angkor declined over generations. The central issue for the rate of a collapse episode is, I would argue, the levels of complex interdependency, the speed of processes (from supply-chains to financial flows), the de-localisation of those welfare supporting functions, and the ‘networked’ structure of contemporary dependency. Each of us (in the developed world) rely for our welfare upon a vast network of high speed interdependent conditions smeared over the globe. <br><br>When Aleric sacked Rome, life at that moment continued as before in the far flung regions of what remained of the Roman empire, where dependent conditions remained largely localised and signaling moved at a horse’s pace. But when the Icelandic volcano spewed its ash cloud or the tsunami in Japan crippled local production, supply-chain shocks were felt around the world within days. The fuel blockades in the UK (2000) indicated how interdependency could rapidly cause wider systemic failure. And as for global financial shocks, they live in seconds. In the broadest sense, the complexity of our globalised economy is orders of magnitude greater than past civilisations prior to collapse- and this means something. This does not mean history is not a guide, but it is not a rule.<br><br>And what of negative feedback? Our complex globalised economy has been stunningly resilient by just such processes. One of it’s characteristic features has been its ability to displace risk in time and space. Civilisations of the past where largely localised and hierarchical that controlled to a significant degree the conditions of their own dependency. Our contemporary globalised economy is characterized by multiple networks of dispersed, globalised and interdependent control. The interest of those who wish to protect themselves -national governments, monetary authorities, banks, national populations do not control the sphere of their dependencies, they do not even understand them, nor could they. They may act to protect themselves, and by doing so further de-stabilize their surrounding networks, feeding back into their own reduced welfare supporting function. Here I think lies another myth, the illusion of control. <br><br>To dismiss the idea of fast collapse as mere ravings of fantasists, deluded souls beating to the drum of some archaic myth divorced from contemporary reality is an unfair characterization of those of us, who like you, are trying to understand the nature of our predicament. <br><br>Wishing you well,<br>David Korowicz<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c937241690801638604 title="comment permalink">6/27/13, 3:03 PM</a><br><br>

Namely, that the objectives underlying the attacks of Afghanistan and Iraq are at variance with those stated and widely believed by the public.<br><br>It could be the case that the US does not attack North Korea not because it could not obliterate that country at will but because it is useful to have an external foe in the wings to justify the extraordinary expense of the DoD, NSA, DHS, and all of the other entities involved in the National Security industry. Ditto for the unending wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The intention was never to "win" the wars. The objective was to fight them. War is big, big business, and a sure way to justify the financial rape of US citizens under the guise of "National Defense". Just think of it! One doesn't even have to produce a product or service that people will willingly pay for! One only has to influence a very small number key politicians and they'll extract the money from the population for you! What could be better? <br><br>We then abandon the equipment in Afghanistan because it's served its purpose -- to make money for the manufacturer. We abandon it there because bringing it home would deny the next manufacturer its cut when the next war must be fought.<br><br>Ditto Snowden. Quite frankly, the NSA/DHS/DoD axis could care less if the American people know about their activities. There's nothing we can do about it anyway. But there's no way they're going to let a "crisis" like this go to waste. Nope, it is clear from the Snowden incident that enemies lurk everywhere and we must redouble our efforts -- and budgets -- to "protect ourselves" from them. Trust me when I say this: if they wanted Snowden, he would have "committed suicide" by now.<br><br>There is a hierarchy of interests being served by the current system. Most people understand that the rank-and-file as at the bottom of this pyramid. What most people don't understand is that the Federal Government is not at the top of the pyramid. It is the next level up from the rank-and-file. Don't agree? Then consider that the Federal Reserve lends money to the US Government, making the Federal Government subservient to it (and its member banks) in this respect. Ditto multinational corporations, who have essentially dictated US trade policy to the obvious detriment of its citizens. How can this be?<br><br>There are, of course, higher layers to this pyramid: the IMF, the World Bank, the Bank of Internal Settlements. And those who hold controlling interest in such institutions. Ever wonder why the BIS can launder money for drug cartels and the IMF can rape the finances of nations (and then monopolize their capital and resources) with impunity? What does this imply about the positions of the various players in the pyramid?<br><br>So when we see that Iraqi oil is flowing east to China rather than west to the US, what does that tell us? That China is the rising power? This misses the point. The real power lies not in nations but in the Corporate and Financial players who control them. Oil flowing east to China only indicates that it is in the financial interest of these players that it flows that way: more money, power, and control accrue to them under this regime than if the oil goes to the US or to the EU.<br><br>The US government omnipotent? Think again. The US government is really just a convenient tool. It is either omnipotent or impotent as the occasion requires.<br><br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c6954130148528380198 title="comment permalink">6/27/13, 3:17 PM</a><br><br>

The reason being that both coal and charcoal are the same, pure carbon. <br><br>Except that coal always has impurities (sulfur for example), while charcoal is often pure. Charcoal can also have more energy in it. So when we switched to using coal to make steel, we actually reduced the quality,but it became cheaper and was compensated by other advances. <br><br>All but a handful of alloys and metals can't be melted by charcoal. Liquid tungsten will freeze in lava, so it probably won't be melted by charcoal.

As I commented in several earlier posts referencing your paper on systems collapse, it's a very well-thought-out scenario, and where it departs from reality -- in assuming that governments will take the minimum possible action, when this is not what history shows -- you state that presupposition up front. I'm curious what kind of responses you get to your paper; when it gets quoted here by commenters, it's almost always being used to support the claim that there's nothing that can be done (and thus, inevitably, that there's nothing that ought to be done).

I’m never quite sure what standard of news reporting goes on in the US?<br><br>It was fascinating that the "sort of" announcement was an intention to stop quantitative easing at some point in the future and not an actual specific plan to do so on a particular date. Magic at work! Perhaps they were testing the waters with their toes and found that it was too cold? It certainly had repercussions here.<br><br>I would have directed the funds from quantitative easing into infrastructure projects whilst those funds were still worth something rather than pumping up the financial system, but no one asked me. That money is going into beefing up dodgy balance sheets (that’s my take on it anyway and I could be wrong) and I’m not entirely convinced that it is public funds well spent. A cynic would possibly describe it as a heist.<br><br>Catabolic collapse has a largely unconsidered benefit in that it reduces the complexity of our society. Too often people respond to situations by adding layers of complexity. Someone in the comments mentioned FEMA workers on scene after a disaster and surely it possibly may have occurred to them that the local community has to get off their bottoms and respond (or indeed prepare in advance) too? Relief workers are a product of a society that has the surplus to support them. So many things are like this.<br><br>Which gets me to weddings, of all things. Why is it that people want to spend so much money on a wedding? The problem is that they all end up looking the same. Boring, dull and not even remotely perfect. Try something different, how about eloping and saving the cash? What’s wrong with these people?<br><br>I reckon this happens on a big scale too as various countries mimic the economic leaders and end up pursuing the same strategies with the same (or remarkably similar) outcomes. QE anyone?<br><br>Surely, any future after catabolic collapse will be a future of many different societies and ways of living. Dissensus will rule the day out of necessity.<br><br>PS: I’ve been working too hard of recent times.

I'm sure this gap is where our attention should be focused.<br><br>How could the electricity go off all around the world? Well for a start, we have seen cascading black-outs that started with a software bug at a control room in Ohio, and cascaded to 55 million people in the US and Canada, halting all rail and aircraft in New York. 10 years later could the decaying infrastructure mean even bigger problems? Or is it a cyberattack? Or an EMP nuclear attack? How do we find out what happening?<br><br>With the power out, the High Frequency Traders on Wall Street can't function, causing a panic in London and Tokyo, leading to a UST bond collapse, wiping trillions from the asset books of banks around the world. LIBOR markets instantly freeze up, meaning the end of commercial interbank lending and import/export letters of credit not being honoured. This brings all international trade to a halt, as it did in 2008. Then it took 4 days, but then it was a surprise, now they are ready for it.<br><br>The collapse in USTs causes as cascade of corporate bond collapses as well, including electricity generators. Suddenly the coal miners are worried that the generators might not be able to pay for the coal, so they stop supplying coal until things sort themselves out. But before they do sort themselves out, Goldman Sachs declares bankruptcy over a $300 billion deal in credit default swaps that has gone bad, and the entire system locks up. Just like it did in Cyprus a couple of months ago.<br><br>So without coal moving to the power stations, the electricity goes off throughout the US, and the internet goes down. Nobody wanted it to happen. It just happened, at least I think it did, but its difficult to know with the phones and TV not working.<br><br>What would be the effect on the world of the internet going down in the US ? A similar panic in the UK, Europe, Shanghai and Japan, with the same outcome.<br><br>Yes, some countries probably are still running, but who would know, if we can't get in touch with them?

Is that right? I'd be surprised at this, as I have difficulty finding negative feedbacks mentioned but no difficulty finding positive feedbacks (many involve methane but are different positive feedback loops). Indeed, the one you mention, appears to have a positive feedback at the south pole, though a negative feedback at the north pole. However, I've also seen an hypothesis which suggests that the THC may not slow down at all, as El Ninos might increase. Consequently, it seems like conjecture that negative feedback loops will somehow regulate temperatures so that it doesn't get too bad. Maybe it will, maybe it won't. <br><br>However, it seems as though you're invoking negative feedbacks to propose only that the extermination of all life is unlikely, not that conditions won't become very poor. Indeed, you see there being a severe die back. In this case, I'm not sure why you bring up the negative feedback idea. If negative feedbacks merely allow some kind of life to continue, maybe even a few humans, this has nothing to say for civilisation and societies, other than negative feedbacks won't halt or slow collapses.<br><br>Even more, in comments, you anticipate an effective collapse at the next crisis, since the picture you paint of the resulting society is very different from the ones we live in now.

Too many people forget that Industrialism was started with wind and water, not coal as pop culture says it was."<br><br>I think this is right. We have many problems, but we have a few things going for us and one of them is the enormous amounts of refined metals we now have. I know nothing about working metals but it seems to me that with some refinement a solar furnace could provide the heat to work metals, if charcoal is scarce. With this kind of technology people could create a whole fleet of simple (mostly human powered) machines, like bicycles, treadle water pumps, treadle sewing machines and of course guns.<br><br>I think it's very important to draw a distinction between industry, which existed in many forms before the industrial revolution, and industrial civilisation. Leo is right many doomers equate the two and imagine a return to the stone age as the only possible future after the collapse of industrial civilisation. I doubt people will forget the idea of the wheel, the gun, the crank, the pedal, the treadle or the blade.<br><br>With over 7 billion people and a reasonably fit adult able to produce in the region of 70 to 100 watts of power on a sustainable basis, it seems to me that the real power source of the future is human power. My son and I, some years ago, felled a years supply of firewood (for our very small house) with a bow saw, hauled it home (about 800 hilly yards) on a handcart, cut it into short logs with the same bow saw and split it with an axe. Compared to a chainsaw and a tractor this is slow work, but it is pleasant work, quiet enough to talk, listen to the birds sing and enjoy the countryside. It was not drudgery, it got the job done and it took a fraction of the energy. A society that can make handcarts and metal saw blades would not be a bad place to live, it would be a quieter, more convivial and safer world that our modern world.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c1600845886600262164 title="comment permalink">6/28/13, 2:41 AM</a><br><br>

I have three, 21, 18 and 15. I've done three things to try to inform them. First, we've changed our lifestyle quite substantially, with a focus on energy conservation, growing our own food, less consumption, etc. So we've tried to hint towards the shape of the future in our actions, which always speak louder than words. Second, we've always had talk in the household about managing their expectations of the future, the need to understand the times they live in and to live appropriately. We've talked openly about the big themes of energy depletion and economic challenges and the future not being like the past. But we've done this within the context of the long arch of history, of slow change, of ups and downs, of nobody knowing the details, etc. As you say it doesn't make sense to scare them and parents can only plant seeds after all. Third, we've tried to steer them individually to learning practical skills wherever they can, to working hard and avoiding betting on a life plan based only on sitting in offices typing stuff into computers. Which is probably a good thing anyway, regardless of energy depletion. <br><br>I don't know how successful this will be, though. They'll probably rebel as kids do and follow their own path to some degree. But maybe we've given them some reference points to which they can return if they need to. Time will tell!<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c4819342871728756303 title="comment permalink">6/28/13, 3:43 AM</a><br><br>

Yes they can't power modern industrial civilization, but they have powered basic industrialism and improve living standards compared to human only energy systems. Besides, if you start by reducing consumption and improving efficiency, you increase what they can do. <br><br>And the ones that powered proto-industrialism weren't even perfected and new ones have been added since there (like solar). And ancillary technologies have appeared that can dramatically extend their use. Electricity can be used in radios or telegraphs and allows aluminum to be smelted. Napoleon had an aluminum dinner set, it must have taken a ridiculous amount of coal/charcoal to make. Mind you recycling is easier for aluminum, but other chemicals are similar in that electricity is the easiest way to get them. <br><br>Still have to do research on it (I have a lot to read first), but my impressions from metallurgy is that a lot of its advancements weren't energy based. More along the lines of better design, realizing you can do "X" and get a better outcome than anything else. Improved furnace designs would certainly help each bit of charcoal go further.<br><br>Precision tools and machining might be similar, some other technologies could also count in this category. <br><br>One of the main things I plan to explore in 10-20 years time when I'm a professional engineer and have some experience.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c4157924436244710958 title="comment permalink">6/28/13, 5:05 AM</a><br><br>

To this day people who were there reminisce about what a pleasant wedding it was. I don't get the lavish-wedding thing at all, either. As for summer, why, it's hot, humid, and sticky, and the garden's happy as can be. <br><br>Dave, that is to say, you can cobble up a cascading series of worst case scenarios to get the world, at least in your imagination, to a preselected future. The whole point of this week's post is that this sort of thing may be an amusing hobby but it's not a useful way of trying to anticipate the future, because the resulting predictions reliably fail. <br><br>Mkroberts, no, not quite. What I'm saying is that in the real world, greenhouse events get shut down by negative feedback instead of going to Venus-like extremes, financial panics get terminated by negative feedback instead of running us straight into the Dark Ages, and so on. I'm making a statement about the observed behavior of systems. That doesn't mean that things won't get bad -- you're quite correct there; what it means is that in the real world, crises are followed by periods of relative stabilization. It fascinates me that so simple an idea is so hard for so many people to grasp!<br><br>Wildeye and Leo, bingo. A deindustrial society is not a society without tools, without energy, or without the prospect of a decent and humane existence; it's simply a society without factories, and without the absurd levels of energy use per capita we're used to these days. Getting there, mind you, will likely be rough...<br><br>Mallow, watch the Gulf Stream. If it stops flowing, Western Europe is in deep trouble. How fast might it shut down? Nobody knows. <br><br>Ando, no argument there!<br><br>Joseph, a good systems theorist ought to anticipate that, because that sort of self-organizing property is a standard feature of complex systems. In a crisis, it's another form of negative feedback. <br><br>Mike, that's an excellent example, because it shows the capacity for dramatic recovery when (a) the collapse is sudden, and (b) you've got plenty of resources. That's another reason why fast-crash theories don't work: if some sudden event were to terminate industrial civilization tomorrow, and there was any significant number of survivors, they'd rebuild in short order, because an industrial society is the only way they know how to live, and all available resources would go into a quick rebuilding of the old order. It's when change unfolds over generations that there's no recovery of prior conditions, because nobody alive knows how things worked back in the day.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c7385779531212913925 title="comment permalink">6/28/13, 10:53 AM</a><br><br>

My grandparents lived through the same era, not to mention the Depression beforehand, and their lifestyles from 1930 to 1945 were very much along the lines you've sketched -- that is to say, not much different from life in a Third World country today. <br><br>Ric and Ezab, thanks for catching the typo. <br><br>Phil, the thing that fascinates me about the use of the USSR's collapse by fast-crash theorists is that the USSR collapse followed my scenario, not theirs -- a period of crisis, followed by stabilization and modest recovery. Is Russia today a wasteland full of corpses? Not hardly; people adapted, and life goes on. <br><br>Leo, the wild cards there are the economics and thermodynamics of fossil fuel extraction. If you no longer have the surplus energy to be able to afford mountaintop removal mining, or tar sand extraction, or what have you, then that process stops; equally, if the remaining reserves don't have enough net energy, factoring in all systems costs, to justify their extraction, then they stay in the ground. My working guess is that a lot of theoretically extractable fossil fuels will never reach the surface due to one or the other of those factors. <br><br>DeAnander, it's an interesting question, and yes, I've seen some movements in that direction. <br><br>KL, good! <br><br>Cherokee, well, a reduction in complexity is clearly good for weddings!<br><br>MawKernewek, I said "above 1200 ppm," which includes the Cretaceous peak. I was specifically referring to the Toarcian, Aptian, and Cenomanian-Turonian greenhouse events; in each of those, the thermohaline circulation shut off when CO2 got past 1200 ppm or so, according to the link I included in the post. <br><br>Wildeye, thanks for the links! It amazes me that people forget just how complex a technology has been maintained without factories, using hand tools supplemented with the occasional water wheel and windmill. I may have to do a series of posts on that one of these days, just to drive the point home. <br><br>JP, I read CHS occasionally, but don't really have an opinion on his ideas; his subjects of interest have some overlap with mine, but not that much. As for China, of course -- thus the massive effort they're making to build domestic demand. <br><br>Dltrammel, good! <br><br>Phil, once again, the difference between my views and the fast-crash theorists is not that I don't expect sudden crises and discontinuities. It's that I argue, on the basis of ample historical evidence, that those sudden crises and discontinuities will be followed, not by an accelerating plunge into the abyss, but by stabilization and partial recovery. I wonder how many times I'll have to repeat that here before it finally sinks in!<br><br>Angel, I haven't written about Harris, though I've read some of his work; I think he pushes his cultural materialism model further than it can really be taken, but he's got some excellent points.

We have global hegonomy in that respect; as much as we are a failure at land wars in Asia (which do blow up stuff and make money for the Military-Industrialists though). Anyway, that is one reason why we spend as much money as the entire rest of the world on our War Department [Cough, cough, dept. of defense]. And is possibly why the rest of the developed world cuts us so much economic slack, lets us use so much oil and keeps using the US Dollar as the world's reserve currency, to our trade benefit. For the time being, they figure it's cheaper to let us be the "muscle" (world's policeman is a misnomer, what the developed nations perceive as trade with the poorer nations is more like an old fashioned extortion racket.)<br><br>So I would say, we are already being "propped up" and might have collapsed shortly after the old Soviet Union without the cooperation and help we've had so far. How long this will last depends on how usefull the arrangement is seen by the majority of our partners. It could come unwound rather quickly when they change their minds.<br><br>As for China, regardless of all the power of a command economy, they are joined at the hip to the West; without Western consumers their business model collapses. They also have a far more restive population than the U.S., and are up against real resource limits and environmental limits when their trade declines. China's ability to control the extraction of oil, food or other resources from Africa could get very difficult if the U.S. Navy leaves the Indian Ocean. They may be trying to build bases there, but I don't think their ability to project power will be large enough or soon enough to sustain any Imperial ambitions.

When the chair you sit in was made by your spouse, or when the meal you eat was not only cooked but *grown* by your spouse, or by your joint efforts, there's a kind of connection that imho is different and deeper in quality than the bonding of, say, going out shopping at IKEA together on the weekend for a new chair, or catching some great italian food downtown.<br><br>I'm not knocking the charm of great italian food downtown -- love it actually -- and I'm sufficiently corrupted by civ, I do confess, to enjoy shopping at times [shocked I tell you shocked]; but I'm speaking here of a kind of emotional bonding that I feel with my current partner in our present, gradually-simplifying lifeway, that I have not felt before under more urban circs. <br><br>I dunno if "simple" is quite the word (we just spent 2 days installing the drip irrigation system I designed, and before that we've been spending almost 2 weeks dealing with 3 downed trees, and we think a whole lot about our well and whether it really needs some refurb); but a lot of our activities are directed towards simple *goals* like food and firewood, shelter and long-term subsistence on our modest property. And we work together a lot, because a lot of this work is hard and tiring and much easier with two people pitching in.<br><br>There's a kind of gratitude I feel when my partner is out there in the blazing sun, swatting bugs and connecting drip emitter hoses right along with me, that is different in quality from the kind that I feel when my partner takes me out to dinner or buys me a trinket. Both are nice, but I think the teamwork, strategising and grunt labour that go into the "simpler" lifestyle build a special kind of bond, and I suspect that it can, with the right people, forge that bond more strongly than some more frivolous "consuming together" activities that -- for some -- comprise the bulk of their time spent together.<br><br>I can only compare it to water and roots. Feels like the team effort on subsistence activity encourages deep tap roots of affection and mutual reliance, while the frivolous fun stuff is like surface watering that encourages lots of frilly root growth near the surface. As any arborist can tell ya, the surface stuff is nourishing but it doesn't contribute much to windfirmness. Trees without deep roots can blow over in the big gusts. And now I'm sounding so darned preachy that I think I'd better get off the soap box.<br><br>Holy cow, my Captcha says "teragod"!<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c4121475131804008496 title="comment permalink">6/29/13, 5:39 PM</a><br><br>

Projections of the effect of our present interglacial are largely based on the results of ice core examinations revealing something of past conditions. <br>Although the worn out phrase, 'this time it is different', is normally fallacious when applied to the rise and fall of civilizations, I suggest it could have some truth in it as regards global warming for the following reasons. <br>(1) The combination of orbital forcing cycles such as obliquity, eccentricity and precession vary dramatically over time. The present and near future do not portend a negative feedback cooling trend. Berger &amp; Loutre (sciencemag June 2008) suggest that we will simply skip a whole cooling phase. <br>(2) As oceans warm, they expel CO2 and cannot absorb more until a 'cooling trigger' is pulled. That cooling trigger, in the past, has been the combination of the CO2 sequestration by trees, bushes and grasslands and cooling support from the orbital forcing cycles mentioned above. Never, since the glacial/interglacial cycles began over a million years ago, has this strong negative feedback mechanism failed. However I strongly suggest that humans have destroyed Gaia’s ability, at the present time to effect a cooling cycle. <br>(3) One of the primary observations made by scientist James Lovelock was that although the sun has increased its insolation or solar irradiation effect gradually since life emerged, survival temperature has been maintained. According to the Lovelock/Margulis Gaia Theory, it is life-forms themselves that maintain life sustaining balance. Several of these balancing mechanisms have been destroyed over the last few thousand years, a key one being the loss of trees. One of several atmospheric air-currents was responsible for moving the moisture emitted by trees in the Amazonian rain forest northward toward the American Southwest. True, there have been several serious droughts in the area over the last couple of thousand years; however, the rainforest remained – till now. As I write, Phoenix AZ is recording record high temperatures.<br>(4) We're off the chart with predictability of how increasing CO2 will affect climate. There is no evidence that CO2 has been this high over the last million years. <br>(5) I am wearied by hearing how hot it was millions of years ago. Yes, CO2 was many times higher than now. But let's remember that humans had not yet evolved and greenhouse gases were necessary to maintain the surface temperature necessary for life. In fact the greenhouse effect is still necessary but it must be maintained in balance. Gaia was doing a pretty good job until she was overrun by humans.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c7502307296594947743 title="comment permalink">6/30/13, 5:31 AM</a><br><br>

Both are convection cells driven by solar heating with poleward flow vectored west (NE and SE trades) and flow towards the equator vectored east (the Westerlies) by coriolis effect. Their boundaries are shifting slightly due to climate change, the Hadley looks like it will expand about 2 degrees northward by the end of this century; but no major changes in circulation. Water is much denser than air, and can hold much more heat, so changes in the thermohaline circulation could affect this. However, due to the slow speed of the circulation, it will probably take centuries. Even over a millenium the result will tend to show as slight boundary shifts and variations in strengths; the basic pattern is defined by earth's orbit, axial tilt, atmospheric composition and thickness, and to a lesser extent, continental configuration; this last affects currents more than wind though except for very high mountains such as the Andes or Himalayas.<br><br>I think the Trade Winds will remain usable for your purposes.

It seems that "What Happens Next" is in the context of civilizations, a long process. I'm 36, likely to live through the second phase of collapse of industrial civilization, wondering what exactly to do.<br><br>Because "What Happens Next" is that most people go on their way of acquiring as much stuff as possible - which is ironically the problem, and a necessity, if we are to pass on some of the tools the next generation will need.<br><br>As someone who has no assets and a lot of student loan debt, coming from a background of working for law firms, and opposed to being involved in the mainstream economy because that's the very thing causing problems; I can see that doing a job and getting up enough money to buy land, even a suburban neighborhood plot, gives me rights going forward, and a place to pass on that is the only sine qua non for sustainability: land.<br><br>To get land, I need some work, and I think working on selling some of the alternative energies like solar and wind is an option: while it can't last forever, done well especially, it prolongs the catabolic collapse. So I feel I've resolved a dilemma: getting land and doing something that doesn't hasten problems but prolongs solutions.<br><br>And this points to a larger question, about time and the self. If I were to summarize our present crisis - particularly the unwillingness to deal openly and honestly about resource constraints, which "closetedness" of awareness leads both to the delusion that it will go on forever, and the delusion that it will suddenly fall apart irreparably - it's basically that there's a giant unspoken conspiracy to do whatever we want with no regard to the future or to the consequences of present actions.<br><br>So it's important I think to discuss this in a religious context and I'm glad you went there, because, so I've come to think after reading this series and other perspectives, religion is about the relation of one's self to the past, to the future, and to other selves like one's self in the present.<br><br>Thinking about the long-term cycles of civilization get one thinking about one's relationship to those long-term cycles, which to me ends up being spiritual. The pressure though, is to accommodate one's sense of connection with the future to the real world demands of the present: the need to carve out some space for oneself in a contracting world.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c3827100234798799354 title="comment permalink">6/30/13, 4:28 PM</a><br><br>

At least not a linear type of feedback. It would essentially be the catastrophe many of us would hope to forestall. <br><br>One of the other effects of a cessation of thermohaline circulation should be a warming of the cold ocean floor. The geothermal heat which exists below the seabed will no longer be countered by the cold brine from the arctic branch of the thermohaline system. In turn this would lead to a release of any and all frozen methane, another *positive* feedback event. Another nonlinear event, or catastrophe. <br><br>As to whether our next catabolic step will be fast or slow, I have an analogy. Apologies if you have already used it yourself. <br><br>As a watermelon sits in the summer sun, you do not notice it changing for perhaps a week or so. All the bacteria and yeast proliferating in its interior do not affect the rind, until the whole thing collapses over perhaps an afternoon. <br><br>From the viewpoint of a yeast organism, this collapse might not be noticed at all. So long as there is sugar in the watermelon flesh that has not yet been converted to vinegar, the yeast might get along just fine. That is, until it finds itself in the gut of a fruit fly maggot.

The notion that negative feedback mechanisms woven into the fabric of reality will prevent the storms from being 'complete' ones offers scant comfort in this respect.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c6632870526384181078 title="comment permalink">7/1/13, 6:16 AM</a><br><br>

The more you bend, the harder the spaghetti pushes back, trying to retain its stable (straight) form. To a point. Then the structure of the spaghetti becomes damaged, the force rushes to a single point and breaks the spaghetti, and the aftershocks snap it, not in two, but in at least three pieces, sometimes more. (Science News, Nov 12, 2005)<br><br>Homogenic negative feedback -- building dikes to hold back flooding, superstructures to hold up buildings, economic tweaks to support a crumbling economy -- use what we might call "communal will" as one of the key structural elements: when overstressed, it crumbles and people simply give up on an enterprise, whether it is a dike, or a business, or a town, or a civilization.<br><br>Communal will is a complex compound that involves people, religion (or belief-systems), energy, raw materials, and a story to bind it all together. It's tough stuff: it (almost) never breaks all at once, and you'll have stray clumps of it that resist virtually all outside forces for centuries.<br><br>The focus on "perfect storms" is understandable: communal will withstands single shocks pretty well. It's not so good with multiple concurrent shocks.<br><br>What isn't so understandable is our penchant to ignore erosion, because it seems the force against which communal will is least durable. The most common form of erosion is story-erosion: a creeping discrepancy between the story and reality. The bigger the discrepancy, the more energy goes into telling the story in a louder voice (another form of negative feedback). At some point, the story breaks, and communal will loses its central binding element and begins to crumble.<br><br>I'm going to speculate that story-erosion is a major component in Spengler's civilizational cycles, perhaps the main component, because civilizations can survive other shocks, like religious transformation, energy and raw material shortages, attacks and even conquests. They don't survive a loss of their story.<br><br>The US built its communal will on the twin stories of freedom and opportunity. First, opportunity, in the form of boundless raw material and slave labor in the 1500's. Then religious freedom in the 1600's. Then enlightenment ideals of freedom in the late 1700's, that carried us through the abolition of slavery. Then back to opportunity in the late 1800's and our own industrial revolution. Then freedom again, from WWII through the end of the Cold War with the Soviets. Then again financial opportunity up to the present.<br><br>But the dissonance grows. In a zero-sum economic game, freedom and opportunity are in opposition -- my freedom comes at the expense of your opportunity, and vice versa.<br><br>Furthermore, our national leadership -- the focal point of the story that binds our communal will -- has apparently abandoned both narratives. Opportunity is increasingly restricted to the ultra-wealthy, and even they -- if they aren't stupid -- understand how shaky is the ground they stand on. All the symbols of freedom important to the story -- search and seizure, habeas corpus, fair and swift trials, privacy, redress, freedom of speech, assembly, and religion -- have been under increasing attack since the 1950's, particularly in the last decade.<br><br>If the US is a nation of neither freedom nor opportunity, then what is it?<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c648907281053046243 title="comment permalink">7/1/13, 9:19 AM</a><br><br>

A serious aspect of my concern is the need for methodologies that can preserve what humanity has learned for successful survival and development. It can be debated that this is a hopeless and/or unnecessary task, but I am very reluctant to accept this position. This is simply a way, for me to actualize some kind of meaningfulness and purpose to human ( my) existence. It would also be a kind of penance for the irresponsible mindless waste and destruction of the earth’s resources that humanity has perpetrated for the past 500 years. <br>The acquisition of physical knowledge of the world has been a long and difficult process. It has been aided greatly by the ready availability of energy sources and related technology. To allow its demise, I think, would be, an unforgivable act of omission. <br>The technologies available today are not sufficiently robust and capable of preserving material longer than approximately a thousand years, at best. My view is that at least a ten thousand year time period needs to be framed and longer, if feasible. This creates the possibility for the appearance of developments that can be used to generate human adaptation to future circumstances. <br>Prior to an actual effort is the necessity to conceptualize what would be of real value, at that point in time. I think a main “given” would be an environment of low energy utilization rates. This concept may be one means to filter out what will not be available and can be put aside as non-useful information. For example, no mass entertainment activities or space shots, (do I repeat myself, here ?) . <br>Offhand, I cannot think of any means except the use of lasers to burn letters through thin, high nickel content, stainless steel sheet. This results in a ”stencil”, that can be used to reproduce the information with simple materials. There would be a need to protect the produced stencil “library” in various ways, from destruction through the short sighted interests of salvagers, “religious” or political entities and the like. Beyond this, I am bereft of imagination. I think this work needs to be started very soon, before the energy resources to do it become unavailable. Others should be engaged to work on this issue and that an attempt at implementation should be made. Participating in this project would help channel people into “doing something” for the long haul, similar to the efforts of monks in the previous era of social disorganization.<br>I hope these thoughts are of some value and will be responded to. <br>Ben Simon<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c8026596537585543933 title="comment permalink">7/1/13, 12:54 PM</a><br><br>

The dark age following the collapse of a civilization usually lasts between 500 and 1000 years, and there are plenty of technologies that can preserve written documents that long -- ordinary sheepskin parchment, if it's kept dry, will do the trick. You might also consider finding ways to encourage the survival of living traditions of knowledge -- for example, making sure that enough people know how to practice the scientific method would go a long ways toward helping that crucial bit of knowledge make it through the mess ahead. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, square-rigged sailing ships are an extremely efficient technology; the great drawback, as with all wind-powered technologies, is intermittency. My guess is that future ocean travel will involve square-rigged or junk-rigged ships with backup diesel engines, burning biodiesel, for the kind of prolonged calms that used to be the windjammer's bane back in the day.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c6467354734179549447 title="comment permalink">7/1/13, 6:59 PM</a><br><br>

Two things guaranteed the complete predominance of infernal combustion -- the conversion was a runaway trend once it started. One was (as noted) the elimination of paying jobs by substituting fossil slaves for wage slaves: when fossil fuel was cheap, the argument was irresistible to profit-seekers. The other was compelling even to the independent small fisherman, and that was predictability, reliability; the infernal machines permitted you to be someplace when you planned to be, and to get out of places and situations that were getting sketchy or out of control.

It was, for example, absolute and protected by law in Rhode Island, and nearly so in Plymouth (the old colony), Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and the south-east corner of Connecticut. In other colonies, the picture was different, but again it varied from one colony to the next.<br><br>In all periods up to the Civil War, the sparsely settled western frontier was religiously free, as a simple consequence of being sparsely settled and weakly governed. Only after the Civil War and the closing of the frontier (conventionally, 1870) did the concept of a Christian United States really get much traction, and even so it never got enough for any of the so-called "Christian Amendments" to the Constitution to have the ghost of a chance of passing. A lot of the opposition to the idea of a Christian USA and various Christian Amendments came from the alternative religions and occult movements, which flourished as never before in the USA from about 1850 onward.<br><br>Actually, the nadir of religions freedom in the USA (as a whole, not just in specific states) was probably the period between about 1940 and 1970, when you and I were growing up.

I am hoping you will delve into discussions of what the self is, since it's so related to the matter of time. To understand oneself as related to and part of 200 years from now... that's a big change for people to make in their mental categories. <br><br>Regarding the Fed's movements: on the one hand it's strange, as St Louis Fed Regional guy commented: since inflation was still below target, usually the response would be more QE, especially since unemployment is still high. So there's more to it; the usual metrics are not predictive.<br><br>The reaction to Fed comments was first in stocks. Money drained out and started looking for other places. The StL Fed guy said bonds start having a better return than stocks, so money goes into bonds, prices spike, later level out. Lots of private liquidity will flow into the bonds, short term during that rate spike.<br><br>Other Fed comments suggest that the Fed wanted others to take up some slack from the U.S. public coffers. lots of foreign national banks responded with announcements of liquidity easing if in the absence of Fed action that might become necessary: China and other East Asian countries, as well as the ECB announced they will proceed with their growth, inflation, unemployment targets. <br><br>So overall the Fed is shifting the burden to those other nations and to other private sources, not public debt. Partly, they want buy-in; the Fed feels its responsibility for short-term stability is done.<br><br>Also, the Fed Bankers' comments seemed to suggest to me that they're saying, "enough has been done on the monetary side, so work on the fiscal side, because we've identified a number of structural problems, notably unemployment (inflation has not been a problem); so take what money you have and put it to work." Contrasting with the monetary side, which kind of boils down to money supply; the fiscal side has many more options and is much more complicated, which helps explain the overall political paralysis. Tax rates versus social welfare being primary, but myriad other options are left for "what to do with the money." The helicopter is really the least effective possible use of money.<br><br>I think also the Fed competes with the ECB and has interests in breaking up the EU currency union, so has another reason to shift burdens off to other central banks; effectively the Fed says to the ECB, "you want liquidity, you raise your debt; we're on break." And if the ECB can't hold it together, that just makes Europe an easier target for property-grabs during the decline.<br><br><br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c4752435691902526915 title="comment permalink">7/1/13, 8:40 PM</a><br><br>

I wonder if they may be contemplating militarization. If I was them, I don't think I'd fully trust the U.S. to honor its debts. China made some rather bland comments to the effect that they hoped the U.S. would honor debts, during the debt ceiling crisis. And what are they going to do about it? considering we're well positioned on much of the world's key resources... If they show signs of militarization, we cut them off. But what direction can China grow into? It's well-positioned in physical capital and labor. Even if they effectively keep giving things away in return for debt.. can they expect everyone to pay those debts back in a contracting situation? Or should we expect China to go on its own little splurge right as we start heading into decline? What form does that take? Land grabs all over the world? We won't stand for it, on too large a scale. Debt is just words on paper, a gun speaks a different tune.<br><br>And that's a huge dynamic I think: military superiority, at present, and we can control much of the global market. This makes US public debt more secure than anywhere else. Our debt is high, though not off-the-charts like some: yet our interest rates remain incredibly low - periodically, lower than inflation, which is pretty remarkable. It means effectively people are paying the government to keep their money safe. That suggests no one is really concerned about US default, since if we default, that means the global power structure crumbles, currencies become vague suggestions, and all that's left is war anyway. It also turns into a positive feedback loop: more debt needs more military needs more debt...bond rates stay low even though we have huge debt, because there's nowhere safer to put money.<br><br>Our military creates an interesting situation during the step-downward decline: as things contract, money floods into the safe-harbor US bonds; this props up the military with debt, extending our reach over resources, making the safe-harbor bonds even safer. (Manufacture whatever excuse to invade a market that might be needed.) Countering these positive feedbacks are some negative feedbacks: resource limitations, public opinion worldwide, mainly (I can't think of others.) But the main point is, the strong U.S. military makes U.S. debt bonds a safe-harbor that not much really counteracts. I think this will play a large role in how things could play out in the descent.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c8407454245067341430 title="comment permalink">7/1/13, 8:41 PM</a><br><br>

Excellent post. I am an environmentalist. However one of the major problems with environmentalism is that environmentalists keep on making apocalyptic predictions of catastrophe or collapse within the next 10 to 20 years. The trouble is that we find that 10 to 20 years later we are still here and that things seem to be going along perfectly well. It is hardly surprising that people stop believing what environmentalists say. <br><br>Of course there is a lot of environmental damage going on under the placid surface of western consumer society. We are also beginning to run in to the limits to growth brought about by the peaking of oil supply and resource scarcity. However because we have not yet run into the apocalyptic catastrophes predicted by environmentalist and by some peak oilers, it is very easy to dismiss their predictions. Unfortunately the emphasis on apocalyptic predictions has done a great disservice to environmentalism <br><br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c1480330447210166306 title="comment permalink">7/2/13, 4:59 AM</a><br><br>

It is certainly not a speed issue, as sail power held the Atlantic crossing record until well into the 20th century. But, as JMG mentioned it is intermittency that is the big problem.<br>The economic worth of a ship is in how many voyages it makes in the life of the hull. If you are floating around waiting for the wind to pick up, you are not making paying voyages, while the economic life of the ship is still ebbing away. Another issue, which my Great Grandfather experienced, was getting hit by a big storm which destroyed the rig and blew the ship past the country of destination (New Zealand). It took them six weeks to get back, after a change in weather and having rebuilt the rig.<br>That said, in the last few years, shipping lines have taken to a policy of slow steaming, to reduce fuel costs, this is a world wide behavior now.<br>As a note on the power of sail, unlike engine power, you cannot de-power sail at will, the way you can with an engine. This can and did result in ships being driven straight through waves, instead of over them.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c3425906639630243002 title="comment permalink">7/2/13, 5:23 AM</a><br><br>

Of course its not terribly comforting to get a large scale extinction of marine life, and shutdown of the Thermohaline current would make the UK (where I live) rather chilly. However, this isn't totally extinction of all lifeforms so technically this is the wide expanse of middle ground - and obviously much harder to face because of this. Of course we are already in a large scale extinction event, it just doesn't feel like it to most people.<br><br>Talking of feedback I see that Mark Carney (Canadian) , previously CEO takes over at the Bank of England. He is reportedly very keen to monetary policies such as QE, so I expect to see some positive feedback actions shortly hence making a crash deeper.<br><br>It seems to me that a common pattern in feedback mechanisms is that inappropriate positive feedback actions will be applied for a while. Think of, pumping up the next bubble with QE, government underwriting of mortgages to boost house prices, spending on low EROEI energy sources. Eventually nature fights back with a big dose of negative feedback mechanisms and we collapse down to the next stage in a catabolic collapse. Your theory seems incredibly convincing to me.<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c8701951672374482571 title="comment permalink">7/2/13, 9:15 AM</a><br><br>

It's the same thing where I live, half of all workers according to one widely quoted study, now work in so-called "precarious" occupations, that is, in jobs that are part-time, short-term with poor pay and sparse or no benefits. <br><br>This place used to be an industrial power. No more. My home town used to have a plant that employed 2,000 men plus a steel mill, two flour mills, a shoe factory and a cement plant. All gone. Boarded up businesses and brownfields everywhere. Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town. <br><br>And you wonder about the logic of it. Through offshoring these titans of industry collectively destroyed the manufacturing capacity of the US (and that of other countries, including mine) and consequently destroyed the incomes of the middle class and the consumer market that used to buy the products that their companies made. So, a question: is the bankruptcy of the US government and the recent succession of financial crises the logical consequence to the offshoring? To put it another way: were the various recent financial crises, at least in part, the financial echoes to events happening in the real economy? <br><br>And you wonder also about this so-called military/industrial complex. Looks like the industrial half of the complex, that used to supply and finance the military half, got up and left. Every last nut and bolt of productive capacity, that could be offshored, was offshored. Their former workforce in the US, who used to earn a decent buck and who paid the taxes that financed military expenditures, was replaced with foreign, dollar an hour labour that cannot afford to buy the products that they make. And most importantly, don't pay taxes to US treasuries.<br><br>These mighty industries are now on Chinese soil and within easy reach of a giant, rapidly modernising, nuclear armed and notably unsqueamish Chinese military. How can this have happened? I mean, think of it, to build up the economic and war-making capacity of a foreign, unfriendly power, to put your industrial assets in the clutches of a hostile army? And to hobble the country that you rely on to protect you and to defend your interests? Could these geniuses in the C-suites possibly have been this boneheaded? What am I missing here?<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c3269815938696752490 title="comment permalink">7/2/13, 9:32 AM</a><br><br>

But what are they without the American social, legal, governing and military infrastructure that they've done so much to undermine? What power do they have? Who makes laws to suit the interests of this managerial class, who maintains the judicial systems that enforce their claims, who raises the troops and police forces that protect their lives and assets? Where does the money come from to pay for all this? <br><br>And who does this managerial class think will defend them? An enfeebled US government that's drowning in debt and corruption? Or do they think the Chinese will step up? I say the Chinese, given half a chance, will eat them alive and pick them clean. Mercenaries? Will a mercenary step in front of a bullet to save an American plutocrat? Not likely. <br><br>The C-suite suits may think they live at 30,000 feet but they don't. They may think that they're self suffcient but they're not. They rely on a social and economic "eco-system" to survive just like everyone else. They may think that they wield power through their briefcases and lawyers, they may think they can do what they want and they may even think that money talks. <br><br>But I say that, at the end of the day, the suits live at the sufferance of armed men. Do you think the CEO of Wal Mart is powerful? Who is more powerful, the CEO of Wal Mart or the army general (whether he's Chinese or American) that commands infantry divisions? Who is CEO Mike Duke going to deploy? His minimun wage work force? Money may "talk" but I think Mao was right, power comes from the barrel of a gun. <br><br>So, my question is this: Is the US military blind to the enormity of what's been done? Maybe they are. But will they eventually wake up? What if they do? What is the likelihood that senior US officers, growing ever more dismayed at the economic decline and financial corruption and political disarray engulfing the US, decide to take matters into their own hands? (Would this qualify as a negative feedback loop?)<br><br>I'm in no way shape or form arguing in favour of a military coup. I put it out there as a possibility. Most of us tend towards optimism, we'd rather think the best of people rather than the worst. But the events of the last century don't give me much cause for optimism. <br><br>So I'm wondering, will an American Army general become a modern day Odoacer? And will an American President become the modern day Romulus Augustulus? Can you picture a US citizenry, so fed up with their declining circumstances and fed up with Wall Street and Washington, actually welcoming such a development?<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c2144408674732578869 title="comment permalink">7/2/13, 11:15 AM</a><br><br>

(‘Collapse’ seems an ill-defined notion between the two. ‘Apocalypses’ seem historically to have been few and rather local, though they left lasting impressions.) I would make an additional category – the so-called ‘existential threat’ to a national or trans-national entity or identity. These latter threats are defined usually in the context of war or internal subversion.<br> <br>For example, Britain in 1940 was said to be facing an ‘existential threat’, which even now seems a highly plausible categorisation. In the mind of Winston Churchill it included a threat to the continuing existence of the British Empire – which latter of course was indeed finally unravelled by the war. (Churchill later seems personally to have ‘squared’ this loss by focussing on an entity he called ‘The English Speaking Peoples’; aka the USA, the new hegemon. The USA sought dominance in military projection, trading advantages and client states, rather than in ‘colonial occupation’.)<br><br>Invasion and war on American soil seems a remote possibility, although Van Woodward writing in 1952 drew attention to the ongoing effects of having had a ‘defeated and impoverished’ South within the ‘can-do’ triumphalism of the Yankee dominated Union. Conversion of the South, by means of petro-fuelled industrial modernisation and its ‘business’ mode had only just got into its stride. I conclude now though, that, even with an oncoming collapse of the American advantage derived from its global business model (an historical ‘discontinuity’), war on American soil is unlikely for any reason for many decades yet to come? I believe you have already set out your opinion on this, certainly regarding direct invasions. I see though that many Americans fear such an eventuality (‘existential threat’)?<br><br>I would like to examine ‘famine’. This can be much more than a ‘discontinuity’ or an ‘existential threat’. Famine can kill 10s of millions very fast (weeks) and displace many more on a scale at least as great as that posed by war, pogrom or attempts at genocide. My brief look suggests, however, that like invasion, famine is not probable in the USA, even if there is a ‘collapse’ of the present inflow of global resources. The USA has all the resources to hand that are necessary to keep Big Farming and essential distribution functioning to feed the urban nation. The ‘joker in the pack’ might be successive climate related disasters, though even these are more likely to affect international food trade, rather than pose a threat of famine in the USA. Home grown vegetables could help a lot of urban people be better fed, but famine can only be prevented by distribution of ‘big’ primary production – grains, legumes and vegetable oil.<br> <br>Over the next 100 to 300 years of course the trend will move against ‘big farming’ and large urban populations, and such a trend will eventually transform even the USA. But it is unlikely to be sudden at least in your part of the world.<br><br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><a href=imperfect-storms.html#c6141160783684448588 title="comment permalink">7/3/13, 3:35 AM</a><br><br>

Yes, the money supply increased, but it's by no means clear that the money was reaching actual people with the means to spend it. Instead it probably served to shore up the balance sheets of big banks, which did NOT spend it. Also, during the years after the crisis, state and local governments cut spending. So there was hardly the glut of money sloshing into the economy that some people like to pretend.
