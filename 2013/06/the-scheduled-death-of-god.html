<div class=MsoNormal>
There's a mordant irony in the fact that a society as fixated on the future as ours is should have so much trouble thinking clearly about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Partly, to be sure, that difficulty unfolds from the sheer speed of social and technological change in the age of cheap abundant energy that’s now coming to an end, but there’s more to it than that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the civil religions of the modern world, the future functions as a surrogate for heaven and hell alike,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the place where the wicked will finally get the walloping they deserve and the good will be granted the promised benefits that the present never quite gets around to providing them. What Nietzsche called the death of God—in less colorful language, the fading out of living religious belief as a significant force in public life—left people across the Western world flailing for something to backstop the sense of moral order in the cosmos they once derived from religious faith. Over the course of the nineteenth century, a great many of them found what they wanted in one or another civil religion that projected some version of utopia onto the future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s crucial not to underestimate the emotional force of the resulting beliefs. The future of perpetual betterment promised by the faith in progress, and the utopia on the far side of cataclysm promised with equal fervor by the faith in apocalypse, are no less important to their believers than heaven is to the ordinary Christian, and for exactly the same reason. Every human society has its own conception of the order of the cosmos; the distinctive concept of cosmic order that became central to the societies of Europe and the European diaspora envisioned a moral order that could be understood, down to the fine details, by human beings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since everyday life pretty clearly fails to follow such an order, there had to be some offstage location where everything would balance out, whether that location took the form of heaven, humanity’s future among the stars, a future society of equality and justice, or what have you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Discard that imagined place and, for a great many people in the Western world, the cosmos ceases to have any order or meaning at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was precisely against this sense of moral order, though, that Nietzsche declared war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like any good general, he sent his forces into action along several routes at once; the assault relevant to our theme was aimed at the belief that the arithmetic of morality would finally add up in some other place or time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He rejected the idea of a utopian world of past or future just as forcefully as he did the concept of heaven itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s one of the things his doctrine of eternal return was intended to do:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>by revisioning the past and the future as<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>endless repetition, Nietzsche did his level best to block any attempt to make the past or the future fill the role once filled by heaven. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here, though, he overplayed his hand. Strictly speaking, a cycle of eternal return is just as imaginary as any golden age in the distant past, or for that matter the glorious future come the Revolution when we will all eat strawberries and cream. In a philosophy that presents itself as a Yes-saying to life exactly as it is, his reliance on a theory of time just as unprovable as those he assaulted<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>was a massive problem. Nietzsche’s madness, and the resolute effort on the part of most European intellectuals of the time not to think about any of the issues he tried to raise, left this point<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>among many others hanging in the air. Decades passed before another German thinker tackled the same challenge with better results. His name, as I think most of my regular readers have guessed by now, was Oswald Spengler. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Spengler was in his own way as eccentric a figure as Nietzsche, though it was a more stereotypically German eccentricity than Nietzsche’s fey Dionysian aestheticism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>A cold, methodical, solitary man, he spent his entire working life as a schoolteacher, and all his spare time—he never married—with his nose in a polymath’s banquet of books from every corner of scholarship. Old Kingdom Egyptian theology, traditional Chinese landscape design, the history of the medieval Russian church, the philosophical schools of ancient India, the latest discoveries in early twentieth century physics: all these and more were grist for his highly adaptable mill. In 1914, as the impending fall of the British empire was sweeping Europe into a vortex of war, he started work on the first volume of <i>The Decline of the West</i>; it appeared in 1918, and the second volume followed it in 1922. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The books became immediate bestsellers in German and several other languages—this despite a world-class collective temper tantrum on the part of professional historians. <i>Logos</i>, one of the most prestigious German scholarly journals of the time, ran an entire special issue on him, in which historians engaged in a frenzy of nitpicking about Spengler’s historical claims. (Spengler, unperturbed, read the issue, doublechecked his facts, released a new edition of his book with corrections, and pointed out that none of the nitpicking addressed any of the major points of his book; he was right, too.) One study of the furore around Spengler noted more than 400 publications, most of them hostile, discussing <i>The Decline of the West</i> in the decade of the 1920s alone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Interest in Spengler’s work peaked in the 1920s and 1930s and faded out after the Second World War; some of the leading figures of the "Beat generation" used to sit around a table reading <i>The Decline of the West</i> out loud, and a few other figures of the 1950s drew on his ideas, but thereafter silence closed in. There’s an ironic contrast here to Nietzsche, who provided Spengler with so many of his basic insights; Nietzsche’s work was almost completely unknown during his life and became a massive cultural presence after his death; with Spengler, the sequence ran the other way around. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The central reason why Spengler was so fiercely if inconclusively attacked by historians in his own time, and so comprehensively ignored since then, is the same reason why he’s relevant to the present theme. At the core of his work stood the same habit of morphological thinking I discussed in <a href=../../2013/04/an-aside-to-my-readers.html>an earlier post in this sequence</a>. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who launched the study of comparative morphology in the life sciences in the eighteenth century, remained a massive cultural presence in the Germany of Spengler’s time, and so it came naturally to Spengler to line up the great civilizations of history side by side and compare their histories, in the same way that a biologist might compare a dolphin’s flipper to a bat’s wing, to see the common patterns of deep structure that underlie the surface differences. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Such comparisons are surprisingly unfashionable in modern historical studies. Most other fields of study rely on comparisons as a matter of course:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the astronomer compares one nebula to another, just as the literary critic compares one experimental novel to another, and in both fields it’s widely accepted that such comparisons are the most important way to get past irrelevancies to an understanding of what’s really going on. There are historical works that compare, say, one revolution to others, or one feudal system to another, but these days they’re in the minority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More often, historians consider the events of some period in the past by themselves, without placing them in the context of comparable periods or events, and either restrict themselves to storytelling or propose assorted theories about the causes of those events—theories that can never be put to the test, because it’s all but impossible to test a hypothesis when you’re limited to a sample size of one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty with a morphological approach to history is precisely that a sample size of more than one turns up patterns that next to nobody in the modern industrial world wants to think about. By placing past civilizations side by side with that of the modern industrial West, Spengler found that all the great historical changes that our society sees as uniquely its own have exact equivalents in older societies. Each society emerges out of chaos as a decentralized feudal society, with a warrior aristocracy and an epic poetry so similar that an enterprising bard could have recited the Babylonian tale of Gilgamesh in an Anglo-Saxon meadhall without anyone present sensing the least incongruity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each then experiences corresponding shifts in social organization:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the meadhalls and their equivalents give way to castles, the castles to fortified towns, the towns to cities, and then a few of the cities outgrow all the others and become the centers in which the last stages of the society’s creative life are worked out. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, in the political sphere, feudal aristocrats become subject to kings, who are displaced by oligarchies of the urban rich, and these latter eventually fall before what Spengler calls Caesarism, the emergence of charismatic leaders who attract a following from the urban masses and use that strength to seize power from the corrupt institutions of an oligarchic state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Traditional religions rich in myth give way to rationalist philosophies as each society settles on the intellectual projects that will define its legacy to the future—for example, logical method in the classical world, and natural science in ours. Out of the diverse background of folk crafts and performances, each culture selects the set of art forms that will become the focus of its creative life, and these evolve in ever more distinctive ways; Gilgamesh and Beowulf could just as well have swapped swords and fought each other’s monsters, for example, but the briefest glance at plays from ancient Greece, India, China, and the Western world shows a wholly different dramatic and aesthetic language at work in each.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this might have been forgiven Spengler, but the next step in the comparison passes into territory that makes most people in the modern West acutely uncomfortable. Spengler argued that the creative potential of every culture is subject to the law of diminishing returns. Sooner or later, everything worth bothering with that can be done with Greek sculpture, Chinese porcelain, Western oil painting, or any other creative art has been done; sooner or later, the same exhaustion occurs in every other dimension of a culture’s life—its philosophies, its political forms, you name it. At that point, in the terms that Spengler used, a culture turns into a civilization, and its focus shifts from creating new forms to sorting through the products of its creative centuries, choosing a selection of political, intellectual, religious, artistic, and social patterns that will be sustainable over the long term, and repeating those thereafter in much the same way that a classical orchestra in the modern West picks and chooses out of the same repertoire of standard composers and works. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As that last example suggests, furthermore, Spengler didn’t place the transition from Western culture to its subsequent civilization at some conveniently far point in the future. According to his chronology, that transition began in the nineteenth century and would be complete by 2100 or so. The traditional art forms of the Western world would reach the end of the line, devolving into empty formalism or staying on in mummified form, the way classical music is preserved today; political ideologies would turn into empty slogans providing an increasingly sparse wardrobe to cover the naked quest for power; Western science, having long since exhausted the low-hanging fruit in every field, would wind down into a repetition of existing knowledge, and most forms of technology would stagnate, while a few technological fields capable of yielding grandiose prestige projects would continue to be developed for a while; rationalism would be preserved in intellectual circles, while popular religious movements riddled with superstition would rule the mental life of the bulk of the population. Progress in any Western sense of the word would be over forever, for future cultures would choose their own directions in which to develop, as different from ours as ours is from the traditional Chinese or the Mayans. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Spengler didn’t leave these projections of the future in abstract form; he turned them into detailed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>predictions about the near future, and those predictions have by and large turned out to be correct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was wrong in thinking that Germany would become an imperial state that would unite the Western world the way Rome united the classical world, the kingdom of Qin united China, and so on, though it’s fair to say that Germany’s two efforts to fill that role came uncomfortably close to succeeding. Other than that, his aim has proved remarkably good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
He argued, for example, that the only artistic forms that could have any vitality in 20th century Europe and America would take their inspiration from other, non-Western cultures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Popular music, which was dominated by African-derived jazz in the first half of the century and African-derived rock thereafter, is only one of many examples. As for politics, he suggested that the history of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries would be dominated by a struggle pitting charismatic national dictators against a globalized oligarchy of high finance lightly concealed under a mask of democracy, a struggle that the financiers would eventually lose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Though the jury’s still out on the final outcome, the struggle itself is splashed over the news on a daily basis.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All these events took place in other times and places, and will take place in future societies, each in its own way. What distinguishes contemporary Western society from earlier urban civilizations, according to Spengler’s view, is not that it’s "more advanced," "more progressive"—every society goes in a different direction, and proceeds along that route until the same law of diminishing returns cuts in—but simply that it happened to take mastery of physical matter and energy as its special project, and in the process stumbled across the buried carbon we’re burning so extravagantly just now. It’s hard to think of any historical vision less flattering to the inherited egotism of the modern industrial West; it deprives us of our imagined role as the cutting edge of humanity in its grand upward march toward the stars, and plops us back down to earth as just one civilization among many, rising and falling along with the rest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s in this way that Spengler proved to be Nietzsche’s heir.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Where Nietzsche tried to challenge the imaginary utopia at the end of history with an equally imaginary vision of eternal return, Spengler offered a vision that was <i>not</i>
imaginary, but rather rested on a foundation of historical fact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Where Nietzsche’s abandonment of a moral order to the cosmos left him staring into an abyss in which order and meaning vanished once and for all, Spengler presented an alternative vision of cosmic order in which morality is not a guiding principle, but simply a cultural form, human-invented, that came and went with the tides of history. Life was as much Spengler’s banner as it was Nietzsche’s, life in the full biological sense of the word, unreasoning, demanding, and resistant to change over less than geological time scales; the difference was that Nietzsche saw life as the abyss, while Spengler used it to found his sense of an ordered universe and ultimately his values as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s among the richest ironies of Spengler’s project that among the things that he relativized and set in a historic context was Nietzsche’s philosophy. Nietzsche liked to imagine himself as a figure of destiny, poised at the turning point of the ages—this was admittedly a common occupational disease of nineteenth-century philosophers. Spengler noted his debts to Nietzsche repeatedly in <i>The Decline of the West</i>, but kept a sense of perspective the older man lacked; in the table of historical parallels that finishes the first volume of Spengler’s book, Nietzsche has become one more symptom of the late, "Winter" phase of Western culture, one of many figures participating in the final disintegration of traditional religious thought at the hands of skeptical intellectuals proposing new systems of philosophical ethics. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When Nietzsche announced the death of God, in other words, he was filling a role familiar in other ages, announcing an event that occurs on schedule in the life of each culture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The Greek historian Plutarch had announced the death of Pan some eighteen centuries earlier, around the time that the classical world was settling firmly into the end-state of civilization; the people of ancient Crete, perhaps recalling some similar event even further back, used to scandalize Greek tourists by showing them the grave of Zeus. Every literate urban society, Spengler argued, followed the same trajectory from an original folk religion rich in myths, through the rise of intellectual theology, the birth of rationalism, the gradual dissolution of the religious worldview into rational materialism, and then the gradual disintegration of rational materialism into a radical skepticism that ends by dissolving itself; thereafter ethical philosophies for the intellectuals and resurgent folk religion for the masses provide the enduring themes for the civilization to come.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a stark vision, especially painful to those who have been raised to see the most recent phases of that process in our own culture as the heralds of the bright new era of history presupposed by the Joachimist shape of time, or the initial shockwaves of the imminent apocalypse presupposed by its Augustinian rival. Defenders of these latter viewpoints have accordingly developed standard ways of countering Spengler’s challenge—or, more precisely, defenders of both have settled on the same way of doing so. We’ll discuss their argument, and place it in its own wider context, in next week’s post.</div>

Correct me if I'm wrong or have the wrong idea but is the final phase of Spengler's narrative something like the resurgence in religious/spiritual traditions happening all over the west, with the phase before that (radical skepticism) being akin to the post-modern movement? Just a thought I had. <br><br>Its an interesting predicament especially if you are a member of generation Y (like myself). On one hand, we are bombarded with post-modern media/ideas (the Simpsons/ South Park etc) on the other we are expected to fulfill the 'modernist' ideal of going out and having a full time carrier with the aim of 'getting ahead' and progressing in society. Its a tricky situation to be in I can tell you. Many of us don't know what to believe any more. So we do our jobs/study half arsed (sorry was that too rude?). Some of us though, increasing I think do accept the 'circular/timeless' philosophy discussed in last weeks post. But yeh, Like you said, these are very emotionally charged issues its difficult to talk about the wider scheme of things. I am trying my best though to bring it up with members of my generation (with some success).

I don't think that Polybius would see revolution as the whole cycle of anacyclosis, just as the transition from one phase to another -- the American revolution, for example, replaced monarchy with oligarchy. <br><br>Tom, excellent! Yes, postmodernism is the current version of the sort of radical skepticism that cancels itself out, and ends the whole trajectory of rationalism -- there were parallel movements in every past civilization that had a developed philosophical tradition. Next comes the emergence of ethical philosophies that focus on how to live when you can't know the objective truth, which appeal to intellectuals, and the first stirrings of what Spengler calls the Second Religiosity, the rebirth of popular religion, which appeals to the masses.<br><br><a href=#c467358458846044562 title="comment permalink">6/6/13, 12:35 AM</a><br><br>

And even better than the last one.<br><br>I began down my current path, three years ago, trying to confront Spengler's powerful metaphysical claim: <br><br><i>"‘Mankind’, however, has no aim, no idea, no plan, any more than the family of butterflies or orchids."</i><br><br>Whatever people might think about Spengler's attempt at universal history, that single sentence wakes us from our comfortable, oil-fueled dreams of a sci-fi push to the stars which <a href=../../2011/08/way-future-wasnt.html rel=nofollow>you so expertly summarized back in 2011</a>. It reveals that the sci-fi stories we've been telling ourselves are just stories; and as they have already proven impossible, mankind will exhaust the Western story and move on to something else.<br><br>But the course Spengler set for the West was not clear to me then. He predicted a Second Religiousness -- but what would happen to all the grand rationalism people are proclaiming these days? He proclaimed that the West could only proceed into an ahistorical state -- but how could anyone voluntarily do that, when we moderns obsess so deeply over our impact on the future?<br><br>In the last paragraph of this post, you seem to sneak in the answer I eventually figured out to those questions.

Will we be forced to lose the collective knowledge we possess? <br><br>As I've said before, the conclusion I came to about these bigger questions is based on Guénon's metaphysics. My reading convinces me that the persistence of modernity is not just about oil; and that the final chapter of the West will be dragged out many long, hard years after the modern way of life becomes materially unappealing.

F.ex. you can't find a complete break with any former form-language as in modernism: <br><br>http://solidarityhall.org/modernism-as-a-cultural-discontinuity-an-architectural-comment-2/<br><br>The fear of Beauty and God, as expressed in our culture, is extreme, it's never seen before.<br><br>You might find it off-topic and delete my quota from Alexander, but that's ok as I've access to other Norwegian and international blogs on which I hope to write an essay on this topic someday:<br><br>"Later, Katalin Bende, also working on the project in our office, asked me to explain what I meant by this true liking and about people's fear of it, and why anyone could be afraid of true beauty. "What kind of beauty could go so deep that a person would be afraid of creating it?" she asked.<br><br>I told her that, in my view, a difficulty we modern people encounter can sometimes go something like this: When centers are properly distributed in a truly beautiful structure, one cannot avoid seeing the I (what a religious person might also call God). In the 20th century there has been something almost like a taboo, against seeing the I, or true beauty, or God. Hence the discomfort. This discomfort that modern people feel with real beauty – especially that architects and designers feel – is almost legendary. Working with architects, I have experienced it again and again. Many traditional shapes, especially the most profound shapes with deep and serious centers in them, for some reason trouble modern architects profoundly. Even when an architect does want to borrow a traditional shape for a building (as postmodernists sometimes do), he often feels he has to make the shape "modern" in order to feel comfortable with it. So, for many decades, architects of the 20th century felt that they had to take a traditional form and distort it, so that they could demonstrate that they had possessed it, and so that their colleagues would not laugh at them for being archaic.<br><br>Let me put it another way. The history of the 20th century has been one in which people do not want to see God nor, therefore, true beauty either. The role religion has, for many become uncomfortable. Many people want no part of it. They do not want, even, to get near it. And for that reason, they also do not (cannot) want, in their lives, any kind of true beauty. True beauty is the quality of being in touch with the I. A structure with true beauty – the beauty which brings something in touch with the I – is, in effect, something we cannot avoid, in some part, seeing God. For this reason, the underlying design vocabulary of the 20th century, almost throughout the century, asserted that designers should create structures which are "interesting", "pleasing", "fantastic", "exhilarating", "with elan", and so on – anything but beautiful – indeed never truly beautiful. That word has unalterable meaning, cannot be contaminated, and during the temporary insanity of the 20th century, struck a nerve which people could not tolerate." – Christopher Alexander, The Luminous Ground, page 295-296<br><br><a href=#c6726281758526990843 title="comment permalink">6/6/13, 2:56 AM</a><br><br>

So the effort was to set aside those convenient and (for us) resonant contexts and see a place or people as it really was, with its own inherent logicks.

But Africans also influenced Western art, architecture and design. In 1905 Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque - young second-tier painters at the time - happened upon an exhibition of African tribal artifacts at a Paris museum. The stark beauty of the masks, shields and sculptures therein so amazed the duo that they b-lined back to their respective studios and attempted to incorporate what they had seen into their paintings...Cubism was born.<br><br>As Impressionism - European painting's supernova - had pretty much run its course, Cubism caught on in the vacuum and spread like wildfire. It helped give birth to the nascent architectural movement aptly named The International Style and various minor design styles in it's wake. [was the autobahn a manifestation of International Style perception? If God is indeed dead, then why not nature, why not art, and, Arnold Shoenberg seems to ask, why not music?]<br><br>Of course, Cubism's most obvious offspring was Abstract Expressionism. I knew a few notable Abstract Expressionist artists personally, and, believe me, these dudes were out to lunch!<br><br>I'll not go into the devastating consequences of Cubism and the International Style (and its bedfellows) on the look and feel of Western culture, such consequences being obvious. Nor can I blame the African artisans whose work was stolen from them by European "explorers" so many years ago. Their work, introduced into a dying culture, simply took root and spread - in mutated forms that is - in much the same way that a plant or animal, innocuous enough in its native environment, might reek ecological havoc when introduced into a vulnerable foreign landscape.<br><br>Picasso's sin, if any, was his recognition of the superior quality of the African art he viewed at the museum that day, as compared to the vapid fare hanging in the salons of Europe at the time. Decades later, Andy Warhol took a page from Picasso's book and upset the convention of Abstract Expressionism by introducing the far better crafted and resolved forms of contemporary popular art into the otherwise stagnant fine arts scene of the 1960's. Warhol, like Picasso, recognized a superior aesthetic when he saw it.<br><br><br><a href=#c4700059749936500188 title="comment permalink">6/6/13, 8:52 AM</a><br><br>

As an educator who teaches a course that essentially amounts to the rise and fall of human civilizations, I am fascinated by your critique of our own time. <br><br>It seems to me that Spengler’s assessment of the cyclical nature of human societies, brilliant and innovative as it was, may overlook a concept that has only recently been explored by the study of modern biology. Human societies and their popular belief systems (religions) are subject to many of the same evolutionary forces that affect individual organisms. First, if modern biology is correct, and I think that it is, evolution has no terminal goal. It is simply an ecstasy of fumbling that selects certain traits, brought about by random mutations that are advantageous to the particular environment in which the organism or society finds itself in. All life on this planet is in competition for energy, the more energy an organism or society harnesses, the more complex it becomes, and usually that complexity allows it to dominate it’s rivals until that complexity becomes it’s undoing. <br><br>The fact that human societies tend to follow similar patterns of rise and fall is tied to the physical laws that govern our biology and social organization. Increased energy input is subject to diminishing returns; each period of human history has limits on complexity, often defined as progress. Progress is restricted by the ability to harness a larger portion of the energy of the universe. Each phase of human organization over the past 10,000 years has been dependent on a new, more energy dense resource. Our current predicament is simply that our era is locked into the energy produced by fossil fuels and we are in the process of hitting the wall of diminishing returns of that energy source. If we are unable to overcome this limitation we will inevitably decline as all other civilizations have done in the past, only to be replaced, or not, by another civilization that is able to harness a more energy dense resource. If humans are unable to realize this goal we will almost certainly be relegated to the dustbin of evolutionary history. The primary point here is that our “religious” belief in progress is nothing more than an evolutionary strategy that may allow us to overcome the limitations of our age. Without this prevailing belief system, we will never be able to escape our fragile planetary ecosystem and be doomed to extinction without ever escaping it. Our and every other species on the planets goal is survival through genetic dispersion. The more places you are, the less likely you are to go extinct when, not if, your environment becomes inhospitable to you. We are the first species that has the ability, however limited to escape the confines of our planet. We are only able to do this through harnessing the power of ancient stored sunlight. Our current “extravagant” use of energy and our belief in progress, are nothing more than evolutionary strategies that may or may not doom us to failure as a species. <br><br>Forgive me if this post is a little long, rambling and off topic. It is my first.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Andrew<br><br><br><a href=#c8086553690445689526 title="comment permalink">6/6/13, 9:04 AM</a><br><br>

Lerwill</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>One of the significant points I took from reading Spengler is how those morphological patterns repeat in subtle ways. On example that comes to mind is how modern paganistic religions create their mythology and world view from recent literary interpretations of history, not history itself. <br><br>For example, when I see books purporting to expound on early Greek religion and the form the worship of their Gods took, I am reminded that Varro himself had little idea of actual practices of his great grandfathers, instead leaning on the literature that reinterpreted life according to the mythological thinking of his present.<br><br>In a similar way, I see the neopagan view of the history of goddess-worship as heavily influenced by Murry, with the mythology of prehistoric matriarchal societies taking the place of Eden in some branches of Augustinian narrative. I find that the influence extends far beyond paganism into the wider culture, seeing people react angrily and storm out of a talk when the historical examples did not include one that reinforced their favored cultural myth. <br><br>I question if the lack of historical perspective is a good or a bad thing; while not learning from the past can lead to repetitive pratfalls, our preconceived notions of what time is does limit our responses to the challenges that our infinite present affords us.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c5515502597134079290 title="comment permalink">6/6/13, 10:32 AM</a><br><br>

And there I met two old men. One was my own grandfather. The other was my cousin's grandfather. Both had lived through the front lines of WW1, both had stared into the "abyss" if you want to call it that, and, if you want to further intellectualize it, witnessed up close and personal that first stage of Europe's collective suicide. <br><br>But they evidently hadn't suffered enough because they then both saw the second stage: the rise of communism and fascism and WW2. By this time both men were deemed too old for military service and so dedicated themselves instead to seeing that their families survived. <br><br>My grandfather, for his part, having had a lot of experience in digging trenches, did what he knew best. He dug a trench. He fortified the top and sides with timber and covered it with earth. There the family sheltered with some neighbours praying to survive the next five minutes and then the next and on and on for days while explosives rained down. Somehow they made it through. And then tanks and soldiers came and evicted them all. And so they went on the run as refugees, from one farm to another, seeing beastly things along the way, congregating with people in their situation wherever relative safety might be found. They survived that ordeal also. <br><br>Both men came away from these experiences scarred and changed but with different perspectives. For though he had no time for the traditional Judeo-Christian god or the preaching of the village priest, at a dinner table discussion my grandfather said never mind, he was convinced that there is "something" out there but what it was he couldn't say. Like an unseen hand, at work. And so this isn't all for nothing. <br><br>My cousin's grandfather scoffed saying there's no "paradise" if that's what you hope for. He said the only "paradise" is to be found in the plate in front of you. He believed in no god or unseen hand or force for "good" at all. Maybe for my grandfather this alternative was just too awful to contemplate. I'll never know. I never got to know him well and he died soon after. <br><br>Both of these men were illiterate peasants. They had about three years of formal schooling between them. They knew nothing of Spengler or Neitzsche. For that matter, what I know of Spengler and Nietzsche I just learned from your post. So thank you for that. <br><br>I know what scholars are trying to do. They try to discern the broader picture and see the larger themes. But in getting out of the weeds of individual experience I think I you can get too far out of the weeds. Personal recounting, like that of these two old men, does illuminate. There's the history of great men and great events. And there's the history of people trying to live for another five minutes. <br><br>I think that speaking to those that were there as events unfolded and who played some part and who were changed by them puts a face to textbook accounts. Because I think that history can be just as much a matter of the fear and sweat and blood and guts of ordinary people as it is a matter of sterile scholarly abstraction even if it is intelligent and perceptive. <br><br><br><a href=#c1877606376075016899 title="comment permalink">6/6/13, 10:40 AM</a><br><br>

Projects belong to individual high cultures. Spengler expected a major new culture to arise in what is now Russia in the centuries ahead, and I have similar thoughts about Latin America; each of them will choose its own project, and go from there in its own direction. <br><br>Mr. O, good. You're taking this project seriously. Yes, I'll be offering some suggestions down the road a bit. <br><br>Quos Ego, yes, I'm going to have to talk about that, and the self-hatred and hatred of life that drives it. <br><br>Leo, thanks for the story! <br><br>Tom, every society has dogmas that can't be called into question with impunity; we've got plenty of them in today's industrial world, for example. We just insist that our religion isn't a religion...<br><br>Mustard, ecology trumps philosophy, until philosophy gets the common sense to learn from ecology.<br><br>Paul, the religious forms of the Second Religiosity evolve out of the half-conscious or unconscious choices of the mass of people -- they can't be predicted, or constructed. As for Druidry, I can think of few things more improbable than my very small, very erudite, highly eccentric tradition taking on any significant historical role at all. <br><br>Nils, thanks for the heads up -- I haven't read Sterns, and clearly have to remedy that. <br><br>Jo, Flannery's point is a good one. There are civilizations that did a relatively good job of finding a stable relationship to their environment, too -- traditional China is one example out of many -- but there also there were many problems early on, and adaptation took time. This is one of the things that gives me hope for the future. <br><br>Permaliv, nah, there have been plenty of other societies in which the fear of beauty and the deliberate pursuit of ugliness have had their day. It rarely lasts long -- it's one of those things that comes at the very end of rationalism -- and the buildings, artworks, etc. that come out of it are hideous enough that they don't survive long. <br><br>Shrama, if we follow the usual track, the ethical philosophies that will shape our future haven't been invented yet -- they're the equivalent of Stoicism and Epicureanism in the classical world, relatively late schools that follow the age of high rationalism.<br><br><a href=#c1453615888939122726 title="comment permalink">6/6/13, 10:53 AM</a><br><br>

Social media allow people to vent their feelings without doing anything that might actually trouble the system. If you post a rant denouncing Obama, let's say, what does that actually accomplish, and who needs to care? <br><br>Raven, thanks for the links. <br><br>Sixbears, good! As I've suggested more than once, early adopters of the deindustrial lifestyle are going to have huge advantages as everyone else stumbles down the same path. <br><br>Raven, militaries all over the world are getting ready for the impact of peak oil. It's just the public that's being fed nonsense on that subject. <br><br>Andy, the results of any morphological study have to be balanced with a clear sense of what makes any given phenomenon unique. Spengler tries to do that, but he doesn't always succeed -- thus his work, like the work of any scholar, needs to be read with a critical eye. <br><br>Robo, Spengler's been all but erased from our collective memory -- as far as I know, the English translation of <i>The Decline of the West</i> has been out of print for decades. Thus it's not surprising that you hadn't heard of him. <br><br>CGP, each individual human being is born, grows up, reaches maturity, ages, and dies. The only way to avoid that is to die young, which is hardly an escape! What Spengler is saying is that a similar rhythm shapes the lives of societies. It's not fatalism, except insofar as an awareness of human mortality is fatalistic; it's simply a recognition that there's a framework to our existence that we didn't establish, can't change, and must deal with. <br><br>Hal, exactly! <br><br>Twilight, excellent -- you get today's gold star. It's only in the imagination of the modern West that life is meaningless and miserable in the absence of limitless progress; in reality, it's possible to have a happy, creative, meaningful life in any historical context, and those of us whose lives are already being shaped by decline might want to learn that in a hurry. <br><br>Chapel, heck of a good question.

Will some such discontinuity happen in the future? It's entirely possible -- but when you insist that it must happen, you've strayed across the border from reasoned speculation to faith.

No, as I've commented before, Druidry is probably the least likely candidate on earth for a core theme of our culture's Second Religiosity. <br><br>SLClaire, I'll see if I can work that in. As for the next high culture, no, that'll emerge somewhere else, and take its own radically different approach to the world -- that's Spengler's claim, at least. <br><br>Greg, thanks for the info! I'm not as familiar with the visual arts as I am with music, so didn't know about the African roots of 20th century painting -- though it doesn't surprise me a bit. <br><br>Andrew, Spengler's theory assumes that evolution has no goal, and can be fitted very easily into a Darwinian analysis. As for the whole we-must-go-to-the-stars meme, though, I've addressed that in <a href=../../2011/08/elegy-for-age-of-space.html rel=nofollow>an earlier post</a> -- the short form is that the space age is ending, and all the millennarian dreams that have been pinned to it are dying with it. <br><br>Hybrid, death is no inconvenience to a deity! It's the cultural form created by human beings that goes away, and (maybe) returns later. <br><br>Phil, true enough! A very dry, very German sense of humor. <br><br>Michael, thank you!<br><br>Ed, remember that our current North American civilization is culturally an offshoot of Europe, and the age of Puritanism was well under way by the time the Puritans arrived here. Spengler argues that the time frames are pretty much identical across the board. <br><br>Harry, and that's one of the things that marks contemporary Pagan revivals as, by and large, the hobbies of small groups of intellectuals disenchanted by the living religious currents of their time.

I recall someone in a comment on an earlier post talking about classical music as a form of mathematics, and I responded that I thought that was an artifact of bad teaching. But it runs rather deeper, doesn't it?<br><br>I was chatting with a choir member after a concert this last weekend. They'd sung my Missa Druidica a year ago, and he commented on how it had forced him to stretch his skills, and thanked me for that. But then he made an interesting comment: he told me that if he had turned in the score for a grade from Dr. So-and-so from his past, he'd have gotten it back covered with BVLs. I blinked and asked what he meant by BVL.<br><br>"Bad Voice Leading," he said. "Of course, I really enjoyed singing the odd intervals. And if you did everything that Dr. So-and-so thought needed to be done in a piece of choral music, you'd end up with a particularly dull Methodist hymn."<br><br>There's one particular progression in the last movement where I gave in to the director, because the intervals were just too hard for his singers: so I exchanged the tenor and bass parts and shifted them into appropriate ranges for Better Voice Leading. But the result is simply wrong. It isn't terrible, but it's musically <i>wrong.</i> I can't cite any rule that tells me <i>why</i> it's wrong. It just is.<br><br>This strikes me as exactly, at the microscopic level, what you and Spengler are painting with a broader brush. "Voice leading" is a trick used to make music easier for the singers. It isn't a mark of either good or bad music. But as a Culture becomes a Civilization, the demands of art become the demands of form, and so, while you might be flunked from a composition class or barred from the ranks of professional music for Bad Voice Leading, you will never be expelled for being merely insipid, or ugly.<br><br>It's always fascinating to see these very particular personal nits find such a tidy home within a larger perspective.<br><br>I find it somewhat encouraging, as well. After all, had I been <i>appropriately</i> concerned with my reputation as a properly-trained musician who knows better than to commit the crime of BVL, I'd been terrified to attempt even a Methodist hymn. Which is perhaps the whole point of the shift to form over art.<br><br>It's encouraging in the sense that a degree of inexpertise is an asset, not a liability, when it comes to making art.<br><br><a href=#c8541600017336161333 title="comment permalink">6/6/13, 4:06 PM</a><br><br>

My naive assumption is that the health of "culture" will be driven by other type of health rather than be the driving force: e.g. if a culture is expanding and conquering the world I would expect great music to be made at that time. <br><br>I am very interested in the idea of the trajectory of rationalism.... would love to know more about how this has occurred in other past civilisations. I wonder if one way that our intellectuals can resist the pull of post-modernist truth scepticism is by trying to link ethical truths with neurobiology/ evolutionary psychology... don't think it will work but it is at least a new option....<br><br><a href=#c8975848819167818037 title="comment permalink">6/6/13, 9:07 PM</a><br><br>

That makes sense. <br><br>Joseph, fascinating! Yes, that's very much the sort of thing that Spengler was talking about -- that and its opposite, which is the deliberate flouting of formal rules for no better reason than to flout formal rules. <br><br>Marko, the length of time that a civilization lasts, according to Spengler, is very nearly random -- it may be a long time or a short one, depending on incidental factors. If we didn't have the jaws of resource depletion and environmental destabilization tightening around our civilization's neck, we might well end up with an imperial state over the long term. Instead, we can expect a short-lived empire -- that's America's -- followed by a descent into a dark age. That's my take, at least. <br><br>Bill, excellent! You get tonight's gold star, for developing a simple way to show that the myth of progress covertly imagines a future of static perfection. <br><br>Bozack, Spengler doesn't discuss mechanisms. He's purely talking about morphology, "what happens" rather than "why does it happen." As for the wider industrial world, a lot of barbarian tribes outside the Roman world had chieftains who wore togas and coined their own money on the Roman model; a successful civilization is usually imitated by surrounding societies. In our case, that covers much of the world. <br><br>Harry, thank you. <br><br>Permaliv, it can be hard for people from our civilization to recognize deliberate ugliness in others, since canons of beauty are culturally created and thus what looks hideous to people of one culture can be perfectly charming to those from another. You might have a look at late Roman art, though -- that included a cult of garish ugliness that's close enough to our aesthetic that a lot of people can get it.<br><br><a href=#c5648058177124510486 title="comment permalink">6/6/13, 10:48 PM</a><br><br>

It is always fascinating to see the source of ideas. It was a particularly clever idea of Spengler to let the critics provide free fact checking services! It made me laugh. Excellent work and I note that you have also used this method between the blog and books.<br><br>He's right too, you know, morphological thinking/reasoning is well suited to comparing civilisations. It is just that people don't like the message of such analysis and so dismiss that message.<br><br>I spent some of my earlier years travelling through third world countries. I can't explain why I did so, but it was probably because of economic reasons (ie. it was cheap).

As the ocean heats up to the north west of the continent, winter rainfall becomes more like summer rainfall. Summer rainfall becomes intermittent and heat is blown here in from the centre of the continent. A couple of days ago, during the dry season they received 140mm to 180mm (5.5 to 7 inches) of rain up in the north west of the continent at Broome.

The paths of civilization seemed to follow river courses with increasing stages of development and hierarchy on the main, downstream trunks of river systems and less developed, "seed" stages in the upstream branches. A blossoming of culture did happen downstream upon an initial base of abundant resources. When civilizations collapsed the hinterlands offered a refuge for escape or retained a cultural reservoir and of course the biodiversity to continue the hunting and gathering life ways in smaller groups. In this vein, perhaps we need to rethink the Noah mythology. Was Noah escaping a flood on an ark or was he escaping the collapse of flood plain civilization by returning upstream where all the wild beasts and plants in the 2 X 2's were inhabiting the wild earth? And is it not us who are really adrift on this global ark, with our dependence on domesticated nature, fossil fuel, fragmented ecosystems, and ratcheting of technology to keep our heads above water. Are the timbers of this ark to be soon splintered into a million pieces and will there be a refuge for Noah anymore? The ultimate tension may lie between those who would keep this boat afloat at all costs and those who have kept faith in the wild seeds.<br><br><a href=#c50128475644933803 title="comment permalink">6/7/13, 10:51 AM</a><br><br>

If your son has a choice of lumberjack, miner, railway worker or other dangerous job vs. joining the military, the military may not look like such a bad bargain for parents or offspring. But now that we are down to one or two cherished offspring per family the prospect of sending a child into danger is more difficult to accept.

I read a philosophical/sociological biography of Makaguchi years ago that rushed back into my mind while read this post. The author, Bethel, posits that (my own summary follows) we seem to be locked into an endless cycle of conflict. The educational system in a Revolutionary society emphasizes the “Moral” (what we must do) with the “Intellectual” (reasonable justifications for why we should do it) placed second and the “Technical” (how to get it done) coming in third. Eventually the revolution becomes established. The educational system in an Established society emphasizes the “Technical” (how to establish the goals or the revolution) with the “Intellectual” placed second (reasonable insights supported only to the extent they further the technical initiatives of the new regime) and the “Moral” coming in a distant third because the moral imperative for revolution has been long since established. Eventually a new group of revolutionaries arise and the establishment, though destined to fail, reacts against them. The educational system in a Reactionary society emphasizes the “Moral” (what to do -- conserve the old ways) with the “Technical” (how can we best destroy the revolution) placed second and the “Intellectual” (reasonable justifications for why we should maintain the status quo) coming in a distant third. A <b>Self-Renewing society</b> would have an educational system which emphasizes the intellectual, then the moral, and lastly the technical. In order for such a breakthrough, the vast majority of people will have to re-prioritize their philosophical outlook so that all religions and social reform movements become subservient to one over-arching concept: Our shared Human ability to pursue reason.<br><br>[Reference: Makiguchi the Value Creator, by Dayle M.

The problem for many people (including me) is the use of the word God, which carries overtones of a superior being floating around somewhere, spiritual or physical, attempting to micromanage earthlings to various degrees, and punishing disobedient ones when necessary. Of course, I have abandoned any belief in such a critter, and have claimed the agnostic tag to the whole idea of "God". However, your description of the cosmos is spot on, and what I have come to recognize thanks to some reading of the Tao Te Ching. There is a natural order within nature/the universe that we are a part of and are subject to its functions. Perhaps I need to listen to others more carefully when they use the word God, as they might not mean what I think they mean.

Recall that Spengler wrote nearly a century ago, when the Western avant-garde movement was merely a tiny knot of artists bent on assaulting the conventional sensibilities of the prevailing culture. As author and critic Lionel Trilling once explained, in Spengler’s time these people weren’t interested in talking to the masses. Their art was rarefied and special, designed exclusively for the avant-garde itself, those inclined to look down on the masses and on conventional thought and culture. Few at that time predicted that this avant-garde cynicism and cultural nihilism eventually would be absorbed into the popular culture itself and be accepted, even embraced, by large numbers of people within the so-called masses—the same masses under assault by the avant-garde. But Spengler saw it coming, as merely the inevitable consequence of any civilization’s transition from its cultural to its civilizational phase." - Robert W.

Although I'm a comparativist by temperament and profession, I must admit that I am inclined to pick at Spengler a bit for his habit of portraying cultures as autonomous, bounded units. Although civilizational cycles are very, very real, and I think Spengler rendered an enormous service by his morphological treatment of the general phenomenon, I also have some sympathy with the historicist perspective that sees every moment as radically unique. <br><br>Much of what makes every moment unique is, in fact, the cumulative heritage of the past. The "Battle of the Books" in the late 17th century is instructive. If there is a catastrophic collapse of Western Modernity, its dreams will still be here in texts and oral traditions--like the Mycenaeans in Homer's poetry. <br><br>How will their fossilised remnants be understood and utilised? They will certainly not disappear forever from our mental firmament. Likely they will remain, like wisdom teeth or a dorsal ridge, on our collective body. No doubt 800 years from now some new Arnold of Brescia will try to revive the Star Trek civilisational project, hurling it in the face of the reigning socio-political-oneirocracy of his time.<br><br>That being said, I think it's important that there be a metabolism between priests and prophets, innovators and traditionalists, people who focus on what is new under the sun and people who focus on what is the same, if we are to have a more adequate picture of the time in which we live in order to respond accordingly.

This is real science, in which empirical questions are being investigated, and, in spite of their inherent difficulty, the investigations are beginning to show sharable, empirical, results, which might, within a decade or two, begin to have profound effect on our society.

In many ways his framework for thinking about the future is so much more solid than his main competitors, that it seems like nitpicking to critique him. But like your critique of Nietzsche, it is critical to grasp what he didn't have right in order to really appreciate his contributions. <br><br> In past comments, I have outlined my main critique, which is that the last 500 years of ascendance of 'the west' have seen more than just the discovery of stored fossil energy. And many of the discoveries are not going to be easily lost. We have gone from the first circumnavigation of the globe to doing it in under 2 hours and communication across the globe in milliseconds. We have gone from a patchwork understanding of a little of how nature works to a comprehensive reductionist understanding of how atoms and photons form materials, human beings, and galaxies. One does not have to be a adherent of the religion of progress to observe that the scale of change in what humans do that has occurred in the past few centuries has never occurred in any period of less than a few million years in the history of our planet. The global ecosystem itself is recording the magnitude of the changes we have made. And so analogies with previous societies only go so far. They are a powerful antidote against the notion that we are now omnipotent and will not see current growth rates reverse. But the claim that an agrarian feudal society will follow the age of fossil fuels seems not to be a very reliable prediction.<br><br>In 1920s it was easier for Spangler to guess that nineteenth century science would go the way of Greek science and mathematics...as groundbreaking insights that were lost for centuries. But in 2013, that argument is pretty hard to sustain. There are too many people who know how to build radios and computers using pretty basic tools for them to ever disappear. And there are too many people who understand the history and structure of the universe for the transformational discovery of our place in the cosmos to be forgotten. So, some foundational insights of modern science are not likely to dissolve as a future society chooses other priorities. Many parts of the religion of scientific progress may disappear. I expect the 'endless frontier' rhetoric of Vannevar Bush that dominated science policy for the last 60 years will be abandoned. So I would say that the course of previous societies gives us our best guidance about human nature in a declining civilization, but the technological options available this time make prediction of the actual course of human economy, technology, standards of living, and ecology on the basis of previous societies' trajectories to be only modestly useful.<br><br>Thanks for your stimulating essays.<br><br><a href=#c5167485729502960153 title="comment permalink">6/9/13, 1:44 PM</a><br><br>

New ideas are astonishingly rare.<br><br>Your theory of catabolic collapse being one such is a very insightful observation and I certainly wouldn't have been able to develop it.<br><br>Mostly here at the farm, I bring together the work and observations of others. The ideas get tested and if they work in this environment and are worth the effort, they're incorporated otherwise they get discarded. Having no background in farming, I'm not dogmatic about any particular systems, but instead can pick and choose. Most visitors tend to have strong opinions which they are all too happy to share!<br><br>The power system here is an ongoing saga. Winter is a real drama as the battery temperature plummets (well probably not to your winter, but still it's cool. The average temperature is probably about 9 degrees Celsius now). As temperature goes down, the batteries have to be recharged at ever higher voltages and the complex system here adjusts for this. <br><br>However, the other day I observed that one setting on the controllers didn't adapt to the readings from the temperature probes. This has caused the batteries to be under charge during winter. I changed the setting and then ... 25% extra charging that day. I could seriously kick the controllers and all of the money, time and stress I spent on the recent wind turbine. Plus all of the generator usage in previous years over winter... The technical manual had no word of this unique feature either. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time to observe what was going on, knowing that something was a bit off. Grrr! Another household not too far from me is suffering from the same problem and we’ve been discussing it at length.<br><br>I cannot underestimate the number of years that it takes to get all of these different systems working optimally. It is virtually impossible to move to a farm and make a successful go of it from day one. It is just not possible. I'm not whingeing, I'm just floored every time I learn something new about the place.

Creationism is not a theory in the scientific sense since it is not predictive and disregards all evidence that would falsify it.<br>The evidence for the theory of evolution is copious, physical, and objective. The abilities of the theory of evolution for prediction and analysis of speciation vastly outweigh any competitive explanations. <br><br>Belief in angels, or belief in angelic intervention in human affairs, is a different kind of belief. You seem to be holding up those ideas as crass superstition and all people who believe them as scientific nincompoops. I do not think this is the case.<br><br>It is possible, though unusual, to be conversant with the scientific method and even to practice it, and to be conversant with current scientific knowledge, without believing that existing methods of scientific investigation can describe and understand everything important about the cosmos. One major area of human inquiry in which science has thus far made little progress is the nature of consciousness. At this moment, we don't know how widely spread consciousness is, whether it is an emergent property of life, or whether it is fundamental in some way to the fabric of reality.<br><br>The word angel comes from a root in both Latin and Greek which means messenger. Biblical angels are messengers of God, conceived to be entities which do not ordinarily have physical existence but are capable of taking on physical existence temporarily, and capable of communicating with human beings either through ordinary physical speech or through subjective visions and sensations. <br><br>I am not suggesting that there is scientific evidence for the existence of angels or that people ought to take their existence on faith. However, many religions espouse a belief in angels, demigods, tutelary spirits, or some other kind of sometimes embodied, sometimes disembodied intelligent entity that is friendly to human beings and interacts with humanity from time to time. If the majority of Americans believe in angels, that simply means that the majority of Americans have a belief in some form of traditional religion. <br><br> <br><br><br><br><a href=#c2410669579532903834 title="comment permalink">6/10/13, 4:49 PM</a><br><br>

One can see similarities in structure and evolution of species and cultures, though there may be differences (e.g. gene transfer in most species is mostly vertical, whereas meme transfer in most cultures is mostly horizontal). Is a civilization like a web of interacting cultures, which is similar to an ecosystem being a web of interacting species? Or is a civilization more like an invasive species that takes over an ecosystem? <br><br>There is more to the story of speciation than adaptation. For example it seems like there are two necessary conditions for speciations: reproductive isolation of small populations, and (this is more controversial) mutation of a master gene, which hierarchically regulates many other genes. So by analogy, there might be more to the story of the rise of cultures than adaptation. But Spengler seems to be describing the social equivalent of succession of an ecosystem, not of cultural speciation. Still there might be differences. Whereas ecosystems can reach a stable equilibrium, history suggests that civilizations collapse. Why this difference? Is it necessary or incidental?<br><br><a href=#c9025106567252440095 title="comment permalink">6/10/13, 4:54 PM</a><br><br>

A successful high culture always inspires imitation, at least on a superficial level, and the sheer material extravagance made possible, however temporarily, by industrial civilization makes that imitation particularly attractive in the present case. <br><br>Hewhocutsdown, you're welcome. <br><br>Raven, no, that has essentially nothing in common with the shape of time as I've described that concept, though it's a useful quantitative factor to keep in mind. <br><br>Mary, you're welcome. It's exactly the process of muddling on, it seems to me, that's the best reason for hope. <br><br>Rita, that may be part of it, but I'm by no means certain it's all of it. <br><br>S P, running out of ideas is a common fate faced by all creative arts. Hollywood remained creative about as long as, say, jazz, or ancient Greek tragedy.<br><br>Phil H., my answer was Spengler's analogy; I'd have used a different one if we were talking about a different writer. Still, your farmer friend makes a good example of what Spengler is talking about. It's not just that he's nearing the end of his life; so is industrial agriculture. <br><br>JP, heck of a good question. Every attempt at an explanation I've seen is basically handwaving; it may be that high cultures pop up when and where they pop up, for reasons that don't submit to any sort of ready analysis. <br><br>Hapibeli, The Baha'i faith is a good contemporary example of what Spengler called the Magian high culture -- that's the one that emerged in the Middle East around the time the Roman world was winding down, and took the shape of a galaxy of religious communities, with Islam and Rabbinic Judaism the two most famous examples. (Christianity started out as a Magian faith but veered in a different direction.) It's a model that works tolerably well for a community of believers, but doesn't scale up well beyond that -- which is to say, I'm less sanguine about that than you seem to be.<br><br><a href=#c8866355508133044744 title="comment permalink">6/10/13, 5:06 PM</a><br><br>

As for computers, are you serious? Sure, there are plenty of people who can put together premanufactured power supplies, motherboards, etc., but how many of those people have the least idea how to wind the coils for a power supply transformer, etch a circuit board, etc? Then there are the memory and CPU chips, which can't be made at all in the absence of whole suites of extremely complex and demanding technologies dependent on extravagant energy and resource availability. <br><br>My response to your critique remains what it's been: you're ignoring the extreme vulnerability of today's information storage technologies and the consequences of the extreme specialization of the modern economy, both of which make it all too likely that vast amounts of today's knowledge and technology will be lost during the unraveling of industrial society. I've come to believe, in fact, that it's exactly the conviction on the part of most people in the industrial world that our current technologies and knowledge base <i>can't</i> be lost that all but guarantees that they <i>will</i> be lost, because there are too few people willing to take the steps that might succeed in preserving them while there's still time for those steps to have some effect. <br><br>Cherokee, the interesting thing about the catabolic collapse theory is that it's based squarely on <i>The Limits to Growth</i> -- I simply generalized the process of decline sketched out in that study, applied it to the history of earlier collapses, and went from there. I'd be the last person to claim that it was a wholly original notion. <br><br>Paul, then perhaps you can explain why Spengler's work was a bestseller in the US during the boom years of the 1920s. As for your final comment, I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out what relevance that has to the topic of this post. <br><br>Leo, I believe there's a bit of a difference between anarchy as a fact and anarchism as an ideology. <br><br>Iuval, excellent! That was one of the things behind my suggestion, in <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>, that the future history of technic societies might best be understood using succession as a model. The point I'd make is that "collapse" is a very broad term. Until 1911, for example, Chinese civilization had established a climax community that was viable, with ups and downs, for several thousand years; ancient Egypt managed the same thing, until it was disrupted (as China was) by external forces. If industrial civilization turns out to be the first sere in a succession process, the ecotechnic civilizations of the far future may last for thousands of years as well -- though we have a lot of seres to get through before then!<br><br><a href=#c4272316795964259195 title="comment permalink">6/10/13, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

Most universities have electrical engineering or electronics labs and an AM radio receiver is a standard project. Maybe by 'from scratch' you mean starting on a desert island? Most students start with a diodes, wires, a few resistors/capacitors and a pre-built speaker. They learn to make power supplies, but don't wrap their own transformers (or mine and process their own copper and a lot of other things if you want to be complete). Students also regularly build micro-computers starting with wires and and CPU and memory chips. The silicon fab to make the CPU and memory chips is difficult, but there is going to be good money available to anyone who keeps that skill alive...and if you are willing to work at slower speeds and transistor counts, the technical requirements are not nearly as difficult as making 3GHz chips on 30 cm wafers.<br><br>To the main point though, I think you overestimate how complex much of modern technology really is. The really hard part is usually the basic engineering discoveries and the marketing to figure out which of the many things you could make will actually sell. With something so simple and obviously useful as a telephone or a radio or even a computer or cell phone, it is hard to imagine how the ability to build them will be lost. Basic things like agriculture, the wheel, etc were not lost when past civilizations collapsed. It is hard to know which things will be lost in our future. High energy consumption things like air travel are likely to dramatically decrease. But basic electronics is not all that complicated, and is too useful to be easily lost except maybe at the end of a die off of most of the humans.<br><br><a href=#c1476274075050592442 title="comment permalink">6/12/13, 6:16 AM</a><br><br>

I believe given enough supplies, time to practice and documentation, I would be able to produce one rudimentary calculator (not full fledged computer) every other day.<br><br>Now, technologies do not exist in a vacuum, but within a social context. My calculator is not going to be pretty or intuitive to use, but since we can expect literacy to crash there might be a market for it.

With a modest investment of time and effort, he can turn his half-a-dozen kids into a semi-skilled, unpaid (and admittedly illegal) assembly line that can churn out abacuses on a per hour basic.
