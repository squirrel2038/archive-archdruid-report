<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> was, as some of my readers grasped, more than an attempt to imagine the far future without reference to the contemporary folk mythologies of progress and apocalypse—though it was also that, of course. In particular, I hoped to evoke from my readers a specific response or, rather, two precisely opposite responses: the two sides of a fault line along which the tectonic pressures of the collective imagination are pressing toward crisis. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The results were as good as I could have hoped. Some of those who read last week’s account of a future without limitless progress, to be sure, found the prospect unbearably dismal. The most vocal spokesperson for that point of view was, unexpectedly enough, SF writer David Brin, who contributed a fine thumping tirade—helpfully <a href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8587336&amp;postID=5105002076347799283">posted to his own blog</a> as well as this one—full of the sort of “if you disagree with me, you’re just being negative” rhetoric most often used these days to market Ponzi schemes and perpetual-motion devices. Still, he also took the time to characterize the narrative as an infuriatingly gloomy “paean to despair.” Though nobody else seems to have felt quite the same need to bluster about it, a number of other readers expressed similar reactions. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes this fascinating to me is that a rather larger number of my readers had the opposite reaction. A vision of a future in which civilizations, species and worlds follow life cycles like those of all other natural things didn’t leave them furious or depressed. Their comments instead featured such words as<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“comforted,” “delighted,” and “awed.” It’s easy, and also common, to mischaracterize such feelings as simple schadenfreude at the failure of humanity’s overinflated ambitions, but there’s something rather more significant going on here. Not one of the readers who made these comments made gloating remarks about the fate of humanity or the Earth. Rather, what comforted, delighted, and awed them was the imagery of Nature’s enduring order and continuity that I wove throughout the narrative, and brought to the tightest focus I could manage in the last two paragraphs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This division is one I’ve been observing for quite some time now. It so happens that my unpaid day job as the head of <a href=http://www.aoda.org/ >a contemporary Druid order</a>
brings me into contact with a tolerably large number of people who fall more generally on the latter side of the division I’ve just traced: whose sense of wonder and instinct for reverence are far more readily roused by the order of Nature, and their own necessary participation in that order, than it is by the overturning of natural order that plays so crucial a role in the theist and civil religions of mainstream Western culture. It so happens, for that matter, that I find myself consistently on that side of the division I’ve just traced. Reflecting on my own sense of alienation from the conventional religiosity of our time, and on what I’ve learned from the many other people who experience a similar alienation for similar reasons, I’ve come to believe that what’s going on is the emergence, for the first time in more than two thousand years, of a genuinely new religious sensibility in the western world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A religious sensibility isn’t a religion. It’s the substructure of perceptions, emotions and intuitions on which religions are built, and to which religions owe both the deep similarities that link them to other faiths of the same general age and historical origin, and the equally deep divides that separate them from faiths of different ages and origins. Between the tendency of modern religions to insist loudly on<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>their uniqueness, on the one hand, and the opposed tendency of modern irreligion to run all religions together into a formless blur, on the other, the concept of distinct religious sensibilities is a difficult one for many people nowadays to grasp; the best way to make sense of it is to glance back over the emergence of the religious sensibility that currently dominates the western world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you had the chance to survey the religious landscape of the western half of Eurasia and North Africa two or three millennia ago, unless you happened to be looking in some very obscure corners, you would find very few similarities to the religious institutions, practices, and ideas of today. People didn’t belong to congregations that met regularly inside buildings to pray together; questions concerning life after death weren’t a big deal for most people, and nobody wasted time waiting for the end of the world; sacred scriptures in the modern sense were distinctly rare, next to nobody claimed that a god had created the universe, and even the most devout believers in one deity freely conceded that other deities existed and deserved the reverence of their own worshippers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The core religious institution of that era was the temple, a house for the deity rather than a meeting place for worshippers—rituals in the old temple cults took place out in front in the open air, not inside—and the core ceremony was sacrifice, in which worshippers invited the presence of a deity for a feast and quite literally “killed the fatted calf” to supply the main course for divine and human participants alike. (Food storage technology being what it was at that time, that was the way you provided meat for any honored guest.) The status of priests varied from one part of the western world to another, but in most places they were elected or hereditary officials set apart from the laity only in the most pro forma sense, and you didn’t have to be a priest to perform a sacrifice.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Behind all the richness and diversity of the religious life of the time was a distinctive sensibility, one that saw the cosmos as a community to which gods and men both belonged. The modern notion of equality had no more place in their cosmos than it did in any other ancient community, but the sharp differences in rights and responsibilities didn’t prevent every member of the community from having a share in its collective life and benefits. That sensibility once had the force of revelation; the Jews, for example, were late adopters of the temple cult, and the awe and wonder palpable in Solomon’s prayer at the consecration of the temple of Jerusalem (II Chronicles 6) conveys something of the power of a religious vision in which gods could “in very deed dwell with men on the earth.” It was by way of that emotional power that the sensibility of the temple cults superseded a still older sensibility whose traces can just be made out in the oldest strata of Western religious traditions. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, by 600 BCE or so, the initial power of that vision had long since settled into a comfortable routine of thought and practice, and by 600 BCE or so, in turn, the first stirrings of a new and very different religious sensibility were starting to appear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Orphism in the Greek-speaking communities of the Mediterranean basin and the earliest forms of Buddhism in India rejected the celebration of life’s good things in the community of gods and men, and offered in its place a radically different vision—a vision of salvation from the natural world and the human condition itself, available to an elite few willing to embrace a life of radical austerity and spiritual practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then and long thereafter, this was a fringe phenomenon that appealed only to a tiny minority of intellectuals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most people either believed and practiced as their great-grandparents had, or settled into fashionably up-to-date materialist philosophies that discarded belief in gods without stirring the smallest fraction of a cubit from the religious sensibility that underlay the traditional faiths. Still, the new sensibility spread into popular culture as the years passed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You can track its spread by the way that robust traditional celebrations of human sexuality gave way to shamefaced discomfort with the facts of reproduction. Many Greek religious processions, for example, carried large wooden penises as emblems of the gods’ gifts of fertility and delight; by the time Greek philosophy was a going concern, intellectuals were muttering excuses about symbols of the abstract progenitive power of the divine principles to justify to themselves a tradition with which they were obviously uncomfortable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Attitudes toward sexuality of the sort that we now call “Victorian” found an increasingly public voice as the new sensibility spread, though here again most people simply rolled their eyes and did what they and their great-great-grandparents had always done. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The great breakthrough of the new religious sensibility took place over the half-millennium after 200 CE, as three great religious movements—Christianity, Islam, and Mahayana Buddhism—democratized the older vision of salvation for an elite, by proclaiming faith in a uniquely holy person and his doctrine as a valid substitute for the lifelong austerities and spiritual disciplines of the older tradition. The shift was never total; ordinary members of all three movements were expected to take up certain practices and austerities, of the sort that could be pursued alongside an ordinary lifestyle, and all three also evolved roles for those who aspired to the total immersion of the older tradition (monks and nuns in Christianity and Buddhism, Sufis in Islam). By that time the new sensibility had become sufficiently widespread that throwing open the doors of salvation to all and sundry got an enthusiastic response. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s indicative of how deeply the new sensibility had percolated through the society of the age that by the time Christianity began its final rise to power in the Roman world, its Pagan rivals were as deeply committed to the idea of salvation from the human condition as their Christian rivals. The writings of late Pagan intellectuals such as Iamblichus and the Emperor Julian show as much discomfort with sexuality and physical embodiment as those of their Christian contemporaries; what differentiated the two was simply that the Pagan writers defended the older, elitist conception of salvation for those who earned it by austerity and spiritual practice, against the new vision of salvation by faith, and made common cause with what was left of the old temple cults because those had long been a focus of Christian animosity. Their rearguard action failed, though its literary remains became a lasting resource for those who never did fit in with the new sensibility—or, more to the point, with the specific institutional forms that the new sensibility took in its cultural and historical contexts. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A religious sensibility, after all, is not a monolithic thing, and its expressions are even less so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In Europe and the European diaspora, the division between more elitist and more democratic visions of salvation became an enduring fault line, to be joined by the divide between centralized and collective concepts of spiritual authority, on the one hand, and between more this-worldly and more otherworldly concepts of salvation on the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Fault lines of comparable importance, though radically different nature, ran through the older religious sensibility as well, and can be traced in the very different religious sensibilities of regions outside western Eurasia and the Mediterranean basin. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For that matter, older religious sensibilities and their institutional forms can quite often find a way to survive in the interstices of the new; consider the way that Shinto, a temple-centered polytheism of the classic kind, has been able to hold its own for more than fifteen centuries in Japan side by side with Mahayana Buddhism. The repeated revivals of Pagan worship in the western world from the late Middle Ages to the present suggests that the same thing could as well have happened in Europe and the European diaspora, if violent intolerance along religious lines had been less of an issue there. The point that needs making here is that the dominance of a religious sensibility is never total; even when a great majority of people take the presuppositions of a given sensibility for granted as unchallengeable truths, there are always those who don’t fit in, whose personal sense of the sacred pulls them in directions outside the accepted religious sensibility of their age: some toward sensibilities that have been dominant in the past, others toward sensibilities that may potentially play the same role in the future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s important, it seems to me, not to impose the traditional folk mythology of progress onto these shifts from one religious sensibility to another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of course it’s been a rhetorical strategy common to many modern religions to do exactly this, and to portray the replacement of the old temple cults by the new religions of salvation as a great leap forward in human progress. Still, that strategy runs serious risks. There’s always the danger that some more recently minted theist religion will play the same card, and argue that just as Paganism was replaced by Christianity, say, Christianity ought to be replaced by the latest, hottest, newest revelation, whatever that happens to be. There’s also the considerably greater danger that atheists will make exactly the same argument. This latter has been a valuable weapon in the atheist arsenal for centuries now, and it gets much of its power by drawing on the same arguments monotheist religions used against their polytheist predecessors. As an edged joke common in Neopagan circles these days puts it, when you’ve already disbelieved in all the other gods, what’s one more? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, the contemporary quarrels between atheists and theists, like the equally fierce quarrels between the different theist religions of salvation, take place within a shared sensibility. It’s indicative, for example, that theists and atheists agree on the vast importance of what individuals believe about basic religious questions such as the existence of God; it’s just that to the theists, having the right beliefs brings salvation from eternal hellfire, while to the atheists, having the right beliefs brings salvation from the ignorant and superstitious past that fills the place of eternal damnation in their mythos. That obsession with individual belief is one of the distinctive features of the current western religious sensibility; in the heyday of the old temple cults, while acts of impiety toward sacred objects or ceremonies would earn a messy death in short order, nobody cared about what opinions individuals might have about details of religious doctrine, and thinkers could redefine the gods any way they wished so long as they continued to show proper respect for holy things and holy seasons.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The hostilities between Christianity and contemporary atheism, like those between Christianity and Islam, are thus expressions of something like sibling rivalry. Salvation from the natural world and the human condition remains the core premise (and thus also the most important promise) of all these faiths, whether that salvation takes the supernatural form of resurrection followed by eternal life in heaven, on the one hand, or the allegedly more natural form of limitless progress, the conquest of poverty, illness, and death, and the great leap outwards to an endless future among the stars. It’s precisely the absence of those common assumptions, in turn, that makes communication so difficult across the boundary between one religious sensibility and another. The gap in understanding that reduced an intelligent man like David Brin to spluttering fury at the suggestion that salvation might not be waiting for humanity out there among the stars is exactly parallel to the one that drove normally tolerant Roman thinkers to denounce the early Christians as “enemies of the human race.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, the fact remains that to a growing number of people nowadays, promises of salvation from the natural world and the human condition—whether that salvation takes the more traditional form of eternal life in a supernatural realm or a more contemporary form decked out with spaceships and jetpacks—fail to evoke the emotional responses they get from participants in the older religious sensibility. It’s not merely that these promises no longer ring true, though in many cases that’s also an issue; it’s that they no longer have any appeal. What stirs awe and wonder in these people, rather, is a sense of belonging and of participation in the great cycles of Nature, an awareness of oneness with life that does not shrink in terror from life’s natural completion in death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What inspires them is not the hope of a final separation from the realities of nature, life, history and time, but a conscious and delighted participation in these realities—not the promise of salvation, but the reality of homecoming. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The emergence of this new religious sensibility has been, as such things always are, a gradual process. Historian of religions Catherine Albanese in her useful 1990 study <i>Nature Religion in America</i>
has traced it back in American religious life to colonial times, and its roots in older European cultures go back considerably further still. That said, it seems to me that the last few decades have seen the new religious sensibility approach something like a critical mass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It’s become much more common than it once was for me to encounter other people who, as I do, find more cause for reverence in the curve of a grass blade in the wind or the dance of energies through an ecosystem than in the dubious claims of past miracles offered by theist religions or the equally dubious promises of future miracles made so freely by the civil religion of progress. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If I’m right, and the new religious sensibility I’ve outlined in this essay will play a significant role in the religious imagination of the western world in the decades, centuries, and millennia to come, a case could be made that its emergence is timely. More than any other single factor, the civil religion of progress helped to drive the weird astigmatism of the collective imagination that makes blind faith in vaporware seem like a reasonable response to the converging crises of our age, and convinces so many people that the only possible thing to do in a blind alley is to keep stomping on the accelerator in the vain hope that the brick wall in front of them must surely give way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>

Understanding that entanglement, and how a different religious sensibility might help to unravel it, can offer some useful insights into how we got into our current mess and how we might get out of it; we’ll discuss that next week.</span></div>

A friend showed me a movie on food scarcity that came out last year 'A Place at the Table', the movie was on its own merits a mid grade piece of propaganda on how the federal food policies ought be to fix an unacceptable predicament, but it also featured interviews with people from Collbran the tiny cow town I grew up in. Seeing how much my home town has changed since I went off to College 7 years ago is chilling. It was never a rich place, but it was far better off when I was growing up. The world that people becoming adults today walk into is so changed from my experience in '06, and with it the abandonment of the traditional narratives grows more common. Not all go in directions I can make much heads or tails of; similarly I have done little to maintain any contact many people I once knew in Collbran.<br><br>Tales of the long stories and the long cycles are favorites of mine, and my roommates. Aspects of them are seen as dreary or cynical by some of my progress leaning friends. But its a different World-feeling than that, there is sorrow, but mixed with awe in a outlandish and beautiful way. I wonder about those who go through more hardship in their developing years than I did, all the various ways the young will express their religiosity, how it will fortify them in some faculties, but erode at the foundations of others. I hope the grasp of screens on the youth weakens a quickly as possible relative to the decline of other social systems, and I hope that weakening grasp does not release anything too unfortunate.<br><br>The 4 year old in our household sang a song about her tower of blocks that would "bring rain to the compost" and it started to rain. I think I am going to try to start another 14 yard pile of compost in light of the movie on food scarcity, when in doubt, make better soil. Here in Colorado there is never a lack of need for good soil, if someone will do it for free. Best to make it before the daily dump trucks of wood chips stop driving by en-route to the landfill. Too bad Collbran's climate won't even support the gardening that is possible in Fort Collins climate.<br><br>I am looking forward to the Equinox ritual on the 22nd, it will be my first Equinox celebration with a group of friends. If anyones going to be near Fort Collins drop me a line, the more are there the more is there to learn.

Firstly, JMG’s logic tools, social and physical context as well as his historical analysis are in fact fruits of a shared Greco/Judeo-Christian heritage. What I mean is that he is advocating a pygmy belief system whilst perched on the shoulders of giants (analogy not insult!). Paganism as a religious and cultural system could not have produced a JMG making the arguments he does! Additionally, the test of any belief system is what it is like to live in a society where that belief system is practically (as opposed to theoretically) implemented. As a South African I am frequently exposed to societies where animism and polytheism form the foundational belief system of millions and from my limited experience these sections of society have some very grievous social downsides which stem from these same belief systems. A druid from 600BCE might at some point have been found cutting someone’s throat and placing him or her (reverently) in a bog. The difference between that druid and this one illustrates the point.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c5976002274625077716 title="comment permalink">9/11/13, 11:01 PM</a><br><br>

Late night random thoughts<br><br>1) last week's post was great fun<br><br>2) "A mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels."<br><br>3) in Mike Pollan's latest book (Cooked) he devotes quite a few pages to the ritual aspects of traditional BBQ and ... wait for it... the possibility that it represents a slender but unbroken thread of meaning from ancient days (pre-civ even) of ritual animal slaughter and feasting, offering to the gods the smoke or insubstantial/spiritual essence of the sacrifice, and sharing among the "congregation" the earthly nourishment. Temple religion indeed!<br><br>4) The idea that our "home" is some other place that we go to only after we die is one of the strangest we humans have come up with, imho. "Trailing clouds of glory do we come" and all that -- the idea that our physical life is actually a dream or sleep or period of benighted idiocy from which we wake, upon death, to our *real* existence... well it's hard to wrap my head around it, that's for sure. Certainly a useful religious sensibility for slaves and other similarly downtrodden folks who have to endure much hardship and suffering in life and need to hope for deliverance to a Better Place.<br><br>5) There is a divergent theme in NT theology that intreprets Christ's message as actually subversive of this "pie in sky" sensibility, and interprets "the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand" as meaning not "it's coming real soon now, any day" but "it's right here w/in arm's reach if you can only see it." There are injunctions to the faithful to behave like the birds of the air and the lilies of the field -- in other words, to be more creaturely and less self-conscious and worried about some putative future.<br><br>That's enough stray thoughts for now. Must sleep. My quite elderly Mum is visiting, so thoughts of age, mortality, Time and inexorable change are very much with me... I notice in passing that there seems to be a wry sort of consolation for doomer/preppers who contemplate the inevitable loss of beloved, aged parents in the context of the Long Descent; we can feel somewhat relieved if we expect them to die *before* things get too much worse. Whereas doomers/preppers with grandkids (ones I meet anyway) have a lot to worry about. Strange, innit. Very strange. Turning the Narrative of Progress upside-down upends also the consolations/sorrows of generational positioning. Children and grandchildren represent, not security and hope, but worry; the natural aging and demise of parents (who lived pretty good lives during the fossil party, if they were born in the right place with the right phenotype) seem almost, ummm, lucky?<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c4064332663679428966 title="comment permalink">9/11/13, 11:53 PM</a><br><br>

I'll probably know it on another level entirely on my deathbed. To not feel warm and fuzzy contemplating an atom of mine shared by some future being doesn't necessarily mean I'm a disciple of progress. And for someone to feel warm and fuzzy doesn't necessarily mean they're any more in sync than I am with the way things are. Maybe they are repeating that mantra because it means they can avoid feeling otherwise about this terrible beauty we call death? Or maybe I'm just singing a more melancholy air on the same theme. Either way I'm guessing neither of us are enlightened,<br><br>If we all lived in your first sensibility promoting culture there would still be those who are left, if not cold, certainly not warm and fuzzy at the mystery of life because after all there are two kinds of people; those who are dead and... :)<br><br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c5067461739718319869 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 12:10 AM</a><br><br>

Unfortunately, much of what I see in the world right now tends to reinforce this ideology. It is my impression that through a lackluster educational system that is more interested in creating new consumers than it is workers we've created a culture that fails to question anything beyond how our basic needs are met. In essence, few people want to be bothered to learn about what is happening outside their windows. Those of us who do cast a critical eye to what we are being told by the mass media and the authorities are generally marginalized. Far from giving up, perhaps it is time that we collectively make more concerted efforts towards planting sustainable communities and growing them into something that can last beyond the long arc of our current culture.

One is tempted to say that they have *no* religious sensibility, but, as has been made rather clear in this forum on a previous occasion, the idea that people of no religious sensibility exist is self-evidently too preposterous to even talk about (and by 'self evidently', I mean 'and no arguments for this will be forthcoming').<br><br>For what it's worth, I'll give my take on the 'meh'-feeling.<br>Deep time is a very awesome place, to be sure, but that one of 'my' atoms may end up in an alien does not have any discernible implications for my actions in the here and now.

It seems that you are adherent of "deep time" thinking. Some scholars I have read put it this way (my pardon about very bad translation to English): <br><br>There are at least three layers in history. First, most easily observed layer is that of news and daily happenings. Attention span of this layer is from one year up to one decade. Current hazzle about Syria works as good exampe about this one.<br><br>Second layer is the one where cultural and political mood shifts inside civilizations occur. It's attention span is from decade up to one century. Our current zeitgeist period started after World War Two, when horrific brutalities and excesses caused by 1800's philosophies on steroids send Western civilization tailspinning into abyss of current political correctness, self-shaming and bashing of all manly virtues. Period of mentioned cultural trends we are living is in turn experiencing it's own twilight years currently. Good riddance.<br><br>Third layer is that of millenias. It is where tectonic forces of cultural evolution change very slowly ways mankind observes reality around. It is in this unit of time where intellectual "revolutions" of 600 BC and 300-600 AD happened. Below daily "news" of those eras deeper forces were working. Changes caused by them are more lasting and durable than state formations or empires which offered stage for them to occur. Emprerors and kings and caliphs, none of them remains, but laws laid down by rabbis, bishops in Nicaea and the ulama shape the world where we are living today. There can be no stronger testimony to power of that force but the fact that billions of people profess belief in single god and lead their lives in accordance.<br><br>Curiously enough, this "deep time" construct used by some secular historians has counterpart in the world of mystical/religious thinking, and way older one.<br><br>Sun's position in sky moves slowly at equinoxes and solstices, one degree per 72 years or something like that. In some traditions this unit of time is called Great Month, and whole circulation of the Sun is called Great Year. <br><br>There is also different interpretation, where peregrination of one degree roughly corresponds "Year of Gods" measured other way. Year starts with sign (observed through whole of the world) that no person alive experiences but once during lifetime... This means that when last person alive to have perceived this sign departs, the new sign is experienced by those alive during that exact moment, and cycle of the Great Year starts all over again... This cycle is supposed to roughly correspond precession of the Sun. <br><br>I'm sorry for this quite confused explanation, but I have no anthropology skills or adequate level of English language to explain better. These probably Gnostic traits of thinking have had some publicity here in my country back in the days, when our famous author of historical fiction and eager investigator of mystic traditions weaved this world view into two novels, "The Immortal Turms" and "Johannes Angelos"... Later was written in the form of (fictional) correspondence by last porphyrogénnētos of the (New) Rome, and is very good novel indeed.<br><br>However, my actual point in all this is that "deep time" is actually one of the oldest surviving ways to perceive world history, descending from astronomer-priests of Mesopotamia through Parsi to at least some current non-anglosaxon Indo-Europeans of the East... So semi-mystical and/or religious thinking comes to same conclusions as some secular historians. <br><br>Once more, sorry about horrific English in this comment.

Not that I see it or anything else replacing my country's dominant religion any time soon. If population decline and emigration doesn't drive this nation into extinction, I imagine some form of refurbished Orthodox Christianity surviving here long after the West's traditional theist religios have been replaced by new ones.

For a long time I thought that the trouble was just a failure of focus. Now I'm much more inclined to believe it has to do with something far more central, namely Christian metaphysics itself, which insists, as you rightly put it, that in the end the goal is to transcend this world, to place our hope in a life beyond it. Now I would argue that a faith that puts incarnation (the divine becoming flesh and blood) at the center of its vision of reality, does not have to be a faith that overlooks or despises the natural world; nevertheless Christians in my opinion have never been too good at finding, in the creation itself, a gift to desperately love. Instead if there's beauty, well that's a sign that points somewhere else, to an beauty infinitely greater. Or if there's anything frightening or dark or violent about it, (disasters) well that's a sign of our need for refuge in a world beyond.<br> And where does that leave us? Unsatisfied with the here and the now, and in the end never quite willing or able wholeheartedly to love it. The arrow strikes the intended target at a tangent and glances off. No desperate falling in love for us. No speechless wonder at this gorgeous reality we inhabit. No overwhelming desire to protect, to embrace, to nurture the world, the very elements of which are knitted into our very flesh and bone! I myself would use marriage language to communicate the way that I feel we should love the planet. But try injecting that into a conversation with most of my Christian friends!<br> I could never give up the faith; it's so much a part of me, it would be like giving up my language, or cutting off a foot. But I do find that quite often I have to go it alone, in expressing my response to what I think others around me of the same faith just fail to see or hear. The beauty (and the troubles) of the world themselves call attention to the shortcomings of our response. It's like trying to play the Hammerklavier sonata with one hand.<br> <br>HB<br><br>http://ninevoltnomad.blogspot.com/<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c7932600203030672570 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 4:56 AM</a><br><br>

My first reaction to this post was that you're identifying nothing new; this sensibility is everywhere, whether you call it The New Age or eco-whatever. But then I realised what you have brought into focus so clearly is the emotion/worldview behind it, and more crucially the worldview of those who don't share it. I have been surrounded by 'nature lovers' (for want of a better term) for so long I had forgotten what other people really feel. My mind boggles that people take more comfort from believing in 'the afterlife', 'enlightenment', or 'infinite human progress' than from being alive in this world now.<br><br>I was brought up as a traditional Catholic Christian in my formative years, but to me now the details of the theology seem preposterous and laughable - the virgin birth, transubstantiation, etc. I don't know whether I still believe in 'God' and 'life after death'. But either way I have no EMOTIONAL investment in these ideas. As you identify, what matters is the emotions, the source of one's awe, one's sense of reverence. I find it in the natural world, in deep ecology and deep time.<br><br>Likewise, I have always loved science fiction, whether the drama-in-space kind or the more intellectually ticklish classic short stories from those who ask "what if?". But I have never 'believed' sci-fi and space travel like a religion, the way I 'believe' in the sanctity of earth's ecosystem and the wonder of life and consciousness in a physical universe.<br><br>Many thanks for sharing your ideas - I look forward to your posts every week.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c9025401542668546392 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 4:56 AM</a><br><br>

I've spent the last several years I suppose unconsciously letting go of fixed habits of thought, all various versions of attaining future salvation through "right" belief and behavior. Belief in work/upward mobility, a couple of religions, political narratives, etc. Running, running, running. Even my initial participation in the process of simplifying my life was shaped by this sense of "do this and things will work out well in the future". Always the future, and I would always get quite bothered when any of these belief systems were shaken.<br><br>It seems I've had to exhaust this process, by falling in and out of love with several systems of belief, to be able to really understand that there is no salvation in the future. There is just acceptance of the fullness of life right now, with all its ups and downs, an acceptance that our happiness and satisfaction is completely rooted in our life in natural world and the relationships which span out from it. As you start to get this it seems so obvious, and the experience of life deeper deeper and easier, more peaceful.

She goes to the Baptist church, mostly for social reasons; he seems to have that sort of chimeric vague monotheism found in a lot of present-day folks of mixed european and native american cultural background. While we were discussing her choice of church, he gestured at the landscape around him and said "this is my church." I then mentioned that I was an animist; I generally avoid the "P" word in most circles around here since most people think it is synonymous with either atheism or satanism (after all what else is there in the world but Jesus, Satan, and the Void?). They didn't know what the word meant, so I explained it briefly. They both said "Oh, that's what we are too." <br><br>About 25 years ago I was listening to a casual lunchtime seminar by a professor of religion at the University of Georgia. He mentioned that, based on the sorts of questions and comments he hears from them in classroom discussions, he felt that about 3-5% of his undergraduate students were animists (or at least held beliefs indistinguishable from animism), whether they self-identified that way or not.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c860449451896524009 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 6:39 AM</a><br><br>

What inspires them is not the hope of a final separation from the realities of nature, life, history and time, but a conscious and delighted participation in these realities—not the promise of salvation, but the reality of homecoming."<br><br>I'm getting strong vibes of G.K. Chesterton's writings in "Orthodoxy," which leads me to think that perhaps--even in mainstream religions--the transition to a new, very different religiosity has been in progress for a century already. In the same vein of thought as Oswald Spengler, I think the rise of materialism in a culture signifies the death of an older religious sensibility, and the advent of a new one, which may take many years to fully manifest itself. While I still regard myself as a Catholic, my sense of the universe is very close to what you describe in today's entry.<br><br>I'm interested in what you think of the role of complexity science in this new religious sense. Beginning with Mandelbrot, and elaborated by Christopher Alexander, Jane Jacobs, Nassim Taleb, and Nikos Salingaros (among many others with whom I am less familiar), complexity science and fractal geometry are a central part of my worldview, and an anchor for my sense of belonging in the universe. I also observe that complexity science is very disruptive to existing paradigms in economics, architecture, politics, medicine, religion (and atheism), etc; this new line of thinking has the potential to dissolve previous worldviews and give rise to new ones.

Having been raised in a Protestant church until my early 20s, I can fairly say that I experienced the preoccupation with the afterlife and salvation. In my mid-20s when I started seriously contemplating death, I began panicking. The very thought of oblivion without something beyond death still terrifies me to this day. In fact a few days after reading last week's post (while watching the film "Oblivion" ironically), I suddenly had a few moments of total dread as the idea of dying and the end of consciousness flooded my mind. I don't know if this is a challenge I will ever overcome. <br><br>Having said that, I have been embracing nature and the sort of sensibility you describe in recent years. Again, the final result of that thinking is as yet unclear to me, much as what that journey could look like.

I wish I'd had access to your writings when I was a young undergraduate at MIT in the 90's, where I found myself surrounded by nominal "atheists" whose religious fervour in the name of Science and Progress was unlike anything I'd ever seen in a more conventional religious setting. The low points had to have been the Singularity cult and the Extropians, both of whom gave the Scientologists a run for their money for sheer lunacy, running around waving their magical galvanic skin sensors in the air and spouting holy writ from their pulp-novel sci-fi scriptures. But aside from these bits of comedy gold, the entire institute was pervaded by a culture of enthusiasm for the inevitable, eternal march of Progress, and I found even the relatively sane, reasonable members of the community to be pretty crazy.<br><br>At the time, I knew I couldn't embrace that mythology, but I had very little idea about where else to turn for a vision of the world that I could accept as true. I went through an extended New Age / Eastern Religions phase, which ended up being enriching but still left me a bit unsatisfied -- I'm perhaps not enough of a serious person to play along with any of it without rolling my eyes now and again (no offence). It took me about five years after leaving MIT to get comfortable with calling myself an "atheist" again, this time meaning something quite distinct from the neoliberal cult of Progress that currently owns the use of that term in pop culture.<br><br>Your writings are a real comfort to me. Not because they paint a way forward for my own life (they really don't), but because they remind me that I'm not crazy to believe what is obviously true about the world and our place in it.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Picador<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c6274365882927817704 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 7:36 AM</a><br><br>

But when I thought about it, it did make some sense. Salvation may be a failed ideal, at least as an effective response to industrial civilization's crises at the collective level. It might have helped had the austere way to salvation been really popular but that is not how it has turned out. The most popular paths to salvation currently only end up making the crises worse.<br><br>Also, given that no future human civilization is likely to have the wherewithal to inflict the kind of damage that we have had on the biosphere, what's the need for salvation? The austere path to salvation would be needed only as a treatment for individual psychological problems - something for which other methods may prove equally effective. <br><br>So maybe the corvins are the ones in real need for salvational religions - and only if it is of the right kind.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c7230487218171074070 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

Capernicus, Galileo and Darwin succeeded, to the scorn of religious institutions, in taking humans off the altered position of being the center of the universe and opened the door of seeing the vast universe and relative insignifigance of humans in it. And as you so brilliantly write here the civil religion of progress really is only a sibling putting us write back on center stage. There really is so little difference. <br><br>It is the very emergence of a weakening biosphere because of this hubris that we are also seeing the emergence of this new religious sensitivity standing in awe before the workings of nature. That is so timely and no coincidence. <br><br>Neither 2000 years ago when western religions were emerging nor the past 200 years of the civil religion of progress was the biosphere really a tangible concept of the sacred. Because like oxygen, when it is present it is invisible. It only becomes visible in its absence or when threatened. And so we see this new religious sensitivity coming just at the right time. <br><br>This new religious sensitivity will grow with the biblical consequences of biosphere feedback in the decades ahead and will reawaken a sense of the sacred in the natural world, aided by the return of the predators (germs and famine) that will act like heat that tempers steel in allowing this new religious sensitivity to define the culture that surrounds it. <br> <br>It is a vision that really awakens a sense of the sacred in me and gives me great hope.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c8702276053437846901 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 8:27 AM</a><br><br>

I think such theologies have been developed for the believers, not for those who don't believe.

Pretty much nailed it right there. The concept of differing religious sensibilities is useful, and it helps clarify some fundamental differences I've had with others. <br><br>One place this difference shows up is the importance of belief, as you mentioned. If one's concern is with the condition of the physical, natural world and its impact on those born (and sprouted, etc.) into it, practice becomes central, while belief becomes peripheral. To my mind, this is a crucial difference between the appropriate tech lit of the 70s cited in Green Wizardry and the "sustainability" movement of today. It seems these days that environmental activists are often more concerned with what people believe about climate change, etc. and not as much concerned with the consequences of actions. This is interesting, as today's Americans wield more power (as measured in watts) than any generation in history or elsewhere on Earth, and the ways in which we use (or choose not to use) that power are likely to have outsized impacts on the future of the country for generations to come. <br><br>I'm enjoying this series quite a bit, and I hope that at some point you circle back to tie up the loose end of several weeks ago. Your take on what scientific research might look like in the context of a declining society certainly piqued my curiosity.

It is shared by people who's outward faith is Christian (like Wendell Barry), Buddhist (like Gary Snyder), atheist and neo-pagan. And by the same token there are people in all of those movements, including neopaganism, that don't share the new sensibility at all. <br><br>That might sound obvious, but it was very surprising to me. When I was younger I enjoyed ecospiritual writings by Buddhists and Christians, but I assumed that they were missing something, because they clothed their religious sensibilities in the trappings of the old, salvation-oriented religion. Now I see that this isn't at all the case. I actually came upon this realization in a somewhat startling way. In the last year I've gotten heavily into ceremonial magic. Initially I was uncomfortable with the Judeo-Christian entities that make regular appearances in the Golden Dawn tradition. Then one day I invoked the four Archangels and I realized that the beings looking back at me, whatever name I called them by, were completely unrelated to the concept of an "archangel" I had picked up in Catholic Sunday school. Instead, they were nothing less than the gods of the natural world that I had always by nature preferred! <br><br>That brings up another point, which is that there are elements of the older religions worth preserving, including in area of personal "salvation," however you want to define it. Spiritual growth, mysticism and monasticism, the hard work. The good stuff. I wonder if you might not feel that way also (you did write Paths of Wisdom after all), and if <i>The Celtic Golden Dawn</i> might be an effort at exactly that end? <br><br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c4788224446964042909 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 12:18 PM</a><br><br>

Individualism and freedom are very often assigned to the realm of thought and “philosophy” (broadly understood), when in fact these experiences are almost entirely fabricated from the purely social experiences available through and to language. On the other hand, the body is often relegated to the role of slavery and political control simply because the body is obviously susceptible to imprisonment, torture, etc. Example: Thoreau’s mind is free while writing Civil Disobedience, though his body be imprisoned. <br><br>My intuition tells me at the root of this shift in religious sensibility there is work to be done properly assigning the above roles. The mind is constructed of political and social ideals. But the body provides an entrance to the world outside the nomos (law).<br><br>Incidentally, JMG, did you ever notice in Plato’s famous image of the cave that the only access the prisoners have to the natural world is through their physical self?

I had to go through the “stages of grief” a la Kubler- Ross as best I could, finally seeing that I could choose despair (tempting) or seek something more positive.

What would Thursday mornings be without a visit to the Archdruid! Your writing and that of the community of commenters have been inspiring and comforting. <br>One idea from the Green Wizardry cannon was preserving knowledge for the future; my chosen field being medicinal plants: the identification, harvesting, growing and making medicine with them. One of my goals is having a library of books and an archival herbarium of the plants most needed and used locally. I find it wonderful that several different commenters have referred to books by Stephen Harrod Buhner, most recently, Stonemeadow . I find his work very helpful in bringing us into nature rather than just talking at us about it…on an experiential level.<br>The further I delve into the secret world of plants, the further I am pulled into the great wheel of the seasons, the solstices and equinoxes, the “rightness” of slowing down and resting in the winter and the bright busyness of the garden cycle.

I had focused on the “We are stardust” aspect which I find pretty cool, but not so much your vision of the ongoing universe. I did not take that vision to imply a lack of meaning or purpose or spirit, since such questions were not addressed.<br>If nature's enduring order is for naught – order generally having a purpose – and there is only an endless string of intelligent species rising and falling, each looking out at the stars and wondering deep questions but with nary an answer existent, well, that is somewhat bleak. <br><br>If salvationist religions made an appearance and had mass appeal beginning around 600 BC, that would be quite interesting in light of what the yogi Yuktaswar, Yogananda's guru, said about the yugas. That we descended into Kali Yuga about that time, and that its duration is only some 2400 years. The ancient Egyptians had a similar system, which seems possible to me in that there are so many cycles to nature, why shouldn't we be affected by cycles we have not yet understood that affect us psychically?<br><br>I guess I am an elitist when it comes to salvation. Christian salvation theology is a dumbing down of spiritual common sense; I call it cheap salvation. It actually negates free will and is somewhat boring and pointless as a cosmic worldview.<br><br>On the other hand, if we look at nature there is a tremendous amount of step by step ordering, so why should there not be progress on the part of living entities, as they gain wisdom through lived experience? Anything which the human being longs for so consistently ought to real. <br><br>I have long thought that atheists and theists or Christians are not so different on the spectrum. It may well be that belief in God has some importance, and that the theist has got that part right, but what I see in the world is that believers only believe slightly, and are almost entirely immersed in this life. I don't see a big difference in the avoidance of death between believers and nonbelievers. To ask whether someone believes or does not believe in God is a shallow question. If I want to know something about the developing wisdom of a soul, I would ask whether they are able to engage in deep introspection, whether they are able to deeply question their worldview and take it apart for examination, whether they have ever been struck by the fact that they know nothing, how many good questions have occurred to them? Likewise, have they learned that other people are real and not only themselves? <br><br>I once read that someone said to the Buddha, “But what about God?” And the answer was to get enlightened, before which the question was not really appropriate. That is wisdom. For beginners, belief in God doesn't help them all that much so far as I can see, and the atheist can do perfectly well in increasing personal wisdom just by living and thinking. Even though God is the all in all in my view, belief in his existence is only of minor relevance which is why he doesn't care. Indeed, a stopover in atheism may be a valuable learning experience.<br><br>I don't want salvation from the world, but I want to purify my soul within it, I want to know who I am and be able to come and go in physical manifestation without amnesia. That would be salvation enough for me.<br><br>All is sacred.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c2420922228714029296 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 2:04 PM</a><br><br>

Salvation is salvation from the human condition of ignorance of this reality. <br><br>(I’m not sure what nature has to do with it, but none of this requires rejecting nature at all unless you maintain that nothing is true of nature except what we know of our own discovery (without revelation). For what it’s worth, in this exegesis, God is a natural being, revealing natural truth, which is beyond human understanding without his natural help. Just replace reality with nature in the above, and the statements are unchanged.).<br><br>Objections?<br><br>“The bible says otherwise…”, notes the first objector.<br><br>So what. Truth cannot be communicated by a book. Perhaps that’s why Jesus never said, “Go write a bible.” Also, the bible can be made to say anything you want it to say - with sufficient mental gymnastics.<br><br>“If the bible isn’t known to be true, then how can you know any of your premises: namely, that God exists, he has a son, his son became incarnate? We only know these through the bible,” asks the second.<br><br>False. While Christians do place far too much emphasis on the bible, it is not because of the bible that Christianity exists, but the other way around.<br><br>Anyway, what you have here may be true for all I know; In which case Christians are a pretty boorish lot. <br><br>:- (<br><br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c3704174458044233334 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 2:40 PM</a><br><br>

I developed an idea that in order to implement the kind of general change required for future human survival, the social- psychological force needed can only come from a religious source, as exemplified in the past, by the construction of cathedrals and the like.<br>2. The basic psychological difficulty people have in regard to their dying and death is their simple recognition that the end of their physical functioning as a living entity means no further experiencing of anything, period. I agree that this is a very hard concept to accept and internalize, but in grasping it, a serious psychological issue is firmly settled. Also, at this point, the case boils down to understanding that “nothing really matters” after you are no longer capable of awareness.<br>This is a great “out” for any contemplations about personal existence, whatever that may consist of and should be a great relief. In addition, with this, it should be recognized that there cannot be any hope of contact, in any form, with those who have gone down the road, previously. This desire is deep part of the emotional being that humans are, but must be lived and grown through by us all.<br>I am concerned with the issue of how can human beings be possibly be comforted when the dying starts as a result of the breakdown of industrial civilization. I don’t think that there will be an initial, soft process of “dieoff”. The destruction of technological infrastructure and its normal functioning, presently, has no alternative path for survival, at the level needed. Billions of people are going to be without food, water and shelter in a very short interval of time. The means to obtain these necessities outside of the system are minimal and will be reduced further, in the event. The deep vicious circle of warfare and destruction will come to a halt, but not before the demise of most of present day humanity. The collapse won’t be total, but horrific never the less.<br>If the needed religious mechanisms can be implemented, a great deal of suffering can be avoided, especially if there are developed, as a major part of it principles, a deep respect for life and productive living, including effective methods of social sharing and physical care for each other as well as the environment. An additional lesson that will be needed, by humanity, will simply be learning how to raise personal consciousness and awareness, beyond one’s own attention. The effort for doing this can be started, even now, with prospective beneficial results. <br>I hope that my expressed thought, here, will be of some value.<br><br>Respectfully,<br>Ben Simon<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c1332748752933265071 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 3:00 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks to everyone for their feedback -- yes, even those of you who disagree with me. <br><br>Ray, let me be sure I understand this. Your four-year-old sang a song to bring rain for the compost, and it immediately started to rain? I think you may have a budding wizard on your hands. ;-)<br><br>Lure Junkie, the paradox is purely in the linear scheme of religious evolution you're applying here. You might consider Shinto, which is a polytheist faith which most Japanese practice; do you find those same grievous downsides in Japan? For that matter, where monotheist faiths don't have a secular government riding herd on their propensity to persecute, they tend to have some pretty grievous downsides of their own. As for today's Druidry, it isn't ancient Druidry; we don't bury people in bogs, any more than you burn heretics and Jews at the stake, and it's rather a display of bad faith to bring up the one without acknowledging the other, don't you think? <br><br>Jo, you're welcome, and thank you. <br><br>Patrick, the only reason I've been able to figure out how to talk about it is that I encounter a lot of people who share the new sensibility, and have had pleny of chances to fumble vaguely with words about it! <br><br>Unknown, thanks for the link! You're quite right, of course -- the panic in that article is palpable, as is the free use of really dubious logic. <br><br>DeAnander, bingo -- sacrificial ceremonies were basically community barbecues, with the gods and goddesses as the guests of honor. It definitely made for good, hearty, stick-to-the-ribs religion. <br><br>Kevin, of course there are many shades and variations, and there are also plenty of people who aren't touched by either of the sensibilities I described. If you'll reread the post, you'll find that I mentioned that in so many words. <br><br>Sunfyrlion, well, I don't think Homo sap. is quite finished yet, so we may manage the thing one of these days. <br><br>Bruin, before we can have sustainable communities we have to have sustainable individuals. Get working on your own life, and once that's sustainable, it's time to start working with others. <br><br>Thijs, you might want to glance back over the post, and notice the place where I said that, ahem, "the dominance of a religious sensibility is never total; even when a great majority of people take the presuppositions of a given sensibility for granted as unchallengeable truths, there are always those who don’t fit in, whose personal sense of the sacred pulls them in directions outside the accepted religious sensibility of their age: some toward sensibilities that have been dominant in the past, others toward sensibilities that may potentially play the same role in the future." If your personal sensibility doesn't fit in either of the two I've traced out, well, that follows, doesn't it?<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c4822028833951678307 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 3:17 PM</a><br><br>

That's why I tend to focus on ancient societies I know a little about, when citing examples of ecologically sensible practices in premodern times. <br><br>Stonymeadow, if Thomas Traherne is being quoted in full on shintaido sites, I'm even more sorry that I've never lived anywhere where shintaido is taught! <br><br>Juhana, your English is considerably better than that of many US high school graduates, so no need to worry. As for precession, I have no idea if it's available in your part of the world, but the book <i>Hamlet's Mill</i> by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend might be worth a read. <br><br>Ursachi, what drives the replacement of one religion by another is always a complex matter, and it's quite possible that a lot of Eastern Europe will remain Christian for a very long time to come, even if other religions end up predominating in Western Europe and America. <br><br>Øyvind, granted, Le Corbusier has a lot to answer for, but I'd save a share of the blame for the Bauhaus. My sister-in-law had to spend a year in a college dorm designed by Gropius, and ended up wishing that he could be condemned by a just and wrathful God to spend all eternity in his own buildings. <br><br>Flute, glad it's a useful concept for you -- I was looking for a way to talk about the emotional and perceptual underpinnings of a religious worldview, as distinct from the specific beliefs, imagery, and institutions built on that foundation. <br><br>Brazza, it's going to be a slow process, but there might be some positive changes at the end of it. <br><br>JC, I find Darwin's own writings very inspiring reading. <br><br>Ando, the quest for an escape hatch from the human condition is becoming ever more frantic as the consequences of decades of really bad choices pile up, and so, yes, there are a lot of people cashing in on that demand.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c5120891325976149839 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 3:31 PM</a><br><br>

As for the New Age, well, I suppose you could twist the concept around to mean that; just remember that neither the Second Religiosity nor the emergence of a new religious sensibility means the end of history, or the evasion of any of the consequences of all those bad decisions we've made for decades now. <br><br>Harlan, there's no need for you to give up your faith. There's been a significant amount of movement toward expressions of the new sensibility I've discussed within Christianity, and if the Christian faith manages the transition to the new sensibility, it won't be the first example -- the Jewish and Hindu religions both managed the leap from the old sacrificial temple cult to salvation-centered faith without abandoning their primary commitments. <br><br>Christine4, you're quite right that the new sensibility is nothing new; it's been slowly emerging for several centuries now. Still, as I mentioned in my post, I think it's approaching a critical mass. <br><br>Nathan, I tend to think that what's going to happen forty or fifty billion years from now is not really something we have to concern ourselves with! <br><br>Yupped, exactly! One of the downsides of salvation-centered religions is that they can produce an extreme form of provisional living -- everything is about heaven or nirvana or what have you, rather than here and now. In turn, the mystical traditions within salvation-centered religions have had to come up with any number of ways to counteract this bias.<br><br>Andy, not at all; what was before the temple religions had its own distinct sensibility, which replaced another one before that, and so on back for a good long while. Also, how do you get a totalizing narrative out of an abstract analytical category that I pointed out, in so many words, was never monolithic or universal? <br><br>Juhana, nice! Thank you. <br><br>Watchman, I haven't -- I'll put it on the to-read pile. As for White, we'll be discussing the strengths and weaknesses of his case shortly. <br><br>RPC, I haven't followed current Catholic theology, so wasn't familiar with the piece in question. I'll have to find time to look it up. <br><br>Matthew, I've also noticed more of the new sensibility in younger people -- not to mention an easier time grasping the reality of the ongoing decline of the industrial world. It seems like a good omen. <br><br>Bill, I encounter the same thing quite often, as I'm sure you can imagine! Very few people "convert" to Druidry; what typically happens is that they find out about what we are and what we teach, and say, "Wow, that's what I think, too. I guess I must be a Druid." <br><br>Alex, I haven't studied complexity science closely, though I've read Wolfram's not-unrelated <i>A New Kind of Science</i> and will have some comments on that shortly. I'll see if I can find time to read up on Mandelbrot et al.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c2105515516897627826 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 3:50 PM</a><br><br>

Still, I felt it was important to link to Brin's comments, because they're a perfect example of an intelligent man goaded to rage by the conflict between his basic sensibility and one that contradicts it. <br><br>Will, that will indeed be interesting. The moment I'm waiting for is when somebody drags out the imagery of infinite progress, and the only response is a general laugh. <br><br>Someofparts, fascinating. I'm not a dog person, but I can see how that might work. <br><br>Thrig, that's one of the few things Lewis got wrong. Monotheists were considered <i>atheioi</i> (literally, those without gods) because they didn't offer proper respect to holy things, festivals, etc. It wasn't their belief but their actions -- thus even in the nastiest of the Roman persecutions of Christianity, you could get off scot free by simply burning some incense publicly to the guardian spirit of the Emperor. <br><br>Matthew, if you'll glance back over both these posts, you'll notice that nothing in them either supports or opposes the idea of life after death. That's quite deliberate; within any given sensibility, there are many beliefs about that issue. <br><br>Maria, delighted to hear it! <br><br>Ben, if you're interested, my book <i>A World Full of Gods</i> builds that argument a good deal further. <br><br>Picador, glad to be of help. One question, though -- must your life move "forward"? Forward to what? <br><br>Shrama, every religion and every religious sensibility I know of has a place for those who seek transcendence through austerities and spiritual practice. What varies is the relevance of such people and their path to the broader purposes of religion. Thus I don't doubt that religious forms that emerge out of the new sensibility will have their own modes of intensive spiritual practice; it's simply that everyone else won't be expected to practice a "mysticism lite" made effective through faith. <br><br>Doc, widespread adoption of biomimicry would require human designers and engineers to admit that nature is smarter than we are. That'll happen, but not until the new sensibility becomes a lot more widespread than it is now. <br><br>Jeffrey, the remarkable thing -- as I mentioned in an earlier post -- is that the worldviews before Copernicus et al didn't actually put humanity at the center of the cosmos; it's simply important to the historical mythology of the modern world that they be thought to have done so. This is all the more remarkable because the civil religion of progress gives Man, the Conqueror of Nature, a far more central and important role than any theistic religion ever did!<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c9195939486026727182 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 4:07 PM</a><br><br>

Exactly what role belief is likely to play in the religious forms that evolve out of the new sensibility is anybody's guess, but I'd be surprised if it was as central as it's been in recent centuries in the west -- that's the most belief-centric religious sensibility in history, as far as I know. <br><br>Richard, not at all. Eleven million years is a <i>very</i> long time, and I've assumed the gradual evolution of more ecologically sensible approaches among human societies over that time. <br><br>Raven, ask three Druids, get at least five answers. The variety of Druidry I practice includes a strong vertical dimension. <br><br>Mike, we'll be covering that next week. The short form is that yes, there's a link you've missed. <br><br>Emmanuel, in the world of my novel, everybody composts everything. It's as automatic and as unthinking as taking out the trash is to today's Americans. If there were monastics, though, they would be nuns, not monks -- there's a definite gynocentric pattern to the religious and intellectual life of my imagined Merigan culture. <br><br>Robert, do you remember when Spengler, the columnist for The Asian Times, was insisting tongue in cheek that the US ought to elect Vladimir Putin as its next president, since he's got plenty of experience with rescuing a collapsed superpower? It was a very edged joke, sharpened considerably by the fact that Putin seems considerably more capable of talking plain common sense than any of the buffoons we have in US politics these days. <br><br>Alexander, thanks for the link. <br><br>A.S., not in the least. Thanks for the tip -- I'll look into them. <br><br>Zach, that's a complex issue. I've seen significant movements toward the new religious sensibility in many branches of Christianity -- and generally the more conservative ones at that; consider Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, who's arguably part of the most conservative church of all, and has been way out there in front in terms of ecological activism, including such practical steps as getting Orthodox monasteries to put in solar power. <br><br>As I mentioned to Harlan above, it's far from uncommon for religious forms to make the jump from one sensibility to another with their central commitments intact. If I'm right about the new sensibility, I'd expect future Christianities to put a great deal of focus on the incarnation and a kenotic Christology, among other things, but that's not all that far from trends at work today. <br><br>Mike, if that's true, I'll be delighted. <br><br>Doug, that's certainly my take on things.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c3556778512760469794 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 4:40 PM</a><br><br>

It's simply that, as an intellectual on the cultural and religious fringes, there are only a very few people, all things considered, that I'll be able to reach at all. <br><br>Joseph, that's an excellent question. I don't propose to make the future's choices in advance -- but if they want printing presses and shortwave radios, I'd like them to have the opportunity to have them. <br><br>Steve, I haven't forgotten about science in a post-progress world; I simply get to things in my own eccentric order... ;-)<br><br>K-dog, oh man. I wonder if such obvious clutching at straws is going to be the thing that finally makes the Rapture business so embarrassing that nobody wants to admit they used to believe in it. <br><br>Steve, as I mentioned to Shrama, every religious sensibility I know of has had a place for disciplined spiritual practice, so there will doubtless be something of the kind in the future -- and it may borrow quite a bit from older forms. As for my esoteric writings, I'm mostly concerned with providing students right now with something that they can work with; the far future will no doubt come up with its own approach! <br><br>Bill, nah, I didn't think his comment was extreme. Blustering and intemperate, yes, but on the internet? That's par for the course. (There are good reasons why I keep this forum tightly moderated.) <br><br>Developer, the attitude of societies toward land is a very complex and fluid thing, and yes, it's usually shaped by the religious sensibility of the time. How long will it take for the new sensibility to start shaping our land use patterns? Good question...<br><br>Redoak, excellent! You get today's gold star for asking some very hard questions. I don't propose to try to answer them off the cuff, as they deserve more thought than that. <br><br>Peacegarden, I know a lot of people who've had that experience.

I find several misconceptions, but I will only address one for the moment. Both people who turn away from traditional religious scripture and towards nature for religious inspiration and those that turn to traditional religious scripture and away from nature for the same purpose will find their search incomplete. As I see it, Nature and Scripture are the two "Books" of revelation unto humanity.<br><br>Human interpretation of their true meaning, and our role in both, is inevitably disastrous, leaving both nearly unrecognizable and often undesirable. <br><br>Getting beyond this dross, seeing both for what they are, brings us a truly unifying vision. Natural law and spiritual law coincide harmoniously. For example, we eat to commune with the earth and to nourish our bodies. We pray to commune with our Creator and nourish our souls. The absence of either causes illness. These are but a single law manifested in the natural and spiritual realms.<br><br>This is the avenue humanity needs to explore at our current crossroads, now that our earth is being objectified and mistreated and our religious sensibilities torn asunder by moral relativism.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c2931303870285261938 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 5:53 PM</a><br><br>

And the post concludes by showing a video clip of St. Sagan of the Holy Church of Cosmic Progress. I see he’s also gunning for Jim Kunstler, and made some unflattering comments about Kunstler when he was a teenager. Sounds like we have another Jason Godetsky out there, but this time on the side of the Religion of Progress rather than neo-primitivism. <br><br>http://nebris.livejournal.com/5526647.html<br><br>You must have really touched a raw nerve with the true believers in the Cult of Perpetual Progress. Eric Hoffer once observed in “The True Believer” that people who buy into a particular belief system tend to become more strident and insistent and increasingly willing to tune out contrary evidence as their worldview becomes more and more untenable. The Archdruid as a black magician and a “pocket vest version of Sauron”? Responses like this one and David Brin’s piece suggest that the believers in the Religion of Progress are getting desperate in spite of their outward optimism. <br><br>They keep telling themselves that new miracle sources of energy such as solar power, wind turbines, algae based biofuels, shale gas, fusion reactors and zero point energy (all of which are either not new at all or are science-fiction if not science-fantasy and likely to remain that way) will allow them to keep living the same mass consumer lifestyle that so many consider to be an entitlement today. It’s a scary thing to contemplate the idea that all of that might be going away and that we will have to make do with a lot less in a much harsher world due to the foolish choices of the last few decades.<br><br>Deep down inside, I think they know the gig is just about up, and it scares the hell out of them, so they are desperately telling themselves and anyone who will listen that there is no need to worry because this or that miracle solution will come along. “I believe it because it is absurd” applies just as much to the Religion of Progress as it does to Tertullian’s theology. There a lot of people in deep denial who are desperate to keep the status quo going, but they are setting themselves up for a fall and perhaps an early grave by their inability to face up to reality and just deal with it.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c7617117517740798420 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 6:13 PM</a><br><br>

Is the purpose of a poem getting to the end of it? (Well, I've read a few of which that could be said...) I'd like to suggest the possibility that the order and meaning of the universe, like that of a poem, a dance, or any other creative work, is found in the journey, not in the destination. <br><br>Wall0519, Suzuki's got a lot of mystics on his side; for that matter, though I don't consider myself much of a mystic, it's an experience I've had tolerably often. If you ever remember the name of the book, post it here; I'd be interested in reading it. <br><br>Nano, always a good starting point! <br><br>Bogatyr, down the road a bit I want to write about my favorite works of non-progress SF. There's been quite a bit of it down through the years, including some thumping good reads. <br><br>Orc, no, that's not what I'm saying at all. What I'm saying is that Christianity, like other religions that emerged over the millennium or so after the birth of Jesus, was powerfully shaped by what I've called a religious sensibility -- a human, social, collective set of emotions and presuppositions -- that predisposed believers to interpret the message of Jesus in terms of leaving the world behind and going to Heaven. That's far from the only way to interpret the Christian faith, but that's the way that was historically most prominent over the last two thousand years or so. If I'm right and a new religious sensibility is coming into play in the western world, other ways of thinking about the Christian message may be more common in the two thousand years or so ahead of us. Is that a little clearer? <br><br>Dave, that's an incredibly oversimplified model of the way human population dynamics work. I'd encourage you to study some ecology before making such generalizations. <br><br>Bogatyr, a good friend of mine with a Chinese wife and mother-in-law has connections with a very similar tradition; they're all through the Chinese diaspora, and have roots going back to the Han dynasty. The interesting thing there is that we have homegrown traditions like that in the Western world as well -- the notion that everybody in the west was a vanilla-flavored Christian until 1965 or so is pure hogwash, though it's pleasing hogwash to some of today's pseudoconservative pundits. Will Chinese traditions get wider influence as China does/ You bet -- but they won't be alone on the playing field by a long shot. <br><br>Ben, I think you're incorrect in expecting a sudden dieoff of billions of people, and I'm far from sure your denial of life after death is as essential, or as relevant, as you believe -- though that's your call, of course. Do people need to start thinking hard about how to deal with death up close and personal, on a fairly large scale? There, of course, you're on much more solid ground, because even the sort of extended stairstep decline I'm expecting will involve lots of death. <br><br>Thecrowandsheep, yes, by a small margin. As for Bauhaus, my sister-in-law described the Gropius dorm as basically unlivable -- designed with no attention to human needs such as basic soundproofing between one unit and the next, for example, as well as stunningly ugly. <br><br>Jo, sounds like a plan -- and the folks at <a href=http://www.luckymojo.com/catalogue.html rel=nofollow>Lucky Mojo Curio Co.</a> can get you set up with books and a cup for tea leaf reading, so you can add foretelling the future to your new religious movement!<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c3164350328287840132 title="comment permalink">9/12/13, 9:19 PM</a><br><br>

A religious sensibility, again, doesn't define the religious forms that are built atop it, and if your take on that sensibility involves the Bible (or some other scripture) as well as study of nature, then go to it. <br><br>Liquid, well, you got further into the movie than I did. I never could find much to interest me in the whole Star Trek business. <br><br>Nick, what is the human condition according to the Theravadin tradition, the oldest historically documented form of Buddhism? Suffering. What does the Buddha teach? Liberation from suffering. To enter Nirvana is to leave behind the human condition. Once you bring in the Mahayana, not to mention the Vajrayana, things get a lot more nuanced, which is why I specified as I did. <br><br>MawKernewek, keslowena! That's a worthwhile achievement.

He used to post here before he got banned for trolling, and has been spluttering about me on and off ever since. I don't mind; Jason Godesky was the best publicity I could have had -- I long ago lost count of the number of people who first encountered me via his tirades, came here to see what all the fuss was about, and decided that I made more sense than he did -- and if this guy wants to give me the same sort of career boost, I won't complain. <br><br>BeaverPuppet, you do it by convincing the intellectuals first. They're an easy sell -- you can convince intellectuals of just about anything -- and once they get into something, it will percolate through society as a whole. Read up on the history of ideas and you'll find that same process playing a regular role in the spread of various ideas, some sensible, some utterly absurd. <br><br>Trippticket, Toynbee was a devout Anglican and might not welcome being awakened.

IIRC the point being made was that Balinese terraced fields were watered by a complex irrigation system (gravity fed of course), and it turned out that the irrigation system's design and maintenance were coordinated and specified by an equally complex set of "religious" festivals, calendars, practises, temples, etc. The local religion, in other words, was a beautiful panoply of stories, songs, and rituals which helped/guided the people to manage their agriculture and watersheds so as to survive, both culturally and personally, across the long term. And the "priesthood" were indistinguishable (in a blunt functional sense) from sophisticated watershed managers and irrigation engineers. If you Google for the topic you'll find references to the "subak" system, lots of publications, yada yada; I should probably read some of them to refresh my aging memory. The other take-home message of the book I read way back when was that -- no surprise here -- the eager (and arrogant) engineers of the Green Revolution did not at all appreciate or understand the sophistication and elegance of the traditional Balinese water management system, but dismissed it prima facie as "superstition" and backwardness (to be outmoded/eliminated by the crusading forces of Progress, natch). It has taken decades for Anglo scholars to "discover" that the Balinese so-called superstitions were actually guides, mnemonics and laws enabling and mandating sound ecopraxis.<br><br>So I'll propose this as a candidate for the list of cases in which a religion has assisted a culture in maintaining ecological responsibility and stewardship.<br><br>Is it just me or is Captcha getting more, er, captious?<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c1873013267253430765 title="comment permalink">9/13/13, 12:20 AM</a><br><br>

And I get this reaction from many different people about various political subjects, especially regarding alternative energy and pollution, even if the broader societal doom never actually enters the picture.<br><br>The argument begins by me pointing out that we are on an unsustainable course. What we're doing can't go on forever. The other person agrees completely. Nevertheless, the response comes back, shrilly insistent, "don't you worry your little head about that, because whenever humanity (or America, or the Free Market, etc.) has gotten into trouble, the adversity has forced us to innovate."<br><br>Okay doesn't anybody see the inherent contradiction there? If I may be permitted to paraphrase maliciously, people just like David Brin keep telling me over and over, "When our backs are against the wall, we always come up with a solution. So quit acting like our backs are against the wall!"<br><br>Wait, do these people even believe in their own premises? "Necessity is the mother of invention, so therefore there is no need to worry, there's no necessity." I have heard that type of response from so many people over so many decades, over such a wide variety of subjects, from political reform, through traffic congestion, to the energy and pollution issues, all the while I keep watching the problems get worse. <br><br>I don't believe humanity's destiny, be it doom or ascension, is set in stone, and I don't believe anybody who claims it is.

Can't anybody besides me see that this attitude <b><i>itself</i></b> is one of the biggest barriers against finding the solutions that the other person assumes will save us? Is it just me, or are these people insistent on shooting themselves in the foot?<br><br>And yet somehow the people who say "all our problems will inevitably be solved" accuse people like <b><i>you and me</i></b> of promoting complacency. The people who say "We don't need to worry about our problems" [until they become far worse] accuse <b><i>you and me</i></b> of reveling in human suffering.

The old one spans roughly from the peak of the Roman empire through to the creation of the industrial society, finding its ultimate expression in the form of the religion of Progress, and peaking (perhaps) with the energy source which drives our modern technological society. Whatever one may believe about the causes or what will follow, it is hard to miss that something is badly broken and that the institutions of the day don't seem to be able to respond, if they even still function at all. <br><br>Beyond that it may be that many find the orgy of debt and consumption that coincided with the end of the 20th century to have been unfulfilling, not to mention increasingly out of reach. I suspect that for some this drives a search for meaning in other places. What I wonder is how many have enough contact with nature in order to drive such feelings? I don't know how long term urban dwellers would come to it, but I have no contact with that life. I do know many rural people have little to no care for the natural world around them, and almost seem to dislike it – perhaps that is because the old spirituality is still strong there.<br><br>…...........<br><br>This tension between the old and new spirituality seems very similar to other conflicts with which I have wrestled my whole life. I was raised a Lutheran and believed strongly until my late teens, when I threw it off to be an atheist for a time – but that only fit for a while. I'm the son of an engineering professor and a artist/teacher, raised on SF books and believing fully in the progression to the stars. I saw the technology my Dad worked with, and became an engineer myself. But in truth I took after the artist in the way I think about things, and it took many years to reconcile that conflict. And I grew up in the country, so when I was not reading SF or repairing machines, I was running around in the woods and helping with the garden and gathering firewood with my Dad. At 50 I am a mish-mash of both, but these old battles are long settled – the engineering is something I do to pay the bills, and I am only really at peace when I am home in the woods.<br><br>…...........<br><br>I have been reading your Druidry Handbook, and have had a similar reaction. While the specific rituals and practices are unfamiliar, and the terminology for other languages is difficult and cumbersome for me, the ideas are very familiar and comfortable, like an old pair of jeans.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c1534828347417600203 title="comment permalink">9/13/13, 12:00 PM</a><br><br>

Certainly those scriptures have been molded and reinterpreted many times in the past to fit whatever sensibility was in vogue. We now see in several branches beliefs that God rewards goodness with material prosperity and we should pursue this as a righteous goal, in spite of the fact that the Bible I read seemed to rather clearly proclaim quite the opposite. It is not hard to imagine the parable of Eden read to show that body shame is a great sin and a sign of separation from God=Nature, and envision nudity converted to a holy state of union with God-In-Nature, not a sin and crime punishable by shunning and the sex offender registry. <br><br>I wonder specifically about your fictional world in Stars Reach, where the prevailing religion is Gaianist and gynocentric, and seems to have rejected or at least ditched most of the language and imagery of Christianity. Is this just something you put in there because you would enjoy imagining how it might work? Or do you envision this as a later phase in the evolution of religion here? As an aside for Juhana, the manly virtues and values are extremely in evidence in JMG's fictional future even though women hold most of the political and religious power, and the religious imagery is all quite female-centered. Trey and his buddies would have no trouble putting most 21st Century western men to shame in any contest of traditional masculinity. Even the intersex character is tougher, stronger, and more "manly" than most guys you see running around North America now.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c975927563377704717 title="comment permalink">9/13/13, 12:08 PM</a><br><br>

Much appreciated.<br><br>The actual point of what you’ve posted is slowly dawning on me. What you’re calling religious sensibility is the impetus for much of what happens in religion, even among those that would consider themselves polar opposites, or the unique holders of ultimate truth.<br><br>This undercurrent varies with the times/environment, but is also shaped by emergent ideas or cultural memes (I’m not even sure exactly what a meme is, but I’ve finally found cause to use it in a sentence so I feel like I’ve accomplished something…)<br><br>This begs the question, for me, is there a truth worth getting at, if you are able to “disconnect” yourself from the cultural current of the time? I think there is, but I’m not sure how you’d answer that.<br><br>Along those lines (and I don’t want to be labeled as a disciple of progress, but…), I do think that some of these sensibilities are more appropriate than others. That is, that there is a movement toward the “better” by those who mature in their faith in whatever. <br><br>As an example, in an earlier post you wrote: “you can apprehend the order of the cosmos in love and awe, and accept your place in it, even when that conflicts with the cravings of your ego, or you can put your ego and its cravings at the center of your world and insist that the order of the cosmos doesn’t matter if it gets in the way of what you think you want.” These are two sensibilities which are not only different, but exclusionary. (Ar at least, the dawning of apprehension is certainly an improvement…)<br><br>My own set of exclusionary religious sensibilities: “you can apprehend the _relatedness_of_individuals_ in love and awe, and accept your place in it, even when that conflicts with the cravings of your ego, or you can put your ego and its cravings at the center of your world and insist that the _relatedness_of_individuals_ doesn’t matter if it gets in the way of what you think you want.”<br><br>The difference between these two is only of emphasis as far as I’m concerned, as I believe the order of the cosmos is predicated upon the relatedness of individuals. <br><br>I barely even know what I mean by that though, so I won’t push it any further!<br><br>Peace<br><br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c2197746115385218925 title="comment permalink">9/13/13, 12:45 PM</a><br><br>

Let me just say, I deeply appreciate you and your writings here and elsewhere. I'm hip-deep into Inside a Magical Lodge, and see a lot of parallels with my experience in my tradition. I'm also reading Green Wizardry, which is awesome. Secondly, you may have already encountered Kukai, but if you haven't already read this, I highly recommend: http://www.amazon.com/Kukai-His-Major-Works/dp/0231059337/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379101606&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kukai<br><br>I'd like to acknowledge the filters of my view through the tradition I am coming from in this conversation; at least two thousand years after the awakening of Shakyamuni in multiple cultural contexts. At the same time, there are several factors at play in terms of my understanding of Foundational Buddhism that I'd like to address. From a purely historical/sociological perspective, what Shakyamuni was teaching and to whom was radical in his context. His first teaching was to the 5 Hindu ascetics with whom he'd previously practiced extreme austerities. To them he taught the middle way and the 4 Noble Truths. In response to their extremism in terms of asceticism, his middle way was quite controversial, and the fact that he taught women and members of all castes is in contrast to your assertion of the buddhadharma being "available to an elite few."<br>I'd also like to point out that there are 4 Seals that are accepted by all schools of Buddhism, Theravada, Mahayana, and otherwise, that are hallmarks of Shakyamuni's heritage. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Makes-You-Not-Buddhist/dp/1590305701/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379102063&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=what+makes+you+not+a+buddhist" rel=nofollow>More can be researched here.</a><br>Again, I would say from my interpretation, that the teachings of Shakyamuni, Gautama Buddha, beginning with the 4 Noble Truths at Deer Park, are about bringing it all back home: seeing clearly through the illusions of self, and resting uncontrived in the selfless and interdependent nature of all phenomena, including the natural world and the human condition.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c4924688654790809405 title="comment permalink">9/13/13, 1:17 PM</a><br><br>

I'm probably the world's foremost expert on that. :-) And, of course, I highly recommend it! <br><br>http://www.themonthebard.org/music.<br><br>See the Missa Druidica, but also Anu Danu, which is adapted from the Lammas Bread Blessing by Nickomo.<br><br>Beyond that, I'm in the same boat as Trippticket.<br><br>I guess I could say a few things, all of which I believe to be true, but might not be. YMMV.<br><br>There is no ancient Druid music for the same reason there is no ancient Roman music or ancient Egyptian music. They never wrote it down, or if they did, we either haven't found it, or we don't know how to read it.<br><br>Druidry has a long, knotted history, but after 1700 it was culturally wedded to Western Europe, specifically the British Isles. The "Druid music" of any Druid prior to, say, the mid-1900's was just good old-fashioned Western European music. Beethoven. Brahms. Sea chanties and tavern songs and church hymns.<br><br>All popular music since about 1950 has been dominated by the recording industry, which is out to make money, not music. A "Druid" label would have been such an unthinkably small niche market, that I don't believe there is any such thing. I'd be happy to be told I'm wrong.<br><br>More recently, as the recording industry fell into the Law of Diminishing Returns, it started to diversify, and you can find quite a lot of modern and explicitly Celtic music, some of which could probably be considered Druidic. There's also bound to be oodles of stuff, of varying production quality, out there in the Cloud.<br><br><i>Authentic</i> modern Druid music -- that is, music created by or for Druids -- is mostly congregational tonal chant, with harmonies (if any) that can be taught without reading music, as well as "folk" style music, typically a single singer and a guitar or harp accompaniment. Look up Damh the Bard, or Nickomo for examples.<br><br>Most Druid groves seem to have their own preferred cycle of tunes that they sing during celebrations, many borrowed from the larger neo-Pagan community. All of them are in D minor. (I'm joking.)<br><br>I don't know if there's anything in the gap between this and what I've written.<br><br>The music I've written is odd and in some ways pointless. I write it because the Muse tells me to: it's a labor of love. But it has zero commercial potential, so you aren't going to find much else like it out there. I'm guessing that holds true all the way down to the congregational singing of Druids -- there simply isn't a market, and without a market, it just isn't done.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c308075617576642766 title="comment permalink">9/13/13, 3:24 PM</a><br><br>

It speaks to me on a very personal level. Your post about religious sensibility addresses the change of worldview that I have experienced lately.<br><br>For two or three decades I had followed a meditative philosophy (Sant Mat) that purported to deliver a means of detaching oneself from the world, and to rise above and escape its sordid reality. Then, about 10 years ago, I abandoned it to return to first principles. I needed to construct my <i>own</i> philosophy. I eventually cobbled one together, believing that it was unique. But then, in the past year or so, I stumbled across the books and lectures of Alan Watts, a self-professed 'spiritual entertainer' who gives his own take of Hindu, Buddhism, Zen and so forth. <br><br>I was astounded and encouraged to discover that at least 80% of what he expounded upon meshes with the fruits of my own rumination, and I am enjoying the process of exploring the remaining mini-crescents of our combined Venn Diagram. In short, I have undergone a personal religious sensibility shift of the type that this post talks about. <br><br>I can testify (if that word is not too loaded in the current context) that one's outlook is very, very different when operating in a different religious sensibility.

When I first started practicing Zen I didn't read the foundational sutras (scriptures recording Buddha's teachings to his disciples) because my teacher spent much more time discussing Dogen or his own interpretation of Dogen. Fair enough as he's practicing in the Soto Zen tradition that Dogen founded in the 1200s in Japan. Unlike some religions, Buddhist sects are free to add their own writings to the sutra collection, thus it's no issue to study Dogen rather than the sutras that Buddha taught. <br><br>Nick's interpretation of the Four Noble Truths is quite consistent with my teacher's and one I could relate to in my own practice. However, because my husband got a copy of an English translation of the Majjhima Nikaya (Middle Length Discourses, one of the original sutras taught by Buddha) he and I, and also other members of our sangha, had occasion to read this particular foundational text. It certainly struck me in many places, and unpleasantly so, as being salvational in tone. Buddha held up the arhat as the standard to shoot for. The arhat's goal was to not be reborn, to leave existence forever, because existence cannot ever be satisfying. I think JMG's take on this is correct. The bodhisattva ideal in Zen and other Mahayana sects of Buddhism holds off on the final attainment (leaving existence forever) in favor of helping others to achieve it before oneself. Thus, the original goal of the arhat remains, but as best as I understand it, not while other suffering beings still exist. I should say that I am not much of a scholar of Buddhism, so I might be wrong, but this is my sense of things.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c6810653031574731814 title="comment permalink">9/13/13, 7:29 PM</a><br><br>

It seems to be the separatists'/Nationalists' move to bolster a certain type of core, majority (xenophobic) support.

I don't know that it takes a lot of contact with nature to send people moving toward the new sensibility I've sketched out -- I see a lot of people who start seeking contact with nature as a result of new feelings and perceptions stirring in them. <br><br>Bill, you'll notice that in the imagined future I created for <a href=http://starsreach.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>Star's Reach</a>, Christians are still around -- they're called Old Believers by the majority, and have a status halfway between that of Catholics in post-1688 England and Jews in medieval Europe. I chose to make the religion of 25th-century Meriga a gynocentric Gaia-worship partly because that's what felt right, partly because of the way I wanted to explore gender issues in that imagined future. <br><br>One of the things that makes Merigan culture distinct from ours is that men and women by and large have different spheres of activity, and don't compete with one another. Religion, scholarship, one set of trades, and the larger share of politics are women's country; war, a different set of trades, and some dimensions of politics are men's country, and you don't get much overlap. It's not a utopia by any means; it's a violent, troubled Dark Age society on the far side of some very hard times; but that dimension of Merigan society, at least, gave me a chance to think out loud about one of the ways things might unfold from the reshaping of gender roles under way in America today. <br><br>Orc, I think it can certainly be said that some ways of thought and action are better than others; that doesn't require a belief in progress -- quite the contrary, as C.S. Lewis liked to point out, the facile equation of "better" with "whatever comes next" makes it easy to leave behind good options in favor of worse ones. <br><br>Nick, once again, that's a very Mahayana understanding of what Shakyamuni taught; for all I know, the Mahayana may be right -- but it's not the understanding you'll find in the Pali Canon. As for Kukai's works, yes, I read those in my early 20s, when I was considering Shingon Buddhism as a potential spiritual path; I took another route, but I enjoyed Kobo Daishi's work -- and learned some things from it, too. <br><br>Joseph, you're as close as we've got here on this blog!<br><br>Hadashi, now there's a blast from the past! Watts is definitely an interesting read -- I got turned onto him by aging hippies at my first college. I should revisit his work sometime. <br><br>KL, they're great to look at, from outside. <br><br>SLClaire, that was exactly the point I was trying to make.

While I have always seen nature as sacred to some degree, this was less of a reverent or "awesome" experience and more of a subtle but fundamental shift. When out in nature it is easy to be awed, frankly we are very much a small part of a very large universe. Nature is very powerful and ultimately the time scales are far beyond the human. <br><br>But this is not so much about that. This felt much more like some sort of Zen awakening. <br><br>I had been going through a rough period with very little money and some despair over getting a job. I was watching the fish and I realized that their lives were equal to ours - not lesser - and that the concept of "meaning" when applied to life was an illusion. A fish lives, does the things a fish does, and dies... And we are not really much different. We don't need to excuse our existence or prove our usefulness to society or create "meaning". Our life is granted to us without reservation, and it will leave us just as easily.<br><br>While there are things I would like to do in my life that I see as "meaningful", this experience helped me out a lot and changed my perspective deeply. I don't feel as weighted down by expectations or existential dread. Of course, as a human, we are part of society and our own biology drives us to seek status and meaning, but in the end we are a living being on the earth.<br><br>That is a small lesson but I feel like it is one that is strongly resisted by the current paradigm (with humans on "top" in both the Abrahamic religions and in the religion of progress). Nature doesn't always shock with beauty or power, sometimes it just knocks softly and delivers a little note.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c3855883151500072092 title="comment permalink">9/13/13, 10:58 PM</a><br><br>

Personally, I don't think truth as such, pure unqualified truth, can be attained by any human being through any means whatsoever; the best we can do is create models that seem to work most of the time, and reason is only one of many tools that can be applied helpfully to the creation of those models.<br><br>Most of the atheists I know, by the way, are perfectly courteous about the differences between their beliefs and others.

In fact, people that refer to them as pantheists derives in a sense from poor translation of the word kami (as gods). In Shinto, as I understand, kami are the spirits in all natural things—the pebble on the roadside, the fern, the sun, the blade of grass, etc—which they revere. In short, poor translation of the word kami as gods leads people to think they are pantheistic, but it's really a result of their reverence of nature.<br><br>Obviously, I don't know a lot about the subject.

Eastern Christianity is on the whole truer to the essential spirit of the faith, including in the respects you have commented on.<br><br>For example, you cite Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople as instantiating elements of this new religious sensibility. But in point of fact, this sensibility is not new to Eastern Orthodoxy at all. The ecclesiastical calendar of Eastern Orthodoxy has an ancient feast called the "Blessing of the Waters," which is essentially a celebration of nature in tune with the “new” religious sensibility - one lost to Western Christianity especially since the rise of capitalism and industrialism. A close study of traditional Athonite and Russian Orthodox mysticism will also reveal that nature, as intrinsically beautiful and resplendent, often plays a prominent role.<br><br>A further example of the abiding presence of the sensibility you describe in Eastern Christianity is the traditional emphasis on the holiness of all matter, even the most ordinary of dirt and rocks, and its destiny to be freed of the effects of the curse and transfigured in the fullness of time. This theme of the holiness of all matter is especially prominent, I believe, in early Christian Syriac writings.<br><br>One last point: The separation of heaven as the locus of personal destiny after death from a renewed and transfigured earth as the locus of the “immanentized eschaton” foretold in scriptural apolcalyptic has its origin in the post-Constantinean depoliticization of the Christian faith. By contrast, the ante-Nicene fathers were hostile to Imperial Rome, and looked forward to the return of Christ among other reasons because it represented the overthrow of this imperial order. This was to be preceded by the Resurrection of the just, and the post-Roman rule of Christ was identified with personal salvation and eternal life after one’s natural death. In other words, “heaven” was not experienced in heaven, but on earth.<br><br>In short, the unnatural separation of individual heaven from a transfigured earth is the result of a political accommodation to earthly power that represents a distortion of true biblical and Christian theology. Unfortunately, the Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical authorities embraced this particular “Romanizing” error with as much enthusiasm as the Roman Catholic popes. This is yet another reason why I regard the distinctly non-Roman origin of Nestorian Christianity as theologically important.<br><br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c4297733981770869251 title="comment permalink">9/14/13, 10:57 AM</a><br><br>

If anyone ever picks it up, it's likely to be the sole surviving record of long dead musical traditions represented on it.<br><br>JMG, as you say, whoever is capable of retrieving the Voyager gold disc will probably be able to transcribe the music and find patterns in it. It doesn't follow that they will know it is art. They might very well think it's a set of mathematical statements, and waste time trying to decipher their meaning without a Rosetta stone. Hoping, perhaps, to learn something about alien Earth tech.<br><br>On Earth we have artifacts and entire structures that archeologists don't know the purpose of. Not ooga-booga alien technology, just just stuff that we have entirely lost the tradition of what it's for, or somebody does know perfectly well but the archaeologists haven't talked to that person. It doesn't take much disruption for knowledge of the use of things to be lost and replaced by wild-assed guesses. I saw a mid twentieth century angel food cake cutter in an antiques shop labeled as some kind of comb. And that's not a complicated piece of equipment.<br><br>If you have no clue as to the purpose of an artifact, and especially if it's ripped out of its original setting, you will not notice or understand the significance of its details. You might not even recognize that it is an artifact. <br><br>Within the last few decades, ecologists and foresters have come to realize that many open meadows that used to exist in California mountain forests were artifacts. In a climax forest without human intervention, the meadows get filled in by trees. The Indians kept meadows open by setting fires periodically, until they were prevented from doing so. European settlers killed most of the Indians and removed the rest from their ancestral lands, and in so doing threw away all their knowledge of forest management. <br><br><br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c4101060634862419694 title="comment permalink">9/14/13, 2:30 PM</a><br><br>

I do feel a sense of awe at the fact that we are simply another species following its own life cycles like any other form of life, united with the rest of the natural world. But I also feel a sense of despair - I once believed that the future will feature not only a lot of unimaginably advanced technology, but also a better quality of life for most people on the planet. My vision of the future has shifted to one where humanity faces the consequences of its radically unsustainable behavior and falls back down to Earth again in a slow, grinding decline, with plenty of misery to go around. I know that people can and do live meaningful lives in hard times, but it can be difficult to see decline as anything other than a much gloomier outcome than the shiny new world that the religion of progress leads the faithful to expect.<br><br>That said, I am slowly shifting toward this new sensibility and accepting the fact that we won't get the future we ordered.

It's a reflection that troubles me; but when we look back, it seems as though the atrocities of C20 were about as atrocious as those of C19, and those were about as bad as the ones in C18, and so on. <br><br>The printing press, wondrous as it is, was used early on to print the Malleus Malificarum. The railroads were grand, but they were also often built by slave and corvee labour, and they served to extract the resources of conquered colonial possessions for the benefit of invading overlords. Shipping insurance -- Lloyd's of London -- a sophisticated innovation, and deeply involved in the Triangle Trade (early globalisation!). Do we have to go back through all the ghastly things done to indigenous peoples by the allegedly "advanced" forces of Progress? Or the ways in which the Third Reich made cutting-edge use of early computer technology?<br><br>Technology, Progress, all the advances of the fossil fuel era, they definitely freed *some* humans from suffering (and inflicted unthinkable suffering on others). They definitely increased (at least temporarily) the number of living humans present at any one time on the planet -- to an historically unprecedented peak. Transport, organised central governments, communication, hygiene -- yep, great things achieved, famines averted, resources better distributed in some cases, slavery significantly reduced in many areas, nutrition improved, literacy expanded, etc. -- hard to argue with the success stories. <br><br>And yet. And yet. It seems to me that if a larger number of humans than ever before are living lives of relative comfort (even luxury) and security, it's *also* true that a larger number of humans than ever before are still living in poverty, hunger, precarity and fear; because the human habit of establishing overdogs and underdogs, and awarding most of the goodies to the overdogs, hasn't changed a whole lot. So now that there are 7 billion of us, there are a lot more underdogs as well as a lot more overdogs; but there are *always* way more underdogs than overdogs at any one given moment.<br><br>So if we had a fancy Star Trek dolorimeter device that could actually *measure* the amount of pain, fear, distress and grief in the world, wouldn't that meter be reading higher now that, say, 75 percent of a population of 7 billion is in distress, than it did when 75 percent of a population of 1 billion was in distress? Is that "progress"? I'm not so sure. I used to feel sure.

Human beings historically do not exist without trees (i.e. all the services that trees provide that maintain a habitable biosphere for us to live in). Trees, however, can exist just fine without human beings :-) and have done so for millions of years.<br><br>Anyway, at some point even if one is wholly human-centric (a perfectly natural animal point of view, much as a bear's consciousness is bear-centric and a salmon's is salmon-centric), one has to realise that placing zero value on the biosphere -- regarding all non-human life as worthless compared to human life -- is in the end a suicidal ideology, much like regarding one's intestinal flora as worthless compared to one's brain.

(excluding nuclear and large hydroelectric). Substantially increasing the proportion of renewable sources creates a problem for the grid. Turbines are most efficient when running 24/7 but wind and solar power are not steady, nor readily powered up and down to meet short term demand. Geothermal power is steady, but not much is available in California.<br><br>According to an article in today's (Sunday) SF Chronicle, the commission which regulates California's utilities about to to require that utilities increase their power storage capacity in order to smooth out the flow. <br><br>Pacific Gas and Electric already has some pumped hydro storage via kinetic energy (you pump water from a lower reservoir to a higher at night when demand is low, and release it through turbines the next day). CPUC wants the utilities to purchase and develop other storage technologies such as battery banks, compressed air, flywheels and molten salt. Most of these require technological improvement. Batteries are the only tech suitable for distributed generation at present. <br><br>Obviously the energy losses inherent in multiple transitions of energy form added to transmission losses make it unlikely that these arrangements will be sustained for long. However, getting utility companies to invest in improved technology for electrical power storage while the money is available and the demand exists is probably a good thing.

Gods, big bang, aliens, evolution, anything one can imagine is nothing but moving images on the back drop of, I suppose what I would call in the most nonreligious sense, God. God being the catch all. God being the everything and nothing. I wonder how others deal with, what is to me the unavoidable conclusion of all true philosophy, or religious thought, that all that exist is the one. That nothing can happen that the potential for was not already present.

It just happens, with an appropriate verbal smokescreen in the way. <br><br>Travis, that's certainly one way to look at it. Still, I'd encourage you to reflect on the fact that all this talk about billions of years and the like is simply chatter about mental models that we can never be sure have any relation to reality. This moment, this experience, is the closest approach we've got to what is; the rest is speculation and monkey-chatter. <br><br>Swathorne, Sagan was a very complex thinker; I challenge you to read, say, <i>The Demon-Haunted World</i> or <i>Pale Blue Dot</i> as anything but paeans in praise of the Great God Progress, but he also had his own distinctive ecological sensibility. I have no idea how future generations will assess his thinking; I know I find him about as congenial as fingernails screeching down blackboards, but that's probably just a personal thing. <br><br>Of course your broader point is correct; it's precisely because of systems theory, ecosystem ecology, and other branches of "green science" that we have the clear sense of ecological interconnections that we do, and I've been talking for some time about the need to conserve as much as possible of the scientific method and the more helpful discoveries of the last three hundred years through the time of troubles ahead.

I was reminded of a cartoon of a PETA raid on an animal testing lab: a few dead scientists lying around in their lab coats, a PETA warrior with a semi-automatic rifle slung across her shoulder petting a rabbit, saying something like "poor little bunny". There is a totally unsustainable pet culture going on, where people (mostly middle aged women) who have not been able to form intimate human bonds and/or satisfy their need for nurturing, resort to forming intimate bonds with pets instead (the pets are easier than humans in many ways). In more sustainable cultures, animals give back more than just love/loyalty and are expected to provide a large portion of their own food. <br>I wonder if pet culture is part of the emerging new religious sensibility or a symptom of the old one. <br><br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c1848679406677648528 title="comment permalink">9/17/13, 4:42 AM</a><br><br>

It takes me a while to digest such things, but I think he's missed the mark in a few ways.<br><br>The Soviet Union spent a long, long time collapsing, long enough to develop widespread <i>dofenism</i>, which he translates as "not giving a rat's ass." By the time the SU collapsed, no one believed in it any more -- not the people, not the soldiers, not the police, not even the officials. It basically just went away: quietly and gently, as such things go. Orloff talks about how one day, Andropov stood up and called it the "former Soviet Union," and that was that.<br><br>I hope we have enough time for <i>dofenism</i> to develop here, but I don't think we will. I think we're going to see a very different pattern of collapse.<br><br>The True Believers in America's Destiny are going to respond to a contracting economy by contracting and intensifying geographically, abandoning some areas entirely, but becoming much more ardent "Patriotic Americans" where they can: this is consistent with our whole metaphor of concentrating wealth, concentrating power, concentrating celebrity.<br><br>Following the idiotic pattern of some of our large corporations, the US will be carved up into "cost centers" and "profit centers," and the "cost centers" will be -- well, laid off. Federal support will be quietly, unofficially withdrawn, as when Katrina turned New Orleans into an overwhelming liability. I think those will be the best places to live, in the long run....<br><br>Because in the contested areas, the "profit centers," a high standard of living will be artificially supported, but as the system crumbles, those areas will be partitioned -- I'm guessing along racial lines -- to sustain the American Lifestyle with its same high standard of living among fewer and fewer people. The increasingly militarized police forces will demonize the underclass and take out their frustrations on those people: DWB (Driving While Black), for instance, will incur a randomly-distributed and ugly death sentence (in some places, it has almost reached that point, though the police usually stop at hospitalizing the "offender.") At some point, there will be a violent backlash from the underclass, and given modern communications, it will probably erupt everywhere at once.<br><br>I would like to hope that the underclass would win, but I don't think they will. We'll have our own <i>Krystallnacht</i>, and the militarized regime that survives will be ... brutal. While it lasts.<br><br>For reference, I point out that Germany's infamous Thousand-Year Reich lasted for only twelve years, and had invaded (and totally pissed-off) most of its neighbor-states, which got the remaining neighbors involved in shutting them down.<br><br>The contracted US, depending on how tightly it has contracted, will likely have no fronts within striking range: the area that Mexico will try to take back will be one of the areas the Feds will cede early in the game as a "cost center." As a result, I think the world community will quietly write off its financial losses and simply abandon the US to its second civil war.<br><br>Ugly.<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c5101939916426528094 title="comment permalink">9/17/13, 10:02 AM</a><br><br>

To my mind PETA et al. are classic examples of the pseudoactivism of the privileged; a certain percentage of those who benefit most from an unfair system feel guilty about that, but aren't willing to do anything that might threaten the benefits they get from the system. Plunging into some harmless form of activism is one popular way to resolve that dilemma. <br><br>Thus you had any number of upper-class liberals in 1920s Britain getting very publicly incensed about the treatment of African-Americans on the other side of the Atlantic (while doing nothing about the abuses of their own caste system at home), just as you get plenty of upper- and upper-middle class liberals in America today getting very publicly incensed about the treatment of animals, or any number of other things that don't have any impact on their own positions of privilege. Listen for the tone of shrill self-justifying fury; once you learn to recognize it, it's hard to miss. <br><br>Joseph, that's certainly one possible pattern.

I am surrounded by people who believe strongly in progress, in science and in technology and live for that. Of course, if I were to suggest to them that their narrative is not so much different from the religious people that they find so stupid, they would be shocked with the idea. Indeed, one of their fundamental flaws (I would indeed say flaw) is the inability to see that they are dominated (very strongly) by a set of myths (that you so well describe in your blog). A group of very nice, intelligent people become completely sterotypical. When they talk and come up with a "great new idea", most of the times is completely predictable if you have a basic understanding of their own mythos (and this "atheist" group do take a lot of ideas from Christianity - not that they would recognize it).<br><br>But then again, this is not my point. My point is about religious sensibilities.<br><br>My religious sensibility is different from theirs and, in the rare times I decide to engage in conversation that becomes a problem. Because we do not share the same underlying premises, it is quite common that mis-understandings happen. For instance their Christian belief that one set of rules and morals can apply to the whole of humanity at the same time makes them believe that anyone that proposes more decentralized models is automatically a bigot.<br><br>Of course, being aware of this, I try to be careful but sooner or later I fall into a trap that is only based on the fact that we do not share the same religious sensibilities (that is in fact not true - we still do share a lot of things).<br><br>The conversation becomes difficult when we do not share the same core values (and, if I may add, the other side is not willing to entertain that alternative views of the world might deserve attention - which describes perfectly most modern "atheists")<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c7262651384011751186 title="comment permalink">9/17/13, 12:06 PM</a><br><br>

These guys even invited me to their place to shop for goats when I expressed some interest! I wonder, can common cause overcome cultural identities in strange times? It wouldn't be unprecedented.

Misanthropy is a recurring thread that surfaces throughout our species. It appears in schools of thought and sensibilities from all over the conceptual map. It is one of these things that opponents will often try to tar and feather you with, because whatever your perceived "cause" it is likely there are some folks in your midst who have said and done things that suggest they don't hold "humanity" in very high regard. <br><br>I guess the point here would be to answer the original query as no, that phenomenon is not really related in particular to the emerging sensibility JMG is suggesting here. It is a separate entity you may encounter in various manifestations anywhere and everywhere. For every one you might find who would trample the person to save the bunny, you might find ten who wish humanity deeper fulfillment, meaning, and comfort (i.e. good things) via connection with nature. <br><br>As for the "pet culture," well the american love of pets is hardly anything new. And of course pets are being ever more indulged and splurged upon. Americans are doing that about everything! Our dogs and cats are getting the same treatment as our cars and children. These animals are a part of human society; they have little or nothing to do with our relations with Nature At Large.

I know, it sounds anachronistic, but somehow it is not so. Even if practically no Homo Sovieticus believed during late Brezhnevite era that system actually worked as claimed, I personally don't believe sense of nationalism faded away from important parts of population during whole process of state decay. <br><br>This attitude has long roots indeed. Do you really believe that people listening this speech by Master himself didn't believe it, even if they were deeply suspicious towards promises about Heaven on Earth? After revolution to abolish all masters, they got the Master. Human soul is...complicated. In chaotic and violent countries that basic irrationality of humanity manifests itself in ways that are hidden in more prosperous societies. <br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IGbjPqFFvA<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c5602770201911998089 title="comment permalink">9/18/13, 1:39 PM</a><br><br>

The result was horrific - anything but humane.<br>Round here they use poison bait on just about every farm (probably not good for the owls). It has to be permanent because there is sufficient rat migration to repopulate any food source. For me, it is like punching a hole in an elastic sheet - I get filled in. During a period when we did not have dogs and cats I poisoned a colony under tree roots close to the house. It worked for a year or two but I did not like descriptions of the symptoms and was leery for our subsequent house animals (and even for the owls).<br><br>We can have fairly brutal winters so attention to eliminating food sources has been the key. We can't do much about all fallen apples but migratory birds clear these by about mid winter. The old patriarch (?) rat we had for 2 or 3 (?) years taught his clan some cunning 'starvation' food sources but since he has passed on - a combination of old-age and our terrier - we are spared population spikes. Your trick of not allowing colonies to establish anywhere (especially under the house or shed!!! or compost heap) is key. When we get a 'freeze up', keeping rats from any 'open water' can help - they need to drink every day. <br><br>best<br>'Oddities' constantly multiply round here - if it is not one it is another!<br>Phil H<br><br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c6814240725291594852 title="comment permalink">9/18/13, 2:53 PM</a><br><br>

I'll echo Karl in recommending Graeber's <i>Debt</i>. The part that triggered the memory is your mention of the 600 BCE shift in beliefs from the pagan to those that fit the newer sensibility.<br><br>From what I remember (I took notes of the book, but some how missed that section) the introduction of coin at that time in both Greece and China shifted philosophies closer to the modern. Previously, tallies were used to indicate debt; such tallies for are destroyed when the debt is made whole. Thus, tallies reflect more the pagan traditions of birth, life and death in a constant cycle of renewal. <br><br>(Fun facts from <i>Debt</i>: Chinese tallies resemble the yin yang symbol; and our word "symbol" originates from "symbolon," the Greek term for a debt tally.)<br><br>Coins, on the other hand, somehow retain their value after a debt has been repaid, often for decades or longer after the initial coin has been minted. Furthermore, coins are often minted with base metals, so their face values outstrip their metallic. This may have shifted the previously pagan sensibility toward a philosophy that entertained a life after death, a more immutable permanence of soul, and one with greater value than the physical incarnation.<br><br>Bringing this back to your essay, could this new religious sensibility have been sparked by our current financial crisis where billions of supposedly immutable dollars and Euros disappeared in a puff of paper value?<br><br><a href=a-sense-of-homecoming.html#c4043146405992553083 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 7:13 PM</a><br><br>

(Will the oranges be plentiful in the future? Will there be no more oranges? Will the <i>orange situation</i> stay pretty much the same, or perhaps decline slightly? Will there be wondrous new genetically-modified oranges to Save Us All? "The 4th moon of Jeebus in the Fxgnrt Quadrant was found to harbor an abundance of a type of Space Oranges -- later known as Jeebian Oranges, and confoundingly, as Fxgnrtian Apples by the apple-eating races of the Shmeng Quadrant -- which were highly prized throughout the galaxy.")<br><br>Sorry where was I?<br><br>In short, it's an illustrative fictional narrative example from the mind of another early-21st-century human and I guess I can't see getting that worked-up over it, for that reason and because it's about a future that is unknowable, that passes outside my area of influence the minute I die, and regarding which I don't feel anyone has any reason for any emotional investment one way or another.
