<div class=MsoNormal>
Earlier this week, I was trying to think of ways to talk about the gap between notions about the future we’ve all absorbed from the last three hundred years of fossil-fueled progress, on the one hand, and the ways of thinking about what’s ahead that might actually help us make sense of our predicament and the postpetroleum, post-progress world ahead, on the other. While I was in the middle of these reflections, a correspondent reminded me of
<a href=http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.it/2012/09/the-next-ten-billion-years.html>a post from last year</a> by peak oil blogger Ugo Bardi, which set out to place the crises of our time in the context of the next ten billion years. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s an ambitious project, and by no means badly carried out. The only criticism that comes to mind is that it only makes sense if you happen to be a true believer in the civil religion of progress, the faith whose rise and impending fall has been a central theme here in recent months. As a sermon delivered to the faithful of that religion, it’s hard to beat; it’s even got the classic structure of evangelical rhetoric—the awful fate that will soon fall upon those who won’t change their wicked ways, the glorious salvation awaiting those who get right with Progress, and all the rest of it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course the implied comparison with Christianity can only be taken so far. Christians are generally expected to humble themselves before their God, while believers in progress like to imagine that humanity will become God or, as in this case, be able to pat God fondly on the head and say, “That’s my kid.” More broadly, those of my readers who were paying attention last week will notice that the horrible fate that awaits the sinful is simply that nature will be allowed to go her own way, while the salvation awaiting the righteous is more or less the ability to browbeat nature into doing what they think she ought to do—or rather, what Bardi’s hypothesized New Intelligence, whose interests are assumed to be compatible with those of humanity, thinks she ought to do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s plenty that could be said about the biophobia—the stark shivering dread of life’s normal and healthy ripening toward death—that pervades this kind of thinking, but that’s a subject for another post. Here I’d like to take another path.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once the notions of perpetual progress and imminent apocalypse are seen as industrial society’s traditional folk mythologies, rather than meaningful resources for making predictions about the future, and known details about ecology, evolution, and astrophysics are used in their place to fill out the story, the next ten billion years looks very different from either of Bardi’s scenarios. Here’s my version or, if you will, my vision. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

<b>Ten years from now:</b> </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Business as usual continues; the human population peaks at 8.5 billion, liquid fuels production remains more or less level by the simple expedient of consuming an ever larger fraction of the world’s total energy output, and the annual cost of weather-related disasters continues to rise. Politicians and the media insist loudly that better times are just around the corner, as times get steadily worse. Among those who recognize that something’s wrong, one widely accepted viewpoint holds that fusion power, artificial intelligence, and interstellar migration will shortly solve all our problems, and therefore we don’t have to change the way we live.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another, equally popular, insists that total human extinction is scarcely a decade away, and therefore we don’t have to change the way we live. Most people who worry about the future accept one or the other claim, while the last chance for meaningful systemic change slips silently away. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>A hundred years from now:</b> </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It has been a difficult century. After more than a dozen major wars, three bad pandemics, widespread famines, and steep worldwide declines in public health and civil order, human population is down to 3 billion and falling. Sea level is up ten meters and rising fast as the Greenland and West Antarctic ice caps disintegrate; fossil fuel production ground to a halt decades earlier as the last economically producible reserves were exhausted, and most proposed alternatives turned out to be unaffordable in the absence of the sort of cheap, abundant, highly concentrated energy only fossil fuels can provide. Cornucopians still insist that fusion power, artificial intelligence, and interstellar migration will save us any day now, and their opponents still insist that human extinction is imminent, but most people are too busy trying to survive to listen to either group. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>A thousand years from now:</b> </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Earth is without ice caps and glaciers for the first time in twenty million years or so, and sea level has gone up more than a hundred meters worldwide; much of the world has a tropical climate, as it did 50 million years earlier. Human population is 100 million, up from half that figure at the bottom of the bitter dark age now passing into memory. Only a few scholars have any idea what the words “fusion power,” “artificial intelligence,” and “interstellar migration” once meant, and though there are still people insisting that the end of the world will arrive any day now, their arguments now generally rely more overtly on theology than before. New civilizations are rising in various corners of the world, combining legacy technologies with their own unique cultural forms. The one thing they all have in common is that the technological society of a millennium before is their idea of evil incarnate. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>Ten thousand years from now:</b> </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The rise in global temperature has shut down the thermohaline circulation and launched an oceanic anoxic event, the planet’s normal negative feedback process when carbon dioxide levels get out of hand. Today’s industrial civilization is a dim memory from the mostly forgotten past, as far removed from this time as the Neolithic Revolution is from ours; believers in most traditional religions declare piously that the climate changes of the last ten millennia are the results of human misbehavior, while rationalists insist that this is all superstition and the climate changes have perfectly natural causes. As the anoxic oceans draw carbon out of the biosphere and entomb it in sediments on the sea floor, the climate begins a gradual cooling—a process which helps push humanity’s sixth global civilization into its terminal decline. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>A hundred thousand years from now:</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Carbon dioxide levels drop below preindustrial levels as the oceanic anoxic event finishes its work, and the complex feedback loops that govern Earth’s climate shift again: the thermohaline circulation restarts, triggering another round of climatic changes. Humanity’s seventy-ninth global civilization flourishes and begins its slow decline as the disruptions set in motion by a long-forgotten industrial age are drowned out by an older climatic cycle. The scholars of that civilization are thrilled by the notions of fusion power, artificial intelligence, and interstellar migration; they have no idea that we dreamed the same dreams before them, being further in our future than the Neanderthals are in our past, but they will have no more luck achieving those dreams than we did. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>A million years from now:</b> </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Earth is in an ice age; great ice sheets cover much of the northern hemisphere and spread from mountain ranges all over the world, and sea level is 150 meters lower than today. To the people living at this time, who have never known anything else, this seems perfectly normal. Metals have become rare geological specimens—for millennia now, most human societies have used renewable ceramic-bioplastic composites instead—and the very existence of fossil fuels has long since been forgotten. The 664th global human civilization is at its peak, lofting aerostat towns into the skies and building great floating cities on the seas; its long afternoon will eventually draw to an end after scores of generations, and when it falls, other civilizations will rise in its place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>Ten million years from now:</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The long glacial epoch that began in the Pleistocene has finally ended, and the Earth is returning to its more usual status as a steamy jungle planet. This latest set of changes proves to be just that little bit too much for humanity. No fewer than 8,639 global civilizations have risen and fallen over the last ten million years, each with its own unique sciences, technologies, arts, literatures, philosophies, and ways of thinking about the cosmos; the shortest-lived lasted for less than a century before blowing itself to smithereens, while the longest-lasting endured for eight millennia before finally winding down. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All that is over now. There are still relict populations of human beings in Antarctica and a few island chains, and another million years will pass before cascading climatic and ecological changes finally push the last of them over the brink into extinction. Meanwhile, in the tropical forests of what is now southern Siberia, the descendants of raccoons who crossed the Bering land bridge during the last great ice age are proliferating rapidly, expanding into empty ecological niches once filled by the larger primates. In another thirty million years or so, their descendants will come down from the trees. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<b>One hundred million years from now:</b> </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Retro-rockets fire and fall silent as the ungainly craft settles down on the surface of the Moon. After feverish final checks, the hatch is opened, and two figures descend onto the lunar surface. They are bipeds, but not even remotely human; instead, they belong to Earth’s third intelligent species. They are distantly descended from the crows of our time, though they look no more like crows than you look like the tree shrews of the middle Cretaceous. Since you have a larynx rather than a syrinx, you can’t even begin to pronounce what they call themselves, so we’ll call them corvins. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Earth’s second intelligent species, whom we’ll call cyons after their raccoon ancestors, are long gone. They lasted a little more than eight million years before the changes of an unstable planet sent them down the long road to extinction; they never got that deeply into technology, though their political institutions made the most sophisticated human equivalents look embarrassingly crude. The corvins are another matter. Some twist of inherited psychology left them with a passion for heights and upward movement; they worked out the basic principles of the hot air balloon before they got around to inventing the wheel, and balloons, gliders, and corvin-carrying kites play much the same roles in their earliest epic literature that horses and chariots play in ours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As corvin societies evolved more complex technologies, eyes gazed upwards from soaring tower-cities at the moon, the perch of perches set high above the world. All that was needed to make those dreams a reality was petroleum, and a hundred million years is more than enough time for the Earth to restock her petroleum reserves—especially if that period starts off with an oceanic anoxic event that stashes gigatons of carbon in marine sediments. Thus it was inevitable that, sooner or later, the strongest of the great corvin kith-assemblies would devote its talents and wealth to the task of reaching the moon. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The universe has a surprise in store for the corvins, though. Their first moon landing included among its goals the investigation of some odd surface features, too small to be seen clearly by Earth-based equipment. That first lander thus set down on a flat lunar plain that, a very long time ago, was called the Sea of Tranquillity, and so it was that the stunned corvin astronauts found themselves facing the unmistakable remains of a spacecraft that arrived on the moon in the unimaginably distant past. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A few equivocal traces buried in terrestrial sediments had suggested already to corvin loremasters that another intelligent species might have lived on the Earth before them, though the theory was dismissed by most as wild speculation. The scattered remnants on the Moon confirmed them, and made it hard for even the most optimistic corvins to embrace the notion that some providence guaranteed the survival of intelligent species. The curious markings on some of the remains, which some loremasters suggested might be a mode of visual communication, resisted all attempts at decipherment, and very little was ever learnt for certain about the enigmatic ancient species that left its mark on the Moon. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even so, it will be suggested long afterwards that the stark warning embodied in those long-abandoned spacecraft played an important role in convincing corvin societies to rein in the extravagant use of petroleum and other nonrenewable resources, though it also inspired hugely expensive and ultimately futile attempts to achieve interstellar migration—for some reason the corbins never got into the quest for fusion power or artificial intelligence. One way or another, though, the corvins turned out to be the most enduring of Earth’s intelligent species, and more than 28 million years passed before their day finally ended. </div>

<b>One billion years from now:</b> </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Earth is old and mostly desert, and a significant fraction of its total crust is made up of the remains of bygone civilizations. The increasing heat of the Sun as it proceeds through its own life cycle, and the ongoing loss of volatile molecules from the upper atmosphere into space, have reduced the seas to scattered, salty basins amid great sandy wastes. Only near the north and south poles does vegetation flourish, and with it the corbicules, Earth’s eleventh and last intelligent species. Their ancestors in our time are an invasive species of freshwater clam. (Don’t laugh; a billion years ago your ancestors were still trying to work out the details of multicellularity.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The corbicules have the same highly practical limb structure as the rest of their subphylum: six stumpy podicles for walking, two muscular dorsal tentacles for gross manipulations and two slender buccal tentacles by the mouth for fine manipulations. They spend most of their time in sprawling underground city-complexes, venturing to the surface to harvest vegetation to feed the subterranean metafungal gardens that provide them with nourishment. By some combination of luck and a broad general tendency toward cephalization common to many evolutionary lineages, Earth’s last intelligent species is also its most intellectually gifted; hatchlings barely out of creche are given fun little logic problems such as Fermat’s last theorem for their amusement, and a large majority of adult corbicules are involved in one or another field of intellectual endeavor. Being patient, long-lived, and not greatly addicted to collective stupidities, they have gone very far indeed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Some eight thousand years back, a circle of radical young corbicule thinkers proposed the project of working out all the physical laws of the cosmos, starting from first principles. So unprecedented a suggestion sparked countless debates, publications, ceremonial dances, and professional duels in which elderly scholars killed themselves in order to cast unbearable opprobrium on their rivals. Still, it was far too delectable an intellectual challenge to be left unanswered, and the work has proceeded ever since. In the course of their researches, without placing any great importance on the fact, the best minds among the corbicules have proved conclusively that nuclear fusion, artificial intelligence, and interstellar migration were never practical options in the first place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Being patient, long-lived, and not greatly addicted to collective stupidities, the corbicules have long since understood and accepted their eventual fate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In another six million years, as the Sun expands and the Earth’s surface temperature rises, the last surface vegetation will perish and the corbicules will go extinct; in another ninety million years, the last multicellular life forms will die out; in another two hundred million years, the last seas will boil, and Earth’s biosphere, nearing the end of its long, long life, will nestle down into the deepest crevices of its ancient, rocky world and drift into a final sleep. </div>

Earth is gone. It had a splendid funeral; its body plunged into stellar fire as the Sun reached its red giant stage and expanded out to the orbit of Mars, and its ashes were flung outwards into interstellar space with the first great helium flash that marked the beginning of the Sun’s descent toward its destiny. Two billion years later, the gas- and dust-rich shockwave from that flash plowed into a mass of interstellar dust dozens of light-years away from the Sun’s pale corpse, and kickstarted one of the great transformative processes of the cosmos. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Billions more years have passed since that collision. A yellow-orange K-2 star burns cheerily in the midst of six planets and two asteroid belts. The second planet has a surface temperature between the freezing and boiling points of water, and a sufficiently rich assortment of elements to set another of the great transformative processes of the cosmos into motion. Now, in one spot on the surface of this world, rising up past bulbous purplish things that don’t look anything like trees but fill the same broad ecological function, there is a crag of black rock. On top of that crag, a creature sits looking at the stars, fanning its lunules with its sagittal crest and waving its pedipalps meditatively back and forth. It is one of the first members of its world’s first intelligent species, and it is—for the first time ever on that world—considering the stars and wondering if other beings might live out there among them. </div>

I always look forward to your postings, in part because they challenge so many of our commonplace assumptions about the world.<br><br>Your future scenario reminds me somewhat of early 20th century pulp fiction writers like HP Lovecraft, Robert E Howard and Clark Ashton Smith, who seemed to take it for granted that we are not the first intelligent species to walk (or swim) the Earth, and almost certainly not the last. In fact, I remember not all that long ago that you had commented that you strongly suspected that we are not the first sentient species to have existed on planet Earth and that we might not be the only sentient species living on Earth right now.<br><br>Likewise, it’s very likely that the early civilizations in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Peru, China, India and so on were not the first civilizations either. There is pretty good circumstantial evidence that there were lost civilizations during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, and that legends such as those about Atlantis are probably based on dim memories of such long-dead cultures. Such civilizations would have been destroyed during the global ecological crisis, seismic disasters, floods and climate shifts that accompanied the end of the last glaciation. I read your book on Atlantis and I think you made a very good case that at least one such civilization existed long before the earliest documented civilizations. <br><br>There has also been some very interesting speculation about possible pre-human civilizations as well. One of the more interesting and controversial scenarios has been sketched out by Mike Magee, a retired British civil servant. He believes there was a species of intelligent dinosaurs that existed during the late Cretaceous. I might add that he is not the first to suggest this idea either. I have some serious doubts about his arguments and the evidence that he claims to have found, but it does make for a very interesting “what if”. On the other hand, what traces will our civilization leave after 65 million years, and how will such traces be interpreted if any remain?<br><br>http://askwhy.co.uk/anthroposaurus/index.php<br><br>JR Mooneyham has also had some interesting speculations about pre-human and early human civilizations as well, although unlike Magee, he labels his strictly as speculative and makes no assertions that he believes these civilizations actually existed.<br><br>http://www.jmooneyham.com/lost-civilization-kerguelen.html#section49<br><br>http://www.jmooneyham.com/atlantis-1.html#section22<br><br><a href=#c2646478064900693854 title="comment permalink">9/4/13, 9:04 PM</a><br><br>

In the long run it plays out the same in essence. I am fond of a twist where from maybe 1346269 to about 39088169 years from now (again sticking to my personal habit of using the Fibonacci pattern rather than base ten) there are multiple species descended from modern humanity. Some quite mentally capable (memories of great richness and depth of feeling), some only barely capable of what we today would likely call abstract thought, and (from time to time) a few aware of the sophigenic (think "sophistry" to approximate their sense of this Earthlore) climate change so well recorded in the strata. Over all the genus is fairly successful, and often finds a keystone niche, especially in temperate and polar climates. "Civilization" as a particular social form for several species remains common for millions of years, tending toward more regional and k selected forms. Eventually a civilization (or a series of civilizations, depending on how our concepts would be projected forward) manages to maintain a degree of historical continuity with dates spanning 514229 years, though its final collapse was quite tragic, as its very adaptations toward long stability leaves it with inadequate and inflexible defenses against encroachment from a more quick lived creative species with a tendency toward what we might call cruel humor.<br><br>There are biological decedents of humanity for 102334155 years, but the larger share of that is as the rather less mindful side of a symbiosis with a decedent of the humble oyster mushroom. The massive multi-generational fungi have minds of extreme sophistication and patience, but their day to day life consists mostly of excreting protein rich mater and breeding harvest-apes to gather carbohydrate rich foods from a wide variety of regional ecosystems. War is common, but rarely lethal (to the fungi). A deep aesthetic sense of [untranslatable, but it involves the appreciation of the relationships between complex arrangements of organic chemicals, the shape of foot paths made by harvest-apes, and the songs of trees.]. This phase ends after a crisis emerges from consequences of "over domestication" of the mushroom's artisan ecosystems is exploited by a parasitic fungi-phage fern.<br><br><a href=#c3608037557479980767 title="comment permalink">9/4/13, 10:02 PM</a><br><br>

As referenced in the scenario, though, there's been a broad general trend in the direction of increased cephalization in quite a range of evolutionary lineages. Vertebrates now by and large have bigger brains than vertebrates did a hundred million years ago, presumably because it's a survival advantage. That doesn't mean that evolution moves teleologically toward intelligence, of course, but it does suggest that the basic precondition of intelligence -- a sufficiently complex central nervous system -- is becoming more common over geological time frames, and thus the chances of further intelligent species are likely to increase over the next billion years or so. <br><br>Enrique, fascinating -- I hadn't heard about the "anthroposaurus" hypothesis.

In answer to your final paragraph, it makes me feel warm and fuzzy and excited to know that "my" atoms once participated in a spectacular supernova, a gorgeous yet lifeless dust nebula, and in the past or the future they may once more participate in these things and also in the great pageantry of life on some alien orb. I dunno why, but I just love thinking about that.<br><br>Months ago, I linked the Ugo Bardi essay in one of my comments here, but your reply indicated you were already familiar with it. I've been wondering for months if you would ever get back to responding to the Bardi article, and you didn't disappoint. I love the idea of other human civilizations that are so alien from us that they might as well be extraterrestrials, and also I love the idea of animals evolving into intelligent species (One of my favorite books is David Brin's _Startide Rising_, about intelligent spacefaring dolphins, although in that case the Uplift to intelligence was the result of human genetic engineering. Yeah, yeah, Brin's arrogance to imagine that dolphins aren't already as intelligent as they need to be, I'm sure you'll reply. I liked the book anyway, the dolphin characters were memorable.)<br><br>Reading speculations like these always makes me wonder how many human and non-human civilizations might have arisen in prehistory that we simply can't know about. 4.5 Billion years is a long time, it's impossible to prove that humans or non-humans _didn't_ have some sort of civilization before the history that we know.<br><br>I would be remiss if I didn't point out the Star Trek Voyager episode, "<a href=http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Distant_Origin_%28episode%29 rel=nofollow>Distant Origin</a>". Star Trek Voyager was probably the weakest of all the Star Trek series, but this episode was certainly one of its best. It postulates that intelligent Hadrosaurs achieved a technological civilization and managed to migrate off the Earth just before the Chicxulub meteor doomed the rest of their kin. The characters postulate that geological subduction erased all trace of the dinosaur civilization before Man even evolved. The Hadrosaurs have a basically humanlike (Star Trek type) civilization, but they're steeped in repressive religious dogma which bears some resemblance to the civil religions you've been discussing here. It's rare that Star Trek even mentions religion, so this was an interesting twist. I know you've said you don't care much for Star Trek, but if you were going to watch one episode, that'd be one you might actually like. <br><br>It opens with the wonderful conceit of watching dinosaur archaeologists excavate a _human_ skeleton which the Star Trek crew had left behind on a desert planet in a prior episode...! ;)<br><br><a href=#c9166680019068050128 title="comment permalink">9/4/13, 11:00 PM</a><br><br>

Their emotions desires and drive are nothing like what humans were like and have made a stable sustainable society possible but they have also prevented further social or intellectual development.

Do you really think that we'll go the way of the wooly mammoth(or polar bear?), hopelessly hyper-adapted to a particular ecosystem and washed out with it?

That led me to a few thoughts that it is late to post over there, and I didn't expect them to ever be on topic here. But this week they sort of are.<br><br>Thought number one is about the various attempts to calculate the likelihood of earthlike intelligent life evolving elsewhere in the galaxy. Usually they define "earthlike planet" as rocky, similar mass to Earth, orbiting within a similar temperature range. Sometimes they specify watery oceans.<br><br>None of these formulae take into account that life didn't evolve just on planet Earth, or by getting a start on Mars and arriving here on meteorites. Local life evolved in a binary system of Earth-plus-Moon. <br><br>The gravitational field of our unusually massive satellite produces ocean tides, which are useful. Even more important, (according to a documentary I watched on TV; correct me if I'm misinformed), the Moon's gravity keeps the Earth's axis of rotation at IIRC an angle of roughly 23 degrees to the ecliptic. The exact angle isn't important, but the stability is. Axial tilt is a major factor determining seasonal changes in temperature. Whatever temperature range an organism evolved to live in is the range it needs. Abrupt changes are lethal. <br><br>Our massive satellite was torn out of the planet by a cosmic hit-and-run. What are the odds of that happening to earthlike planets in other solar systems, and happening at the right time in the planet's geological development? With all the earth-sized planets we think are out there, it is likely to have happened more than once, but it must be fairly rare. Calculations for frequency of earthlike planets that don't take the Moon into account are orders of magnitude too large.<br><br>Some folk traditions and pagan religions see the Moon as the source or the governor of earthly fertility. Though we know it to be an airless barren rock, that may well be true.<br><br><a href=#c201695168003545127 title="comment permalink">9/5/13, 3:46 AM</a><br><br>

He was English of the WWII generation so had drunk tea all his life. On his first trip to the United States he came across tea bags for the first time. He tried to make a pot of tea but put the whole tea bag, paper wrapping and all, into the pot. Having said which, loose tea leaves are a nuisance. Many’s the time that I have drunk too deeply of a cup of tea and swallowed the leaves. (But I do remember by grandmother swirling the tea before pouring it — I never knew why.)<br><br>Regarding learning from previous generations, I am doing serious vegetable gardening this year. It has generally gone well (although I descend into the use of bad language when the topic of squirrels comes up). Rather than trying to learn from others this year I have followed the approach of that great American philosopher, Yogi Berra, who said, “In theory there is no difference between theory and practice.

And even when this planet is over, evolution will continue to carry out the same autopilot script somewhere else with more superficial variations...until maybe this entire universe contracts and then the whole thing starts up again with more blind variations in nervous systems and deluded dreams of cold fusion and interstellar travel dreamt of by other creatures with different sets of ligaments.

That is the idea that the universe has an obligation to be fair (fairness is of course a subjective concept). You'll notice that in the good scenario that if humanity does the right thing that nothing can stand in the way of humanity, or it's successor the "galactic intelligence"'s way, not even the heat death of the universe. On the other hand if humanity does the wrong thing we go extinct, and so does the universe (presumably humans are the only creatures capable of creating galactic intelligences). If you believe in a fair universe, this is a lot more comforting than the idea that we might go out into that long dark night not because of the mistakes we made, but because of planetary climate cycles which were ultimately outside of our control. A refutation of this was also what I got from your excellent post.<br><br>As to your final question. I am conflicted.

At first I was a bit outraged at the audacity of your predictions, but have to admit, the end almost made me cry. <br>I just have one piece of criticism - in your story, you equate human with civilization, intelligence with civilization. Don't forget that humans inhabited this planet for 3 million years before they started reaching for the stars and building pyramids. The story of their lives is reduced by our cultural mythology (what you describe as the religion of progress) to nothing happening. Maybe they were enacting a different story, not one about conquest, but one about belonging to the world. <br>Another point about civilization is that most civilizations on this planet have been simply abandoned by its people. We will be the first that will end because we run out of resources (one was destroyed by us) So the societal organization of a future intelligent species may be nothing like a civilization.<br><br><a href=#c5700770437914508087 title="comment permalink">9/5/13, 7:36 AM</a><br><br>

One of the great mysteries is how 'progressive' evolution really is. It is very hard to know if intelligence with any similarity to ours is somehow nearly as much complexity as our environmental niche (solar system) can support. Or whether the development of the first (known) intelligence capable of figuring out the basic principles of how the universe works will lead to much more powerful intelligence. The question of whether we ever figure out intelligence to the level of being able to significantly modify or 'improve' it is really one of the great unknowns of the future. I suspect the evolution of new kinds of intelligence from our machines is more likely than your predictions suggest. It is easy to debunk 'singularity' eschatological ideas, but the possibility of machines becoming able to do practical problem solving is harder to dismiss. I fully agree that Bardi's intelligence is unreasonably attached to utopian human values. The future of intelligence is fraught with unpredictable peril.<br><br><br><a href=#c1101202501664707073 title="comment permalink">9/5/13, 7:58 AM</a><br><br>

Why do you think we will have made great progress in Cosmology in the next 500 years? The 500 years after Ptolemy were relatively static, after all; refined observations added more epicycles, at best. I don't see the Long Decline as being terribly conductive to that sort of Science, especially when you need such astoundingly expensive instruments to make observations of what the current model considers the Early Universe.<br><br>That said, regardless the larger cosmological model... well, stellar nucleosynthesis is a one-way street. Someday, the hydrogen will be gone, and the last dwarfs will burn out. Helium burning? I wouldn't rule it out. Then lithium, and so on and so on... but eventually, it has to end. The skies will go dark, and leave a graveyard of cold iron. (iron, too, is not forever: eventually, every mass finds itself in a black hole, and the black holes evaporate for want of food. Nothing remains but a uniform soup of photons. This is the modern version of Victorian Heat Death.) I cannot see any cosmology that obeys simple conservation laws going any other way. <br> <br>Telling that to just about anyone, however, is akin to telling a medieval peasant that God and all His angels have absconded from Heaven. I wrote a post on my own blog: http://tmaugust.com/blog/how-does-the-world-end/<br><br>The oddest response I got was that someone told me I was not a poet after reading that.

I don't recall much of it now (that was 45 years ago) but the part that gave me nightmares was the part about the Earth being swallowed up by the red-giant Sun and then the eventual heat-death of the universe. I was much too young to get change and death on that level. It was too far removed from the mainstream Presbyterian religious viewpoint I was being brought up in and I had no way to think about the clashes of viewpoint. Nor could I bring it up with any of the adults in my life. <br><br>At this point, it's the near-term, 10 to 100 year scale, that gives me nightmares if anything does. Or at least keeps me up some nights. All along in reading your blog I have been challenging myself to get the emotional, social, political, and cultural aspects of decline while doing what I can in the physical world to prepare for it. Seeing it laid out this way builds on that process and reminds me of the need to do psychological preparation as well as physical preparation. <br><br>As I age and start to really get tragedy, seeing it affect people I'm close to and seeing my own decline and death sometime in the near-term of this civilization's decline, thinking of the larger-scale tragedies in store for human civilizations that you've laid out is especially poignant. At the same time, though, pulling myself out of my human-centrism for a moment, it's fascinating to think of intelligent descendants of raccoons, crows, clams, and whatever other species manage it. The example of the corbicules is particularly intriguing as they are wise enough to both know and fully accept their fate. And in contrast with the heat-death idea, I prefer the idea that the universe goes on, the great cycle endlessly turning. So call me a combination of unsettled and intrigued. That's been true of this whole series of posts. Looking forward to the weeks to come!<br><br><br><br><a href=#c131685739367908903 title="comment permalink">9/5/13, 10:10 AM</a><br><br>

I do have one area of pushback. All of your future is confined to Plant Earth and the Moon (and eventually the new Earth). Yet it was only in 1887 that Michelson-Morley discovered that the speed of light is fixed. Hence space travel, at least outside the solar system, becomes impractical (if we want to return in our own lifetimes, if you know what I mean).<br><br>But you are talking millions and billions of years. You state, “In the course of their researches . . . the best minds among the corbicules have proved conclusively that nuclear fusion, artificial intelligence, and interstellar migration were never practical options in the first place.” I love the gentle irony of that statement. But isn’t it likely that someone, whatever their genetic heritage, will do an end run around the speed of light limitation and that inter-stellar travel or time-travel or some other type of travel will happen? Indeed, the New York Times recently reported that NASA scientists are developing experiments to do this. Will they succeed? Probably not, but we’re talking only a hundred years from the starting point. Indeed, in the time frames you are talking about I expect that someone will successfully tackle a much more difficult challenge: how to get around the Second Law.<br><br>I am currently struggling through a book that “explains” modern physics. It does seem that information at the quantum level can travel instantaneously. It’s fascinating, if puzzling. In the words of J.B.S. Haldance, “My own suspicion is that the Universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we cansuppose”. <br><br>Your recent discussions to do with the ending of “progress” in the sense of material advance such as we experienced in the last two generations do not, in my view, prohibit a much different kind of progress — or maybe “understanding” is a better word. Maybe not in the next few hundred years, but eventually.<br><br><br><a href=#c5894829228402003014 title="comment permalink">9/5/13, 10:22 AM</a><br><br>

Even the scale of a few millennia (as the Long Now Foundation enjoys chewing on) is daunting. So overall, an excellent essay, with richly layered meaning. I'd suggest looking beneath the specific predictions, toward the methods of thought that went into them.<br><br>My understanding of what I am -- a transient phenomenon generated moment by moment by the operation of a complex machine (via a process of narrative construction, out of memory patterns in my brain created in the course of interaction with the world; that machine and its mode of operation themselves having been generated by the operation of a vastly larger complex machine, the earth's biosphere, via the algorithm of evolution) -- also tells me that there's nothing supernatural about intelligence or self-awareness, nothing that is impossible or impractical to re-create, either in a future earth species, in an alien species, or artificially.<br><br>(Just imagine a hyper-intelligent AI saying, "after a thorough analysis, I conclude that we're screwed" as a way of reconciling AI as a real possibility with the absurdity of the Singularitarian idea that it can "save us" from anything.)<br><br>A few of my atoms becoming parts of new patterns in the distant future is better than any alternatives, but of no great importance. There's greater comfort elsewhere. What's important is the patterns themselves. My nature is to want to preserve and pass along the patterns that created me and the patterns I create -- whether that's a reasonable expectation or not. (Of course those atoms are themselves patterns, as is the mathematical structure of the vacuum upon which they assert themselves, but those patterns existed long before me; they're not "mine" in the same sense as my genes or my memories or my letters in the sand are.)<br><br>The good news is, many of those patterns I cherish came from the world around me, which includes crows and clams and stars and crags of black rock. So I don't think I'd find that pedipalped creature as alien as JMG suggests. Different, yes, but not incomprehensibly so. It may contain some of my atoms, but it matters more that it will contemplate the same kinds of atoms and stars that I do.<br><br><a href=#c1479481396875189427 title="comment permalink">9/5/13, 12:28 PM</a><br><br>

The "Great Bay" in the title is the California Central Valley, which becomes a wonderful sheltered bay for most of that period. <br><br>It's a novel-length book, written as a series of time frames. Each begins with a narrative, not unlike your text here, and then proceeds to a short story, with some limited character development to give you a sense of the times. Here's a short quote from the narrative for the period of 5,000 to 10,000 years from now: "As the green belt in the Sahara expanded and the lakes filled, a dynasty of matrilineal kings emerged in Chad and Libya ... For three hundred years there were great bazaars on the Yenisey River in Siberia, caravans coming from as far as the rich uplands of Tibet. Cities seemed to rise and fall in Mexico on a thousand-year cycle." <br><br>His projections differ from yours in detail, but it's interesting and an easy read.<br><br>It's funny: I've learned to steel myself before reading the week's episode of TAR, usually waiting until Thursday morning to avoid messing up my sleep. Your posts always trigger a lot of thinking. This one did too, but I'm glad I read it Wednesday night, because overall it left me much calmer, like an intellectual version of the SoP effect.<br><br><a href=#c202629254038857560 title="comment permalink">9/5/13, 12:30 PM</a><br><br>

The one question that keeps coming up for me is the issue of our cultures nuclear legacy. How do you think that will be dealt with in the face of The Long Descent? If it will not be dealt with, doesn't that reduce the chance of our species survival? I know little about nuclear technology other than the fact that the waste is highly dangerous to life and persistent over millions of years. My understanding is that the storage solutions we're using for it are effective for decades at the most. We can assume that we will not show the wisdom to develop longer term solutions, so what happens when containment fails? Is there anything we can do about this now?<br><br><a href=#c8274438129646162467 title="comment permalink">9/5/13, 12:32 PM</a><br><br>

Generally. Which gives me pause...<br><br>Now JMG is not known for his deep love of permaculture, but allow me if you will to offer up a game-changer for the climate change scenario. For a few decades now, permacultural ranchers have been employing a grazing tactic known as "mob grazing," or "MIG grazing," or "mob-stocking." It's designed to mimic the once-great herds of grazing hooved animals moving around open rangeland, pushed by predators and self-soiled salad bars. And the results are nothing short of astounding.<br><br>Where ecologists talk about 1000 years to build one inch of topsoil, mob-grazers are doing it in one year. In fact it's not unheard of to increase soil organic carbon by 3% in one season! Do you have any idea how much atmospheric carbon that represents, now safely sequestered in the soil where it's useful?<br><br>I do. There's a white African biologist named Allan Savory who tells the story better than I do, and he's now the editor of Stockman Grass Farmer (among other things). <br><br>Check out his TED talk if you don't mind feeling incredibly hopeful for a shot at reversing climate change.<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpTHi7O66pI<br><br>"If we could get half of the grassland acreage on Earth switched to mob-grazing management we could return atmospheric carbon to pre-industrial levels in a decade."<br><br><a href=#c2127204925784160469 title="comment permalink">9/5/13, 12:33 PM</a><br><br>

That's of course what you have done here very effectively. But I mean, I wonder if just this sort of exercise adopted as a regular personal practice might not be a very useful component for a spiritual system that's able to deal with the future. As a variation, one could meditate on being each of the creatures (chickens, cows, apple trees, carrots, streams, rivers, worms) that make up one's material body in the present.

It is good to watch events unfolding around us from bird percpective from time to time. Of course actual day to day living is done from frog percpective, and concerns about future are very real on that level of reality for many. Well-strucured global exchange network, using complicated financial tokens to represent actual wealth, is sliding into mood of paranoia and distrust slowly but certainly. Upfront payments or bank-to-bank securities are demanded more frequently, before largesse is sailed into it's destination.<br><br>It is funny that someone mentioned Atlantis in this thread. I used to attribute that branch of "knowledge" to tin hat brigade without hesitation, but south of Malta, Haqar Qim and all that stuff... It is quite impressive feat in Western part of Mediterranean, supposed to have been practically empty during so early time period. No hunter-gatherer or small-scale farmer gives that much energy to such a grandiose project, it takes logistics for food and shelter... Advanced logistics. <br><br>As prevailing current, inflow, from Straits follows the coast of Africa all the way to Aegean, floating INTO Great Sea roughly between Maltese islands in the north and Libyan coast in the south has been no problem, if you are positioned just outside the Straits... The getting out part has been the hard one with old school rigging... Especially because mistral of winter is nasty in that region, before blessings of diesel freighters took victory over seasonal winds :).<br><br>Advanced sailing skills during that period are maybe unlikely, but not infeasible. If old shellbacks (of course not literally sailing, sails are obsolete technology right now) have many unspoken tricks of the trade even in this world of GPS, who knows, maybe there has been some way... Trade from Western to Eastern Mediterranean and Red Sea has always been lucrative, even during TRUE Dark Ages, as that hilarious geographer Cosmas illustrates... Maybe it was lucrative enough for Neolithic "nations" also.

Oh, I urge the blogger, or his readers, to have fun writing adventures in the dark and gloomy world he provided -- many will be fun! <br><br>Moreover it is wholly in keeping with the mood of today's American public: sourpuss, grouchy, complaining-gloomy ingrates who think they invented dystopias and apocalypses. (Amateurs!) In other words… same-old, same-old. Put it down to boomers who are all-cranky about impending senior-senility. The nation and world will be better off when the Boomers go away.<br><br>Seriously, is "arch-druid" for real? Has he even looked at the curves for solar power? Which have been arcing toward competitive with fossil fuels at a spectacular rate? Even if the curve slows, our ability to make vast acreage of solar collectors will only expand through every up-or-down phase of civilization. If they are durable, one generation adds to the acreage and how long before Druid's scenario looks laughable?<br><br>Algae farming will suck in industrial CO2 and put out food and fuel. Vatgrown meat will eliminate the 70% of agricultural land used for grazing. Does he seriously plan to coax you all into ignoring this, and a myriad other trends? Great! He is part of the reason these things have been slowed down, during the Cynical Decade.<br>Moreover, if even once humans set up space industry (as Planetary Resources now intends to attempt) every arch-druid "calculation" goes into the trash. The amount of available power in just near Earth orbit makes Saudi Arabia seem like a finger nail clipping.<br><br>I am not claiming all is roses. So long as grouches of both left and right have hijacked the national and international discussion of the future, hobbling pragmatists and problem-solvers while mocking every hint of a can-do spirit, we certainly do face critical times. Tellingly, in their grouchy nostalgia, the trogs of the left are in many ways almost identical to those on the right. A similar meanness of spirit and cynicism that boils down to one thing --<br><br>"Don't try to get me to lift a finger to actually help solve problems. My laziness is sheltered and armored by cynicism. My torpor is protected by shrugs of disdain toward those who try.

If it had, would we even know how to recognize the signs, or would we scratch our heads and label the passing of a previous sentient species a K-T boundary?<br><br>One question though, in 10,000 years you speculate that the 6th global civilization will be passing into it's 'Winter' stage (in the Spengler-ian sense). Do you envision that civilization as being global in the current sense? ie; literally being a globe-spanning civilization as the West is today?<br>By Toynbee's count Earth has hosted some 23 (or 27) civilizations in the last 10,000 years but only the West became a 'global' civilization.

Marine mammals are social and curious but interact with their environment without manipulating it much. So, no dolphin tech. Human beings wander around. However, an intelligent species can do a good deal of local exploration without traveling.<br><br>One adaptive strategy for a social species or one with a group mind is to stay put, modify its immediate environment intensively and propagate itself by releasing genetic material to spread on the winds or the air, carried as seeds or pollen by other species that do travel, or be borne by individual species members who are in an unintelligent larval phase of development. The resulting colonies would not possess the cultural information of their progenitors and would have to develop their own culture and tech from scratch.

The thing to remember is that helium burning requires much higher temperatures and pressures than hydrogen burning, and when it does happen, it goes quickly and for a shorter time, and produces less energy per unit mass of fusion fuel than hydrogen--&gt;helium. There are certain massive stars more than 8 solar masses, that can go further and produce elements up to iron in a series of reactions. <br><br>It is not possible to release more binding energy after iron, since further fusion would actually absorb energy. So what happens is that the iron core starts to collapse, then rebounds due to neutron degeneracy pressure (a quantum effect) and blows the star apart in a supernova. This burst of energy can actually perform the fusion reactions beyond iron.<br><br>In fact when the sun reaches the end of its life, most of the material that is expelled is still hydrogen, that is the outer layers of the Sun, with some extra helium that had been produced in the Sun, because only in the core, and in the red giant phase, in a shell surrounding it, did fusion actually take place. <br><br>Very long term, what will happen to the Galaxy, is that an increasing fraction of mass becomes tied up in stellar remnants such as white dwarves (the core of a Sun-like star), neutron stars and black holes (collapsed cores of very massive stars), so eventually less and less is available to make new stars.<br><br>The odd thing about stars, is that the more massive they are, the shorter they live. This is because the core temperature and pressure is higher the more massive the star. The physics works out with the luminosity being proportional to the cube of the mass. So a 10 solar mass star shines 1000 times brighter, but has 10 times as much material, so instead of lasting 10 billion years like the sun does, it lives for only 100 million years, before exploding as a supernova. <br><br>It's a cosmic irony that the stars that live fast, die young, and are profligate with resources are the important ones for creating terrestrial planets and complex chemistry.<br><br>The galaxy has been around for about 12 billion years. Since the massive stars that perform the heavy element enrichment die young, several generations of these could have created enough heavy elements for terrestrial planets early on enough in solar systems born say, 10 billion years ago, giving them a 5 billion year headstart on us.<br><br><a href=#c4420425142009024578 title="comment permalink">9/5/13, 5:02 PM</a><br><br>

Any number of factors can cause it; I decided, for the sake of this scenario, to use the very common phenomenon of major environmental changes over a period of several million years to put just that little bit too much stress on a vulnerable species. Of course I could have taken things in different directions; evolution certainly appears to be contingent -- that is, it could always have taken a different twist. <br><br>Martin, I've argued at some length in my book <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/E/The-Ecotechnic-Future rel=nofollow>The Ecotechnic Future</a> that industrial society is merely the first, and the most cluelessly wasteful, of a potential range of technic societies, defined as societies that use a significant amount of energy from sources other than human and animal muscle. There are plenty of things that can still be done with the more modest energy flows that can be obtained from renewable sources, and I expect that a future society that plays its cards right could certainly manage aerostats and a global civilization without having to waste energy as freely as we have. <br><br>Phil, of course.

My guess is that on other worlds with other conditions, other kinds of life have found things perfectly satisfactory for them, thanks. <br><br>Tripp, not a problem -- anything that encourages people to get part of their food supply under their own control is welcome here. <br><br>ChemEng, I suspect any social species will have some distinction between those actions that are considered appropriate and those that aren't. How exactly that gets expressed, and what those actions are, is another matter -- there isn't even much consensus across different cultural traditions of humanity about what's moral and what's not -- consider sexual customs just for starters. With entirely different species, I'd guess, all bets are off. <br><br>Yupped, it's our destiny to become compost!<br><br>Ugo, thank you for taking this little jeu d'esprit in the spirit it was meant!

Do you think that it's possible that sooner or later somebody will do an end run around the laws of thermodynamics and make a working perpetual motion machine? I don't. The most parsimonious solution of Fermi's paradox is that perpetual progress leading to interstellar migration isn't an option; like people considering perpetual motion machines before the discovery of the law of the conservation of energy, we don't yet know why, but that does seem to be the most likely shape of things. <br><br>Ken, of course the next decade to century are the critical ones for you and me. The point of the scenario wasn't to fret about events ten billion years in the future; it was specifically to point out a difference in attitudes that we'll be discussing next week. <br><br>Marcello, you might want to look up bog iron sometime -- iron concentrated into usable ores by chemosynthetic bacteria; it's very common. Of course an industrial society along present lines won't be an option again for many millions of years, but I'd like to suggest that industrialism is not the only way to have a technologically advanced society -- in fact, that it's a remarkably crude and wasteful way to do the thing, and that the potential for less clumsy ways exist. <br><br>Somewhatstunned, that's one of the things that inspired my corvins. I've seen crows who acted as though they know who's going to be landing on the Moon in a hundred million years. <br><br>Myriad, I'm certainly not claiming that there's necessarily something supernatural about intelligence. My guess here is based on Stephen Wolfram's principle of computational equivalence, which suggests that the computations necessary to figure out how to build an intelligent mind would be of the same order of complexity as the two billion year long evolutionary process that created the ones we've got now. Strictly speaking, it's not impossible, but I don't recommend trying to do it, much less betting the farm on it!<br><br>Jose, I'd heard of it, but haven't read that. Clearly I'll want to remedy that at some point. <br><br>Brian, I've discussed that repeatedly here. For the next quarter of a million years, unless a lot of money is invested very soon in nuclear waste storage, there are going to be dead zones surrounded by cow skulls on stakes or something similar, and the locals will warn you solemnly that if you go there, you die. They'll be right, too, because each of those zones will have a dead nuclear reactor and/or abandoned fuel rod storage pools toward the center, and a zone surrounding it in which radionuclides with varying half-lives have been spread by a variety of processes. Just one of those little gifts we're saving up for our descendants...<br><br>Trippticket, sure, and if half the people who own cars on the planet were to discard them, we could accomplish a lot, too. Are you, personally, doing anything to make either of these grand plans happen? If not, it's just a lullaby -- a way not to think about the future our own actions are creating for us. <br><br>Glenn, my scenario assumes that all economically extractable fossil fuels will be extracted and burnt, and that methane releases triggered by the resulting warming will add to the mess and prolong the process of recovery. That's a hypothesis, of course, but it seemed like a fairly reasonable one. <br><br>Steve, that would be a very solid series of meditations. I may write that up sometime for Druid use -- if so, I'll credit you with the idea!<br><br>Juhana, there's evidence that high-quality stone for tools was traded all over the Mediterranean basin in the Neolithic, quite probably by water, thus your suggestion stands.<br><br><a href=#c7349839830387696370 title="comment permalink">9/5/13, 10:03 PM</a><br><br>

Mind you, if you'd taken the time to check out the blog more generally, you'd have found out that I started work on solar and wind energy about the time you were doing page proofs for <i>Sundiver</i> -- I enjoyed that one greatly, by the way -- and that one of the central themes of this blog is the need to get up off our rumps, individually and collectively, and take constructive action to deal with the converging crises that are being brought on by the blind faith in vaporware you've promoted here. Still, I'm sure you're a very busy man. <br><br>I appreciate your contribution, though, because the difference between your reaction to the scenario I sketched out and the reaction of many of my other readers points up the issue I want to discuss in the next few posts. You dismissed the scenario as pure gloomy negativity; quite a few other readers found it intriguing and even consoling. That gap shows the emergence of a sensibility that is likely to have a significant impact on events in the decades and centuries to come. More on this in upcoming posts. <br><br>Nano, "vorticitating hypersphere" is one of those phrases that ought to be repeated three times very fast while drunk. <br><br>Ben, I'm guessing that global civilizations will be more common in the future, as certain technologies -- notably sailing ships and radio communication -- that are quite workable under nonindustrial conditions, will make it much easier for civilizations to spread. Still, it's a guess. <br><br>Enrique, I've been watching that. It'll be interesting to see what happens if Obama gets even more clueless than usual. <br><br>Kyoto, excellent! The sense of wonder was something I was shooting for -- though I did my best to write it so that people with one set of beliefs would get that, and those with another definitely wouldn't. <br><br>Jim, waving pedipalps noted!<br><br>Josh, I wouldn't put it past social insects to make a shot at it someday. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, you'll notice that I only had one of my other intelligent species, the corvins, get into space travel. It may well be a minority interest at best.<br><br>MawKernewek, please look up bog iron, and also keep in mind how long people will be able to mine metals out of our ruins. <br><br>Sgage, have you seen his blog? It's full of exactly that sort of cheerleading about vaporware of various kinds. The whole thing reminded me of the harsh but not inaccurate comment of a professor I know: "Expecting science fiction writers to predict the future we'll actually inhabit is like expecting romance novel writers to be good at marriage counseling." <br><br>LatheChuck, good. I've noticed in general that the laws of thermodynamics seem to be very unpopular with cornucopians.<br><br><a href=#c6935517532136910372 title="comment permalink">9/5/13, 10:24 PM</a><br><br>

The sort of futilitarianism you've outlined is nowhere implied by my scenario. You yourself are going to die someday; so am I; so is everyone else; does that mean that all we can do is lay down and die right now? Of course not -- and in fact, for most people, the unflinching contemplation of the reality of death is a sharp reminder of the value of life, and inspires a great many people to get out there and accomplish things while they can. <br><br>With regard to your dead planet, I'd like to take that example and reframe it. Here are two empty beds. One of them has never had anyone in it. In the other one, you spent an hour and a half last night having the best sex of your life with a partner you care about profoundly. Does the fact that the beds are currently empty mean that what happened in each of them over the last twenty-four hours has equal value? <br><br>Doctor W., I wonder if they'd notice the difference between dying tonight of gunshot and dying of old age at the end of their normal lifespans...<br><br>Darren, I don't have a strict definition, purely an ostensive one -- a fully sentient being is one that can do the same kinds of things human beings can, in terms of thinking, manipulation of the environment, etc. <br><br>Trippticket, to my mind a great deal depends on whether long-distance transport remains an option. Long-distance sailing vessels can be maintained on wholly renewable resources, you know. <br><br>Carl, heck of a good question, to which I don't claim to know the answer. I'd encourage you to take whatever steps you can to prepare to survive in place, and later on, if an opportunity to relocate presents itself, make that judgment call based on what's happening at the time. <br><br>Heretic, thanks for the tip and the link! That's not one that I've read, and I'll want to fix that. <br><br>Ray, of course you may be right. I simply chose to arrange my scenario otherwise, to make a point. <br><br>Kleymo, funny! The answer, of course, is to do what you can with what you have, where you are, right now. <br><br>LL Pete, I'll have to look that one up. Thanks for the tip. <br><br>K-dog, no argument about the raccoons. They're extraordinarily intelligent already, and given a few tens of millions of years to expand into new ecological niches and develop even more complex nervous systems and social structures, they've got as good a shot as anything does. <br><br>Robert, funny!

(pop culture lingo from The Simpsons cartoons: expressing a lack of interest or enthusiasm)<br><br> Explaining what might appear as a rather trite dismissal of your whole post requires a somewhat lengthy digression.<br><br> First, Daniel Banker's Total Perspective Vortex is from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. But he does have a point. Total perspective is a crippling liability. Limited perspective is required for meaningful existence. More on this below. <br><br> Second, my favorite line (of all time), from one of my favorite songs, from one of my favorite bands:<br><br>What a beautiful face<br>I have found in this place<br>That is circling all round the sun<br>What a beautiful dream<br>That could flash on the screen<br>In a blink of an eye and be gone from me<br>Soft and sweet<br>Let me hold it close and keep it here with me<br><br>And one day we will die<br>And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea<br>But for now we are young<br>Let us lay in the sun<br>And count every beautiful thing we can see...<br><br>...And when we meet on a cloud<br>I'll be laughing out loud<br>I'll be laughing with everyone I see<br>Can't believe <b>how strange it is to be anything at all</b><br><br> Third, I once had a limited perspective that I felt was solid. I had a working relationship with the universe. I knew what it was all about. I had a good bead on things. I was happy. A friend of mine broke it for me. The jist of it is that he required an infallible proof for every little thing, and every argument or bit of evidence I wished to enter required its own subordinate proofs. I realized later that this argument was an infinite regress that basically amounted to 'I refuse to take anything seriously' which is both infallible and useless. He was quite right but he also had nothing to say.<br><br> Of course, that line of thought leaves one nowhere; adrift on an aerostat home with the tether cut. But life goes on even when one's foundations are ripped away. Which brings us back to the present narrative.<br><br> There are two things to consider. One, one's belief's and two, the serious consideration of our present circumstances. The problem is the interplay between serious and belief.<br><br>Not done...

Perhaps my comment brought Mr. David Brin over to this humble space. Maybe he Googled himself right after I made the comment, or has some sort of daemon that checks when people mention his name...<br><br>Mr. Brin, I've greatly enjoyed a lot of your books, and attended a couple of your lectures in person. But I think the polite way to phrase our disagreement here would be, we are not seeing eye-to-eye about the definition of the problem(s). I won't go into more detail because I'm up too late as it is and no doubt plenty of other people here want to get your attention too. But I'd encourage you to consider whether the practical problems about how to get the common people-on-the-ground through the hard times we're obviously facing, with efficiency and grace -- which is what Mr. Greer typically writes about -- are or are not as legitimate a way to ponder our future challenges, as the grandiose technological projects you describe. The sorts of technologies that you and other sci-fi writers envision (by the way I consider myself an amateur sci-fi writer, I'm not exempting myself) will always have side effects, risks and unintended consequences. The consequences of trying to live in harmony with the Earth and to take care of hearth and home with minimal demands, are well known.<br><br>Despite having read Mr. Brin's blog for several years, I'm still a bit taken aback by the vehemence of the response to what I consider a rather innocuous science fantasy piece. Why the ad-hominems about everyone else's "laziness" and the "ingrates" from a simple spec-fic piece about the evolution of life thousands and billions of years from now? Would you Mr. Brin expect people to impugn your personal character by twisting the best qualities of your futuristic novels into some sort of invective in return? It brings to mind Jim Hightower's remark that "If you're taking a lot of flak, you must be right over the target." I think the target here is indeed mankind's competence at replacing the natural environment with something ersatz. Underneath the shrill denunciations that techno-utopians make about Peak Oil people, is a gut-level understanding that mankind has already irretrievably wrecked the environment that sustains us -- so if we _can't_ replace the natural environment with controlled technology that will provide for our needs instead, then we're all well and truly f*****. In such dire circumstances, it's a pretty common reaction to denounce as a traitor anyone whose strategy differs even slightly from yours. I'd also encourage everyone to remember something which during the second Iraq war was dubbed "The Tinkerbell Strategy".<br><br>I'm further reminded of Mr. Freeman Dyson -- gawd, I'm almost afraid to mention his name here, for fear he's gonna show up and lambaste us too -- another groundbreaking intellectual, who was a vociferous opponent of climate change. Not that he denied for an instant that burning carbon was changing the Earth's weather, oh no, that was a given. Mr. Dyson, however, insisted that any tiny efforts to curb carbon or mitigate climate change were a foolish waste of time and money. Why? Because, he said, "within twenty years" [from 2008] we will have "genetically engineered carbon-eating trees," his words, that will presumably drop piles of diamonds instead of leaves for you to rake up from your yard. OK Mr. Dyson, if you're watching, the hurricanes, the heat waves, and the melting ice caps have arrived. Where are your trees?<br><br><a href=#c2456973883844032979 title="comment permalink">9/6/13, 12:23 AM</a><br><br>

My "rabbit-powered lawn" blog post that I dropped a link to (thank you btw), our pastured chicken operation getting off (on?) the ground this month, and then mob-grazing as many cattle as we can stock on our pasture, and probably leasing the pasture land adjacent to us as well. I'm very excited about that part!<br><br>We should be selling 6 species of gourmet mushrooms by this fall, all of which are speeding up carbon cycling on both properties and fetching respectable prices. Our first small primocane raspberry crop is ripening as I type, and in the process of expanding by 15 fold. A Celeste fig crop just went in the ground, with half a dozen more varieties to be added soon. A big blueberry patch and unusual superfruit hugelkultur are on the short list.<br><br>The electrician who wired the farmhouse has offered his services to our cause pro-bono, for setting up micro-hydro systems on the creek adjacent to the house and barn. We're in the research stages of an aquaponics setup (not sold on that one yet). Most of the materials for a passive solar batch water heater are lying around waiting for me to find some time (and waiting for the sun to come back out!), as well as a solar oven for the back deck. We hang our laundry out and don't use HVAC, haven't for 5 years now actually, even in the south Georgia heat 2 summers ago. I sat up last night watching YouTube videos on rocket mass heaters until I had to force myself to get some sleep, and then right back at it by 6:00 this morning.<br><br>The new farm is on a busy road that leads from our little Appalachian town to a grass-based farm several miles farther out than we are, so an on-farm sales customer base almost seems like a foregone conclusion. Dumping the car (a 1996 Toyota Camry with 250k+ on the odometer) is a big dream of mine, but for the moment we still make the bulk of our income from selling herbal health and household products of our own invention on the farmers market circuit.<br><br>www.smallbatchgarden.com<br><br>more to follow...<br><br><a href=#c498322498764785396 title="comment permalink">9/6/13, 4:11 AM</a><br><br>

A modest cob cottage is on the drawingboard, as well as converting our old wall tent (where the 4 of us spent the last 16 months living without electricity or running water) to a hard-topped workshop with roundwood poles from onsite.

Our Robot Nannies relieving us of the horrible obligation to actually do or make anything? Though he doesn't mention it, I imagine that sex has been replaced with brain implants and test tube babies, and the desire for physical challenge and competition has been deleted from our genomes because it is too inconvenient for the machines. And of course it had to be justified by vastly exaggerating the alternative -- humans can no longer live in the tropics because they are 5C warmer than at present? Huh? We are tropical animals biologically. Move uphill ferkrissakes. The tropics are full of mountains. Global desertification is hard to bring about unless you somehow stop water from evaporating from the oceans.

Thank you!<br><br>This one is close to my heart by way of very different childhood programming.<br><br>Pls follow me for a bit if you have the time, it'll be lengthy: I was raised Pentecostal (of the fundamentalist strain maybe?), the first book I remember reading is --the only one at the ready for many childhood yrs was-- the KJV Bible. One habit was reading it together on a yearly basis as a family.<br>Of course, being a product of my kiith and, like all, with a need to belong, I soon was doing it on my own.<br><br>This is when the cognitive dissonance started.<br>The more I assembled my thoughts into coherent logical patterns, the more I questioned the biblical mythology. The answers I got sent me on tautological loops that discouraged me from critical and systems thinking for far too long. <br><br>But gave me a strong "doubting-Thomas" streak and apprehensiveness about anything I don't understand or can't follow logically to its origins on my own terms. This makes me suspicious of anything posing as unquestionable truth and forces me to read a lot.<br><br>Anyways, one of the passages that always stayed with me since about 8yrs old is Ecclesiastes 1:9-11, "The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after."<br><br>Read that passage a few times, take away the supernatural, with the idea the bible is a compilation of ancient lore &amp; understandings of ancients --who generation after generation, collapse after collapse, re-applied their own Scientific Method to surviving lore until only essential truths remained-- and is perplexing that it could be true.<br>You then naturally ask, what of fossil-fuel-guzzling jet engines, have they been invented before? What of Saturn V rockets able to take 45tons of payload to Trans-Lunar Injection?<br><br>So, for some years now I've created my own version of "The Next 3.5Million Million Years" that follows very much the one you describe here. It goes like this (of course these are very much rounded figures which I haven't taken the time to update in a while):<br><br>A) 3.5 Million Million Years ago --oldest signs of bio signs on Terra.<br><br>B) 20MY yrs --taking hominid evolution as a yardstick, avg time for a phylum to evolve to enough sentience to cause global changes.<br><br>C) 1MY --avg time for evolution to neutralize/recycle the longest-lasting radioactive waste.<br><br>D) 2MY --after C above, avg time for evolution to bring ecological balance + fill every nook and cranny with myriad fauna.<br><br>E) 25MY total --sum of B+C+D which I take as avg time for a sentient species to evolve, grow/dominate/overshoot/decline/collapse, then evolution to clean up + replenish for the next one to come around.<br><br>F) 5 Cataclysms --verified times Terra's fauna has been nearly wiped out, double it to 10 for ones we're not sure of nor have a record of.<br><br>A/E is 3.5MMY / 25MY = 140.<br>140 / 10 = 14.<br><br>14 times: likelihood that in the distant past creatures evolved with similar attributes to us capable of global impact, capable of vicious cycles of exponential growth + use of finite resources + pollution creation on the environs it depends for survival.<br><br>As we are not evolution's end product, and that Terra will likely go on for another 3.5MMYs before Sol expands and engulfs it, it is likely that another 14 species will to come to sentience with capability of global impact to their own detriment.<br><br>Somehow, of the things that give me fitful sleep worry and restlessness, that one gives me a sense of…tranquility (?) …calmness (?). For some reason, it steadies my perspectives.<br><br><a href=#c6713560644755132171 title="comment permalink">9/6/13, 9:57 AM</a><br><br>

Yeah, those all-powerful grouches who have so totally dominated the discussion that one just never hears a word of optimism or salesmanship in the national media of any kind.

To be sure, most people are on something of a sliding scale of greed, selfishness and short-sightedness, but sociopaths are constitutionally different, unable to be bothered with remorse and compassion. If you think about what that would mean, it would mean that such a personality has several traits that naturally accompany such a psyche - they lack the deep inner life that appreciates beauty and life, they being shallow seek short term rewards and are almost as incapable of thinking long-term as they are of remorse. Being cunning, manipulative and attracted to power, it seems likely that sociopaths have had a lot to do with the incredibly poor planning and short sighted greed that has allowed this nuclear mess to exist.<br><br>The reason I think this is important is because I see a lot of hand wringing laments that "we" have got to improve as a species. Sure, it is really true that we do, but if we are looking at the wrong target we might miss the predator at our tails. Yes, "we" are not saints and it causes many problems, but if we ignore the well heeled predators that are taking advantage of us and care not for the future of life itself, well, it might be compared to (as JMG laments) the way apocalypse and utopian scenarios promote laziness and a do-nothing attitude.<br><br>For example, it is certainly known that the great majority of all burglaries, muggings, murders and rapes are committed by a very small number of repeat offenders. But what about the well-heeled, the non personally violent who merely foment wars and despoil the earth while lying and manipulating to get what they want?<br><br>I found it very interesting when I once read of at least one Native American tribe that they think in terms of 7 generations when making decisions.

I may not fully agree with your vision of the future over the next few centuries, but I like the vision over deep time.

Just as every turning of the seasons is as exciting as the last, so too can I imagine filling different roles in future civilizations and even in new sentient forms, forever exploring the grand diversity of physical experience. <br><br>As for the next few hundred years, I can imagine a couple of scenarios that would bring an ecotechnic future into being sooner with less of a global collapse. One is that particular regions - Scandinavia seems like one good bet - with a stable population and a relative abundance of resources will manage to get enough of their loops closed with renewables (e.g. using wind, solar, and biomass power to build more wind turbines) that their technological culture will survive the end of fossil fuels. These regions could then act as a seed to build out into the rest of the world.<br><br>The second possibility is that one catastrophe (e.g. plague-level pandemic on a global scale) will be large enough in terms of population destruction that it creates a temporary surplus of resources (metals in uninhabited buildings, surplus electrical generation capacity, unused land) that can be applied to ecotechnic technologies. The assumption being that by that point we will be convinced that a lower-energy, renewable-based world is the better choice, if only we had enough resources to move in that direction.<br><br>Perhaps these scenarios are less probable than your vision of slow global collapse, but I do see them as possibilities.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c5846561961751249973 title="comment permalink">9/6/13, 1:16 PM</a><br><br>

I've been pointing out the computational nature of evolution, sometimes with very smart people, for years ("evolution <i>is</i> intelligent design, dammit!") and you're the first to entertain the idea sufficiently to respond in kind.<br><br>As for Wolfram's principles of computational equivalence and computational irreducibility (both could apply here), that's a worst case boundary. I can't rule out the hypothesis that replication of evolution's computation is the <i>only</i> way to arrive at AI. (Would it even still be "artificial" if it were achieved that way?) However, we didn't have to recompute the evolution of insects or birds in order to achieve powered flight, nor the evolution of aerobic metabolic pathways to achieve motive power from the oxidation of cellulose. Also, we have the present results of evolution's computations to work from. (Analogously, rule 110 being computationally irreducible doesn't stop me from looking on page 38 of Wolfram's book to see the 3200th generation starting from a single black cell already computed.)<br><br>Progress in the field also appears genuine. A computer science course on AI programming that I took 30 years ago started with a list of the field's characteristic problems on the blackboard (speech recognition, route planning, scene recognition, text recognition, language translation, etc.), some of which were considered pipe dreams at the time. All of them now have commercially and socially useful, if imperfect, realizations.<br><br>If progress towards "real intelligence" seems slow, it's partly because "intelligence" or "sentience" per se is never, outside of some corners of academia, the goal at hand, while the actual immediate goals keep advancing. In other words, if HAL is a few decades late, it may be because most cyberneticists have focused on developing features like "able to steer the spacecraft and keep the antenna pointed the right way" instead of "able to re-evaluate the mission and decide to murder the crew."<br><br>The visual perception puzzle I'll soon have to solve to "prove I'm not a robot" to submit this post will likely give me some difficulty. We no longer think playing good chess is one of the most amazing accomplishments of human intelligence, largely because AI found the problem so tractable. Other capabilities that we take for granted have proven far more challenging to imitate, a finding whose philosophical implications alone are worth the price of admission. (Who would have thought, back when TV newscasters were still calling computers "electronic brains," that playing chess would be orders of magnitude easier to encompass than identifying the chess board in a picture of a room? Who, even today, appreciates that in terms of demand for raw neural data processing power, an athlete exceeds a mathematician and a talented socialite probably exceeds them both?)<br><br>In any case, I didn't go into that field, so I won't be trying to do it. And I don't pin any great hope on AIs fixing anything, any more than I'd expect better weather from having a better weather forecaster. My interest is that, succeed or fail, there's a lot to be learned from the attempt.<br><br><a href=#c3325323597420206651 title="comment permalink">9/6/13, 4:40 PM</a><br><br>

Four or five hundred million years is a pretty respectable history (I had to look it up just now). <br><br>Modern cephalopods include the nautilus (which Wikipedia says is not closely related), the octopus, the squid, and the cuttlefish. <br><br>If you've seen the nature show footage of cuttlefish, you'll know that they are remarkably intelligent. And they aren't too far removed from your clams, you know. Have you seen a cuttlefish putting on a visual show to dazzle its prey? <br><br>Another interesting fact about them is that many species are quite short-lived for such smart critters. (They don't have a written language, although they are capable of making ink.) Sex is fatal for many of the short-lived species (there are <i>some</i> species, including the nautiloids, that breed multiple times). They never get to know their offspring, so no grandmothers and no storytelling. <br><br>But in spite of the lack of a cephalopod kindergarten, these little shell-less critters do pretty well around the reef. If not for their brains, they'd be a delicious snack for most of the other phyla there. Whether it amounts to a 'civilization' depends on your definition of civilization, I suppose. <br><br>I am inclined to speculate that the short-lived species have a sort of 'racial memory', in which things that are learned by an individual can be somehow encoded into genomic imprinting and passed to the next generation.

Pure love of understanding for its own sake might be a myth of the religion of progress.<br><br>On another topic, you quote Artificial Intelligence as an example of the pursuits which might be regarded as useless in the future.<br>My personal belief is that in that area, just as in the search for ET life, we tend to be very anthropocentric.<br>Just as we tend to seek life on other planets based upon what we know of life on Earth, I believe we also tend to look for an artificial recreation of intelligence as we know it in the physical world, and expect to recreate a physical phenomenon using algorithms.<br>I think the emphasis on practical results is one of the reasons behind the failure of the AI pursuers. I've never read of experiments trying to create algorithms acting in total freedom and random innovations, for example, in order to study the myriads of ways information can exist in a system designed to create complexity... Probably because this would be redundant with Systems Theory, which didn't need algorithms to understand the basics of complex systems ? But it could lead to new philosophical, if not practical, insights.<br>And usually great discoveries happen because some people act on pure desire of understanding for itself, the practical results coming as side effects of the conceptual discoveries...<br>I still do believe that we have a lot of discoveries to be born out of pure love of understanding, for example in animal behaviour or natural science.<br><br>You are still right that we need to integrate the pure, unrewarded love of understanding into a broader, more rewarding, spiritual system !

Like it or not, life on Earth will be of finite duration anyway. Of course it will last until very nearly the end (or freezing) of the physical planet itself - when I hear about life in deep ocean vents living on geothermal energy, I find it hard to believe that anything humans might do will wipe out <i>all</i> other life.<br><br>That being said, I've thought about deep time in both directions for some years now, and the fact that there's been no confirmation of extraterrestrial life makes me uneasy in view of the fact that interstellar migration is impossible. (Sliding down Hubbart's curve, just starting to see potential planets now, no idea how to get there.) The idea that the Earth could possibly be the only life bearing world is just <b>awful</b> to me, seeing as it <i>is</i> of finite duration.<br><br>A few years ago I wrote (and, uh, promptly forgot about) a piece advocating an attempt to seed other worlds with life.

It's always amusing to hear somebody who's spouting the conventional wisdom trying to portraying himself as the lone visionary heroically contending against the conventional wisdom. <br><br>Onething, and I'll reiterate that it's very convenient and comforting to insist that the world's problems are the product of some minority of bad people, but it's not helpful. The people whose decisions concern me are the ordinary, everyday people who are dragging the world to ruin because they don't grasp the implications of their choices. <br><br>Marcello, I've spent a good fraction of the last seven years discussing exactly these points, and covered them in some detail in the book of mine I cited in response to your last comment. The short form is that there are plenty of ways to generate modest amounts of electricity and heat using renewable sources, and many of them would have been well within the reach of an ordinarily enterprising medieval alchemist if somebody had given him the plans. Add those to an agricultural society using the improved organic methods that have been devised over the last century, and you've got the basis for something that isn't an industrial society, but isn't medieval either -- and that likely has potentials for further development that nobody raised in a more wasteful society, such as ours, is likely to be able to spot. <br><br>JP, good -- and if that suggests to you that an intelligent species, a high civilization, and (say) an artistic or intellectual movement can be seen as parallel systems that follow similar patterns on different time scales, why, yes, that's what it suggests to me, too. <br><br>Iuval, poets do remarkably well during dark ages, and so do literate monks and nuns; crafts such as theirs may not belong to the veneer after all. If I ever need some relativity calculations, I'll take you up on that, thanks! ;-)<br><br>Jeff, well, in a sense...<br><br>Mark, it's certainly possible to imagine scenarios that would bring about an ecotechnic society more quickly than will otherwise happen; it's equally possible to imagine scenarios that would delay things substantially. I'd be more interested by your scenarios if they involved you, personally, doing something to make things happen, and if you then went out and pursued that goal, rather than daydreaming about circumstances handing you the outcome you'd prefer. <br><br>Ing, to my mind, it's less a matter of "what is there to do?" and more one of "what do you, yourself, choose to do?" Choosing to play the pipes, to learn the ways of herbs, or (to bring in one of the things that's getting a chunk of my spare time these days) to get some basic working knowledge of amateur radio, is an exercise of that most challenging of human attributes, freedom.<br><br>K-dog, on the other hand, there's a sense in which stardust is simply an intermediate stage between a corbicule and a nameless critter on a black crag, waving its pedipalps...<br><br>Wall0159, 120 years ago balloons were commonplace, so no, nobody was saying that human flight was impossible.

I'd consider your namesake more likely, though!<br><br>Myriad, if I may borrow another of Wolfram's points, there are some things that can be simplified to the point that they can be modeled mathematically or logically -- for example, flight and fire -- and other things that don't seem to be susceptible to that treatment. It's always possible that intelligence might be able to be understood by means of a simplified model, but so far the results don't look good -- and it's worth noting that the brute force methods used by current computers to do quasi-intelligent tasks (such as playing chess) are radically different from the methods used by actual intelligent beings. That said, of course, my story is a story, and the discoveries of the corbicules are purely a work of fiction; what actually happens over the next billion years is quite a different matter. <br><br>Jim, I suspect that the vast octopi civilizations of the future will have to wait for evolutionary incentives toward longer lifespans!<br><br>Richard, well, the corbicules are evolving as fast as they can... ;-)<br><br>Tim, the corvins did, but no one ever went to the Moon after them. It didn't happen to be of interest to the Earth's other intelligent beings. As for interstellar communication, I consider that quite possible, but -- to borrow one of the themes from <a href=http://starsreach.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>Star's Reach</a> -- I suspect that if we ever do hear from other intelligent species, we'll be in for a massive shock, when we discover that a lot of what we think we know about the cosmos is simply a reflection of our own senses and nervous systems...<br><br>Jean-Vivien, that's a huge issue, and one that I was planning on discussing as we go. There are immense possibilities in the intersection between science and the new religious sensibility that's beginning to take shape, but understanding those possibilities is going to take a lot of careful discussion. More on this as we proceed! <br><br>Space Seeder, we have no reason to think that life is unique to Earth -- especially given how common planets are turning out to be in the nearby star systems.

The corvins have access to extravagant amounts of fossil fuel. I recall reading, but cannot now recall where, that the reason the carbon was able to be sequestered was because, for some multiple millions of years after the evolution of trees, there were no organisms to break them down. If there were, the vegetation that produced our fossil fuels would not have lain around stacking up and not rotting for millennia until it could be buried in sufficient quantities to produce our energy legacy. Those organisms now exist and as long as there is biomass to break down and recycle, that is what will happen. The one-time inheritance of fossil fuels was really that, One Time.<br><br>The second is that you make no mention of the decay of the geological cycle as the earth's core loses heat and the magma slows down. I don't know what the effect might be in a billion years, but I'm guessing it will not be zero.

The Earth's coal reserves were indeed put there during a phase in evolution when cellulose-eating decay organisms hadn't yet evolved, but petroleum comes from a different source -- it's what comes of marine organisms buried in sediments during oceanic anoxic events. That's why I specified that the corvins have petroleum, rather than coal. As for the cooling of the Earth's core, that's a complex issue, since the decay of long-lived radioisotopes provides much of the current heat; no doubt that'll cool off in deep time, but I figured 100 million years was close enough that it wouldn't be a big issue. <br><br>Myriad, nah, it's standard for people on Brin's side of our current culture wars to insist that nobody on my side can have any valid credentials at all.

<div class="avt a_b6373a" id=c3255623781354089360></div><b><a href=http://geovermont.wordpress.com/ rel=nofollow>geovermont</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Getting back to JMG's question at the end of the current post, I find his tale of the future most intriguing. I'm a scientist (geologist) and it's true that my study of the deep history of the planet and the evolution of life on it has helped prepare me to take the long view of our future, but in the end, it's not so much science that helps me accept this future.<br><br>There's only so much that science can really tell us about the future (and I'm thinking that JMG used most of that in the current post). In the end, science is hopelessly inadequate for this particular task as science deals with the analysis of testable facts and ideas. Instead of hard science, we need imagination, and where better to find that than in a poet--someone who can take the facts of daily existence, come up with new insights, and who can then express them in a compact and memorable form. I suggest Robinson Jeffers, once a rising start in the literary pantheon of the 1920s and 30s, now almost forgotten and barely in print. <br><br>I was re-introduced to Jeffers through JMG's essay "An Inhumanist Vision" at the Dark Mountain Project. I'm finding that Jeffers' remarkable poems are indeed powerful tools to use to understand our real place in this vast cosmos. Go to a library, dig out an old copy of The Selected Poetry of Robinson Jeffers from the stacks, and dig into poems such as "Rock and Hawk", "Rearmament", "The Purse-Seine", "Flight of Swans", or "The Answer". As a start, try this one on for size:<br><br>Return<br><br>A little too abstract, a little too wise,<br>It is time for us to kiss the earth again,<br>It is time to let the leaves rain from the skies,<br>Let the rich life run to the roots again.<br>I will go down to the lovely Sur Rivers<br>And dip my arms in them up to the shoulders.<br>I will find my accounting where the alder leaf quivers<br>In the ocean wind over the river boulders.<br>I will touch things and things and no more thoughts,<br>That breed like mouthless May-flies darkening the sky,<br>The insect clouds that blind our passionate hawks<br>So that they cannot strike, hardly can fly.<br>Things are the hawk's food and noble is the mountain, Oh noble<br>Pico Blanco, steep sea wave of marble.<br><br>Originally Published in "Solstice", 1938<br><br>Jeffers is trying to set us on a path to see that this world is beautiful even in the death throes of an animal or in the fall of a civilization or even in the extinction of humanity or of all life on the whole planet. He steps out beyond the anthropocentrism that Aldo Leopold helped to wean us from and keeps right on marching, on out past even the biocentrism of seeing the living parts of the world as the most important. It's a scary journey that very few people in any place and any time seem to attempt.<br><br>Jeffords clearly saw that something was seriously wrong about the way our civilization was trending. He saw us moving toward decline, and not just because of the rise of Fascism and the Great Depression. Now it appears that we have wasted decades without making much progress toward a more sustainable life on the planet and that the decades ahead will see the unraveling of much that we had once thought was permanent and secure. <br><br>It's a great "what if" to ask if Jeffers could have written a poem that would have envisioned the next 10 billion years. If his poems The Beaks of Eagles and Shiva are any indication, then I'd say he could have done it masterfully.<br><br>P.S. Thank you JMG for getting me to read or re-read authors such as Hesiod, Homer, De Tocqueville, and now Jeffers. I will admit that I found E.P. Thompson's "The Making of the English Working Class" (discussed in the comments a while back) pretty tedious, but even in that overly long work there were gems.<br><br><a href=#c3255623781354089360 title="comment permalink">9/7/13, 6:06 PM</a><br><br>

Namely people who suggested that even if they knew with absolute certainty that God existed they wouldn't worship him (To be clear I do not believe in the Christian god), based upon the fact that his behaviour ran counter to their sensibilities. Personally I can't help but feel that the idea that it would be better to burn in hell for all eternity rather than to engage with the universe on its own terms in this hypothetical scenario, is very much related to the idea that people would rather strip mine the planet to the point where even even a decent standard of life is difficult to come by rather than accept that the current levels of extravagance are impossible to maintain.<br><br>@onething<br>As to the matter of our leadership leading people astray. One of the things which I noticed in the left wing alternative media was that it was possible to hear about things like water depletion, the horrible effects of hydraulic fracturing, global warming, and the fact that currently the world's population consumes something like 2 planets a year, even while the majority of the world's population lives in poverty. What I wouldn't hear was things like, we really need to consume less, we have to have a lower standard of living. No in terms of economics they would always be advocating that standards of living had to increase and that we had to get back to "growth". These were not people who were lap dogs of the democratic party. They didn't particularly like Obama. To the best of my knowledge they weren't being financed by shadowy oligarchs. They had all the information they needed to see the direness of the worlds situation, but they still weren't willing to face up to it.<br><br><a href=#c3388877575682725404 title="comment permalink">9/7/13, 10:28 PM</a><br><br>

The notion of a Big Bang was simply extrapolated from the notion of an 'expanding' universe, <br><br>derived from the reddening of spectral lines in distant objects. So epicycles are a good analogy -- ancient <br><br>astronomers observed cycles in the sky and imagined a kind of celestial orrery. 20th century astronomers observed <br><br>the reddening of spectral lines, and ran the clock backwards to arrive at a point source, which must have exploded <br><br>quite violently to get us where we are now. The two explanations are similar in their simplicity. <br><br>Suppose our universe, the one we know, with its four-dimensional fabric of spacetime, is merely a point embedded <br><br>in an indescribably complex multiverse? <br><br>In this multiverse, every possible state of each particle is represented, so that the probabilities of quantum <br><br>mechanics are all covered. This would explain the quantum principle that the observation of a particle makes its <br><br>wave function collapse -- you are merely establishing which branch of the multiverse you are in. <br><br>At a greater distance from our point in the multiverse, are other universes in which the fundamental properties of <br><br>matter and energy are different. So, for example, you have a universe in which beta decay does not occur. That one <br><br>suffers a failure to exist, as all its matter collapses in a useless clot of neutrons. It never launches. Or <br><br>another universe over there, where thermodynamics work differently and would allow for a perpetual motion machine. <br><br>Unfortunately that universe also fails in an early heat death. Sort of a Darwinian winnowing of the unsupportable <br><br>branches of the multiverse. <br><br>... just speculatin' ...<br><br><a href=#c3142385708798209966 title="comment permalink">9/7/13, 10:35 PM</a><br><br>

A notable driver is the ratio of folic acid(prevents birth defects) to vitamin D(also prevents birth defects) in the population's diet - sunlight is needed to produce vitamin D but destroys folic acid. The average Inuit has more melanin than say, the average Swede at the same latitude because the Inuit diet over evolutionary timescales contained more vitamin D and less folic acid than the agricultural diet that swept across Europe thousands of years ago. <br><br>Other notable selection pressures: Humans at higher elevations get less of Earth's atmosphere to protect them against solar radiation, which selects towards darker skin than lower elevations. The closer to the equator you get the darker the skin due to greater concentration of solar radiation.<br><br>Sexual selection does play a part - in many(but not all) societies the powerful classes tend to be slightly lighter than less powerful classes since powerful men tend to marry less powerful women on their physical attractiveness - which in many cases includes lighter skin. Women's skin lightens at puberty to produce extra vitamin D during fetal development and lactation; This dimorphism is often seen as a desirable trait.<br><br><a href=#c6692700630169846736 title="comment permalink">9/7/13, 10:42 PM</a><br><br>

Well worth trying next spring, for those of you who already have appropriate plants growing in your neighborhood."<br><br>This is an interesting topic and highly relative to the project of this blog I think. JMG's love of tea aside.<br><br>Chocolate, coffee, sugar, and tea were actually the perfect drugs for the industrial revolution. We were getting busier, more "efficient," working longer days in less familiar environments, giving naps a miss, and so forth. It made sense in that pattern, and the timing of their arrival on the world stage couldn't have been better.<br><br>Today, there's even more to be done in my opinion, though very few people outside of a few of these blogs seems to understand what those things are. And ultimately it all boils down to work that is a lot more...human, and done by hand. Pushing on through siesta won't be as big a deal I don't think because the work will be more cyclical and less, how should we say, retirement-driven. It'll always be there. There won't be as much getting "that couch thing taken care of," to quote the movie Fight Club.<br><br>So my question is, will the perfect storm of industrial drugs be as important in a de-industrializing future as it has been throughout our lives and careers? I have 10 tea camellias growing in my forest garden, and intend to expand that crop radically over the coming decade, but I don't really drink caffeinated tea. This is purely a cash crop issue, and because I love my wife, who does drink black tea.<br><br>I also carry considerable concern about a demographic of young people growing up in the mountains with fewer job prospects, rampant methamphetamines about, and fillers of their in-between hours like Monster energy drinks, Red Bull, Amp, etc. This seems like a lighter/match scenario to me.

It is suppose to be ok down to Zone 7 and that is what we are, but nights of 28 to 27 d weather is too cold for it and you lose most of the leaves. I'll bring it inside this winter. It is suppose to get more cold tolerant as it gets bigger. I haven't tried to brew any of the leaves yet, but will try in the spring. I'd like it in the ground as a bush (can get 8' high and wide). I got mine from Territorial Seed Co., in OR.

So here. I found it unsurprising, being fairly close to how I've viewed the future myself for some time. Of course, those who read JMGs post are a self-selected sample. I was brought up monotheistic, but have strayed a long ways from that over the almost 40 years since I've set out to find my own way. I've always rejected dualism, it seems, and also am puzzled why so many are obsessed with the issue of consciousness. Whether some of the atoms currently (and fleetingly) part of my body end up in another body seems, should I say, immaterial. We don't worry about our personal existence being finite in space, why is it any different if it is finite in time? But being an, albeit insignificant, part of this grand stream of existence is a comfort.

There are people claiming such around here too (Vermont), and I've heard/seen some flashy presentations. But showing a mass of un-decomposed grass roots after a year or two proves nothing. It's the longer term accumulation that counts, after a steady-state balance develops between the rate of addition of organic material and the rate of decomposition of existing matter. In some special situations decomposition is arrested and you get a peat bog, but in most climates that's not the case. The same holds for the various breathless claims the tree-planting will save us. Even in the areas where human planting of trees matters (the edges between prairie or desert and forest), there is a long-term density of biomass that balances additions and subtractions. So no handwaving please, show me the math.<br><br><a href=#c6795047638424351838 title="comment permalink">9/8/13, 8:14 PM</a><br><br>

You repeat, not infrequently, that there's a lot of work to be done and not a lot of people doing it.<br><br>Brin makes the same point, and his urgency I understand. His is a classic hero journey myth: there's a Great Thing to be accomplished, many obstacles on the path, and the threat of failure at every turn. In real life (or evolution) for every Parsifal who finds the Graal, there are a dozen, or a hundred, or a thousand knights who get caught headfirst in a thicket in the deep woods and are never heard from again. The hero journey myth has the luxury of Author's Omniscience, and can focus with perfect foresight on that one guy who wins the prize, lending his triumph an air of inevitability. So Brin's mythology requires that we strive urgently and sincerely; it also "guarantees" success, because otherwise it's a lousy story (to modern sensibilities -- in Greek tragedy, failure is guaranteed.)<br><br>It seems you are trying to craft a different mythology, a more realistic one, and I'm simply not seeing the urgency in it. It unfolds in its own time.<br><br>Let's focus on a specific item of our culture: music. Let's say that I decide my passion is to preserve the music of Beethoven for the next global civilization.<br><br>I spend my own money (as a passionate hobby) to print up scores of all his works on archival paper with archival ink. I take a few of his best-loved melodies and etch them on glass, and again on stone. I write up a simple primer on our musical notation in a half-dozen languages, and have multiple copies printed on archival paper and bound into volumes. I even transcribe a few recordings onto platinum-coated metal disks, and hand-build cranked Victrolas that will play the recordings. I scatter these in a handful of caves in cool, dry climates around the earth, and found a Secret Society with the charge of preserving the repository locations in coded story form.<br><br>By quirk of fate, all of this actually works, and a growing civilization in what we would call CE 4100 digs up a book written in CE 3500 by some apostate member of my now-disbanded secret society, speculating on a legend that the founding story of the sect is a kind of coded treasure map. Someone goes treasure-hunting, and they find one of the caches.<br><br>The treasure they find? F**** <i>music boxes</i>? In a fit of temper, they torch the whole repository. Or maybe they drag parts of it back to civilization, hoping to make at least whiskey money off it.<br><br>Some fragment of one repository eventually makes its way into the hands of a member of the growing musical tradition of that society. To their ear, Beethoven is overly complex, noisy, and offensively emotional (something that would have been true had you moved Beethoven even a century backward in time, and had you moved it five centuries backward, it would have been banned as diabolical). A few composers adapt one or two of the melodies to "modern" ears. Everything I so laboriously preserved is buried in a museum and forgotten.<br><br>A longish story, the point of which is this: what parts of our culture will the future even <i>want</i>, and what is our purpose in trying to pass it down to them?<br><br>In James Blish's <i>Cities in Flight</i> novellas, the last living members of our dying universe are launched into other dimensions to spawn new universes through Big Bangs. To do so, they have to exterminate another species that is racing to get to the “fulcrum” of our dying universe first. It's clearly an act of reproductive desperation, a naked attempt to compete for dominance and control even in (literally) universal death.<br><br>That's true of all the “expanding through the galaxies” stories: they are merely European imperialism written on the stars. The Egyptians wouldn't have found those stories very inspiring at all. Nor do I any more, though they fascinated me when I was young.<br><br>How much of that is also true of our attempt to “pass on” our culture to the future?<br><br><a href=#c5085882644344930394 title="comment permalink">9/9/13, 10:58 AM</a><br><br>

It was a definite tea spitter! The irony is not lost on me that as a culture here, we have a quite different process. Yep, who would have thought it, that a culture founded initially by convicts would actually end up being quite law abiding? Strange, but I’ve always wondered how elections in your country could possibly lead to court action.<br><br>Back to the topic at hand though. I reckon that you are onto something with this style of essays. People think and act on stories and narratives. That's why I reckon so many people are asleep at the wheel (Cognitive dissonance).<br><br>The real problem becomes though, what happens when the prevailing narrative no longer matches the facts on the ground and yet people still act out their lives upon the dominant story?<br><br>I assume that was what your critical thinking essay sought to address?<br><br>My gut feel says that it is a dangerous situation / time in a culture for the dominant narrative to be incapable of delivering and yet it is repeated at ever louder volumes. The problem is intensified because of the blind acceptance that the current dominant narrative requires, stops people from developing skills such as:<br><br>- how do you even know when things are going wrong?<br><br>- what do you do when things go wrong?<br><br>- Do you have the skills to correct whatever error has occurred?<br><br>- have you allowed enough resources to correct any errors that may occur?<br><br>I could just keep going on and on with questions...<br><br>It reminds me very much of the research that goes on here in the aftermath of a major wildfire. Peoples responses have consistently been evenly distributed amongst the following 3 options:<br><br>- Planned for the eventuality and acted on that plan;<br><br>- Understood the risk and thought about planning for the eventuality but decided to take a "wait and see" approach instead; and<br><br>- No idea.<br><br>I'd like to say I'm making this stuff up, but unfortunately that is the outcome time and time again. It is so consistent that there must be something in it?<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1041243823927423857 title="comment permalink">9/9/13, 7:34 PM</a><br><br>

You are correct that access to modern medicine can be a life or death thing (especially for childbirth and young children) and hence is not comparable to the perks of , say, central heating, flush toilets or driving cars. It is one way though, that the system has got people by the balls (or should I say ovaries?) and prevents them from making significant changes in their own lives. Change involves risk and sacrifice, but it is totally understandable that women of childbearing age are unwilling to take big risks or make big sacrifices.

Thanks for your efforts.<br><br>I don't think we're short of research on the subject matter of natural disasters and peoples responses to those here.

It is simply just too expensive and labour intensive and there are too many people with their fingers in the pie.<br><br>Years back I spoke to the local MP about the issue and was told that people complain when nothing is done, but they also complain when fuel reduction burns are undertaken (apparently children’s birthday parties and washing on the line are a major source of those complaints - true story). <br><br>In the past 6 months after a few wet years (and surviving the past dry, scorcher summer), there has been a perceptible shift in peoples perspectives on the matter here.

Here comes the main dilemma I have perceived...<br><br>I have been irregular commenter to this blog for a while now. With my quite terrible pidgin English I have tried to voice my firm believe that current liberal package of moral codes is totally dependent on expanding, prosperous economy. That if feeling and reality of progressing material wellbeing is taken away, liberal moral code follows into trash bin of history in short notice. <br><br>I have based this opinion on two sources. <br><br>First, my personal experiences about systemic collapse of industrial networks in former Soviet bloc during 90's, where mentioned collapse led eventually to current mood of society where patriarchy, kinship and nationalism are taken very seriously and tolerance towards deviancy is very limited. This mood is comig from grassroots level, I remind you, it is not force-fed by Powers That Be from above. Pussy Riot incident is good example of that, Mr. Putin probably saved the group of university intellectuals from far worse fate in hands of common people by throwing them into the jail. <br><br>Secondly, on my reading of history, where danger of insufficient resources and violence (pretty much all history before Industrial Revolution's second phase) has led to human societies which are conformist and narrow-minded, if measured by standards of modern liberals.<br><br>These are not my preferences but observations, which I have made after spending huge amount of time with people from backgrounds with no exposure to Western indoctrination about morality and ethics. I have heard it all said in loud without any memorized self-shame: Elders of Zion conspiracy revisited, that female's plave is between stove and fist if she does not behave, that dark-skinned Caucasians are vicious breed of untermensch. These have not been opinions coming from marigins of society, but opinions that engineers, civil servants and welldoing small-scale shopkeepers have voiced after vodka glass or two without any shame or hesitation. This scenario is utterly outside any imaginable in the current Western society, and while trying to describe how wild mood changes you experience just by travelling outside your own culture's borderland, you probably just agitate persons so immersed in their own cultural narrative that they do not see it's limited sphere of influence. It is not about MY opinions, but observed facts about huge cultural gaps between moods of even Indo-European nations.<br><br>Now, it seems to me that among JMG readers there is faction of people that subscribes his vison about huge population decline during current century, but at the same time have instinctive dislike against anyone that points out that just maybe this kind of future scenario does not hold change for current mix of Western morality (sentimentalism, feminism, multiculturalism, pluralism, racial diversity without subordination)to survive. <br><br>In the Europe last big fall in population was during Little Ice Age from 1600's onwards. That development led among others to horrible wars (Thirty Years War, anyone?), general hysteria against witchcraft, tightening of moral code, subordination of female gender when compared to Late Middle Ages. World War Two was nothing compared to good old 17th century, if you look demographics. Little Ice Age is last historical event in Europe that truly measures against scenario JMG describes, and fall of Soviet bloc is only known internal breakdown of advanced industrial system known in human history. In both cases, current package of Western morality had no more change to survive than snowball has in the flames of Hell. <br><br>So I throw ball to you folks who believe that mankind can both collapse and maintain it's Western morality inherited from distant forebears of Sixties hippie generation. How you are going to do it? And while wondering that question, remeber that shooting the messenger does not solve the underlying problem.<br><br><a href=#c6222276011394165838 title="comment permalink">9/10/13, 5:34 AM</a><br><br>

I think you might find them enjoyable.<br><br>Speaking of books, I was delighted to find the paperback of "Blood of the Earth" at good old Magus Books in Minneapolis. We have a new anarchist bookstore in town, Boneshaker Books (named after a type of bike, apparently), and when I ordered "Green Wizardry" from them they told me they were so intrigued by it that they ordered copies for the shelf.

I think I read the whole thing with a goofy grin on my face.<br><br>I've been darting in and out trying to balance work in the garden (just planted Swiss Chard, it grows all winter long here) and keeping up with this delightful and surprising discussion. David Brin, seriously?! I loved "The Postman" and had no idea he was so deeply into techno-cornocopianism.<br><br>Regarding Corvids, sometimes I feel like they've been mocking me my whole life. The fact that they live so happily around humans and have prospered from our activities seems to predict greater things for them. Last winter a crow decided to dive upon and "swoop" my wife five or six times as she walked one block to work. This was the middle of winter, so no nesting activities or young to be protected, I cant figure out why...they must be panning something big.<br><br>Cherokee Organics, I've really enjoyed your posts over the years! I like how after addressing the theme of JMG's topic you always give an update on your farm activities, keep it up!<br><br>Regarding growing tea and coffee, I'm a professional gardener here in the Seattle area on Puget Sound, and Camellia sinensis grows easily in this climate. Minimum winter temperatures here (lately!) range in the high to low teens Fahrenheit. After mild winters (high teens F) the plants are completely undamaged. After a winter with temps in the low teens F, the plants definitely have some damage but grow back vigorously in spring. Coffea arabica on the other hand is not even close to being hardy here. If you are unsuccessful with tea but are able to grow coffee, hardiness to winter cold probably is not the issue. I'm sure there are many factors relating to your "down under" climate that are unfamiliar to me.<br><br>Now of course as you know there is always a wide range of hardiness within a given species depending on where the parentage originated and human selection for hardiness. The tea plants grown here are undoubtedly selected for increased hardiness to cold. Perhaps also there are coffee varieties that I am unaware of that have been selected/developed for increased cold hardiness? I Don't know.<br><br>Time to go out and collect coriander (cilantro) seed.

I live in a part of the U.S. where the politics are decidedly conservative -- our local rural government is essentially an evangelical theocracy that is only kept in check by state and federal laws. But on the other hand I see how in actual interpersonal interactions all these ideologies go out the window, and decent people are treated decently no matter what their religion or politics, by and large. I also should note that I did NOT find this to be the case in (more affluent and theoretically less conservative) Colorado, where if someone hated your politics, sexuality, or religion, they also hated you, yourself, as a person. Here they just feel sorry for the "fact" that you are going to hell. <br><br>There are certainly many example of the sorts of things you describe, present and past. But I wonder if pervasive structural oppression requires large-scale social organization? What is likely to follow the fading to the fossil fuel era is much smaller scale social organization. Some pre-feudal societies of 1st Millennium Europe appear to have given women more freedom than the more complex Feudal societies did, for example. I believe tribal societies vary greatly between each other when it comes to these things . So I am not sure we really can just extrapolate from what Russians say and do now, in a very early post-peak (and still completely fossil-fuel-based) industrial society, to guess what it might be like in 200 or 500 years.<br><br><a href=#c909580843402150109 title="comment permalink">9/10/13, 2:55 PM</a><br><br>

I mean, they can’t even push through and implement their signature domestic policy initiative, Obamacare, without completely bollixing it up in the process. Moreover, it’s not just Obama; it’s the rest of these idiots and numbskulls on his foreign policy team, including John Kerry, Susan Rice and Samantha Power, all of whom and their boss have proven time and time again that running the foreign and national security policy of a great power is completely beyond their level of ability. And that’s not counting the stupidity, corruption, dereliction of duty and irresponsibility that has become the order of the day in Congress. This is beyond belief. Unlike many on the Right, I don’t subscribe to the view that Obama and his team are part of some vast, subversive conspiracy to subvert the United States. Rather, these people are exactly what they appear to be: a bunch of inept fools, incompetent hacks and arrogant half-wits with overinflated egos who are way out of their league and don’t have a clue. You would at least expect that someone who could slither his way to the top of the Chicago political machine would be more intelligent and competent. Judging from the quality of its leaders, America must really be slipping. Wow!!!!!<br><br>Meanwhile, Obama’s Minister of Propaganda, David Axelrod, jumped the shark once more again with another tweet. <br><br>http://twitchy.com/2013/09/09/david-axelrod-credits-obamas-credible-but-unbelievably-small-threat-for-possible-syria-deal/<br><br>It’s hard to tell whether this guy is a shameless liar, completely delusional or a combination of both. Too bad we’re stuck with such nincompoops for the next three years. There’s something seriously wrong with this country when it entrusts the leadership of the nation to such people as Obama, Axelrod, Pelosi and Kerry. As I’ve said before, these clowns make George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz look like strategic geniuses by comparison. This whole comedy of errors would be hilariously funny if it weren’t such a fiasco for the nation and the rest of the world.

Given that we have recently started to understand evolution and also genetics and biochemistry and genetic engineering we soon should be able to master these disciplines fully to create post humans. In other words take control of evolution and its processes and mechanisms and more rapidly evolve (more rapidly than in another 100,000 years which is roughly the length of time from when homo sapiens came into being as a mutation of some earlier human species) a brand new human species which could be called "homo sapiens authenticus". This new name would distinguish it from the current homo sapiens "non sapiens" or homo sapiens baloney. That new post-homo sapiens "homo sapiens authenticus" would have a negligible reptilian brain a much more developed frontal cortex and would be much more in conscious control of itself than homo sapiens. It also would have a far greater perspective and understanding of itself as a conscious biological evolving entity than homo sapiens has. <br><br>But even without our own conscious role in evolution playing any role, the "normal" Darwinian ++ ongoing evolution of the human species is very likely to continue. So the human species of a million years from now, if any survives at all, is going to resemble us probably about as much as we resemble humanoids of a million years ago? And will resemble us far less than we resemble Neanderthals which are almost "tit for tat" the same as "homo sapiens baloney" I don't know exactly how long it took in the past for successive species of humans to evolve from earlier ones. But I am sure somebody more or less knows this. What I am suggesting is that this is going to continue at about the same speed and we may even start to play a conscious role in accelerating the process. <br><br>Not to even mention the obvious idea that if we cannot adapt the universe to ourselves, perhaps it may be easier to adapt ourselves to the universe?<br><br>Or maybe we can only think of that once homo sapiens authenticus fully evolves from homo sapiens baloney?<br><br><a href=#c1380121350874468199 title="comment permalink">10/21/13, 4:10 AM</a><br><br>

Is it an extinction-new species cycle, or an evolution of current species into forms that adapt to their own biological environment, but eventually are removed enough to count as a new species. Also, somehow, even with a gulf between two consecutive species, I hope to imagine that a species will leave behind some signs, clues and chunks of their legacy of technological advances.

Thinking into the future isn't easy, and is almost always wrong, but it can shed light on where other's heads are at in terms of what humans truly represent as a species~ how important they really are in the 'grand scheme' of evolution. <br><br>However, there is one subject that makes me wince a bit~ the one of climate change. Of course, the climate has been changing throughout geologic time according to our best efforts at interpreting proxy data, and it will no doubt continue to change into the future, but I honestly don't see any good evidence that human activity has any measurable effect on climate. In forecasting the future, I see no reason why the earth would deviate from the glaciation cycles of its more immediate geologic past. If the glaciation (ice age) cycle holds, we are due for the next one, as we are currently near the statistical end of an interglacial period. I would imagine that the 'near term' future (+100,000 years or so) would be dominated by severe cooling, not warming. There is evidence that sea levels have been much lower than they are today~ undersea ruins on the continental shelf for example, but scant evidence of sea levels being much higher than they are currently, and that is with proxy data indicating that co2 levels were as high as 8000 parts per million in the past. I'm not posting this to argue. I'm sure many will take offense with this post, but it is only intended as another point of view. How the future plays out will determine who was right or wrong. Anthropogenic Climate Change has become a religious topic~ an anathema to the religious sensibility of progress. I can find no one who takes peak oil seriously whom does not believe in the actuality of Anthropogenic Climate Change. Why are the two so intertwined? That is a good question to explore, because science favors one, and newspaper headlines favor the other.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c5353068574704419682 title="comment permalink">3/20/14, 2:51 PM</a><br><br>
