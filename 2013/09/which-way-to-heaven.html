The religious sensibilities I’ve been discussing in recent posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> have an interesting property: they’re hard to define with any degree of precision, but remarkably easy to recognize in practice. It’s a little like the old joke about how you know that an elephant’s gotten into your refrigerator; like the telltale footprints in the butter dish, the traces left by a given religious sensibility are hard to miss.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The sensibility that seized the imagination of the western world after 600 BCE, and has begun to lose its grip only in our time, is no exception to this rule. I’ve already talked about its distinctive central theme, the passionate insistence that human beings deserve more than nature, history, and the human condition are prepared to give them, and that there must be some way to escape from the trammels of humanity’s ordinary existence and break free into infinity and eternity. There are plenty of other tracks in the butter dish of western culture, for that matter, but the one I want to discuss this week is as simple as it is revealing: the spatial direction in which, according to the sensibility we’re discussing, the way out of the human condition is most likely to be found</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To the cultures of the modern west, it seems self-evident that the only possible location for heaven is “up there,” and plenty of people assume that that’s universal among human beings. It isn’t, not by a long shot. To the ancient Greeks, for example, the gods and goddesses lived in various corners of the world—some of them lived on Mount Olympus, a midsized mountain in Thessaly, but Poseidon was normally to be found in the ocean, Pan in the woodlands of Arcadia, Hades in the underworld, and so on; when Zeus wanted to hold a council, he had to send a god or goddess around to summon them all to Olympus. In Shinto, the polytheist religion of Japan, some of the kami—the divine powers of Shinto—live in <i>Takama no Hara</i>, the Plain of High Heaven, but others dwell on earth, and every year in the month corresponding to October, they all travel to the Izumo shrine in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>western Japan and are not to be found elsewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The old Irish paradise, Tir na nOg, was on the sea floor of the Atlantic somewhere off west of Ireland—well, I could go on for quite some time with comparable examples.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Within the sensibility that’s now fading out across the western world, by contrast, the route to heaven was by definition a line pointing straight up from the Earth’s surface. I want to stress here that this is part of the religious sensibility of an age—that is, a pattern of emotions and images in the collective imagination—rather than a necessary part of the theist and civil religions that existed in that setting and thus were shaped by that sensibility. It’s not too hard, in fact, to find ways in which the teachings of these religions were manhandled, sometimes very roughly, to make room in them for the images and emotions that the sensibility of the age demanded. </div>

<a href=../../img/jesus-f5b3c6-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 src=../../img/jesus-f5b3c6-g95.jpg></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here’s an example. In the New Testament, the two gospels that describe what later came to be called the Ascension of Jesus describe the event in very simple terms; Mark says “he was received up into heaven” (Mark 16:19), and Luke says “he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven” (Luke 24:51). Those Christian friends of mine who know their way around theology assure me that heaven is a wholly spiritual state or condition of being, which is no more above the earth than it is, say, northeast of Las Vegas. The pressure exerted by the religious sensibility of the last two millennia, though, was such that the Ascension has nearly always been portrayed in art as an exercise in levitation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This has not uncommonly been taken in a very literal manner. It so happens, for example, that Christian symbolism plays a central role in some of the higher degrees of Freemasonry, and members of one of those degrees thus celebrate an Ascension Day service annually. Here at the Cumberland Masonic lodge, there’s an extraordinary early 20th century trompe l’oeil painting, which is hidden away behind another piece of symbolic art, and uncovered for the Ascension Day service and certain other functions. It’s a landscape view of Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives; the Temple is below, with the rest of the city around it, and the Judean landscape reaching away into the distance. The foreground scene on the Mount of Olives is painted on a piece of metal, a little in front of the canvas background, and there are clouds handled the same way at the top of the painting. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There in front, on the Mount of Olives, Jesus stands among his disciples. At the right moment of the ceremony, one of the brethren pulls on a hidden string, and the figure of Jesus rises up from the circle of disciples and soars slowly into the air, rising straight up until he’s lost to sight behind the clouds. It’s a remarkably powerful image, you can hardly help imagining the disciples staring openmouthed at the miracle, and people down below in the streets of Jerusalem catching a glimpse of the sight and thinking, good heavens, that looks like a man rising up into the sky! </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I don’t know of a better example of the way the collective imagination of the modern world shifted gears when Sputnik I broke free of the atmosphere and opened the Space Age. Until then, the top of the atmosphere might as well have been a sheet of iron, as the Egyptians thought it was. (Their logic was impeccable: polished iron is blue, and so is the sky; iron is strong and heatproof, and the sky would need to be both in order to support the boat named Millions of Years on which Ra the sun god does his daily commute; besides, the only iron they knew came from meteorites, which they sensibly interpreted as stray chunks of sky that had fallen to earth. Many of our theories about nature will likely seem much less reasonable from the perspective of the far future.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s an extraordinary experience to go back and read what sensible people in the first half of the 20th century thought of the claims then being retailed by the small minority who dreamed of going to the Moon and the other planets. Outer space—take a moment to think about the implications of that conventional phrase!—was to most people an abstraction, not a place, and when the Moon and Mars weren’t just lights in the sky, they served as convenient new labels for fairyland. Equally, the idea that human machines or human beings, might someday pop through the atmosphere into that “space outside” was raw material for fairy tales. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor were the fairy tales slow to appear. <a href=../../2011/08/way-future-wasnt.html>An earlier post here</a> explored the extraordinary role that science fiction played in shaping the collective imagination of our age, even when it was considered the last word in lowbrow reading.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The civil religion of progress, as I suggested in last week’s post, needed a mythic image of salvation from nature, history, and the human condition before it could break loose from the competition and become the established religion of our time; science fiction provided that, and in the process underwent a massive transformation of its own. Until the early 1940s, science fiction was still what it had been in the time of H.G. Wells and Jules Verne, a literature that explored the whole gamut of imaginable technological advances; thereafter, it fixated more and more precisely on one specific suite of imagined technologies and the central image around which they clustered. </div>

<div class=MsoNormal>
The close similarity between this image and the one shown earlier in this post, I’d like to suggest, is no accident. As pointed out in
<a href=../../2013/04/the-religion-of-progress.html>an earlier post in this sequence</a>, civil religions derive their core imagery and emotional tone from the theist religions they replace, and the image of man’s ascension into space took on the same role in the religion of progress that Jesus’ ascension into heaven has in Christianity. What SF writer Arthur C. Clarke called, in the title of a hugely popular nonfiction book of his, <i>The Promise of Space</i> was the precise equivalent—or as precise an equivalent as a materialist and anthropolatrous civil religion could manage—to the promise of salvation at the heart of Christian faith. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Listen to those of today’s cornucopian true believers who don’t simply put their faith in the endless prolongation of business as usual, and it’s rarely difficult to hear the ringing voice of the Christian evangelist coming through the verbiage about limitless energy sources, new worlds for mankind, and the rest of it. How many times, dear reader, have you heard the great leap upward into space described as humanity’s mission, its destiny, even its sole excuse for existing in the first place? How many times have you read enthusiastic claims about space-based manufacturing, orbital colonies and the like that assume as a matter of course that benefits will outweigh costs and difficulties will inevitably be overcome, because, well, going into space is humanity’s mission, its destiny, etc.? Let’s just say that if you write a blog that asks hard questions about the mythology of progress, you can count on fielding outraged comments along these lines several times a week from now until star date fill-in-the-blank. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now it so happens that there’s a very good reason to doubt these claims, and in particular to challenge the notion that orbital colonies, settlements on Mars, and the rest of it will inevitably prosper if we just find the quadrillions of dollars necessary to pay for them and the infrastructure necessary to build them in the first place. In an article published in
<i>Nature</i> in 1997, a team of economists headed by Robert Costanza set out to calculate how much value is contributed to the global economy by the Earth’s natural systems; their midrange estimates works out to an annual contribution roughly three times the size of the world’s gross domestic product. Put another way, of every dollar’s worth of goods and services consumed by human beings each year, around 75 cents are provided free of charge by nature, and only 25 cents have to be paid for by human economic activity. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That immense contribution to human well-being—call it the “biosphere dividend”—isn’t available anywhere else in the solar system. (Even if Titan, say, has a biosphere of its own, its version of that dividend will apply only to life forms who enjoy sipping liquid methane and gazing at the bright orange sky on a balmy —290<span style="font-family: Tahoma">°</span>F. afternoon, not to human beings.) Here on Earth, human beings get air to breathe, water to drink, shelter from radiation, topsoil in which to grow crops, and a dizzying array of other goods and services at no charge from the planetary system; anywhere else, all these things have to be provided by human labor, and require constant inputs of resources that human beings must also provide. That burden somehow gets left out of the sort of glowing rhetoric so often circulated among true believers in progress—one of many examples of the remarkable blindness to the economics of complex technology I’ve discussed here <a href=../../2013/08/the-ritual-theater-of-progress.html>in several posts already</a>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Such arguments have little impact on those who believe. Still, civil religions are considerably more vulnerable to disproof than the theist religions they supplant, in that they belong wholly to the world of ordinary experience, and are far more difficult to uphold in the face of ordinary experience than their theist cousins. When advances in rocket science made it impossible to ignore the fact that what was up there above the clouds had nothing in common with heaven, Christians all over the industrial world recalled that most schools of Christian theology define heaven, as already noted, as a spiritual state or condition rather than a physical place at high altitude. Long-established habits of thought had to be changed, to be sure, but those habits didn’t touch the core commitments of the faith. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The civil religion of progress didn’t have the same advantage, since its core commitments were supposed to manifest in the world of ordinary experience, not in a spiritual condition inaccessible to any eyes but those of faith. Once the religion of progress embraced the fairy-tale logic of science fiction and set out, like Jack climbing the beanstalk, to find the giant’s palace of its dreams somewhere up there in the sky, it was vulnerable to catastrophic disproof—and catastrophic disproof is what it got, too, though I’m not at all sure the believers have yet noticed just what it was that hit them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The vulnerability here was precisely its dependence on borrowed imagery from the theist faiths it supplanted. Decades of science fiction primed the collective imagination of the western world to see the ascent from earth to space as an ascension from earth to heaven, a passage out of ordinary reality into something wholly other—even if that “wholly other” too often consisted of nothing better than the sort of tacky adventure-fantasy so many SF authors splashed across a galaxy of forgettable imaginary worlds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The torrent of propaganda and pageantry the United States invested in the Space Race against Russia helped feed the sense of expectancy, and brought it to a climax that summer day in 1969 when Neil Armstrong stepped down a spidery ladder onto the surface of the Moon. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
After the speeches and the TV specials and the ticker-tape parades were done with, though, something very different began to whisper through the crawlspaces of the industrial world’s collective imagination—something that could be summed up fairly neatly as “Was that all?” We went to the Moon, not once but repeatedly, and every trip made it harder to ignore the fact that the Moon wasn’t wholly other at all. It wasn’t fairyland. It was monotonous gray desert without air, water or life, and the only thing you could see there that was of interest to anybody but a handful of scientists was the extraordinary blue-and-white sphere of Earth hanging motionless in the black and starless sky.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>

</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To make matters worse, that’s more or less what orbiters and landers found everywhere else in the solar system, too. Mars, the scene of countless fantasies since the dawn of science fiction, turned out to have a remarkable resemblance to the less interesting corners of Nevada, without even the rattlesnakes and poisonous scorpions to lend a bit of human interest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Every world in the solar system that human spacecraft reached offered the same less than overwhelming spectacle: sand, scattered rocks, and basically nothing else. Even if Mars had turned out to have some analogue of blue-green algae huddled on the underside of the occasional damp rock, even if the Huygens lander on Titan had spotted unmistakably biological growths basking in the dim glow from the distant sun, a few space missions and a few more National Geographic specials later, the same reaction would inevitably have followed, because the emotions and fantasies that gathered around the promise of space had nothing to do with what was actually out there in the solar system, and everything to do with images and ideas of salvation and transcendence that had been surreptitiously borrowed from older theist religions. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The drawback to that borrowed imagery is that you can’t actually transcend nature, history and the human condition by riding a rocket to the Moon, to Mars, or even to some hypothetical exoplanet circling Proxima Centauri, any more than you can do it by riding a cross-country bus to Nevada. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Ironically, a close reading of science fiction could have warned of that well in advance; the sense of wonder and exaltation that came to early readers of the genre as they read of voyages to the Moon soon palled, and had to be rekindled with ever more elaborate journeys to ever more distant worlds, until finally characters in SF novels were voyaging across multiple universes in an effort to give readers the same rush they got in Verne’s time from a simple trip in a balloon. That’s what happens when you try to make a quantitative difference fill in for a qualitative one, and use mere distance or size as a surrogate for a change in the essential character of existence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To return to an image introduced earlier in this essay, it’s rather as though some misguidedly materialist believer in the Ascension had convinced himself that heaven really was somewhere up there in the upper atmosphere, and worked out some way to copy those artistic depictions and levitate straight up into the air from the Mount of Olives. His disciples would no doubt have stared with equal awe as he rose into the clouds, and there might well have been people down below on the streets of Jerusalem who caught a glimpse of the sight and thought, good heavens, there goes another one! </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s what follows, though, that makes the difference. According to Christian tradition, the Ascension ended with Jesus being received into heaven and taking his throne on the right hand of God the Father. For our imaginary imitator, of course, no such welcome would await. Somewhere above 8,000 feet, altitude sickness would cut in; somewhere above that, depending on the weather, frostbite; above 26,000 feet, the oxygen content of the air is too low to support human life, and death from anoxia would follow if hypothermia hadn’t gotten there first. If nothing interrupted the ascent, the planet’s already substantial collection of orbiting space junk would shortly thereafter be enriched by the addition of a neatly freeze-dried corpse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All metaphors aside, it’s rarely if ever a good idea to try to take a vision of transcendence and enact it in the world of matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That effort is the stock in trade of civil religions, which tend to emerge in ages that have lost the capacity to believe in transcendence but still have the emotional needs once met by the theist religions of their cultures, and it accounts for the way civil religions have of failing catastrophically when their efforts to act out simulacra of transcendence collide with the awkward realities of the world as it is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The implosion of the civil religion of Communism thus promptly followed the collision between fantasies of the Worker’s Paradise and the bleak bureaucratic reality of the Eastern Bloc nations; the implosion of the civil religion of Americanism is taking place right now as a consequence of the collision between what America thinks it stands for and what it’s all too plainly become; and the implosion of the civil religion of progress is arguably not too far off, as the gaudy dream of infinite knowledge and power through technology slams face first into the hard limits of a finite planet and a solar system uninterested in fueling human fantasies. </div>

The Second Religiosity is not the same as the First, and not uncommonly rises out of a different religious sensibility than its predecessor. How that might work out over the decades and centuries ahead is a complex question; we’ll begin discussing it next week. </span></div>

There is something very distinct about your ability to clear up the fine distinctions that separate such abstract concepts. Reductionist science would say you have more attention and control of low level processing due to Aspergers syndrome.

If I understand correctly from psychology and neurology, the brain contains a filter mechanism.

The idea being you will see the animal tracks you need to find food and ignore the undulating brightness of light as the sun rolls over clouds of different thicknesses. I am wondering if these spiritual cycles within cultures are a reflection our filters in our minds reaching critical numbness to materialism, progress and reductionism and finding beautiful novelty in spirituality.

I thought you'd like this, which is from Wittgenstein's On Certainty, section 108: "But is there then no objective truth? Isn't it true, or false, that someone has been on the moon?" If we are thinking within our system, then it is certain that no one has ever been on the moon. Not merely is nothing of the sort ever seriously reported to us by reasonable people, but our whole system of physics forbids us to believe it. For this demands answers to the questions "How did he overcome the force of gravity?" "How could he live without an atmosphere?" and a thousand others which could not be answered. But suppose that instead of all these answers we met the reply: "We don't know how one gets to the moon, but those who get there know at once that they are there; and even you can't explain everything." We should feel ourselves intellectually very distant from someone who said this.<br><br><a href=#c4487607349447174283 title="comment permalink">9/26/13, 3:25 AM</a><br><br>

That may be the case today, but it was not the case for the New Testament writers. Their understanding of the cosmos was indeed that there was a physical 'roof' in the sky, and that there was a hatchway through which Jesus passed in order to - physically - sit at the right hand of God. Paula Gooder has written a good recent book about this (called 'Heaven').<br><br>More broadly, I know you don't want to talk about astrology much here, but I can't help but see the passage from Pisces to Aquarius behind much of what you are describing. In other words, the whole emphasis upon "salvation" is now passing away (in just the same way as the Aries emphasis upon the warrior, eg Achilles, passed away before). It's not yet clear to me what emphasis will replace it - obviously there will still be a human concern with 'salvation' just as there remains a human concern with what it is to be a warrior - but I think it will be to do with coming to terms with our individuality over against being caught up in the mass, what it means to actually be a human being and so on.<br>Loving this theme of your recent posts. I'll go back to lurking now.<br><br><a href=#c1870604467500549616 title="comment permalink">9/26/13, 3:29 AM</a><br><br>

All pretty obvious when stated plainly as such. <br><br>The most important part I would like to focus on however is this portion: "Here on Earth, human beings get air to breathe, water to drink, shelter from radiation, topsoil in which to grow crops, and a dizzying array of other goods and services at no charge from the planetary system; anywhere else, all these things have to be provided by human labor, and require constant inputs of resources that human beings must also provide."<br><br>I want to focus on this b/c when I think of this/these simple facts (life-sustaining services at NO CHARGE) I actually get angry. I get real angry and here is why. In this day and age these free services have been stolen from us, the way I look at it. We have been separated from our landbase and forced to pay for lesser quality versions of these items.<br><br>Think about how crazy it is that in modern society you have to pay simply to exist on this earth. There are no "free" places to stay anymore. You have to pay a rent or mortgage or something like it just to live on this earth. And once, not long ago, you could live wild and free on this earth..........this has been stolen from us and much as I hate to ruin everyone's mellow I think we all should be very angry.

This post made me think about permaculture as a vision of transcendence. I sometimes have what I'd call permaculture daydreams -- the idea that I can design and manage the garden so it requires almost no work, and is fruitful. In practice the opposite seems to be the case -- mostly I get results from gardening proportional to the amount of trouble and effort I put in. The idea of a fruitful garden without any work is so tempting. I'm still inspired by Masanobu Fukuoka's work for example but now I can see how much it is the result of much hard work rather than a way to avoid that (!)<br><br>Looking a bit deeper into that idea of transcendence I suspect this particular vision of heaven has to do with my Quaker religious context. As I understand it this means each of us is responsible for getting right with respect to the divine power, and this connection then will to give us the power to do right in the world. So the direction of heaven there I suppose is heart-centred, moving outwards. Seems to require continuous work, not least in addressing my own character and weaknesses. I am trying to apply this understanding to the ecological community in the garden though.<br><br>Also, I am now inclined to believe your identification of progress as a governing myth as having tried out <a href=../../2013/07/held-hostage-by-progress.html#c527900193020950811 rel=nofollow>the experiment proposed some time ago</a> on various progressives I have encountered, it's scary how much the mention of progress seems to be an instant convincer.<br><br><a href=#c1408093048797823695 title="comment permalink">9/26/13, 4:44 AM</a><br><br>

Is it just a coincidence that energy really does ascend (radiate away) and escape into space when it's done being caught up in our earthly concerns?<br><br>Of all the "new life and new civilizations" encountered by the crew of the starship Enterprise, the ones represented as the most advanced, the most aspirational, are "beings of pure energy." (And how does the Enterprise get there to meet them? A matter-anti-matter reactor; that is, turning matter into energy.) That's the direction of heaven: becoming energy, escaping rock and muck and ashes and flesh. This idea (despite contradicting some Christian doctrines of resurrection of the body) is everywhere. Even Yoda gets in on the act: "Luminous beings we are, not this crude matter."<br><br>But energy, by itself, is also crude. In medicine, despite many hopes, no novel form of bulk undirected energy (such as UV light, electricity, or radioactivity) proved any more a panacea than did balancing the humors. Electricity (despite Frankenstein) and radiation (despite Godzilla) aren't really sufficient to bring monsters to life. A being of "pure energy" would instantly radiate away into nothing, unless part of its energy could condense into some sort of dynamically stable structure -- and when energy does that, we call it matter.<br><br>This could be a clue to one possible nature or core model for the new sensibility as energy seems to be for the current one. Not another flip of the binary back to "crude" matter and the inertness or at best monotonous identically repeating cycles traditionally ascribed to it, but a turn away from the matter-energy binary. (Although matter will be rehabilitated, so to speak, along the way.)<br><br>That direction is pattern. Language and music and genome. Aperiodicity, evolution, complexity, memory. Our version of chaos: not formlessness but form without formula. Within the predictable cycles of the seasons and (material) heavens, the unpredictable weather. The concept is hardly new, but relatively recent scientific models (e.g. in biochemistry, genetics, and neurology) of how much of life can be understood as rooted in dynamic patterns, arrangements of matter that minutely direct the flow of energy, arrangements of energy that carry meaning and imprint themselves upon matter, make it more compelling.<br><br>Or maybe I'm just biased toward that concept because that's what I've modeled my own religious sensibility on for many years now.<br><br><a href=#c7373213559409282314 title="comment permalink">9/26/13, 7:51 AM</a><br><br>

And, yes, science fiction carried that gospel. As I'm sure you've noticed there are other modes, equally, if not more important. For example, the idea of subservience and submission is also a major part of the old/current religious sensibility. <br><br>I find it interesting that although the civil religion of Progress doesn't advertise docile submission in its propaganda (or overtly in its s.f. gospels), in practice it nevertheless manages to have people participate in their own subservience pretty consistently.<br><br>Some would say that’s the whole point of these rocket ships. For malcontents agitating for something better, it’s easy to see how the escape hatches (whether space, amazing grace, workers’ paradise, or whatever) serve as a sop for acceptance of oppression and eternally deferred promises. <br><br>But there’s more to it. In the US at least we’ve also built up a tremendous mythic edifice of the Expert and the Meritocracy to keep people (and countries and institutions) working hard in systems that are designed to their disadvantage. Rather than saints, gods and angels we are meant to admire and defer to those who “succeed” in the meritocracy. It’s a sprawling (religious) idea that is clearly intermeshed with Progress and has been applied to power and submission at every level from your petty boss to the “development” of nations to biological evolution, race relations and everything else where we want to pretend that a hierarchy is just and right and functional.<br><br>I guess my assertion here would be that if you took as your starting point faith-in-meritocracy rather than faith-in-progress you would cover a good deal of the same ground that you’ve covered in your essays, but you would also cover some very different, interesting, complementary terrain as well. Not only would your concept of a (durable, yet threatened) religious sensibility still be at the center, but the same growing cracks and crises of credibility are there as well.<br><br><br><a href=#c5490482769763253081 title="comment permalink">9/26/13, 8:47 AM</a><br><br>

One of the problems with the sort of abstract numerical thinking cultivated in the sciences is that it gets in the way of maintaining any kind of sense of proportion!<br><br>Flute, exactly -- that's why the whole Biosphere II business, which was launched with such fanfare, vanished from the media when it became embarrassingly clear that it wasn't working. <br><br>Compound F, you'll find them all neatly laid out <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/G/Green-Wizardry rel=nofollow>here</a>. <br><br>Mr. O., bingo. I've never understood why Leary was taken as seriously as he was; so much of his thinking, like the SMI2LE thing, was warmed over pop culture of the most vacuous sort. <br><br>Onion, oh, that's rich. Of course the Randroids are insisting that we haven't had "real capitalism" yet; all their rhetoric is simply the rhetoric of Communism with the signs reversed, and Communists have been excusing the failure of their ideology by saying "we haven't had real communism yet" for decades now. <br><br>Raven, the spiraling collapse of belief in the civil religion of Americanism is a major fact of our time, and promises to lead in some very troubling directions -- more on this as we proceed. <br><br>Sam, thanks for the Wittgenstein quote! As for the interpretation of the Ascension, granted, it will have been understood in the early Christian era in terms of the physics of that time, which mapped theological concepts onto physical space with ruthless consistency; my point was simply that that isn't essential to the Christian faith, while a civil religion doesn't have anywhere else to turn. <br><br>John, Sweaterman, Unknown, and Alex, I hadn't seen that!

What our society regulates by money, others have regulated by tribal custom, feudal tenure, or other means.

The idea being you will see the animal tracks you need to find food and ignore the undulating brightness of light as the sun rolls over clouds of different thicknesses.

There is the grand epoch that began, say 600 BC, and perhaps sooner with agriculture - stretching back even 5000 years. There is the rise of industrialism 200 years ago or so. There is the rise of colonialism/ Americanism preceding industrialism by about a century. There is also the rise of rationalism that it seems began probably around 1250 AD, reached a kind of pinnacle in 1500s 1600s, bore its fruit in the industrial revolution, and has reached its limits. <br><br>What is so curious is the sensation we have now of being at the first rising of civilization (taking the long view back to the agricultural revolution), as though there were no prior civilizations. It does not seem that there were ever those of our kind - ones that left such a material mark on the world. But if one looks to many of the traditions in the east, it is said there were older civilizations, perhaps many. I understand it is a topic you've discussed elsewhere: the subject of Atlantis.<br><br>It seems a corollary of the present hubris that to admit the possibility of ancient, in some ways more advanced, civilizations, is really just a kind of magical thinking, new agey, drug-induced nuttiness.<br><br>But to point out that the amount of sugars and fats the average American consumes as a result of the conversion of oil, coal, natural gas into cows, pigs, corn syrup, and soybean oil - is very much like drug abuse... just returns perplexed stares and grimaces, and a return to chomping the fatburger.<br><br>If the mental framework is as important as it appears to be upon digging through all the fallacies people take for granted even tho reality stares them in the face, it would certainly seem that other kinds of civilization, not so hell-bent on material mastery of the world, might not only be possible, but preferable. Admittedly that is vague, but I mean deep and strong spiritual sciences. In a way, it is just as powerful to need not much from the material world, as it is to have much control over the material world.<br><br><a href=#c683428510249884928 title="comment permalink">9/26/13, 11:54 AM</a><br><br>

If human life happens to be meaningless, it cannot be rendered meaningful through extension in time, through procreation.<br><br>We might apply such a Frankelian analysis to JMG's account, a couple of weeks ago, of the future of our biosphere. If, speaking hypothetically, the spiritual life of <i>Homo sapiens</i>, as a symbol-making and tool-making species, happens to be meaningless, it cannot acquire meaning by being prolonged (contrary to the careers of most other macroscopic fauna species) for hundreds of millions of years. Nor can it under this hypothesis acquire meaning by being repeated, with feathers in lieu of hair, through the eventual appearance in Earth's evolving biosphere of symbol-making, tool-making, Moon-visiting corvids. <br><br>The meaningless indeed persists whether the repetitions eventually come to an end (as in the biosphere schema of JMG) or go on endlessly (as implied in Prof. Bardi's variation on JMG: Prof. Bardi imagines an eventual Artificial-Intelligence-driven New Big Bang). <br><br>If, on the other hand (to explore now the contrary hypothesis), that spiritual life does have a meaning, the meaning can exist even should the career of <i>Homo sapiens</i>, as one species among the many in Earth's long-lasting biosphere, prove brief, and even should there be no symbol-making, tool-making species after <i>Homo sapiens</i>. <br><br>We do well to follow the Christian mystics in stressing not the language of "above" but the language of "within". Properly conceived, the search for meaning is an exercise in interiority. <br><br>Tolstoy touches on this in the title (itself a quotation from Luke 17) he gives to his wonderful theology-of-nonviolence book, which I have just located and printed out and had Cerlox-bound, and in which I have just read the first chapter: <i>The Kingdom of God Is within You</i>. <br><br>This same Luke-and-Tolstoy language, of "within" as opposed to "above", is suggested by Paul's discourse in Athens, as summarized in Acts 17. In this discourse, Paul says that it is in God (not under God, beneath God, below God, as below the clouds and the stratosphere, but rather <i>in</i> God) that "we live and move and have our being." <br><br>At its worst, traditional Christian religious sensibility enjoins a search upward, for a crude transcendence of earthly conditions, in a futile way transferring to distant outer realms a poverty of meaning painfully experienced (and in this branch of the Christian tradition inadequately addressed) in the terrestrial realm. <br><br>At its authentic best, however, the Christian religious sensibility enjoins embarking, while firmly anchored in the terrestrial, a journey into the psychic interior. <br><br>I do not here dogmatically assert with the postwar Paris existentialists that our spiritual life is meaningless, and I do not here dogmatically assert the contrary hypothesis, that it is meaningful (though the latter is my actual theological position): here I assert only that exploring the question whether human spiritual life is or is not meaningful requires an emphasis not on the Above but on the Within. <br><br><br>Sincerely, <br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>Catholic near Toronto, Canada <br><br><a href=http://www.metascientia.com/ rel=nofollow>www punkt metascientia punkt com</a><br><br><a href=#c3703135586541905835 title="comment permalink">9/26/13, 12:46 PM</a><br><br>

"Wild and free" makes a lovely catchphrase, but I suspect you'd find it less than delightful if every choice you made -- including, say, who you get to marry and whether you get to live to adulthood -- was subject to the approval or veto of your local community, including every member of your extended family, and from whom there was no appeal.

I've considered at some point writing a book of nature meditations; that might be a good addition, and if so, it will appear with credit. <br><br>LatheChuck, exactly. The experience of the European diaspora, which encountered whole continents that had been settled by human beings for millennia and then mostly depopulated by pandemic disease, has given a lot of people these days delusional ideas about what ought to be waiting for us in space. <br><br>Kyoto, there'll be a lot of misery, some of it unnecessary; a lot of violence, ditto; and a lot of people who simply give up and drink themselves to death or the equivalent, as there was when the Soviet Union came apart.

One of the many things Tolkien got was the reality of history, and one of his literary gifts was the ability to make his world feel old, with layers on layers of history on it.

I came across that question recently when I realized that the Cosmogony and Works and Days of Hesiode, who wrote before 630 BCE, tell stories that evoke the bible. At some places, it mentions what seems to be equivalent of sins (Zeus is watching, if you do bad things, the Harpies will go after you...) and the myth of Prometheus who was punished for giving the fire to the mortals makes me think of the story of Adam and Eve who were kicked out of the paradise. <br>I didn't find anything similar in Homer's works who were writen before Hesiode's.<br>I would like to know references of books, modern or ancient, who give details about this ideological or philosophical transition. Does it have something to do with ideas disseminated from Egypt to Greece and to the Jews ? Or from Babylon ?<br>Thank you for your answer.<br>Y.

Takes courage… <br>Interestingly, if I have followed your reasoning, this leap does not necessarily land in the territory of atheism or agnosticism necessarily. But I suppose any theism that emerges would have to redefine “god” in a believable way. <br>I tend to accept discussions of “god” more as a concept that speaks to the inherent mysteriousness of consciousness, and the incomprehensible nature of nature. If I have made a leap of faith, which I believe I have, it is inconclusive, without authority and still within a context of a society that generally hasn’t got a clue (though I could be wrong about that… I often am!)<br>Perhaps I have greater leaps to take down the road, but I do feel liberated to not expect heaven in an afterlife.

Even the highest Heaven turns into Hell if the mind is agitated; whereas even the lowest Hell is a blissful abode for someone endowed with a peaceful and relaxed mind" (Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi commonly known as "Amma")<br><br>So the purpose of the austerities you referred to in a previous post are really about bringing the wayward mind under control to experience higher states of consciousness.

I guess you'd call it a "vision." We were doing the usual Pagan circle thing in a public park here near the edge of town, bordered by a wild forested area with one of the local rivers running through it, and as we reached the peak of drumming and dancing and then brought it all to earth with a bang and a moment of silence, I looked up at the wildwood, and felt the wood looking back.<br><br>The overall impression was a fond sadness. "We'll miss you when you're gone," was the way the feeling found words.<br><br>There are two sensibilities at large in our civilization. One, which has been discussed extensively here, is the "I'm the boss, I make the rules" kind of hubris that views humankind as a pinnacle -- nay, The Pinnacle -- of progressive evolution, to which all of nature must submit. The other, its apocalyptic shadow-opposite, views humankind as an uncontrolled virus that Mother Earth will eventually get around to eradicating with a brief shudder of disgust.<br><br>Mankind: overlord or dreaded disease.<br><br>I think my vision comes from the new religious sensibility JMG is speaking of.

Our capacity for intra- and inter-species empathy. Our cleverness with our hands. Our language, and our storytelling. Even our technology, which -- though it causes some troubles -- is a beautiful thing in its own right. That wildwood was alive, and curious, and friendly, though not in the Disney sense -- it would certainly not hesitate to embrace any one of us in the "cycle of life." But as a species, the wildwood bore us no ill will whatsoever, even as our city expands and expands and pushes the trees and beasts away.<br><br>The world holds a place for us, too, just like the beaver or the bacterium.<br><br>On the other hand, Mother Earth isn't going to save us from ourselves, or from any of the changes that take place in world.

Finley's <i>The World of Odysseus</i>? It's a study of Greek society during the post-Mycenean dark ages, using the available literature (Homer and Hesiod) and the evidence of archeology, and one of his central points is the extent to which the Greek polytheism that can be seen emerging at that time is a radical break with the religious past -- as indeed it is, including the collapse of the religious dimensions of kingship, the embrace of anthropomorphism in theology, and much more. That's the sensibility that spread across the Mediterranean world and shaped the established religious order of classical times; compare it with the standard religious institutions of the Bronze Age Levant and you can get some sense of what it replaced. <br><br>Sleisz, I'll grant you that! <br><br>Andy, if I may horn in briefly, I've also covered most of what I personally know how to do, as far as preparing for and dealing with the opening phases of the Long Descent; that's what the Green Wizardry series of posts was all about, and (in another sense) the discussions of magic. I'm far from omnicompetent, and in fact there are plenty of people on this list who are better at organic gardening, conservation retrofitting, ham radio, or what have you than I am! Thus I'm going to talk about the subjects where I have something original and, I hope, useful to say. <br><br>Kyoto, a good deal depends on what kind of Buddhism your sister practices. Those branches of Buddhism that get most intensely into salvation by faith -- for example, the Pure Land sect -- haven't gotten as much traction in the West as others, not least because the Christians already occupy their market niche. As for Plato, good! I really need to do a post on the Cave one of these days. <br><br>Changeling, sure -- it's probably been two years since I read it last, and my brain isn't quite as Tolkien-saturated as it was back in the days when I used to sign high school yearbooks in Elvish. <br><br>Brian, I talked about the reasons for the move <a href=../../2009/08/betting-on-rust-belt.html rel=nofollow>here</a> back when we first got settled. As for the book of meditations, I'll definitely consider it. <br><br>Ursachi, I'd happily cast a horoscope for a shot at a good telescope, so I wouldn't worry about it too much! <br><br>Amma Boy, the division between "religion" and "spirituality" is a very common trope these days, and it's usually used the way you've just used it -- that is, as a way of claiming that your preferred beliefs are "the inner truth contained in all religions," and thus a sales pitch for your guru or your church. I'd like to suggest an alternative view, which arguably does a better job of respecting the profound differences between religious and spiritual traditions: every religion and every spirituality states its own truth, which is different from that of every other. It's not even a matter of different paths up the same mountain; <i>there are different mountains</i> -- a whole glorious range of them, each of which provides a different view from the summit. The only thing they share in common is the same unreachable sky above them all. (And, yes, that's my truth, which is different from any other...) <br><br>Joseph, exactly! One of the key factors that differentiates the new sensibility from the old is that the old assumes an ineradicable split between humanity and nature, and the new recognizes that we are part of nature and never get outside her.<br><br>Joel, glad the concept was useful.

Thank you! There's nothing much I can add by way of a comment because the truths you've revealed are so obvious to me. And the commentators here have some of the sharpest minds I've ever encountered. <br><br>I do have one observation -- regarding all the metaphors for heaven. Isn't it interesting that software companies ask us to trust "the cloud" to store all our digital treasures? And we let them get away with it! LOL! <br><br>I believe they deliberately needed to create this heavenly metaphor-- "the cloud" , because people just might not trust the reality-- which could be a ramshackle bricks and mortar warehouse filled with loud, hot and spinning hard drives, secured by minimum wage (and in this capitalist economy) corruptible employees. <br><br>I don't have to look to the sky for the answers to life -- as awesome and wondrous as it is. My compost pile provides all the answers for me. Sometimes I have an urge to sneak out to the compost heap in the middle of the night with a stethoscope just to listen to the sound of nature as it reconciles life with death. I'd do it if I didn't think my family would have me committed. :-) <br><br>It was during a recent visit to the compost heap after reading one of your essays, with deep thoughts on the 'meaning of life' swimming through my head, that it suddenly struck me that life IS the meaning. And that discovery has brought great comfort to me. <br><br>I am now rich with gratitude.<br><br>Sidd<br><br><a href=#c4438610806601589474 title="comment permalink">9/27/13, 4:46 PM</a><br><br>

Makes plenty of sense, and we looked at many of the same factors when we chose to settle in Ellijay, GA. I'm a bit concerned that we're a little on the touristy side down here, but we are linked to Atlanta by a sub-2-hour train trip, same for <br>Chattanooga, and surely that will come in handy. We make the bulk of our income from the Atlanta and Chattanooga economies already, so we'll just adapt organically as novel conditions present themselves I suppose. <br><br>In a rapid collapse scenario I'm not sure it's the right place, but then, where IS the right place in a rapid collapse scenario? I'm making pretty much the same bets you are on the near and middle future. Even before I discovered you.<br><br>Reading through some of your reasoning in that post and that of some of the commenters after, I want to bring up a permacultural point regarding food production. It's definitely a bonus to live somewhere where rain falls regularly enough to produce annual crops without irrigation, but every ecosystem is productive in its own way. Actually cereal crop production arose in Mediterranean climates with wet winters and droughty summers, as you probably know, and cereal crops are largely the reason we number so many today. And I can report first-hand from this season that overly wet summers are pretty hard on the garden.<br><br>Too much water, not enough water, the point here is to observe and learn from your environment, follow its lead for what is possible, adapt crop selection to match and maximize those possibilities, design for resilience, and adapt your desires in realistic ways. Above all be creative! Even dense forest is productive, if you're looking for mushrooms, ramps, wood nettles, acorns, squirrel, and so forth. And these would form the basis of a pretty robust diet.<br><br>This is more for anyone who might feel limited by what is considered "productive" land versus what isn't generally, than it is for you, btw.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br><a href=#c8746516891823260756 title="comment permalink">9/27/13, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>

There are some seriously good rock walls and raised garden beds just demanding to be built! hehe!<br><br>There was an article recently in the newspapers here about how the Mars rover had discovered 2% water content in the Martian soils and this was a great thing for future settlements. I don't wish to sound mean, but 2% is seriously on the ultra-arid side of things... I tried to imagine how you'd go about extracting that 2% water from a cubic metre of soil and it completely failed my imagination.<br><br>The economists may just be right you know? Ever since your comment about the Internet and associated services having to make economic sense (ie. pay for itself), I've been wondering about this concept, but from a much larger perspective.<br><br>Surely, our society and civilisation has to also pay for itself to function?<br><br>It is a disturbing concept and your current essay points to the unpalatable truth that there is nowhere outside of this planet to extract natural wealth from at a low economic cost in order to maintain a surplus.<br><br>This is it and it is definitely finite. Every year, we draw down further on our accumulated reserves to sustain the monster. There really is no brighter future.<br><br>The funny thing at the farm here is that it doesn't take much effort to start growing food. The longer term foods like fruit trees take a bit more effort than annuals, perennials and self-seeders, but there really isn't much other than wait for 5 to 8 years (and a bit of care along the way) for them to start seriously producing. <br><br>It is the infrastructure that takes all of my time. If you want to improve the top soil, it's a big job. If you want more water or energy supplies, then it's a big job too. A shitake mushroom stand out of scrap steel, then it's a fair bit of work: cutting; drilling; and welding before you even think of cutting the fresh logs to drill and inoculate them. Building infrastructure takes so much time.<br><br>It is my opinion that our current society is now at the point where instead of building up that infrastructure, they are drawing down on the benefits of it (this includes community) - all so that they can continue with business as usual. It is a recipe for disaster.<br><br>PS: Thanks for your confirmation about salvation last week.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5179713759637941060 title="comment permalink">9/28/13, 3:19 AM</a><br><br>

I cannot imagine what it would be like to give up the family farm.<br><br>Bendigo is at much lower altitude and also north of the Great Dividing Range so it can have some seriously hot and dry summers. <br><br>The Black Saturday bush fires of February 2009 came within 1km of the Bendigo central post office and it is no small town. The train line here goes between there and Melbourne. Mind you, those bushfires turned away from here only by a lucky change of wind on the day and headed back north again. I said goodbye to my orchard that day, with regrets.<br><br>I've been busy this week building bushfire shutters for my shed, which is easier to protect than rebuild from scratch. How do you even replace the contents, let alone the building?<br><br>I met Darren at an open farm nearby (Taranaki farm) where he brought out Joel Salatin from the US (I sound like I'm name dropping, but he's just this guy you know?). Actually they were both lovely and passionate people about farming and served really nice barbequed chicken (I'm a vegetarian at home on the farm). It was a really good open day and I was impressed by their systems. By a strange coincedence today, I spied their Joel Salatin inspired chicken roost and it looked good. The moons have aligned.<br><br>Pah! It is you who are upside down, this was never in any doubt here! It is merely a question of perspective and I must say the correct one is here. hehe! Nice one.<br><br>On a more serious note, the areas here with greatest diversity of plants are also the areas that are under the greatest environmental stress.

Your essays get my brain working along lines that otherwise never would have occurred to me. I trust that we provide food for your brain too.<br><br>I'm involved here on the farm at the pointy end of the infrastructure equation so the whole resiliency thing doesn't escape me.<br><br>The solar power system here is on the low tech side of things and I get a bit of ribbing from the renewable energy community. Sometimes, I can't even follow their conversations as they strive towards greater efficiencies on their systems with all sorts of weird and wonderful components. The latest trend seems to be large scale lithium batteries and all of the bits and pieces required to run them. The other latest trend seems to be AC coupling, which is basically converting the DC output of the solar panels directly to AC and combining the panels in strings to much higher voltages. All this to save money on cables (as the current is low), but over 50v AC you need an licensed electrician here and there are multiple inverters out in the weather…<br><br>On the other hand the main components for the power system here are locally manufactured, repairable locally and are well suited to the environmental conditions. A lot of their stuff de-rates as the weather conditions exceed 40 degrees Celsius. My lot is rated continually to in excess of 50 degrees Celsius and I haven’t noticed that any of them get hot.<br><br>All respect to them for giving it a go and I'm not taking that away from them and it is really good to see people experimenting with this stuff. It is just that as you increase the efficiency, complexity increases and your overall system resiliency decreases and they seem to consistently ignore that side of things.<br><br>The local authorities recently put a load limit sign up on one of the local bridges. This was after a couple of days of work on the bridge.

As a film and photography student struggling for his economic and creative future, I can understand that very well. My professors are experienced and established documentary film makers and photographers, and they proved their creative talent at a time when this kind of activity was reserved for a select few who were willing to do a lot of hard work. <br><br>I do see this as a time when it's so easy for so many people to get their hands on these technologies, that your skepticism of the visual media as a form of art is more than warranted. (Well, not for me, since I don't have so much money and I'm not a techno-gadget geek, so I buy it used, if I need it) But on the other hand, there are a lot of creative people in the world, and this medium gives them great opportunities to express themselves, and as long as you don't become a slave to the technologies that make it possible, and diversify your interests and modes of expression in other fields as well, I think that there is still a place in this world for the "visual arts". <br><br>For how long, who knows. There might be a reversal to my professors' time after fuel shortages make the whole "made in Taiwan" easy to get digital camera a thing of the past. And in the long run, it might be lost alltogether. But as long as it exists, I think it still has a worthy place in this world.<br><br><a href=#c7864709969420685619 title="comment permalink">9/29/13, 2:20 AM</a><br><br>

In the first place, he needs to distinguish between material progress and scientific progress, though the latter of course depends on the former. Being humans, we have a curiosity about the universe we live in, but if we wanted to explore it and our position in it (and we did) THE ONLY WAY WAS UP. Therefore the Archdruid traps our scientists in his poetic fallacy. One of the commenters mentioned "phallic rokcets". Well, I was just sweeping my kitchen floor, before making this comment - and my broom had a long shank. You could make a phallic fallacy out of it, but I'd rather you didn't! But you see my point.<br><br>As an atheist (OK, what is it precisely that I don't believe in?), I can't be certain about what any or every Christian thinks about the "Ascension", and most seem to have difficulty in expressing their spiritual feelings in words anyway, and perhaps that is as it should be.<br><br>The spiritual are in awe of nature. I am too - and I think that applies to those who want to explore the universe, so I don't see a difference there. Of course, nature can also be seen as cruel and "red in tooth and claw" - and we know one happened when one gentleman applied that belief to politics and took it to extremes.<br><br>But if science is limited by material considerations, then I believe it is limited period, as, like the Archdruid, I do not believe that permanent material "progress" is possible, since our resources are of necessity limited.<br><br><a href=#c4496641337829596154 title="comment permalink">9/29/13, 3:06 AM</a><br><br>

When heckled by students about whether he talked to his plants he replied that he did. After further heckling to find out what he said, he replied "hurry up and grow you ba*#@!ds or I'll pull you out". Nuff said.<br><br>Hi Ruben,<br><br>We have similar rainfall patterns. There is no substitute in these conditions to increasing the organic matter in the soil. If water runs over the surface of herbage (pasture) then it is not biologically active enough and you need to go hard on adding more organic matter (mulch, compost, whatever, just keep putting more on top). A couple of years back, I saw 10 inches over 5 days during a phenomenal storm and apart from hard surfaces, water did not run over the herbage.<br><br>Of course raised beds have long been a staple for vegetables and other annual crops to keep their feet dry. It is just good practice. There is nothing new about them, my grandfather used to have rows of mounded vegetable beds back in the 70's.<br><br>I've received an invite to check out some local raised wicking beds as they seem to promise reduced water consumption during ultra dry periods.

Not only would it be very inefficient as John has noticed, it also would not be much fun.<br><br>Kind of negates the whole reason for going at all.<br><br>However, there are better and much more interesting options.<br><br>For example, it is beginning to look like biological beings that thrive in high vacuum and hard radiation (hi-vacs) are perfectly possible, we even have a number of existing life forms, some even multi-cellular, that can do some of that right now. The problem is that there seems to be no natural evolutionary path that could lead to human scale beings of that sort.<br><br>However, for the kind of genetic engineering that is likely to exist in the next few centuries, barring of course too bad a collapse, it would be a major project, but interesting rather than daunting. And of course, for such beings about the whole universe rather than just a few, vanishingly rare, little water worlds would be their oyster, or rather real estate.<br><br>Then of course there are self-replicating in one form or another machines, with or without self-awareness, free-will or ex-human souls.<br><br>And nanites, which are sort of in between, again with or without self-awareness, free-will or ex-human souls.<br><br>But more likely something we will not even think of for another century.<br><br>So, while this civilization seems to have missed the boat, if a future one decides it wants to send its “children” “out there” there are some interesting options and the effort involved would probably be just about the level major civilizations like for social cohesion building projects – about the same comparative level of effort as a pyramid, but much more fun.<br><br>There might even be some sort of a payback.<br><br>Just for fun<br>Stephen Heyer<br><br><a href=#c5199850538333028199 title="comment permalink">9/29/13, 7:11 AM</a><br><br>

For a start there are usually 2 words missing from many statements made about life, technology, and so on -- one version of those two words is "for whom" and another is "at what".<br><br>So for example we are told that prosperity is increasing, but there's a tacit omission of the question "for whom." Or we are told that some sector of human activity has become more efficient, but no one is supposed to ask "at what".<br><br>The corporate ag factory farm is "efficient" according to its fans. But what it's efficient at is *only* producing the maximum amount of some standardized commodity crop for the minimum amount of wage labour hours. In terms of energy throughput it's insanely inefficient (10 kcal of fossil energy for every 1 kcal of factory maize last time I checked). Also, one hectare under monocrop produces more of that monocrop than a mixed planting, but *less* (far less) usable biomass; polyculture is anywhere from 2 to 20 times more productive depending on climate and specific crop mixtures.<br><br>And then there's the other vexed question, "for whom"? The vast bulk of the profit from the whole game now goes to the industrial sector (processing, packaging, transport, fossil fuels and chemicals, machinery, etc) with the farming family getting, what is it these days, just a few cents on each dollar?<br><br>So factory farming is efficient, yes, undeniably -- for whom? for industrialists and banksters, who are skimming profits all along the supply chain. And at what? at making profits for industrialists and banksters. And yes, it also produces an enormous glut of commodity biomass, which can be processed into "cheap" food for the proles, so nutritionally inferior that we're now looking at something like a continent-scale disease epidemic among people raised on this factory fodder. These people are then handed off to an "efficient" modern medical system which has become so expensive fewer and fewer people can afford its services... anyway, you get the picture.<br><br>"Efficiency" is really a synonym for optimisation, and optimisation always has a specific goal and a specific price. We can raise more tonnage of pork per acre by CAFO practises, so we can optimise our praxis for that goal; but it will cost us in, e.g., sickly and miserable animals, inferior meat, and unnatural concentrations of manure and urine which in turn require costly remediation. Overeager, overzealous optimisation always results -- this is one of my personal axioms -- in a frail and sickly system, in the same way that overbreeding of dogs for show results in sickly animals; the cost of the relentless pursuit of a narrow band of desired features is a weakening or damaging of other features, so you end up with an overspecialised and fragile critter. Like industrial western civilisation :-) or like some popular strains of commercial fruit which have been bred for colour and size, and now have hardly any flavour.<br><br>When I personally undertake a task I try to do it "efficiently" -- not wasting a lot of time and energy. Sometimes I even start to mimic the factory process if I'm making N of some item in the shop. But I would never go through the whole factory-style layout and setup to make just 2 items, say -- that would be more wasteful than making uno alla volta. There is a meta-optimisation algorithm that determines how much "efficiency" is really optimal; and that algorithm is far more complicated than tonnage of pork per hectare per labour hour...<br><br><a href=#c8397675524906942654 title="comment permalink">9/29/13, 11:05 AM</a><br><br>

If I'm not capable of seeing and enjoying the various wonders in the here and now why should I be able to do it then?<br><br>On somewhat tangential note I think I can possibly bring a slightly new perspective to the study brought up by the first commenter.<br><br>Back in the 1930s it was proven that it is impossible to construct a computer algorithm which is guaranteed to correctly determine whether any arbitrary logical argument is valid or not, within a finite period of time. That is while such an algorithm may be capable proving/disproving a given argument in a second, a hour, a day, or a century, in the worst case it would never finish (even in the hypothetical case where the power doesn't get turned off). Their are logical arguments which deal with only a finite number of variables, which can provably be proved/disproved in a finite amount of time, it's just that in the worst case that amount of time grows exponentially with the number of variables in the argument, and thus quickly becomes functionally infinite. What does this have to do with reasoning capability? While it may be that the human brain is qualitatively better at reasoning than any current computer, it still stands that there are many conjectures in math which have yet to be proved/disproved even after a century or more. Which points to the fact that reasoning is hard, even if you are smart and well educated it is still hard. It is so hard that if you think that all decisions must be made based upon sound logic, then in many cases, making use of unsupported assumptions (Myths?), and fallacies, is not optional. It is necessary in order to get things done before the sun burns out. As such I think a lot of faulty reasoning is caused by the article of faith which many people hold, that reason can be used to replace religion/faith/myths as a means of societal consensus. "I can logically prove that I am write therefore you must agree with me". This quickly runs into the roadblock that actually doing all the work of proving/disproving the current myths which people need in order to function in a society, let alone the new ones you would need to create in order to replace them, is quite likely as difficult if not more so than moving the entire human race to Alpha Centauri. Thus what you end up with is a multitude of sides, all of whom can see the fallacies in every other sides arguments, but unwilling and unable to see the fallacies and assumption which underlie their own logically derived truth. This is not to say that logic and reason are bad. They are quite useful as long as you understand that they are also limited.<br><br>Hopefully this comment is not to incoherent.<br><br><a href=#c2182103368624195655 title="comment permalink">9/29/13, 9:23 PM</a><br><br>

Instead of shedding that winter precip, catch it and infiltrate it. It'll improve the soil and soil moisture for the hot dry season. Your crops on top will be up high enough to avoid drowning in winter rains, and the topsoil from the swales/pathways, can be piled up on the mounds, effectively increasing organic carbon content in your productive soils before you even add the first trowel-full of compost. Always keep these mounds mulched; I mulch pretty heavily unless I'm direct seeding something like carrots, and then I just sprinkle the straw over the seeds lightly enough to get some dappled sun in to the soil surface. You can add more back when they get bigger to conserve water and suppress weeds.<br><br>I always add organic matter any time I plant something new, right around the base of the transplant or in a layer for direct seeding. And I hardly ever pull anything out by the roots. The microbial economy underground is well established and hosted in the previous crop's rhizosphere, and you should treat it like a "plug-n-play" environment for new plants. I just cut the spent herbage off at ground level and add it to the mulch, chopping it up if need be, like with heavy tomato vines.<br><br>Another thing to help accumulate and process organic matter (thereby improving water cycling, among other things) is adding a terrestrial mushroom like Stropharia rugosa-annulata (aka wine caps, garden giants, king Stropharia) and some woodier mulch on the surface. The fungal partners help gather water and nutrients from as far away as 100 yards (or more) from your bed, and bring them back to the plants they've now formed a symbiotic relationship with, to trade for sugary root exudates. I grow all of my perennials this way, but it can be employed with annuals like corn, okra, etc, really anything that can offer later summer/early fall shade to protect the emerging caps. It's a nice secondary crop from the same space, too! They're delicious when young, but get wormy fast, so toss older ones to chickens or into a fish-producing system for another yield.<br><br>Again, if you're getting more rain than your raised mound system can handle, just add a control elevation to the mound to prevent wash-over. The rest is payday. Hope that helps!<br><br>Tripp<br><br><a href=#c2697029771723448929 title="comment permalink">9/30/13, 6:42 AM</a><br><br>

The weather rocked here last night with winds that were the third highest recorded in the state since records began. <br><br>Over the years, I've had two excellent bits of advice from old timers up here about trees:<br><br>- They never get smaller; and<br>- Have no trees within dropping distance of your house.<br><br>Both bits of common sense advice have served me well here.<br><br>It is just my recent observation, but the winds serve the same function that the megafauna (which were eaten by people) once did – who’d have thought nature could have multiple redundancies?<br><br>Funnily enough, my old inner city stomping ground was hammered last night by the extreme winds. From the 1970's onwards, there has been an ideologically driven pursuit in that area of planting large native trees in amongst houses (think 30m 90ft peppermint gums within 2m 6ft of the front of a house). <br><br>The two systems are incompatible as last night clearly showed. I personally witnessed a few squashed houses this morning.<br><br>I've often felt that the pursuit of native vegetation in urban areas, whilst being a good idea, is also a form of green-washing (a feel good gesture at best). Urban areas share little in common with the natural environment.<br><br>An urban area can harbour a huge variety and quantity of wildlife, but as I've witnessed firsthand, people prefer large trees which have little ongoing maintenance to a fruit tree like an apricot tree. The cynic in me says that the large tree doesn't attract fruit bats (for example) which drop half eaten fruit + poo onto their houses and cars. Just sayin...<br><br>Also the emergency services volunteers who were out for 12+ hour shifts last night, I feel for you - having done my time for many years in this capacity, I was left with the gut feel that:<br><br>"how can so many, expect so much, from so few".<br><br>That sounds all a bit bitter, but I'm actually cool about it all.<br><br>Hi Stephen,<br><br>You have been doing it hard up your way this year. September was a corker! Not only has it been extraordinarily dry, but it's been massively hot too. Your area has a fascinating history. I look forward to your comments in future about it all.<br><br>As to the raised beds, it may involve some testing first. I've increased the water storage here so it may not be as crucial as it would have been in the past. Plus everything seems to be getting hardier as it gets better established. What are you seeing on that front?<br><br>Hi Richard,<br><br>Thanks for mentioning luck, I can never tell what the next season will bring. Hope you get a lot out of the book. I reckon community can't be forced as it is founded on obligation - and we are not quite there yet, but will get there sooner or later.<br><br>Hi Jessica,<br><br>Well said. The ground mushroom sounds fascinating. I've just started growing oyster and shitake mushrooms here and are really interested to see how it all turns out.

If you want something to be robust, it is going to be inefficient, and if you want it to be efficient, it will be fragile. Some people consider "life" to be elegant and compact, but it's anything but -- it has all kinds of haphazard redundancies, and many of them get in the way of function. No one with half a brain would <i>design</i> an organism that way. Yet that's exactly what's required for robustness.<br><br>Consider the "robots take over the world" scenario. That won't work until you can throw two damaged robots into a swamp, and twenty years later, at least three functional robots walk out and shake you down for spare change. If you have anything less robust than that, the first supply-chain breakdown puts a permanent end to the robot revolution.<br><br>Self-replicators in a vacuum can't replicate. Self-replicators in a tenuous interstellar medium are either going to have to compete with other self-replicators that are <i>already</i> there, or will themselves mutate, evolve, and (if viable) form a full ecosystem of self-replicators. If that's possible, it's probably already out there, and the Earth probably already has a strain of unknown high-altitude self-replicators that eat the space beasties. If it doesn't, they will develop fairly quickly (e.g. a few billion years).<br><br><a href=#c3946616721285750581 title="comment permalink">10/1/13, 8:08 AM</a><br><br>

Oh! And all you self-replicators, we’ll give you some dead planets and stars to turn into yourselves, but you are not allowed to eat the rest of the galaxy."<br><br>4.

What you seem to fail to understand is the new breed of space enthusiasts who understand that there is nothing up there but barren wastelands but still want to go anyway. Of course it is going to be a whole lot more difficult than staying on Earth; but you can make the same argument for staying in your parents' house and eating your parents' food.<br><br>@flute, that is an excellent suggestion, except, you are making the same mistake that @Adrian Skilling and the Biosphere II made (well, one of them): starting too large. The original biosphere didn't come into being all at once (even the Biblical story of Creation says it took 6 days); artificial biospheres need to be built up over time. If you want to know more about this kind of research I suggest looking up "living machines" and "controlled environment life support systems".<br><br><a href=#c6868293301033490624 title="comment permalink">10/1/13, 9:31 PM</a><br><br>

First you would have to work out some sort of biological process whereby this creature replicates itself using materials which are common even outside Earth's biosphere, then you would have to give it some means of propulsion so it could get to whatever it needs to devour, then you would need to make resilient enough so that it could actually survive in the harshness of space long enough to get there, all of this has to be encoded in DNA, a medium which to my knowledge is still not fully understood. Currently one of the better ways of optimizing for such stringent requirement in such a complicated state space as a gene sequence is a genetic algorithm, an algorithm which is based upon natural evolution. If we consider the time scales involved in natural evolution this should give us some idea of how much time a civilization might have to invest in such a project to see concrete results i.e. alot.<br><br>@Joseph Nemeph<br>If I might quibble over your comment that if it is possible it is probably already there. This assumes that billions of years is a reasonable amount of time for a given possible event to occur. For example lets assume that the likelihood of a self-replicator appearing anywhere within the known universe in a given year is is a trillion to one. Given that the number of different permutation which a three billion gene pair sequence (like the one which makes a human) can possibly make is roughly 10^1,000,000 as compared to the estimated 10^80 atoms in the known universe, it seems reasonable that if there were a set of gene sequences capable of matching the hypothesised self replicator it could be that unlikely to be stumbled upon. If we assume this one in a trillion per year chance, then the probability of such a creature occurring in 13.8 billion years the hypothesised age of the universe is 1.5%, pretty unlikely. If we instead looked 13.8 trillion years into the future then there is a 99.9999% that this beasty is migrating across the cosmos, evolving and quite possibly creating some very strange ecosystems. What's my point? if indeed I have one. Whether or not ecosystems which span entire solar systems are in the cards or not it is quite probable that even though the greatest show in the universe has been going for billions of years that doesn't mean that it doesn't have many new weird and wonderful acts to show.<br><br><a href=#c3000769323380834513 title="comment permalink">10/1/13, 10:28 PM</a><br><br>

I have my doubts about permaculture as it's marketed in the US, and to a lesser extent as it's practiced here, but I know a lot of good people who are into it for lack of anything better, and no shortage of people who've learned at least some good tricks from it. As for hippies, er, I can assure you that I get called that all the time, and I don't consider it an insult, either! As for blades and chalices, the notion of the blade as a phallic symbol -- well, "ouch" is the first thing that comes to mind.

I wonder if they like having cockroaches in their houses; those are very effective self-replicators...<br><br>Bill, interesting. I'll put it on the to-read list. <br><br>Moshe, yes, that occurred to me also. How many launch gantries does it take to equal the weight of an undersea fiber-optic cable? <br><br>Quos Ego, everyone has one movie or TV show or what have you that they think I really ought to see, even though I don't enjoy visual media.

I may want to use that as an introductory image to a post about the delusion that nature can be counted on to do only what we want. <br><br>Bill, I suspect there's some kind of odd weak-force reaction behind the anomalous results of cold fusion -- I've suggested several times now that that might just be the secret of the old alchemists, whose "secret fire" might well have been electricity from bimetal-acid batteries. Still, I grant that there's no evidence that it's a significant source of energy -- just an odd wrinkle of physics that might be able to change one element to another. <br><br>John, I'm well aware that there's a very small minority of space geeks who are in love with the solar system as it actually is. Have you considered how few people are going to be willing to see trillions of tax dollars spent to let that minority chase their dreams? <br><br>Stephen, if I may butt in, have you read any of Sheldrake's other books?

It's a question of activation energy, combined with <i>configuration</i>. <br><br>Consider burning wood. Wood does not spontaneously burn: it requires activation energy. You can apply activation energy in the form of a blowtorch flame, and the wood will burn and release its stored energy, but as soon as you remove the blowtorch, the reaction stops. Arrange the sticks of wood in an open cone, however, and then light it with the blowtorch, and the wood will continue to burn and release energy without further input (other than more wood, of course).<br><br>Now replace the blowtorch with a scrap of charred cloth set glowing by the spark from flint on steel, and the cone of wood with a carefully-arranged pile of kindling, and you can start that same fire with a VERY small amount of activation energy.<br><br>You're correct that if this were possible, some biological organism would have come along and used this as an energy source -- that would be us. It's out of the reach of microbes, however, because microbes are simply on the wrong scale. And they don't have opposable thumbs.<br><br>Cold fusion, should it prove possible and practical, would be much the same. Lattice assisted nuclear reactions require a nuclear lattice, which (at this point) requires purified metals. Those don't occur spontaneously very often at all. Again, the biological organism that might arrange to exploit this would be us.<br><br><a href=#c8126047986784046497 title="comment permalink">10/2/13, 8:03 AM</a><br><br>

We all subscribe to something. And we all believe in it to one degree or another. Our esteemed host subscribes to a set of beliefs same as you and me. [And I happen to agree with a lot of it or I wouldn't be here.]<br><br>Permaculture has never claimed to be original thought, but rather a toolkit for organizing the good ideas that have flowed from our history, a way of beefing up the resilience, and reducing the energy/materials input, that comes from their application. It's basically a flywheel for the integration of good ideas. It's not "above," but "between." It's a relational philosophy. "Stacking functions" (how can we solve another problem with this solution?) is a major part of the practice, and is distilled in principles 4 and 5, listed above. <br><br>The principles are indeed very general, but very profound, as they are modeled on Nature's way of solving problems. No doubt this is skewed to some degree by the cultural lens through which they were discovered, but they are kept simple on purpose. There's no central dogma. The application of them, however, is anything but mundane. Relegating them out-of-hand to being "too general" doesn't mean that everyone is just sort of getting them done as a by-product of their daily activity. Even 'round here. If we all ran through this list every time we made a decision, humans and their environment wouldn't be in the dire straits they're in today.<br><br>The only copyright limitation within the permaculture community that I'm aware of is that one is not supposed to teach "permaculture" unless one has been through a certificate program. Hardly Draconian. That said, I taught a 3-hour permaculture course at a major environmental conference a couple years back, before I took a certificate course, and the permaculture police didn't arrest or sanction me. Matter of fact, I didn't feel like I did the subject justice with my talk, and decided not to teach it again, outside of my garden or online media, after that conference, even with a certificate. I'm just not a good live teacher. In other words, I sanctioned myself because of the gravity of the subject.<br><br>Scores of people coming through these halls proclaiming the magic of permaculture, while not actually practicing permaculture, isn't really my fault. Nor is it permaculture's. <br><br>Obviously you fellas have spent some time in these comments sections, and with a host who is openly hostile to this philosophy (that puts into practice pretty much everything he talks fondly about) it's understandable that you would be turned off to it. That's my major complaint here: that JMG has an extremely large audience, even after hours, and is openly hostile to one of the best chances we have at recovering some functionality and beauty in our world, within a human time frame, on our way down Hubbert's Curve. Permaculture is doing this, now, has been for decades, even in the US; hostility toward it seems counter-productive to me.<br><br>I behaved like a child, you're right. But emotion is a very human trait. Human. Guilty. And I'm not going to apologize for it. <br><br>May I make an alternative suggestion, though? When Americans come through here misrepresenting or malpracticing permaculture, me included, could we blame it on being an American, and not on being a permaculturalist? I realize that is sort of what JMG was trying to say, but stating that we practice permaculture for lack of a better alternative is rude, plain and simple.<br><br><a href=#c1497817100551230010 title="comment permalink">10/3/13, 6:53 AM</a><br><br>

I never said the principles were "too" general, just general. And my opinion of permaculture has nothing to do with hanging around on this blog. It has to do with my own direct experience with permaculture and permaculturists going back about 14 years. I live in a small rural county that has hosted a permaculture training school, a group espousing "financial permaculture" (whatever that is, the term gives me the the creeps), multiple CSAs, etc. etc.<br><br><a href=#c2481127941362370400 title="comment permalink">10/3/13, 7:07 PM</a><br><br>

Before you go any further about my supposed hostility to the principles of permaculture, I'd encourage you to reread the comment of mine that you quoted, and note again that I was talking explicitly, in so many words, about <i>the way that permaculture is marketed, and to a lesser extent taught, here in the US</i>. Is that a condemnation of its principles? Of course not. <br><br>As for the comment about "for lack of anything better" that enraged you, I'm quoting a good many people I know who have gotten involved with the permaculture scene here in the US despite their disagreements with the way that it's marketed and taught, and to some extent with its principles as well. Despite those disagreements, they find it the best option currently available. <br><br>Mind you, if you were to suggest that quite a few people involved in Druidry are there for want of anything better, I'd cheerfully agree with you, partly because I know it's true, and partly because I hope it's true. Druidry is not an end in itself, much less the one and only best way to do x, y, or z. It's a specific, richly human, and therefore inevitably flawed tradition that attempts, with inevitably limited success, to do certain things; it has plenty of idiosyncrasies and no shortage of problems, and a lot of people who are active in it would probably do something else if there was something closer to their ideal -- but there isn't, and Druidry is a close enough fit to work for them, so here they are. <br><br>I would hope that you and other permaculturists would be able to recognize that permaculture is not the solution to every problem or a perfect fit for everyone; that there's a difference between its principles and the sometimes problematic way those principles have been marketed and, to some extent, taught in one particular country; and that a fair number of those who are involved in it are there because, just at the moment, it's the best option they have. I would certainly hope that a reference to these points, wouldn't be taken as an insult and a justification for storming off in a rage. Still, if you want to storm off in a rage, by all means; no need to let the door hit you on the way out.<br><br><a href=#c7226075160265272468 title="comment permalink">10/3/13, 8:07 PM</a><br><br>

Rereading my comments, however, I do tend to come off as a true believer in this regard. I don't believe in one size fits all, and although I don't think that's what permaculture is offering - quite the opposite actually, it always makes a point of analyzing things from a site-specific, climate-specific, owner-specific, culturally-specific, etc-specific, vantage point - I will attempt to reign in my evangelical tendencies.<br><br>I come by that honestly, having gone on more than one baptist mission trip in my younger days, but I don't want to be that guy. Thanks for guiding me down a more useful, and less annoying, path. Your energy descent books are still at the very top of the recommended reading list on my blog...above Holmgren, Mollison, Fukuoka, Thoreau, Schumacher...some pretty good company in my opinion.
