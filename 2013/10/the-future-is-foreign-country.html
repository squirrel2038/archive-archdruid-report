<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m pleased to note that the conversation about ephemeralization and catabolic collapse launched a few weeks back by <a href=http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/when-ephemeralization-is-hard-to-tell-from-catabolic-collapse/2013/09/19>futurist Kevin Carson</a>, and continued in several blogs since then, has taken a promising new turn. The vehicle for that sudden swerve was a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>essay by Lakis Polycarpou, titled <a href=http://nea-polis.net/2013/10/24/catabolic-ephemeralization-carson-versus-greer/ >Catabolic Ephemeralization: Carson versus Greer</a>, which set out to find common ground between Carson’s standpoint and mine. In the process, to his credit, Polycarpou touched on a crucial point that has been too often neglected in recent discussions about the future.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br>
That’s not to say that his take on the future couldn’t use some serious second thoughts. I noted in <a href=../../2013/10/the-flight-to-ephemeral.html>my original response to Carson’s post</a> the nearly visceral inability to think in terms of whole systems that pervades today’s geek culture, and that curious blindness is well represented in Polycarpou’s essay. He argues, for example, that since a small part of Somalia has cell phone service, and cell phone service is more widely available today than grid electricity or clean drinking water, cutting-edge technology ought to be viable in a postpetroleum world. “If Greer is right that modern telecommunications is full of hidden embodied energy and capital costs,” he wonders aloud, “how is this possible?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As it happens, that’s an easy question to answer. Somalia, even in its present turbulent condition, is part of a global economy fueled by the recklessly rapid extraction of half a billion years of fossil sunlight and equally unsustainable amounts of other irreplaceable natural resources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It speaks well of the resourcefulness of the Somalian people that they’ve been able to tap into some of those resource flows, in the teeth of a global economy that’s so heavily tilted against them; that said, it bears remembering that the cell phone towers in Somalia are not being manufactured in Somalian factories from Somalian resources using Somalian energy sources. A sprawling global industrial network of immensely complex manufacturing facilities and world-spanning supply chains forms the whole system that lies behind those towers, and without that network or some equivalent capable of mobilizing equivalent resources and maintaining comparable facilities, those towers would not exist. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s easy to make dubious generalizations based on cell phone service, mind you, because all that’s being measured by that metric is whether a given group of people are within range of a bit of stray microwave radiation—not whether they have access to cell phones, or whether the infrastructure could handle the traffic if they did. That’s the kind of blindness to whole systems that pervades so much contemporary thinking. A microwave signal fluttering through the air above an impoverished Somalian neighborhood does not equal a sustainable technological economy; only when you can account for every requirement of the whole system that produces that signal can you begin to talk about whether that system can be preserved in working order through a harsh era of global economic contraction and political turmoil. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Polycarpou dodges this, and several other awkward points of this nature. He insists, for example, that nobody actually knows whether the early 19th century technology needed to lay and operate undersea cables is really less complex than a space program capable of building, orbiting, and operating communications satellites. Since the technologies in question are a matter of public knowledge, and a few minutes of online research is all that’s needed to put them side by side, this is breathtakingly ingenuous. Still, I’d encourage my readers to keep reading past this bit, and also past the ad hominem handwaving about the energy costs of the internet that follows it. It’s in the last part of Polycarpou’s essay, where he begins to talk about alternatives and the broader shape of the future, that he begins to speak in a language familiar to regular readers of <i>The Archdruid Report</i>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What he’s suggesting in this final part of his essay, if I’m reading it correctly, is that the infrastructure of the modern industrial world is unsustainable, and will have to be replaced by local production of essential goods and services on a scale that will seem impoverished by modern standards. With this claim I have no disagreements at all, and indeed it’s what I’ve been suggesting here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> for the last seven and a half years. The points at issue between my view of the future and Polycarpou’s are what technologies will be best suited to the deindustrial world, and just how much more impoverished things are going to be by the time we finish the transition. These are questions of detail, not of substance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Furthermore, they’re not questions that can be settled conclusively in advance. Mind you, it’s almost certainly a safe assumption that the kind of computer hardware we use today will no longer be manufactured once today’s industrial infrastructure stops being a paying proposition economically; current integrated-circuit technology requires a suite of extraordinarily complex technologies and a dizzying assortment of raw materials from the far corners of the globe, which will not be available to village-scale workshops dependent on local economies. The point that too rarely gets noticed is that the kind of information processing technology we have now isn’t necessarily the only way that the same principles can be put to work. I’ve fielded claims here several times that mechanical computers capable of tolerably complex calculations can be made of such simple materials as plywood disks; I have yet to see a working example, but I’m open to the possibility that something of the sort could be done.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Polycarpou comments, along the same lines, that people in a variety of countries these days are setting up parallel internets using rooftop wifi antennas, and he suggests that this is one direction in which a future internet might run, at least in the short term. He’s almost certainly right, provided that those last six words are kept in mind. It’s vanishingly unlikely that anybody will be able to keep manufacturing the necessary hardware for wifi systems through the twilight years of the industrial age, but while the hardware exists, it will certainly be used, and it might buy enough time for something else, something that can be locally manufactured from local resources, to be invented and deployed. My guess is that it’ll look much more like a ham radio message net than the internet as we currently know it, but that’s a question the future will have to settle. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same point can be made—and <a href=../../2011/06/bridge-to-somewhere.html>has been made here</a> more than once—about solar photovoltaic technology. Lose track of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>whole systems and it’s easy to claim, as Polycarpou does, that because solar cells have become less expensive recently, vast acreages of solar photovoltaic cells will surely bail us out of the consequences of fossil fuel depletion. All you have to do is forget that the drop in PV cell costs has much less to do with the production and resource costs of the technology than with China’s familiar practice of undercutting its competitors to seize control of export markets, and pay no attention at all to the complex and finicky technical basis for modern PV cell manufacture or the sheer scale of the supply chains needed to keep chip plants stocked with raw materials, spare parts, solvents, and all the other requirements of the manufacturing process. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Does this mean that solar PV power is useless? Not at all. Buy and install PV panels now, while Chinese trade policy and an inflated dollar make them cheap, and you’ll still have electricity coming out of them decades from now, when they will be hugely expensive if they can be purchased at all. Anyone who’s actually lived with a homescale PV system can tell you that the trickle of electricity you can get that way is no substitute for 120 volts of grid power from big central power plants, but once expectations nurtured by the grid get replaced by a less extravagant sense of how electricity ought to be used, that trickle of electricity can be put to many good uses. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, in the window of opportunity opened up by those solar panels, other ways of producing modest amounts of electricity by way of sunlight, wind, and other renewable sources can be tested and deployed. My guess is that thermoelectric generators heated by parabolic mirrors will turn out to be the wave of the future, keeping the shortwave radios, refrigerators, and closed-loop solar water heaters of the ecotechnic future supplied with power; still, that’s just a guess. There are many ways to produce modest amounts of direct-current electricity with very simple technologies, and highly useful electrical and electronic equipment can readily be made with locally available materials and hand tools. The result won’t be anything you would expect to see in a high-tech geek future, granted, but it’s equally a far cry from the Middle Ages. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This last detail is the crucial point that Polycarpou grasps at the end of his essay, and his comment is important enough that it deserves quotation in full: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Putting these and other elements together – hi-tech, distributed communications, distributed energy and manufacturing, local sustainable food systems, appropriate technology and tactical urbanism among others – sets the stage for a future that looks quite a bit different than the present one. One might describe it as a kind of postmodern pastiche that looks neither like the antiquated futurisms we once imagined nor an idyllic return to preindustrial peasant society.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The future, in other words, is not going to be a linear extrapolation from the present—that’s the source of the “antiquated futurisms” he rightly criticizes—or a simple rehash of the past. The future is a foreign country, and things are different there. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That realization is the specter that haunts contemporary industrial society. For all our civilization’s vaunted openness to change, the only changes most people nowadays are willing to contemplate are those that take us further in the direction we’re already going. We’ve got fast transportation today, so there has to be something even faster tomorrow—that’s basically the justification Elon Musk gave for the Hyperloop, his own venture into antiquated futurism; we’ve got the internet today, so we’ve got to have some kind of uber-internet tomorrow. It’s a peculiar sort of blindness, and one that civilizations of the past don’t seem to have shared; as far as I know, for example, the designers of ancient Roman vomitoriums didn’t insist that their technology was the wave of the future, and claim that future societies would inevitably build bigger and better places to throw up after banquets. (Those of my readers who find this comparison questionable might want to take a closer look at internet content.)</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The future is a foreign country, and people do things differently there. It’s hard to think of anything that flies so comprehensively in the face of today’s conventional wisdom, or contradicts so many of the unquestioned assumptions of our time; thus it’s not surprising that Polycarpou, in suggesting it, seems to think that he’s disagreeing with me. Quite the contrary; there’s a reason why my most popular peak oil book is titled <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/E/The-Ecotechnic-Future>The Ecotechnic Future</a>, rather than <i>The Idyllic Peasant Future</i> or some such twaddle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>For that matter, I’m not at all sure that he realizes I would agree with his characterization of the near- to mid-range future as a “postmodern pastiche;” I’d suggest that the distributed communication will likely be much less high-tech than he thinks, and that hand tools and simple machinery will play a much larger role in the distributed manufacturing than 3D printers, but again, those are matters of detail. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s in the longer run, I suspect, that our visions of the future diverge most sharply. Technological pastiche and bricolage, the piecing together of jerry-rigged systems out of scraps of surviving equipment and lore, are common features of ages of decline; it’s as the decline nears bottom that the first steps get taken toward a new synthesis, one that inevitably rejects many of the legacy technologies of the past and begins working on its own distinct projects. Vomitoriums weren’t the only familiar<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>technology to land in history’s compost heap in the post-Roman dark ages; chariots dropped out of use, too, along with a great many more elements of everyday Roman life. New values and new ideologies directed collective effort toward goals no Roman would have understood, and the harsh limits on resource availability in the radically relocalized post-Roman world also left their mark. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What often gets forgotten in reviewing the dark ages of the past is that they were not lapses into the past but gropings forward into an unknown future. There was a dark age before the Roman world and a dark age after it; the two had plenty of parallels, some of them remarkably exact, but the technologies were not the same, and Greek and Roman innovations in information processing and storage—classical logic and philosophy, widespread literacy, and the use of parchment as a readily available and reusable writing medium—were preserved and transmitted in various forms, opening up possibilities in the post-Roman dark ages that were absent in the centuries that followed the fall of Mycenae. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the same way, the deindustrial future ahead of us will not be a rehash of the past, any more than it will be a linear extrapolation of the present. I’ve suggested, for reasons I’ve covered in a good many <a href=../../2007/05/glimpsing-deindustrial-age.html>previous posts here</a>, that we face a Long Descent of one to three centuries followed by a dark age very broadly parallel to the ones that followed Rome, Mycenae, and so many other dead civilizations of the past. That’s the normal result when catabolic collapse hits a society dependent on nonrenewable resources, but the way the process unfolds is powerfully shaped by contextual and historical factors, and no two passes through that process are identical. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s common enough in the universe of human experience. For example, it’s tolerably likely that you, dear reader, will have the experience of growing old, if you haven’t done so already.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s likely that at least some of your grandparents did exactly the same thing—but the parallel doesn’t mean that growing old will somehow transport you back to their era, much less to their lifestyles. Nor, I trust, would you be likely to believe somebody who claimed that getting old was by definition a matter of going back in time to your grandparents’ day and trading in your hybrid car for a Model T. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Some dimensions of growing old are hardwired into the experience itself—the wrinkles, the graying hair, and the slow buildup of physical dysfunctions with their inevitable end are among them. Other dimensions are up to you. In the same way, some of what happens when a civilization tips over in decline are reliable consequences of the mechanisms of catabolic collapse, or of the way those mechanisms interact with the ordinary workings of human collective psychology. The stairstep rhythm of crisis, stabilization, partial recovery, and renewed crisis, the spiral of conflict between centralizing and decentralizing forces, which eventually ends in the latter’s triumph; the rise of warband culture in the no man’s land outside the increasingly baroque and ineffective frontier defenses—you could set your watch by these, if its hands tracked decades, centuries and millennia.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Other aspects of the process of decline and fall are far less predictable. The radical relocalization that’s standard in eras of contraction and collapse means, among other things, that dark ages aren’t evenly distributed in space or time, and the disintegration of large-scale systems means, among other things, that minor twists of fate and individual decisions very often have much more dramatic consequences in dark ages than they do when the settled habits of a mature civilization constrain the impact of single events. Furthermore, the cultural, historical, and technological legacies of the former civilization always have a massive impact—it’s entirely possible, for example, that the dark age societies of deindustrial America will have such things as radio communication, solar water heaters, offroad bicycles, and ultralight aircraft—and so do the values and belief systems that reliably emerge as a civilization crashes slowly into ruin, and those who witness each stage of the process try to understand the experience and learn the lessons of its fall. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is why I’ve spent most of the last year exploring the civil religion of progress, the core ideology of contemporary industrial society, and sketching out some of the ways it distorts our view of history and the future. There’s a pleasant irony in the way that Polycarpou ends his essay with the standard ritual invocation of progress, insisting that even though the future will be impoverished by our standards, it will still be better according to some other measure. That sort of apologetic rhetoric will no doubt see plenty of use in the years ahead: as progress fails to happen on schedule, it’ll be tempting to keep on moving the goalposts so that the failure is a little less visible and the faithful can continue to believe.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Eventually, though, such exercises will be recognized as the charades they are. As the worship of progress loses its grip on the imagination of our age, we’ll see sweeping changes in what people value, what they want to accomplish, and thus inevitably what technologies they’ll find worth preserving or developing. The court of Charlemagne could certainly have had vomitoriums if anyone had wanted them; the technical ability was there, but the values of the age had shifted away from anything that made vomitoriums make sense. In the same way, even if our descendants have the technical ability to produce something like today’s internet, it’s entirely possible that they’ll find other uses for those technologies, or simply shake their heads, wonder why anybody would ever have wanted something like that, and put resources available to them into some completely different project.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style='font-family: Times; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>How that unfolds is a matter for the far future, and thus nothing we need to worry about now. As I wind up this sequence of posts, I want to talk instead about the roles that religion is likely to play in the near and middle future as the next round of catabolic collapse begins to bite. We’ll discuss that next week. </span></div>

A lack of understanding of whole systems among geek culture is especially strange to me given that computer networks are complex systems, and computers are amazing tools for modeling the often counterintuitive behavior of a variety of complex systems. <br><br>For instance, even though I'm awful at programming, I could still write a program that plays the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a population of "players" with initially random strategies (represented as 5 "genes" that determine their behavior in the first move and in each of 4 possible outcomes of the previous move). Each player plays all the others, and the most successful strategies have a better chance of "mating" with other strategies and continuing to a new "generation". <br><br>I saw lots of fascinating evolutionary behavior, including punctuated equilibrium (the system could settle into several hundred generations of similar strategies followed by a rapid shift in a few generations to a completely different set of strategies). It was interesting to consider that the basis for cooperative behavior could be shown by such a simple model - most strategies involved very little "backstabbing" of cooperative opponents. At the same time, the commonly-believed "best" strategy of tit-for-tat was very uncommon and rarely lasted long.<br><br>And I'm a terrible programmer - a real geek could design system models I can barely dream of. Yet there is still little understanding of how whole systems work when applied to human society and technological progress in particular. I wonder why it is so common for people who have tools to see how complex systems behave still fail to get it.<br><br>Also, one minor quibble: Roman vomitoria were passages for entering and exiting an amphitheater, not places where people vomited after a drunken feast.

This may be responsible for the Chinese order of society - very hierarchical, obedient, orderly - and arguably, for the sublimation of the individual to the collective, an economic strength in times of deprivation. Of course there are many factors at play, but they seem to be well-positioned for what is coming. And much less likely, on an individual level as well as collectively, to struggle against decline. And their religion, which is also a kind of science, is mostly about nature seeking balance. Not transcendence. It seems fitting that they take a pre-eminent position.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c2481608195680725256 title="comment permalink">10/30/13, 9:00 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c3268269251544763387></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/10215395969858186927 rel=nofollow>Derv</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Good article as always, JMG, but there's a rather serious historical error in your example of the vomitoria. That's a pop-historical myth along the lines of "Columbus was the only one who knew the world was round." There were no special rooms for vomiting, the word vomitorium refers to the large entrances and exits from which the crowds would "spew forth," and while the Romans loved a good party/orgy, very few were fans of throwing up. It happened, but it happens today, too, with drunken party-goers.<br><br>I suggest you use a different example. The public bath houses come to mind, for instance. The Roman world loved them and considered them a fundamental element of social and civilized life. Had they believed in our myth of progress, they may have imagined that one day all of Rome would be one big, steamy bath house of impeccable quality. Yet the practice faded gradually out of favor, and today, when we reflect on it, the idea of communal bathing seems bizarre to most.<br><br>There are other examples of course - I suppose aqueducts or complex idol mechanisms could work too - but you definitely don't want to talk about vomitoria. It's somewhat damaging to an essay and author whose recent work deal directly with historical expertise and identifying parallels with the past.<br><br>(As an aside, I would also note that your mention in a previous essay of Christ's ascension into heaven neglected to take Acts into consideration, which was initially a part of Luke and does state specifically that Christ ascends and disappears behind the clouds. Perhaps someone mentioned it earlier, but I didn't mention it before because it seemed like nitpicking.)<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c3268269251544763387 title="comment permalink">10/30/13, 9:47 PM</a><br><br>

We don't have the resources left to do that. At best, the high-level waste will be hauled to a handful of areas and stored in facilities that will, sooner or later, start leaking; at worst, the waste will be left where it is, and as one facility after another is abandoned, dead zones of various size will spring up in various corners of the world. A lot of people will die, some quickly, some slowly, some over the centuries to come. <br><br>That's pretty much baked in the cake at this point. Please note, though, that it doesn't justify the gaudy apocalyptic handwaving that's been based on it. There's plenty of data available on radionuclide dispersal from nuclear accidents of various kinds, and that data doesn't add up to the extermination of life on earth, the extinction of our species, or, really, much of anything else, except one more source of misery we're inflicting on our descendants. I'm more than half convinced that it's the realization that that's what we're doing that has made fantasies of imminent universal death so popular: convince yourself that we're all going to die soon anyway, and it's easier to ignore the very direct role of middle class lifestyles in poisoning people whose great-great-grandparents haven't even been born yet.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c4080893668039572507 title="comment permalink">10/30/13, 11:36 PM</a><br><br>

Nicole's position felt sort of like Asimov's foundation psychohistory, with the idea you can predict a general order of crises coming, with finance as the one that can change the quickest for the worse. I'd never have bet we'd be in this QE economic twilight zone, but then wonder whether to run from it (avoid debt) or like the local food coop looking at a 3-5 million dollar expansion, and a time of cheap debt and neighborhood folks looking to divest from the larger economy have an opportunty. But I admit I'm still in panick mode - whether to recommend productive debt without ever knowing enough where to invest. And the coop has PV on the roof, a fraction of its energy usage, but perhaps will be just enough if it has to abandon refrigeration in the future? Anyway, a better bet I think than having the while city borrowing a billion dollars for PV on a 100,000 homes.<br><br>I feel sometimes optimistic seeing whether lighting, heating or transportation, I see if we scale back our expectations, we can get by with a lot less, but we'll have to exchange that with more attention to details, like my friend's dad's lecturing me 15 years ago when I fell asleep reading at the off-the-grid cabin on PV and car batteries.<br><br>I'm glad you'll be getting back to religion next week. At the moment, churches seem the only organizing center of relocationation outside of finances. Perhaps the future will contain a movement to "restore the sabbath", separating ourselves from work, and maybe even from technology for one day a week? After centuries of churches dividing under theological lines in the sand, perhaps collapse opens the need for community churches to work together.<br><br>And thinking of local currency from Laurence Boomert's talk, its really hard to see, in a world where middle class need $50k/year to survive, but hopeful perhaps existing volunteer circles can get together with an hour-currency that can be earned for local service work, and even if it represents 0.0001% of the local money flow, maybe the logistics can be worked out and can expand under emergency periods of defaults and bank freezes.<br><br>Nicole called the economic system "fragile", but I'm still trying to thing of a better vision for what we face. The future is overpromised is the only thing that is undeniable.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c2202001808901190039 title="comment permalink">10/30/13, 11:40 PM</a><br><br>

You are using a few implicit assumptions that have to be proved to be a base for your argument. <br><br>1st assumption, for maintaining technological Infrastructure, resources have to be mined and transported from all over the world: I think in a steady state economy, the resources can cycle. Whenever some device goes out of use, local resources and rare materials are freed to be put to use again. <br><br>2nd Assumption, modern technology cannot work without all the rare earth materials that are used currently: This argument is often used with wind power, because rare earth magnets are used to improve the efficiency of the generators. However it is possible to build wind turbines without the use of any rare earth. The current way of implementing current technologies is not the only way possible. <br><br>3rd assumption, the current way of producing and implementing technology is the only way to do it: It is true that the supply chains for solar cells are widespread and huge. But actually solar cells themselves are not a very complex technology. Much research is done currently, especially in the field of organic solar cells, which use no rare materials at all and can be produced using simple technologies as printing. <br><br>4th assumption, The efficiency of our current production systems is maxed out: If you consider how much resources today are wasted by planned obsolescence it is easy to imagine how the same standard of living can be achieved in many areas while cutting resource use dramatically. I have worked with computers that are four decades old and still work well, so there is no need to replace electronics every few years. If you use stuff that is designed to last until it breaks you can stretch the lifecycles of devices enormously. Especially electronics with no moving parts and there circuits based on ceramics are practically free from deterioration. We know that electronics can be used for many decades, but since the technology is so young, we have not reached an upper limit for properly designed technology. <br><br>5th assumption, the current use of resources to maintain the internet is necessary to use it: The efficiency gains for the economy through the use of the internet have a diminishing marginal use. The simple possibility to send text messages in realtime around the world creates huge gains for the private, public and commercial institutions. You can communicate, trade, implement e-government. Attaching pictures is nice, but the marginal gains are comparably small. Streaming videos has even smaller marginal gains. So even if we have to reduce the capabilities of the internet to a percent or a even a permille of its current capacities, the price will not be the loss of internet, but the loss of those pesky video commercials. <br><br>So i agree with you, that the current ways of implementing technology in devices and using those devices is not sustainable and will fade. And we will have to leave some enjoyable habits especially in terms of transportation of goods and people. But i think that especially renewable energy and information technology can be implemented and maintained on a dwindling resource base. <br><br>The 21st century will show three big paradigm shifts in industrial production to maintain our energetic and informational infrastructure:<br><br>I. The current way of increasing material input to maximize the use of labor will shift to maximizing the use of materials by increasing the input of labor. <br><br>II. The current way of increasing production numbers to reduce marginal cost (mass production) will shift to increasing the marginal use of a product by creating individual solutions ("mass customization"). <br><br>III. Increased resource cost will destroy the economic model of being cheaper and force producers to shift to the economic model of being better. So producers will shift from mass production of products with short lifecycles to products of higher quality with longer lifecycles.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c735615460001824502 title="comment permalink">10/31/13, 1:05 AM</a><br><br>

Not transcendence." <br><br>I cannot speak for all theist religions, of course, but I have a few things to say about at least one theist religion I know a bit of and transcendence: Islam. Although I don't pretend to be an expert in Islamic theology, my reading of Koranic Scripture is that each person must live for the here and now whilst preparing for the hereafter at the same time. <br><br>Indeed, the very basis of Islamic value system are (1) tell the truth, (2) have good relationships with your family, friends and neighbours, (3) work for social justice (always)!<br><br>Transcendence comes after you have done all that on a daily basis. And Transcendence is NOT a flight away from the human condition or even nature, it is an attempt to get closer to the Divine whilst one's feet remaining firmly on the ground. <br><br>I know that to quote Koranic scripture nowadays is a risky business, but given the level of understanding people around here display, it might be worth it!<br><br>"And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance"[al-Isra' 17:37]<br><br>"And turn not your face away from men with pride" [Luqmaan 31:18]<br><br>"And be moderate (or show no arrogance) in your walking, and lower your voice" [Luqmaan 31:19]<br><br>"The All-Merciful has taught the Quran<br>He created man and He taught him the explanation.<br>The sun and the moon to a reckoning,<br>and the stars and trees bow themselves;<br>and heaven - He raised it up and set the balance.<br>Transgress not in the balance,<br>and weight with justice, and skimp not in the balance.<br>And earth - He set it down for all beings,<br>therein fruits and palm trees with sheaths,<br>and grain in the blade, and fragrant herbs.<br>Of which your Lord's bounties will you and you deny? (Quran 55:1-12).<br><br>For me, those verses show how important it is to remain steadfast to core values I mentioned earlier and no flights away from the human condition there or from nature either given that Koranic Scripture enjoins us to be like a steward to the earth! <br><br>In short, my understanding of Islam is Truth and Justice + Stewardship of the Earth + Transcendence (last but not least!)<br><br>Now I apologise for the length of this post and be reminded that in NO way am I interested in proselytising. <br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c5549972325294505891 title="comment permalink">10/31/13, 3:31 AM</a><br><br>

And people who do consider themselves technology geeks are lucky if they understand one or two layers well, and that understanding only lasts for a few years before it is rendered obsolete by some new layer. <br><br>So the layers hide the complexity of the whole. Same could be said of any modern system: manufacturing, food production, road travel, medicine, etc. It's impossible to try to understand all these layers as individuals, our brains just aren't big enough.

I have always thought that the biggest component of progress is the information that was generated by the flow of all previous progress. The knowledge of how to forge a short sword for a Roman soldier was not forgotten by the societies that came after, and I believed that the ability of producing a furnace for smelting metals is totally within my grasp, after a visit to the local junkyards. <br>Recent events have somewhat changed my attitudes about that. I was loading a batch of books on a friend’s E-reader, and realized that most information is already in an electronic form. I almost never read physical books or magazines anymore. Even though I know I could produce a working power source from a visit to the junkyard, most people could not do that without an internet connection.<br>It is not much of a stretch to believe that the majority of information that our tech society has produced could be totally lost, especially if education and research continue to head towards electronic platforms for information dissemination. <br>I guess my point is – I now believe a reset to a new dark age is possible.

That may seem like an odd statement until one looks at how many of our current technologies were boosted into the mainstream by conflict. Having been to Somalia, and, later, discussed conditions there with a nephew who was there 20 years later, the availability of cell phone service was, at least initially, boosted by warring factions and their warlords who had the need to communicate and the means to bring this tech into their theater of influence. Early adopters often have questionable motives.<br><br>Another example, from Wikipedia:<br> <br><i>"In 1795 the French military offered a cash prize of 12,000 francs for a new method to preserve food. Nicolas Appert suggested canning, and the process was first proven in 1806 in tests conducted by the French navy. Appert was awarded the prize in 1810 by Count Montelivert, a French minister of the interior."</i><br><br>Perhaps our most prevalent form of food preservation came into its own during the Napoleonic Wars to provide better nutrition for soldiers, to give them an edge over the enemy. I expect that this will be a primary driver as we adapt current technology to the limitations inherent in our de-industrialized future. Short-term survival trumps the long view every time.<br><br>Last year we switched our internet from the giant telecom to a local company started by a friend who has built a wide area network, placing long range wifi transceivers on our mountain tops that can be accessed, line-of-site, by most people in the county. This system has turned out to be more reliable than the wired DSL service, which was previously the only option (one that many didn't have), besides dial-up. The system can operate independent of the greater world wide web, if only for local communications and information exchange. While I won't speculate as to how long this equipment can be maintained, I can envision this line-of-site system being adapted to other forms of communications, be it simple radio repeaters, or perhaps signal lights or fires.

Reason being that people are lazy at least from a high energy culture's vantage point. Ordinary people have an extremely good ability to judge value returned on energy invested. As soon as they discover that some techno gizmo takes up more time and energy to keep running than it saves them, they will discard it. This is not to say that in some cases they couldn't keep the gizmo running by ingenious means but that to keep it running wouldn't be worth the trouble. Take any portable electric device. What would derail its use? not that you couldn't get the rare earth metals to make the innards of the thing but rather, that you couldn't get those teeny weeny batteries any more. Yes, some geek could probably rig up some lead acid substitute but that would turn the mobile device into a stationary one. <br>Or take something as simple as running water. Running water requires electric pumps. Given an intermittent supply of electricity, you would soon be reverting to a hand pump out in the yard assuming you could get one. Sure you have to go outside in all kinds of weather or build a pump house to keep the pump from freezing, but that would be preferable to not knowing when you would have water. If you were an optimist and expected the electric supply to get better you might take temporary measures such as filling up a bathtub or plastic water bottles whenever water pressure was there. You might even build your own private reservoir out in the yard and fill that up whenever the water was running, but in the end, you would probably revert to something simpler such as a hand pump that could supply water on demand. <br>Going camping for a few weeks in relatively primitive environments such as campgrounds with no hookups and no campground store is a good lab for finding out how soon your technology turns worthless once the supply chain is disrupted. To charge your electro gizmos, you will have to rely on your car assuming you are car camping. If you are not car camping, you will have to carry lots of spare batteries. Same goes for your gas stove. You will have to carry extra gas canisters to keep it going. Again, extend the time line from a few weeks to a few months and you would decide that to carry months worth of stove fuel is not worth the convenience of a gas stove and that you would just as soon boil your water on a wood fire.<br>Think of what it would take to keep any technology running in an environment of diminished resources and what you come up with is that once you drop below the point where the technology can no longer support itself economically, it will disappear and along with it, all the other technologies that depend on it. And an economy is nothing more than a lot of people making the decision of whether something is worth the trouble of doing or keeping alive.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c9190783516688070113 title="comment permalink">10/31/13, 7:57 AM</a><br><br>

My company mission is to create whole systems, which produce useful things such as food, soil fertility, animal habitat, which besides sun, wind, water, entropy, there are small to no need of outside energy sources. As apposed to square bushes, and green lawns that you could bounce a quarter off, which require the burning of fossil fuels, spraying of chemicals, importing of fertilizers, etc. In other words systems that require huge amounts of energy giving nothing but a nod to what chemical companies and the like want your yard to be. If one were to stand and look at each system, comparing them with the most scientific of standards; no one could argue that the whole system approach is not far superior to the high energy input and diminishing return system. Right? Well I can tell you that cognitive dissonance is a strong bed fellow. I have become very aware that there are two very strong forces at work in our collective cultural mind; that of the out comes of scientific studies,or mindful observation of patterns, and that of finely tuned marketing campaigns. The problem may be that the marketing tells folks to just keep doing what they are doing, which is what folks generally want to do.

I design such things as switching power supplies, analog circuits and protection systems for industrial products used in harsh electrical and physical environments. Further, we are a manufacturing facility in the same facility, and I have been heavily involved in manufacturing for all that time. I say this to establish some credibility for my opinion that a large amount of our electronic equipment will become useless much more rapidly than most imagine. There are several aspects to this.<br><br>First, the physical equipment that exists now and will be produced in the coming years. People have the misconception that electronics last forever. Many electronics goods (the stuff that does not fail right out of the box anyway) are disposed of because of technical obsolescence or changes of fashion, and so the finite life span is not observed. Nonetheless, electronic components and assemblies have specific failure modes and finite lifetimes. Electrolytic capacitors are the shortest lifetime parts, but LEDs and even internal semiconductors age. Lead free solder and associated metallurgy have created new failure modes. Environmental exposure and corrosion take their toll, along with heat and power dissipation. Add on top poor design and/or manufacturing practices and exposure to electrical faults and surges (such as when the power grid becomes less stable). <br><br>Second are the incredibly complex supply chains needed to get the parts and equipment to users. Semiconductors are made in fabs mostly on the other side of the world, with highly complex equipment made somewhere else, specialized materials from yet others, run from power systems that must provide very clean and steady power. Finished wafers go to other places, often other continents, for lead frames and encapsulation (yet more specialized materials). Then they are shipped to manufacturing facilities all over the world, with finished goods and subassemblies shipped yet again. It would only take a few shortages of materials, a little geo-political or economic disruption, or some natural disasters to break that chain.<br><br>Third, there are the institutions and organizations. We used to have large corporate research institutions, such as Western Electric's Bell Labs and RCA's Sarnoff Labs. The profits needed to support such ventures long since disappeared. We used to graduate lots of engineers with the skills to design these products, but those jobs mostly left with the manufacturing. Once these organizations are gone, they cannot be rebuilt quickly. The Chinese have them now, but it has taken them a lot of investment to get there. Although I am resourceful, I cannot do the same kinds of things at home as I can at work – there are not the people, resources and equipment there. The guys I work with are at least in their late 40's, and I don't see many younger people with the skills to do this work. It won't be too long before I'm too old to do it anymore – in truth it's losing it's interest now. That point will come much sooner if I'm distracted by crisis, such as lack of money or food or shelter. Hungry and/or homeless people don't design circuits well. <br><br>I have been entertaining myself by trying to design our latest generation of hardware to last as long as possible, to the point of resurrecting early circuit designs to eliminate all electrolytic caps.

Since nobody knows in advance just how it's going to come crashing down, it's a gamble whatever you do -- though staying out of debt is probably the wiser plan generally. My $.02, at least. <br><br>Alexander, if you're going to quote somebody, please cite the source!<br><br>KL, my guess is that people a millennium from now will remember us as something very close to evil incarnate, and will shiver when they think of the punishment meted out to us by whatever deities they worship. <br><br>Robo, instead of just hoping that somebody gets around to reviving and retooling those old and durable skills, why not get to work on that process? <br><br>Deedl, that is to say, you're quibbling over details. I'm fine with that; as I mentioned in my post, exactly which technologies will survive and which will prove unsustainable can't be known in advance -- and I specifically addressed your second and third points, by the way, so you may want to reread the post. What we do know is that, per White's law, the complexity of a society is a function of its per capita consumption of energy, and as access to cheap abundant fossil fuels goes away, a lot of what passes for business as usual will go away as well. Beyond that -- well, what are you personally doing to see to it that technologies you consider valuable are preserved into the future? That's where the rubber meets the road, you know. <br><br>Sunseeker, got it and thank you! <br><br>Karim, you're certainly right that a blindness to whole systems is hardwired into industrial culture. As for the Koran, I'll certainly accept your take on it -- I've read an English translation, but don't claim to have anything like an adequate knowledge of Muslim theology, particularly when it comes to issues of immanence vs. transcendence. This is one of the reasons I focus on American culture and its future, rather than trying to draw conclusions about the planet as a whole. <br><br>Daniel, is the nuclear plant near your family farm still operating, and is high level waste stored on site? If the answer to both those questions is "no," you don't have much to worry about; tribal shamans in the far future will put cow skulls on sticks to warn people away from the facility itself, since that-which-strikes-dead-from-a-distance will still be emanating from the wreckage of the reactor itself, but if you're more than a couple miles from the cow skulls you have nothing to worry about. <br><br>Yupped, an excellent point. <br><br>Chris, nah, the UFO business is a spent force -- it has about as much of a future these days as, say, Spiritualism. (Given that the whole fracas was basically manufactured by the US Air Force as camouflage for spyplanes and early surveillance satellites, as I've discussed in my book <a href="http://www.llewellyn.com/product.php?ean=9780738713199" rel=nofollow>The UFO Phenomenon</a>, it was pretty much guaranteed not to have too long of a shelf life.) It's the next wave of religious innovation that's likely to catch the wave of the rising religious sensibility, and predicting the forms that will take is a challenging task!<br><br>Phitio, you really do need to check your facts before making blanket statements like that. I've written here quite often about climate change, and incorporated it into my predictions since the early days of this blog -- if you follow up the link I gave to <a href=../../2007/05/glimpsing-deindustrial-age.html rel=nofollow>this 2007 summary of my views</a>, you'll find climate change very much included. What I don't factor in, except as evidence for the popularity of apocalyptic fantasy, are the currently popular but scientifically unjustifiable claims that climate change is going to wipe us all out by 2030, or what have you; as I commented a while back, that's simply the inevitable successor to the late and unlamented 2012 delusion.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c4648199312130803700 title="comment permalink">10/31/13, 11:12 AM</a><br><br>

History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes?<br><br>As I read the phrase: <br>"...even though the future will be impoverished by our standards, it will still be better according to some other measure. That sort of apologetic rhetoric will no doubt see plenty of use in the years ahead: as progress fails to happen on schedule, it’ll be tempting to keep on moving the goalposts so that the failure is a little less visible and the faithful can continue to believe."<br><br>I couldn't help but flash on the rhetoric of Goebbels and the Third Reich, which moved away from the tub-thumping boastfulness of the early war years to eventual insistence that, despite the increasingly bleak outlook after a string of devastating defeats, viz., El Alamein, Stalingrad, Kursk, Liri Valley, Operation Ovelord, that miracle weapons were just coming online that would turn the tide (and almost did). But their failing was while they focused on very high-quality tanks and planes, the Soviets realized that quantity has a quality all its own and if it cost five T-34 to every Tiger, they could produce six or seven for every one the Germans could.<br><br>Likewise, as the evidence became inescapable that the Soviet Union and its copycat pseudo-communist nations were becoming ever more brutal and repressive, the true believers, even in the West, kept insisting that things were really getting better, or would one day soon (and some still do!)... until over three heady days, the Berlin Wall was torn down by mobs, and then, one evening, the entire population went outside and shouted "NO MORE!' and the politburo was chased from Hrady Castle, and one day Gorbachev uttered the phrase "former Soviet Union"... and that was pretty much it.<br><br>But to add to my previous thoughts on monasteries and surrounding lay communities, my idea is not yet clear enough in my mind that I can reduce it to a short description. Something about communities with a single primary focus that succeed in difficult times. The focus can be prayer or it could be a strong-hold under control of a local <i>comes</i> or <i>jarl</i> who provides refuge in time of danger to defend against roving bands of brigands.<br>Most western monasteries were not really different, being run by a head with almost absolute authority and requiring armed guards -- from the lay community -- and walls and towers for defense. They were sacked because they were wealthy because the business of selling spirituality was very profitable. Towns and manors were also attacked for much the same reasons.<br><br>As to the wherefore of celibacy for monasteries, there is, at least in the west, possibly in other cultures about which I cannot say, a strong tradition that sensual pleasures distract from and weaken focus on the spiritual. However, I am suggesting that this is not really necessary, as groups such as the Amish have managed to maintain a spiritual focus with the expectation of having large families, and I am suggesting that the manorial-based feudal system that became common across Europe after the disappearance of the Western Roman Empire existed in tandem with and was just as successful as the monastic system, without religion as its primary focus.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c3314763336237964178 title="comment permalink">10/31/13, 12:18 PM</a><br><br>

By that I mean predicting that this or that technology or social order will or won't be prevalent, because it was or wasn't in use at some particular past reference date. It's always easy to find absurdities following from that method (whale oil lamps, anyone?) but it keeps coming up, probably because it's an easy starting point that doesn't tax ones imagination too much.<br><br>A different interesting starting point came up in a thread in my "home" forum a few weeks ago. The topic was, if the earth never had fossil fuels, what would the present look like? When and how would our history have veered off of our timeline? (Keep in mind that British imperial wealth and American resource wealth would still have existed, so some degree of growth and development would have occurred anyhow. By now, though, we would be 150 years or so past Peak Wood.)<br><br>Among the revelations of the background reading I did for that discussion was the ecotechnic excellence of the early-1800s canal system in the northeastern US. I'm not convinced that railroads will ever fall into complete disuse, but if they did, canals (requiring many orders of magnitude less metal worked at a lower level of tooling) would remain viable at a moderate level of social order, even if they had to be built anew by hand shovels, as they were in the 1800s.<br><br>This is a completely plausible scenario to me: a barge heads west on the Erie Canal, which is back to its original 40 foot width and 3-4 foot depth. The barge is drawn by a mule (named Piston, not Sal) and laden with twenty bolts of denim, six rolls of mylar for solar concentrator surfacing, and the electronics for a cell phone tower.<br><br>In each instance (the mule/barge/canal versus a railroad or a horse cart, the denim versus factory-made ready-to-wear jeans or nothing because hand-loomed local homespun is used upstate instead, mylar made of costly organic compounds versus polished bronze or silvered glass, the cell tower versus telephone lines or post riders or smoke signals) the means chosen happen to be the least costly way to get the job done. That's least costly in whole-systems cost. It's not about when something was invented, nor about how complex it is. The latter is of course a large factor in the cost, but not necessarily the deciding factor.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c216226824072151048 title="comment permalink">10/31/13, 12:19 PM</a><br><br>

Russia also has public bathhouses. <br><br>One needs public order, a reliable water supply and some concentration of population for a public bathhouse to be practical.<br><br>Public bathhouses were built in American cities in the nineteenth century both for recreational purposes and as a public health measure. Total immersion in hot water takes a lot of water and a lot of heating. Public bathhouses are an easier and more energy efficient way for people to get clean than bathtubs in private houses. I'm told that in England well into the postwar period, it was commonplace for an entire family to take turns bathing in the same bathwater, because of the expense of heating the water.<br><br>This is an instance of a common facility being a more resource efficient way of providing a good than the household economy. <br>Taking your unbaked loaves to the bakery instead of firing up an oven at home is another. In poor countries, most people can't bake leavened bread at home, because an oven takes a lot of space and fuel and it is more cost-effective to do a lot of baking at one time.

Many new domestic systems are grid-tied (largely because subsidies increasingly require grid-tie), may have no batteries and the panels may have built-in micro-inverters. These features will complicate the use of these PVs outside the paradigm within which they were designed to operate - a supplement to grid electricity with easy access to spare parts.

The difference between putting microwaves into the air and putting food and water on somebody's table is significant, and too rarely remembered these days. <br><br>Ekkar, that's a crucial point. People will continue to do stupid things even when those stupidities cost them dearly, if they're convinced that those things are what they're supposed to do. <br><br>SLClaire, true enough, and it's those who don't want to have to make the decisions that matter who are loudest in insisting that decisions don't matter. I'll be discussing this shortly.

The figure/ground distinction is a good one, and may help some people to grasp just how great their vulnerability is. <br><br>Matt, true enough! It's precisely the myth of the machine -- more precisely, the subset of that myth that claims that whatever comes out of a machine must be better than what's made by a person -- that makes people think that shoddy plastic gewgaws are somehow an improvement on handicrafts. <br><br>Raven, thanks for the tip -- I haven't read Heather's latest, and clearly I need to. <br><br>Robo, of course not. The important thing is that you're doing something. <br><br>Renaissance, we'll be talking about manorial feudalism at some length down the road a bit. The short form is that yes, it's an extremely resilient system, which is why it's been reinvented in the wake of every civilizational collapse on record. Monasticism isn't a substitute for that system, but a parallel system that meshes well with dark age realities, and has the additional benefit of preserving knowledge much more effectively than the manorial system does. <br><br>Myriad, that's why I made canals a standard mode of transport in my fictional 25th-century North America in <a href=http://starsreach.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>Star's Reach</a>.

What we missed was that future is not carbon copy of history. We had too strong vision that future shall be reverting back to former systems. Worst possible linear thinking, when you look at it in retrospect. Your books and this blog has made me and some of my friends to reassess our assumptions, and that is hard lesson for any adult person.<br><br>Still, I feel that one piece is missing from your vision about future curve of permanent economic contraction and environmental depletion. That is effect of forthcoming pervasive low-level violence and insecurity on values and choices of coming generations. You know, there was good reason why post-Roman Europe chose otherworldly religion that gave solace in the afterlife as it's unifying force. Being believer in nature is easy when you can admire it's amazing complexity from cosy position of current global middle class. <br><br>Have you seen "Law and disorder in Philadelphia", documentary by Louis Theroux..? I have this strong supposition that those inner city dwellers in your country won't find solace and bliss from any Green movement religion when central order erodes even further away. Human being who lives in awful, insecure conditions wants justice (whatever it means to that person) and some guarantee that one day heavy burden shall be lifted from one's shoulders, and invitation to table so full of food that it's sagging is already sent to that person. That is core content of religiosity for truly poor people, if I have interpreted their message right.<br><br>For example, Lutherans in Liberia and members of different ethnic splinter groups in Near East, modernly called Balkans, have more tangible need to believe in some sort of divine justice than among those representing arm-chair generals of Western middle class. And oh boy imagery of retribution is truly lively and elaborate.<br><br>So I believe that near-to middle future forecasts have much more religious fundamentalism to offer, with deviants hanging from Catherine wheels or necklaced like they do in South Africa already, with plaques like "eater of human flesh", "rapist", "sodomite" and "banker" showing hapless sinner's original crime. Justice has quite straightforward face in environment where poor is stealing from poor, and one stolen, sturdy meal can tip delicate balance between chronic but survivable malnutrition and starvation and disease. <br><br>Human nature just is like that, when things turn truly claustrophobic stern attitude crawls in... We are three warm meals away from barbarism. This cultural bias towards grotesque sentimentality plaguing current Western society, wonderfully pictured in his books by Theodore Dalrymple, has already ensured that Western dark ages shall take quite sinister turn. Nations with more realistic and healthy attitude towards basic nature of mankind, like Russia, probably survive with less chaos and useless bloodshed. <br><br>So have you taken into account effects of forthcoming billow of low-level insecurity, violence, and drug abuse that shall swallow also those who try to stay out of it, as easy prey for dominant predator gangs? I suggest this kind of zeitgeist probably shall have impact on spiritual landscape of next generations also.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c3676209372798947539 title="comment permalink">10/31/13, 2:52 PM</a><br><br>

I think a potent synthesis is attainable here, and the two philosophies are not quite so far apart as they may seem. Our accustomed mode of dialogue in the US usually involves shouting the other side down and considering them anathema, so if both sides can get past that, perhaps these discussions will be more fruitful than most Internet banter.<br><br>I seem to remember that you commented a couple weeks ago about a ham radio post in the near future, and I would be interested to read that. Another well-known commentator I would like to see you dialogue with is Bruce Perens, who evidently spearheaded the effort to remove the CW Morse-code requirement from amateur license exams, and is currently promoting digital voice modes for the ham bands. Being a child of the tech boom, I find these technologies very interesting, but they are utterly dependent on those pesky semiconductors. But I find the idea of using my accustomed QWERTY keyboard with PSK modes to reach somebody on the other side of the continent or world to be highly appealing.<br><br>I will likely go for my ham ticket in December or January, once farm life calms down a bit. It seems that digital radio modes tend to require two separate sound cards, one for transmission and one for reception... but if I can jerry-rig an external sound device of some sort, I think I will find great pleasure in repurposing throwaway tablet computers into low-infrastructure long-range communicators.

I know that "natural" variability takes from 1000 to 100.000 to unfold, but mind that such changes were forced by natural drivers (mostly volcanic activity) which had similar timeframe. Human activity can be compared to an abrupt massive eruption of a voulcanic district compressed in less than 200 years. Recent studies have found strict relatonships between massive voulcanic activities in the past and big extinction events. The unknown in present situation is the inertial response of the earth system to such an impulsive forcing. Being a really complex system, the velocity of response can change abruptly. Don't be linear in considering this. For sure, the co2 is at levels never esperienced in 4 million years. This is a fact. To better understand the point, maybe the Tim Flannery's book "The Weather Makers" could be useful, where the concept of "magic doors" in climate shifts is evidenced. <br><br>Sorry if I was too abrupt in my previous post<br>Phitio<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c591534221685067428 title="comment permalink">11/1/13, 12:50 AM</a><br><br>

I do agree that our disagreements are probably primarily questions of detail, not of substance--though details do matter.<br><br>I am chastened by your assertion that I am not a whole-systems thinker (I certainly think of myself as such--inasumch as it’s possible); I guess I need to be more clear in both my thought and writing.<br><br>In retrospect I should probably have clarified my perspective. Given the wide range of possible futures, I believe in taking a scenarios approach, as David Holmgren and Rob Hopkins do. My point here is only that scenarios like those that Carson promotes in the body of his work that I am familiar with (which may not have been clear from his recent post) fall well within the range of “reasonable” scenarios Holmgren outlines (ie not “technoexplosion”), and are not difficult to imagine as nested within those scenarios at given points in time.<br><br>Part of the confusion between your views and Carson’s may rest in significantly different views of history. Not to speak for him, but from my understanding of his work, Carson believes that the industrial model of the 20th century was actually a tragic detour from the technological and social innovation that could have arisen from the human disaster of the so-called industrial revolution -- Lewis Mumford’s “neotechnic” path. This detour happened because of a continuous and long-standing collusion between corporate interests and governments to subsidize and reward economies of scale that empowered big, hideously wasteful enterprise and quashed more efficient and humane home scale production. <br><br>According to Carson, the unfolding collapse we are now experiencing is an opportunity to return to that former trajectory, using the new technological and social innovations of peer-to-peer networks and distributed manufacturing. This is still “progress” but I think a more nuanced view than the quasi-religious one you caricature. <br><br>Of course, this vision doesn’t work as well in our present world without the Internet or some form of modern communications (at least in the short to medium term) which is why that conversation is so important. The question of materials sourcing is also paramount. <br><br>An interesting study on a future Internet in an intermittent energy future:<br><br>http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~barath/papers/intermittent-eenergy12.pdf<br><br>Raghavan also had an interesting post in Resilience about the constraints on computing in an energy-decent world:<br><br>http://www.resilience.org/stories/2012-02-01/computing-long-emergency<br><br><br>Regarding satellites versus undersea cables: can you reference an emergy study which compares the embodied energy between the two? This is what I was referring to. Of course having a satellite program requires tremendous complexity.<br><br>Regarding cell phones in Africa and elsewhere: of course I understand that making cell phones (at least currently) requires a global industrial network. My point is that its deep penetration into the poorest parts of the world suggests that it is a high-leverage tool. It makes sense to me that in an era of energy decent, a few centralized industries continue to produce such high-value, low-cost tools, especially as they facilitate regional and community resilience and efficiency. <br><br>Good luck to us all navigating the foreign country of the future!<br><br>Lakis<br><br>http://nea-polis.net/<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c8463324694793941587 title="comment permalink">11/1/13, 7:15 AM</a><br><br>

Looking back whatever distance one cares to, it is clear that we have lived through an accelerating anomaly, a unique experience made possible by a set of transient conditions. That acceleration -- in a mathematical sense, an exponential growth pattern -- came to feel like a normal state of being for many of us. The year 1985 was crazy great, until we got to 1990, which was even better. Then came 1995 -- wow -- and then 2000 topped that. Then when it didn't seem like things could grow any faster or get any crazier, we hit 2005. The idea of going back to 1985, which was great at the time, is now really scary. The idea of going back to the development approach of 1895 is terrifying.</i><br><br>...<br><br><i>The fractal nature of it means that we don't need to wait for the government or for some well-funded developer to come in and transform everything. The New Urbanist city fits together like Darwin's coral reef; it grows and evolves and builds on the work of others, always filling in the gaps with something that works.<br><br>This was the approach we used when we were a much poorer country. It is an approach that allowed us to build some of the most beautiful places the United States has ever seen, places we destroyed with the heavy-handed approach we've used in the auto era. And it was a financially-resilient system, a sharp contrast to the too-big-to-fail, Ponzi scheme mess we've gotten ourselves into at every level today.</i><br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c4067354654689866711 title="comment permalink">11/1/13, 7:44 AM</a><br><br>

We've been tapped to roll out and get feedback from the public on the Regional Transportation Plan.<br><br>Some of the things that the Washington Department of Transportation (WashDOT) want to tell the public are revealing.<br><br>1. Due to reduced State Revenues, less Revenue Sharing from the Fed, and the fact that our roads are wearing out much faster (20 years vice 50 years) than expected due to heavier use than planned, we can't build new roads. Actually, we can't afford to maintain the roads and bridges we already have. We will have to triage and prioritize what we want to maintain, what we want to downgrade (ie. pavement to gravel) and what we will have to do without.<br><br>2. Due to demographic changes; boomers aging and driving less, and millenials tending to not even get driver's licenses, much less own cars, there is more demand for transit and a likely reduction in car use.<br><br>3. Designing transportation infrastructure strictly for cars is a waste of scarce resources.<br><br>One consequence of this is that WashDOT is no long using "level of Use" (LOS), which only measures number of cars as it's transport metric. They have switched to "Corridor Capacity", which measures freight ton miles and passenger miles instead. So, when a municipality says "we need another lane" the State is apt to ask "Are your buses running full, and can you add buses and/or routes?" Further, states will only continue funding if the projects are successful.<br><br>In one respect this may be seen as moving the goal posts, in another, it seems like a shift to a more realistic mind set on the part of at least our State planners. And I like their desire to share the information and their response to it honestly with the public.<br><br>Doing less with less (prioritizing) and being up front with the public both strike me as refreshing and historic changes.<br><br>Glenn<br><br>Marrowstone Island<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c3138772927773052953 title="comment permalink">11/1/13, 11:06 AM</a><br><br>

They're not as efficient as the tellurides, but work at higher temps and don't wear out as fast.<br><br>Another issue I found was the sublimation of the tellurides (especially), resulting in inefficiencies, shunting, etc., so these have a wear out mechanism as well.

A multitude of inputs, themselves the products of enormously compex systems, would account for this high productivity. What happens when these complex support systems start to degrade? What happens to farm productivity? <br><br>What will it mean in our own situation where, for reasons of scarce energy or no longer available technology, a farm family can no longer feed 50 others but maybe 30 others or 20 others. What if the change isn't gradual, giving time to adapt?<br><br>In the examples of previous civilizational collapses, the farmer, as a proportion of the total population, was far higher than nowadays. How many farm families were there as a percentage of the population in Roman times for example? <br><br>What if in Roman times or Mycenaean times the ratio was 60 or 70 farm families producing food for every 40 or 30 families that did something else for a living? I would think that this higher proportion of food producers would have given some resilience to immediate post-collapse, post-Roman or post-Mycenaean societies. Maybe an element of resilience that we don't have. <br><br>I would guess that there would have been a good deal of stress in some parts of the immediate post Roman world, for example, from barbarian incursions and the displacement of at least some of the original population from their lands. But there must have been large areas that noticed little difference because, after all, marauding tribes and their families would not have been that large a proportion of the total population. <br><br>But, even if there were new faces in the manor house, so what? After the initial wonderment and fear, I'll bet it meant little change in everyday life ie in the cycle of planting, harvesting, birth and death. In short, as the song goes, meet the new (Teuton) boss, same (in most ways) as the old (Roman) boss. The new boss must have known that his well being depended on the peasants doing what they had always done and so would have disrupted their activities as little as possible ie get the ploughing, planting, harvesting done and give me my piece. <br><br>Maybe there were instances where the boss of the manor house didn't even change, where news of the ouster of the last Roman emperor was largely a matter of indifference.

However, the great advantage of electronic information technology is that it moves so quickly and inexpensively from "library" to "reader". (By "library", I mean to include Wikipedia.) But if the end of cheap energy limits access to the Internet, will we have the ability to produce sufficient books? I propose that we start tabulating our own holdings of books most likely to be useful, and offer "consulting librarian services" to each other. <br><br>For example, if you wanted to know the parameters of paraffin wax as a solar thermal storage material, I could look at page 6-11 of Solar Energy Handbook (Krieder and Kreith, McGraw-Hill, 1981), and tell you that it melts at 47C (117F), has a heat of fusion of 209 kJ/kg (90 Btu/lb), weighs about 800 kg/cubic meter (50 lb/cu. ft), has a heat capacity (without state change) of about 2.7 kJ/kg-degreeC (0.65 Btu/lb-degreeF), and so on.<br><br>This is a great book, by the way, if you're interested in the topic (even including a chapter on wind energy, because (you know) the sun makes the wind blow).<br><br>Did you know, for example, that a typical cooking burner has a heating capacity of about 1 kW, bringing 2L of water to boil in about 10 min.

So if you have a solar collector creating 100 C air in a 23C environment, the efficiency is less than 77/373, or 21%. But that assumes no losses due to friction of the parts, etc. This calculation is just as valid for steam-piston engines, hot-air piston engines (Stirling), or steam turbines; it's the other (non-thermodynamic) inefficiencies that force any real system to fall short. Stirling engines have greater losses than steam engines, which Stirling knew, but he reasoned that the danger of steam explosion would overwhelm its efficiency.

Coal to Liquids has produced 40% of South Africa's oil for many years at less than $50 a barrel, and there are many countries with coal resources that could do the same, if they have the wit to build the plants before a spike in conventional oil production trashes the global economy and the opportunity to get coal to liquids up and running is missed.<br>All that, of course, merely contributes to the 'other' problem - the damage to our living habitat that ongoing emissions of carbon et al are having. McKibben of 350.org and others have pointed out that we must now leave most of the proven reserves of fossil fuel in the ground if we are to avoid utterly catastrophic climate change. Recent papers have pointed out that the climate in the tropics will move completely outside of the currently observed temperature ranges by the 2050s, with the rest of the world following suit thereafter. So we have very little time. But there does not appear to be any underlying resource limit that will conveniently reduce emissions to a sustainable level in time (sustainable for the human-sustaining biosphere, that is).<br>Your view of catabolic collapse is based mainly on loss of critical resources, and for sure some will expire in the next few decades, but the most critical ones - the resources that give rise to greenhouse gas emissions - will not be depleted enough to make any useful difference over the next few decades.<br>So the ONLY available 'solution' to the most pressing problem of a degrading climate has to be a social and hence political turnaround from our present path. <br>Somehow we have to find the conviction, will and capability to start living in a way that only requires emission of 'safe' levels of greenhouse gasses. <br>So compared to 'your' resource-driven collapse, we are instead confronted with the most urgent need to totally reconfigure all human activity in a way that allows civilisation to 'function' while giving the climate the ability to return to a more anthropo-friendly state with CO2 declining from 400 ppm back to the more comfortable -250 ppm pre-industrial state. We have to accomplish this feat in less than one generation - 20 to 30 years is the most time we have to achieve this or the opportunity will be lost and most of mankind doomed to extinction. This will entail a completely different form of 'collapse' - one where we are still comparatively resource-rich but where we are exercising the restraint we always should have by leaving virtually all of the most damaging resources in the ground while making sure that those resources we do extract are applied directly and exclusively to saving our necks.<br>Humanity must rise to meet this challenge (and it will be a miracle of truly religious proportions that we do!) and we could actually have a relatively nice time of it. We could arrive at a global state of harmonious existence with the largess provided on a daily basis by sun, wind and wave, while still having modest access to the technology necessary to ensure that we stay in and truly enjoy that happy state.<br>JMG, sir, how does that essential ‘managed descent’ fit your world-view?<br><br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c8343409150356560626 title="comment permalink">11/2/13, 8:17 PM</a><br><br>

Cultural trends often arise in California, spread to the cities of the northeast, and thence into the hinterlands. If your fellow urbanites haven't thought about where food comes from, they are, like, really behind the times.<br><br>The foodie movement started in Berkeley, California in the late Seventies. It was mainly a way of getting upper middle class people to spend more money in restaurants. However, Alice Waters' emphasis on quality local ingredients, simply prepared, resulted in the hipoisie paying some attention to farms. <br><br>Foodies, organic food enthusiasts and environmentalists have been directing more public attention to where our food comes from and how it is produced. Importantly, a lot of this attention is of the "we can do better" variety, which motivates people to change their behavior. <br><br>Michael Pollan's books are best sellers. This summer, the San Francisco Chronicle food section ran a series of articles about their new experimental rooftop truck garden and bee hives. Local urban and suburban elementary schools are putting in gardens as teaching tools. Gardening is getting popular again as a middle class pastime, and glossy new books on backyard chicken raising are coming out. <br><br>There is at least one farmer's market somewhere in Marin County every day of the week. Much of what's sold is specialty produce and not cheap, but it's local. The carriage trade supermarket labels fresh produce by country of origin and state of origin if from the West Coast and puts up "local origin" shelf tags for foods processed (not necessarily grown) in the local area.<br><br>Nearly all of this (except the school gardens) is the province of people with plenty of spare cash and time, but the fact that attention to food sources is trendy here suggests that a cultural shift is in progress.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c1935384174815661499 title="comment permalink">11/2/13, 11:05 PM</a><br><br>

(The installed versions will be made of a high tech super-alloy, for longevity rather than precision, because they're supposed to run for 10,000 years.) The significance of the example isn't plywood or any other specific material, but the potential use of binary logic in mechanical computing.<br><br>Analog mechanisms such as Antikythera's, that use e.g. gear ratios to perform multiplication of continuously varying quantities like the angle of rotation of a shaft, can be no more accurate than their least accurate ratio. Play or slippage in the mechanism also degrade the result. So yes, high precision materials and workmanship are needed.<br><br>Pascal, Babbage, Herzstark (Curta), and others. developed decimal digital devices instead, mimicking pencil and paper arithmetic. But that approach still requires mechanisms that reliably distinguish at least ten different states of one element/digit (e.g. ten distinct rotational positions of one wheel or shaft), so again, precision mechanisms such as stepped drums and pin wheels were used.<br><br>Automated computation went electronic before it went binary, so there's been little exploration of binary mechanical calculators, the exceptions being mostly novelty one-off uses like educational museum exhibits and the aforementioned Clock of the Long Now. The potential advantages of binary include allowing much-lower-precision components (each element has only two states to distinguish), and being able to use the same kinds of elements to represent and accumulate numbers as to exert go/no-go mechanical control of the process, such as "carry or don't carry." In other words, it lends itself to logic gates and possible programmability.<br><br>I've been testing a few different designs for interconnectible mechanical logic gates, looking to optimize flexibility, reliability, and simplicity. A key issue is distribution of mechanical power to all the gates in a system without using problematic shafts, gears, or strings. (As with electronics, a powered logic gate can tolerate an imperfect input, e.g. a sliding rod that ends up in the ".87" position instead of the "1" position, and still operate correctly and output the correct signal instead of a further degraded one.) The method I have the highest hopes for harkens back to the <i>sautoirs</i> in Pascal's machines. I hope I don't end up needing as many prototypes as Pascal, but in any case, so far I have no <i>fait accompli</i> to drop into this year's Krampus stocking.<br><br>I'm also under no illusions that such contraptions could replace the ubiquitous electronic computing of the present day. To put the billion-fold speed difference into perspective, it would be like replacing automobile highway travel not with walking but with standing still and waiting for the continents to drift. Long slow mechanical computation could be worthwhile for repetitive arithmetic e.g. generating logarithm tables, but that only matters if existing logarithm tables don't survive. My idea is more to show that binary digital computing could have been invented centuries earlier (when it would have been useful) without metal parts, and that if lost, it's correspondingly likely to re-emerge in some form in future civilizations.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c988430739143692822 title="comment permalink">11/3/13, 1:52 PM</a><br><br>

But there have been cities with a big variety of professions before the fossil age and the same will hold true afterwards. <br><br>If you cant get a wind turbine going that simply means you cant do it, it does mean it cant be done. It is quite impudent to think that you can create by yourselve a technology that took many specialists manyears to be developed. Next step for you is to calculate your magnetic losses and adapt the geometry of your parts. If you dont know how to calculate the magnetic fields in your generator, leave it to a specialist and provide him with something you can produce, as food or whatever. <br><br>And you and your off the grid friends who use the latest and most efficient technology are prone to see it fail. Using the latest technology means to have to go through all the teething troubles. Using the most efficient technology means to lose redundancy (because it is always a tradeoff between efficiency and redundancy). And since you people are off grid, you can not rely on community redundancy. <br><br>I work in the research of new ways of electronics production. I work on stuff that will be implemented in industry in may be five years and become larger scale in probably fiteen years and can be bought by you in twenty years. So what you consider latest technology is in terms of how it is produced at least twenty yeears old. When i say electronics can simply be printed, this is not because i smoke, but because this is what i do every day. <br><br>Which brings me the most important point. Implementing technology is a job for professionals, it is nothing people can do at home by themselves. There have been specialized technicians before the fossil age (e.g. bladesmith, gunsmith, locksmith, blacksmith, coppersmith, etc.) and there will be afterwards. How many different occupations and therefore people do you need to maintain a certain technological product? what community size do you need to support those people? that are the questions you need to aks to see where the future of civilization lies. <br><br>Areas with efficient food production and enough population to maintain specialists can achieve enormous technological tasks, as building pyramids or (more recent but still pre fossil) reclaiming vast lands from the sea, as the dutch did. Small populations will fall back to the stone age. <br><br>So if you want to be part of an postfossil civilization, become a specialist in a profession that does not rely on current social or economical systems or on fossil fuels. Living alone off the grid is a symptom of anglo saxon individualist culture but not a solution to any problem. Man became the dominant species by creating communal redundancy in the group, providing help for the needy. There is no reason to leave this path. <br><br>@JMG<br><br>What do i do to preserve technologies: I do not live off the grid but as many germans, i have an electricity contractor who supplies me with 100% renewable energy, so i as a paying customer provide the fincial backbone for a community shift towards a renewable grid. I still can repair and maintain many daylife items and produce food in the garden. I work as an engineer in the research of electronics production, so i know quite a bit about the odds of producing electronic devices. Since my research is about new production techniques i know first hand with how little equipement a big variety of electrical devices can be made. So I work on an individual level to become less dependend on the community but also work as part of the community to make the shift towards a post fossil civilization. Since my community Germany is dedicated to shifting towards 100% renewables i stand not alone at the doorsteps of a postfossil world.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c1521268295101371890 title="comment permalink">11/4/13, 1:15 AM</a><br><br>

The Nyquist stability criterion is a useful way of encapsulating a general behavior of linear systems and perhaps it is not needed for modern engineers who can use SPICE or other software. The kind of thinking that is lacking in our culture is about connections of the system we are focusing on to other systems that interact and encapsulate it. <br><br>So for example, foodies see that food affects their health and start thinking how it can be healthier and where it comes from.

The main point of the stove is to reduce the use of wood and prevent deforestation (and also improve indoor air quality), but now that people want to charge their cell phones, if they have a TEG on the stove, they will burn MORE wood, the opposite effect from the intended one. We didn't take into account the cultural system that those people are part of. It would be better for them to get solar panels, perhaps, since the sunlight is free and doesn't contribute too much to deforestation, but there is still the economic and environmental cost of the panels and associated electronics.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c8731438495272726307 title="comment permalink">11/4/13, 2:05 PM</a><br><br>

Get the weight down far enough and you don't need big batteries, which reduces the weight more, which reduces the engine power required to make a vehicle that can haul cargo and handle better than a golf cart.<br><br>The RMI solution was to make the body out of carbon fiber instead of metal. Lovins said that American car companies didn't want to do this because it would require very expensive retooling. <br><br>Since then, I've been on the lookout for car manufacturers making carbon fiber body parts.

Now this seems to be the weird knowledge of the ancient ones. Mention Laplace Transform "poles" to young engineers-- even engineers with a PHD and I get blank stares. Could modern education be lacking in content on the interactions of dynamic systems?"<br><br>Well, I just sat (Oct 26, 2013) for the NCEES electrical engineering licensing exam for Washington state, and I am pleased to report that the exam, and the study guide I used to prepare for it, did cover Laplace transforms, Control Systems Theory and Root-locus analysis; basically the knowledge domain that those "poles" belong to. Admittedly, the EE candidates who take this exam need to because human safety or the public interest necessitate licensure, and so they are largely power engineers whose curriculum is more traditional.<br><br>Given that the pass rate, I understand, for this exam is over 50%, one can infer that this material is still being taught at least to power engineers.<br><br>My own electrical engineering undergrad years were from 1976 through 1981, and my old text books, and even my dad's EE texts which he collected from 1946 through the mid 60's were excellent reference material.

You pretty much need the same guys who manufacture America's Cup racing hydrofoils to effect any major repairs. There would have to be major tooling and skill investment worldwide, not just on the part of manufacturers, in order for mass-market full-CF vehicles to be insurable.<br><br>On the subject of automobiles, I am fairly well resistant to the idea of ever buying a new car. I am still tooling about in the same 1980s VW van my mom bought new, and I figure if fuel prices spike severely, I am in a very good position to rideshare with others who are becoming disenfranchised from the car culture. It is far from the most efficient vehicle out there (20mpg, however fast or slow I drive it), and it is certainly not state-of-the-art in terms of passive safety features, but it is highly space-efficient... it can carry seven passengers and about 50 cubic feet of cargo in a wheelbase not much longer than the average sedan, and it has near 50/50 weight distribution, which helps out the most important active safety system, the driver. Additionally, numerous engine swaps have been pioneered, including electric drivetrains. (There's a guy in Berkeley with a 1970s Bus called the "Voltswagen," the rear wheels of which are forced into hilariously negative camber by the weight of the batteries. It has the all important California HOV lane sticker, though!)<br><br>I would say that the automobile industry is beginning to experience diminishing returns due to technical complexity. Take, for instance, the new piezo-electric injectors for modern diesel engines. A computer switches a piezo-electric crystal back and forth between two states, many times per injection cycle. Very fancy technology that enables all sorts of outward improvements, but what about when it comes time to replace it... 25 years from now? Quite a capital cost to manufacture such things. That's why I think the automobiles most likely to stay on the road are those platforms that have been proven durable and adaptable... old air-cooled VWs, Toyota Hilux series of pickups, Mercedes diesels, to name a few. Maybe my Vanagon will someday end up running on batteries, but I certainly don't plan on trading it in for a Prius wagon any time soon.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c8085437976974793233 title="comment permalink">11/5/13, 2:03 AM</a><br><br>

We are planning on living in the tent without electricity for only 3-4 more months before we convert the platform to a small wood cabin (480 s.f. plus loft and 12x16 front porch, for 4 people) very simply electrified. The plan is to only install a little lighting, ceiling fans, a few outlets, and a fridge, but none of the big four users - HVAC, water heater, oven, clothes dryer. One could still do plenty of damage to fairy habitat (in my daughter's terms) with that sort of array! We've tried other solutions, like oil lamps, gas light, propane stove water heating, and hope that we've come to some better conclusions. Electric lighting, used very sparingly and coupled with good natural lighting design of course, seems to be the best answer to me. In the summer it never gets turned on. I suppose we could do without if we needed to.<br><br>We've cruised through 3 summers without A/C already, the first of those in balmy south Georgia (US), which was the main trigger for moving north to the mountains! No intention of ever using it again, and in fact told the farm house owners not to bother when we were remodeling this place. They will be adding it in after we are gone though, since apparently "no one else in the developed world can live without it." I doubt the validity of that claim obviously.<br><br>Water heat will be passive - radiator coils on roof, water tank on rocket mass heat exchanger, black eco-shower bags - done all this before, nothing new.<br><br>We probably will use a propane stove/oven, as little as possible, but it is a wonderful convenience. A solar oven and cob oven are in the short plans, and there is a brick-lined Dutch oven pit already in play. It's the icon next to my posts!<br><br>Everyone hangs laundry out to dry, so nothing new there. We do wash laundry by hand, though, as often as we can handle it. Laundry mat washer fills in when we get behind.<br><br>My focus right now is heating, using less firewood in particular, hence the rocket mass heater plan. Rumor is one can get the same heat out of less than one cord that conventional box stoves get from four. I'll bet testing that theory for myself soon enough.<br><br>We also use a fair bit of ice when we are not electrified, so there's a coal and oil impact there that is probably larger than electric refrigeration. Plus it's a pain in the balls.<br><br>And we still drive to farmers markets and craft shows (~80 miles max) to peddle our herbal products.<br><br>So yes, we are still part of the industrial system, but our trajectory is always toward wiser decisions regarding energy and natural resource use, less absolute use, and making our income more locally and in a more regenerative way. Plastic bottles from China holding our lovely herbal sprays moving toward pastured chicken fed from and sold in our own foodshed and all that. I find the whole process to be very interesting and rewarding, always look forward to the next step, and obviously there are plenty more of those to be taken.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Tripp<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c3866931059715762992 title="comment permalink">11/5/13, 5:33 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you all for keeping up a lively and courteous discussion in my absence! <br><br>Juhana, oddly enough, we'll be talking about that at great length in an upcoming series. Dark ages of the sort we're facing are always full of violence, ranging from the sort of low-level sporadic stuff you've mentioned as far up the scale as the technology of the time will allow. Yes, it's part of my vision, and I've already discussed some ways to deal with it. More on this soon!<br><br>Kris, funny! It's occasionally amusing to imagine how they'll whine when the American economy tips into, ahem, "negative growth" for decades at a time. <br><br>Ian, I'm not too familiar with the hardware requirements for digital modes, as the only digital mode I'm deeply interested in is old-fashioned Morse code. If low-tech digital is what calls to you, though, by all means do it! That would be a useful addition to the toolkit. <br><br>MawKernewek, that's why I've been stressing the fact that we need to preserve the necessary skills for the future; odds are that very few of us will be able to make a living with them in our lifetimes, so it's going to be crucial to find ways to pass them on that don't depend on the profit motive. <br><br>KL, too funny. <br><br>K-dog, no argument there. <br><br>News, I'll be very interested to see the results. The reasons I've tended to favor thermoelectrics are, first, they've been used successfully in many low-tech settings -- I'm thinking here of the kerosene lamp generators that were standard issue in Soviet Siberia for many decades -- and second, that they are very simple to manufacture and thus may be within the reach of societies that don't have the technical chops to build a Stirling engine. Still, if there are other technologies that will do the same thing, and do it better, then those will be more likely to be adopted, of course.<br><br>John, a difference of scale is not a difference of kind. You're repeating arguments that have been discussed here literally hundreds of times, and don't stand up to analysis. I'd encourage you to read through the archives and consider the shortcomings of the logic of "but it's different this time." <br><br>Phitio, sudden forcing is far from unknown in the Earth's geological history. I'd encourage you, for example, to look at the evidence from Greenland ice cores suggesting that the temperature spike at the end of the Younger Dryas cold phase took less than a decade to boost the Earth's average temperature by more than 15 degrees F. I'd also encourage you to glance back at <a href=../../2012/04/seascape-with-methane-plumes.html rel=nofollow>this post of mine</a> from last year, which discusses (among other things) the possibility that the collapse of the Greenland ice cap due to methane releases could happen much more quickly than the IPCC et al. are forecasting. <br><br>Cherokee, simple metal-acid battery technology is another very useful little item to preserve. As for your rant, I have no problem with that!<br><br>Bike Trog, no argument there at all.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c8877319795836633944 title="comment permalink">11/5/13, 10:12 AM</a><br><br>

May I borrow that last phrase of yours -- "ephemerality lives only in the minds of those with ephemeral knowledge bases" -- and have some friendly blacksmith put it on the business end of a branding iron? There are some backsides that badly need that reminder scorched into them. ;-)<br><br>Lakis, thank you for a reasoned and thoughtful response! I don't know of any single document presenting a detailed emergy comparison between undersea cable technology and satellite technology, but it's not at all hard to break it down into subsidiary questions -- what kinds of technology are needed to manufacture each one? What's needed to deploy each one? What's needed to operate each one? -- and compare them; in the age of Google, as I noted, that takes all of a few minutes to do, and I'd encourage you to take those minutes and do it, as I did. <br><br>You're quite right that Carson's vision of the future differs from mine, and that that's a central part of our disagreement. The reference to Mumford is apropos as well -- <a href=../../2007/01/hesperotechnic-phase.html rel=nofollow>one of my early posts</a> discusses Mumford's phases, and suggests that his neotechnic phase was basically a mirage or, if you will, a temporary and never quite attainable phase, followed by the hesperotechnic phase we're entering now. I'm aware that that's a wildly unpopular view, but I'd suggest that so far, at least, it's proven to be rather more accurate than the competing visions. <br><br>More broadly, though, I'd like to encourage you and others in what we might as well call the high-tech end of the sustainability scene to look at ways in which the benefits of something like the internet can be maintained without the cripping problems with materials sourcing and economic viability that the internet as currently constituted will face in a deindustrializing age. As I noted in my post, it's entirely possible that there are ways to do the thing that don't require, say, clean rooms and the capacity to lay down monomolecular films, and if something can be built and tested -- not just daydreamed -- before current computer technology starts to become less available, it's quite possible that something of the kind could become part of the ecotechnic future I've discussed. If half the effort currently being put into 3D printers could go into some such project, I'd be considerably less sceptical about the outcome. <br><br>JP, that's a huge issue, and one of the reasons I consider the old-fashioned library and printing press to be critical technologies for the future. More on this later. <br><br>Robert, thank you! I'll be in touch as time and circumstances permit. <br><br>Richard, one can hope. <br><br>Anselmo, exactly. We'll be talking about that as we proceed. <br><br>Ed, excellent! I'd encourage you to add the slide rule to your list of mechanical calculating devices, too -- the fact that it's powered by human muscles just makes it more suited to the future we're most likely to get. <br><br>Anselmo, another very good point. It's not just the geekoisie who are blind to whole systems, of course -- our entire society is pervaded by that blindness. <br><br>Raven, now factor in the energy cost of what you're feeding to the dog. Whole systems!<br><br>Glenn, that's excellent news -- I hadn't expected governments to deal with reality even on that level for a while yet.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c5733572868169832489 title="comment permalink">11/5/13, 10:37 AM</a><br><br>

Because it was getting long, in my previous comment I left out a remark to the effect of, if you can use electricity at all, you can make relays, which can do everything my mechanical gates can do, and much faster too. (Historically, relays in digital computers were rapidly replaced by vacuum tubes, but that brief period was apparently so influential that science fiction writers many years later still wrote of the sound of "the clicking of relays" when futuristic sentient computers and robots contemplated their decisions.)<br><br>The way I'm approaching mechanical digital computing, physically repositioning gates during the operation of the machine isn't necessary, but they have to be laid out somehow and then connected together so that the output of each one can become an input for several others. With electronics, you just run wires (or lines on a printed circuit) from one to another however you wish, within certain generous limits (although laying things out so that gates are close to the gates they feed into speeds up operation). To power each one, you just run some more wires. It's harder to do that mechanically. For instance if a gate's output is to pull (or not pull) a string, you can run the string a distance to another gate, but strings can stretch, bind, fray, etc. A rigid push-rod is more reliable, but limited in where it can reach to.<br><br>Things like player piano rolls and Jacquard punch cards are the equivalent of read-only memory. That's how you store data that doesn't change often, such as (if you have a programmable machine) the most frequently used programs. Re-writable memory is a harder problem, but if you only need a little bit of it, you can make it out of basic logic gates, so that's all I'm worrying about for the time being. Developing more compact forms of mechanical memory, using more specialized mechanisms, would be a follow-up project.<br><br>Hi Andrew H,<br><br>Thanks for the links on Meccano analog computers. I'm still looking for info on how the integrators in those computers are made, because it seems like some precision in those components would be needed, whether standard Meccano parts or specialized add-on parts are used. (Meccano parts are manufactured to pretty tight tolerances, though, so it's plausible.) You can think of a mechanical integrator as a continuously variable transmission (with a full range of "reverse" as well as forward ratios) feeding into a rotation measurement (such as a clock hand, odometer wheels, or a turning threaded rod that moves a pen along an axis on a plotter). The devices wouldn't have to be inherently accurate because they can be calibrated, but they do have to be consistent in their operation (that is, they have to "hold" their calibration) from one minute of operation to the next. I could imagine most of the accessory parts made of wood, but thinking of how wooden disks and cylinders could be affected by humidity and wear makes me think that in the absence of metal, stone might be a better bet for the key integrator parts.<br><br>Hi Robert Mathiesen,<br><br>Infinite respect for your father's achievement.<br><br>When contemplating such things as the Norden bombsight and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1i-dnAH9Y4" rel=nofollow>the Mark i Fire Control Computer</a> (that video by the way describes an integrator starting at 30:52) I wonder whether the machining expertise to make them still exists in the U.S. today. (Maybe computer-controlled milling machines could now crank out those parts effortlessly, but I doubt many people could still them the way they were originally crafted.)<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c4802340434748465477 title="comment permalink">11/5/13, 11:07 AM</a><br><br>

It is not possible for an individuum to be able to maintain and repair all those by themselves. I have to rely on my personal network of specialists i know to exchange my help and knowledge with their help and knowledge. <br><br>If i see what time and effort it takes for me to solve a problem and how quick a specialist can do it, then there is no question that a service exchange of specialists will always be more efficient then everybody living on himself. <br><br>Since i am not a specialist in most domains of this world i do not display professional capture but the amateurs awe for the abilities professionals have. <br><br>By the way, the opposite of professionals capture is the Dunning-Kruger-Effect ;)<br><br>you said: "probably lost in translation"<br><br>Yeah probably, some stuff is better talked about with a beer instead of a keyboard :)<br><br>and finally some fun-facts about the german energiewende, try not to make the mistake to follow the spin the public debate has, which is spun by big coal and big whatever ;)<br><br>"If a 100% renewable economy was economically possible, it would be implemented right now." -&gt; it is implemented right now. Germany is replacing 2% of its supply by renewables year by year. Currently we are at 26%, in ten years it will be over 45 and in 30 years it will be over 80, which is the governments goal for 2050. Implementing renewables is a task for generations, but we are on track. <br><br>"German plans to decommission nuclear power plants sometime in the future are exactly that - plans." -&gt; Three years ago we had 17 reactors running, now the number is nine. We are decommissioning right now, in ten years every reactor in Germany is offline. <br><br>"it has a great many problems balancing supply and demand. This is a real problem that has not and will not be solved." -&gt; The solutions are in development and in process of implementation. Implementing enough storage is a task for decades, so current steps seem small, for balancing demand market solution are developed (e.g. steel plants do not use their planned slice of energy but sell it at times of need to then high spot prices on the market reducing overall demand while still making money). <br><br>"Liebig's law applies to manufacturing as well as to the ecology." -&gt; Nobody knows better then we do. Germany ran out of resources even before the industrial age started, which resulted in developing silviculture centuries ago. We are today harvesting trees that were planted three generations ago while planting the trees for the third generation after us. Resource scarcitiy is part of Germanys Mindset (a common phrase is: "our single resource is education"), which the German Justus van Liebig then applied to his plants. A scientist with an anglo saxon mindset would have looked at his not growing plants and concluded that they may need less government to grow properly ;) <br><br>And i am not a cornucopian. I insulated my apartment to reduce heating demand and i am well aware that my current car may be the last one i can afford. But the world of tomorrow (at least in central europe) will be an industrial civilization, which will be slower then the current one and less mobile and less energy intensive. Even less specalised. But we can not unopen the doors we passed during the last two centuries. Of course the hundreds of millions of self dependend farmers on this planet will never reach industrial levels.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c8905089878614937984 title="comment permalink">11/5/13, 12:09 PM</a><br><br>

There is a wheel inside the mannequin that can be adjusted so as to make the device write different messages. This machine also dips the quill pen in ink and moves its "eyes".

"Better" and words like it are always value judgments, and that means that they're inevitably some person's value judgments. In this case, they're mine: I appreciate the benefits of civilization and literacy, and those basically demand agriculture, so those are three things I'd like to see preserved. That being the case, doing something to further that goal is the next logical step. <br><br>Matthew, well, yes. That's what I meant about the visceral inability to think in terms of whole systems. <br><br>Dwig, I heard about that. I can't think of a better piece of evidence that too many people in the US military are reading comic books rather than thinking. <br><br>Ruben, thank you! <br><br>Sunseeker, thanks for the data. As I said, it's only a guess, based on the simplicity of the underlying technology compared to its rivals; efficiency is not necessarily the most important figure when you can build something inefficient while a more efficient technology is out of reach. <br><br>Phil, bingo.

I'm curious; why the recent flurry of pot shots? <br><br>Roger, now factor in the fact that not much more than a century ago, half the American people worked on farms, and that fossil fuel production isn't going to stop overnight -- it's going to wind down over a period of decades. That is to say, it's entirely possible that a century from now, half the American people will again be working on farms, and per capita energy use will be down about where it was in 1900. Getting there will be a rough process, and what comes after is more contraction and more agriculturalization, but it's still not the end of the world. Only if you assume that the crash will be sudden and nobody will take any steps to cope with it does the current situation, with its extraordinary surpluses of energy and resources, look as dire as apocalypticists like to paint it.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c630600996323803125 title="comment permalink">11/5/13, 2:20 PM</a><br><br>

Nobody, not even those who claim to be most worried about climate change, has shown any willingness to make the kind of cuts in their own lifestyles that would be required to go to a zero-carbon civilization. When you say that a social and political turnaround is the only option, I'm sorry to say that you're wrong -- the option most people have chosen, and continue to reinforce with their actions and choices each day, is to keep on going down the road we're on, and hope that they die before the bill comes due. <br><br>This is why my vision of the future includes climate chaos and the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets; I see those as pretty much baked into the cake at this point. If you believe otherwise, that's your choice, but then I have to ask you this: what exactly do you propose to do to get seven billion people to agree with you, and do something they've shown zero willingness to do so far? <br><br>Mark, well, it goes straight over my head, but then I'm not an engineer. <br><br>Ekkar, thank you.

That's a very helpful way to think of the problem with batteries. I've read, by the way, that to equal the energy content of a gallon of gasoline, you'd need one ton of lead-acid car batteries -- do you happen to know if that's correct? <br><br>C Young, fascinating. The question that will shape the experience of those future travelers is whether the spare parts and other resources will be available to repurpose those substations forty years from now, or if they'll simply be stripped for scrap. <br><br>Deedl, fair enough. <br><br>Crow Hill, it's one of the most dismal habits of contemporary thought to insist that the way we presently do things is the only way we can do things.

What about the energy -- remember, a single server farm uses as much electricity as a small city, and a chip fabrication plant also uses huge amounts of power. Where are you going to get the energy? If you have your own power plant, are you going to be prepared to replace all those components every few decades, too? What's your fuel source -- will your monastery have its own coal mine, or will it have another chip fabrication plant to turn out photovoltaic cells to replace those as they wear out, or what?

Please do report on how that "rocket mass heater" works out. I assume it's something like what here in Vermont they call a "masonry stove", supposedly common in NW European countries such as Finland. The claims on their efficiency seem fantastical to me. They can't be more than 100% efficient, after all (unlike the heat pump I'm currently installing, but that's another story). A "box stove" may only be 50% efficient (and the good ones are more like 75%). So the ratio of the amounts of firewood needed shouldn't be more than 2:1, if it's the same building that's being heated. If you're planning on staying put in the house for generations they're probably worth building, and will outlast my high-tech heat pump, and perhaps even my cast-iron wood stove, by tenfold. But you'd still need to cut a bunch of firewood (hard work even with a motorized chainsaw).<br><br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c2187987610543719736 title="comment permalink">11/5/13, 7:25 PM</a><br><br>

You asked: "I've read, by the way, that to equal the energy content of a gallon of gasoline, you'd need one ton of lead-acid car batteries -- do you happen to know if that's correct?"<br><br>That's basically correct, in terms of total energy stored. About 131 Megajoules for the gallon of gasoline, and 2.1 Megajoules for a typical 50A-h car battery that weighs 35 pounds.<br><br>However, expect the efficiency of converting that energy content into motive power to be at least twice as high for electric motors as for an internal combustion engine. So you really only need half a ton of charged lead-acid batteries to drive the distance a gallon of gas would get you, Also, the needed electric motors weigh much less than the IC engine and transmission they replace, so expect to save around a quarter ton there. So your stock vehicle converted to lead-acid battery power (using, say, 30 average car batteries) only weighs a quarter ton more than it did before.<br><br>In other words, it's no great technical challenge to make an electric car (even with good performance) using lead-acid batteries, as long as you're okay with a range of "one gallon," around 25 or 30 miles, between recharges.<br><br>You can stretch that out to 50 or 60 miles by reducing weight elsewhere and adding some of that weight back in more batteries, along with other tricks like regenerative braking. But you can't simply e.g. double the range just by doubling the number of batteries because their weight and bulk increases so fast.<br><br>(All figures are rather approximate but the basic result is sound.)<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c4005244774761874175 title="comment permalink">11/5/13, 8:36 PM</a><br><br>

Keep that in mind before getting excited about that "gravity light". A small LED lamp needs very little power, and is useful (I keep some hand-cranked ones around). But most essential things such as heating, cooking, pumping water, and transportation (not to mention "server farms") need much larger order of magnitudes of energy. Even just recharging your i-gizmo (the tip of the tip of the iceberg of "the internet") needs far more energy than a "gravity clock" device could deliver.

Of course I'll pass along any data or blog posts about the RMH as it proceeds.<br><br>Here's the real bonus of a rocket mass heater (RMH) and why they are so much more efficient: The rocket combustion chamber actually works as a pump to push hot gases through the system, thereby avoiding the reliance on the draft necessary with a vertical stack. With this active pumping action you can then run your flue horizontally, through a thermal mass (typically rock and cob designed as a built-in bed or couch) for 20-30 feet or so, extracting a significant amount of heat from the exhaust gases. Heat that is normally required to create draft, and is therefore wasted to the atmosphere, even in a very efficient box stove. Designed correctly, the gases can be below 100F when they exit the flue, even if the rocket is raging. <br><br>The now-warmed thermal mass gives off its heat slowly overnight, over days even, where your garden-variety box stove has to be burning to stay hot, and in the case of our tent, stoked at least 4 times during the night when it's cold! What a pain!<br><br>A rocket stove is sort of like a brick oven: you fire it and then close it up. You don't want it sucking the heat out of the house at night when it's not burning, so you fire it through the evening, and then seal it up, allowing the stored heat to dissipate through the night. <br><br>We are intending to place the head of our 3 beds on the 15" high, 18" deep thermal mass and cruise through the night without having to get up to stoke a fire during the night. The whole system should weigh at least 2 tons and cost only a few hundred dollars to build - the fire brick for the combustion chamber and flue pipe being the main expenses.<br><br>We have only a short (&lt;20') run available to us in the tent so we'll be splitting the horizontal flue into 2 parallel flues running the roughly 15' of the mass bench. That bench will become our couch, privy closet warmer, and a bed warmer for our daughter (with son above) in the reconfigured cabin.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c786624676000623645 title="comment permalink">11/6/13, 6:46 AM</a><br><br>

(It's an important one, but it's still only one.) To get to something that might work, it's going to be necessary to remember exactly what a dark age entails...and of course that's not going to be a pleasant subject. <br><br>Cherokee, the only reason I didn't give rats a future civilization of their own in "The Next Ten Billion Years" is that it's just too obviously plausible! As for the speaking gig, well, it was a mixed bag, but it had its high points. <br><br>Angelus, I'd encourage you to start by remembering that any binary -- that is, any pair of apparently opposed ideas -- is a subset of a much more complex and nuanced continuum. Find a third option that's equidistant from both the poles of the binary, and see where that takes you.<br><br><a href=the-future-is-foreign-country.html#c3109322253450945505 title="comment permalink">11/6/13, 10:56 AM</a><br><br>
