<div class=MsoNormal>
I'd meant to devote this week’s post to exploring the way that new religious movements so often give shape to emerging ideas and social forms during the decline of civilizations, and to sketch out some of the possibilities for action along those lines as industrial society moves further along its own curve of decline and fall. Still, these essays are part of a broader conversation about the future of today’s world, and now and then some other part of that conversation brings up points relevant to the discussion here.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s as much excuse as there is for this week’s detour. A few weeks ago, the P2P Foundation website hosted a piece by Kevin Carson titled
<a href=http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/when-ephemeralization-is-hard-to-tell-from-catabolic-collapse/2013/09/19>When Ephemeralization is Hard to Tell from Catabolic Collapse</a>. Carson’s piece got some attention recently in the peak oil blogosphere, not to mention some pointed and by no means unjustified criticism. It seems to me, though, that there’s a valid point tucked away in Carson’s essay; he’s got it by the wrong end, and it doesn’t imply what he thinks it does, but the point is nonetheless there, and important. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Getting to it, though, requires a certain tolerance for intellectual sloppiness of a kind embarrassingly common in today’s culture. When Carson talks about “the Jared Diamond/John Michael Greer/William Kunstler theory of ‘catabolic collapse,’” for example, it’s hard to escape the conclusion that he simply hasn’t taken the time to learn much about his subject. “Catabolic collapse,” after all, isn’t a generic label for collapse in general; it’s the name for a specific theory about how civilizations fall—those who are interested <a href=http://www.ecoshock.org/transcripts/greer_on_collapse.pdf>can download a PDF here</a>—which I developed between 2001 and 2004 and published online in a 2005 essay, and the other two names he cited had nothing to do with it.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, I would be delighted to hear that Jared Diamond supports the theory of catabolic collapse, but as far as I know, he’s never mentioned it in print, and the modes of collapse he discusses in his book
<i>Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed</i> differ significantly from my model. As for the third author, presumably Carson means James Howard Kunstler, the author of <i>The Long Emergency</i> and
<i>Too Much Magic</i>—very solid books about the approaching end of the industrial age, though once again based on a different theory of collapse—rather than William Kunstler, the late civil rights lawyer who defended the Chicago Seven back in 1969, and who to the best of my knowledge never discussed the collapse of civilizations at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This same somewhat casual relationship to matters of fact pops up elsewhere in Carson’s essay, and leaves his argument rather the worse for wear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Carson’s claim is that the accelerating breakdown of the existing infrastructure of industrial society isn’t a problem, because that infrastructure either is being replaced, or is sure to be replaced (he is somewhat vague on this distinction), by newer, better and cheaper high-tech systems. What Buckminster Fuller used to call ephemeralization—defined, with Bucky’s usual vagueness, as “doing more with less”—is, in Carson’s view, “one of the most central distinguishing characteristics of our technology,” and guarantees that new infrastructures will be so much less capital-intensive than the old ones that replacing the latter won’t be a problem. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a claim worth considering. The difficulty, though, is that the example he offers—also borrowed from Fuller—actually makes the opposite case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Replacing a global network of oceanic cables weighing some very large amount with a few dozen communications satellites weighing a few tons each does look, at first glance, like a dramatic step toward ephemeralization, but that impression remains only as long as it takes to ask whether the satellites are replacing those cables all by themselves. Of course they’re not; putting those satellites up, keeping them in orbit, and replacing them requires an entire space program, with all its subsidiary infrastructure; getting signals to and from the satellites requires a great deal more infrastructure. Pile all those launch gantries, mission control centers, satellite dishes, and other pieces of hardware onto the satellite side, and the total weight on that end of the balance starts looking considerably less ephemeral than it did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even if you add a couple of old-fashioned freighters on the cable side—that’s the modest technology needed to lay and maintain cables—it’s far from clear that replacing cables with satellites involves any reduction in capital intensity at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this displays one of the more troubling failures of contemporary intellectual culture, an almost physiological inability to think in terms of whole systems. I’ve long since lost count of the number of times I’ve watched card-carrying members of the geekoisie fail to grasp that <a href=http://www.worldtrans.org/essay/ephemeralization.html>their monthly charge for internet service</a> isn’t a good measure of the whole cost of the internet, or skid right past the hard economic fact that the long term survival of the internet depends on <a href=../../2009/05/economics-of-decline.html>its ability to pay for itself</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>This blindness to whole systems is all the more startling in that the computer revolution itself was made possible by the creation of systems theory and cybernetics in the 1940s and 1950s, and whole-systems analysis is a central feature of both these disciplines. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To watch the current blindness to whole systems in full gaudy flower, glance over any collection of recent chatter about “cloud computing.” What is this thing we’re calling “the cloud?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Descend from the airy realms of cyber-abstractions into the grubby underworld of hardware, and it’s an archipelago of huge server farms, each of which uses as much electricity as a small city, each of which has a ravenous hunger for spare parts, skilled labor, and many other inputs, and each of which must be connected to all the others by a physical network of linkages that have their own inescapable resource demands. As with Fuller’s satellite analogy, the ephemeralization of one part of the whole system is accomplished at the cost of massive capital outlays and drastic increases in complexity elsewhere in the system. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this needs to be understood in order to put ephemeralization into its proper context. Still, Carson’s correct to point out that information technologies have allowed the replacement of relatively inefficient infrastructure, in some contexts, with arrangements that are much more efficient. The best known example is the replacement of old-fashioned systems of distribution, with their warehouses, local jobbers, and the rest, with just-in-time ordering systems that allow products, parts, and raw materials to be delivered as they’re needed, where they’re needed. Since this approach eliminates the need to keep warehouses full of spare parts and the like, it’s certainly a way of doing more with less—but the consequences of doing so are considerably less straightforward than they appear at first glance. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To understand how this works, it’s going to be necessary to spend a little time talking about catabolic collapse, the theory referenced earlier. The basis of that theory is the uncontroversial fact that human societies routinely build more infrastructure than they can afford to maintain. During periods of prosperity, societies invest available resources in major projects—temples, fortifications, canal or road systems, space programs, or whatever else happens to appeal to the collective imagination of the age. As infrastructure increases in scale and complexity, the costs of maintenance rise to equal and exceed the available economic surplus; the period of prosperity ends in political and economic failure, and infrastructure falls into ruin as its maintenance costs are no longer paid. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This last stage in the process is catabolic collapse. Since the mismatch between maintenance costs and economic capacity is the driving force behind the cycle, the collapse of excess infrastructure has a silver lining—in fact, two such linings. First, since ruins require minimal maintenance, the economic output formerly used to maintain infrastructure can be redirected to other uses; second, in many cases, the defunct infrastructure can be torn apart and used as raw materials for something more immediately useful, at a cost considerably lower than fresh production of the same raw materials would require. Thus post-Roman cities in Europe’s most recent round of dark ages could salvage stone from<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>temples, forums, and coliseums to raise walls against barbarian raiders, just as survivors of the collapse of industrial society will likely thank whatever deities they happen to worship that we dug so much metal out of the belly of the earth and piled it up on the surface in easily accessible ruins. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Given a stable resource base, the long-term economic benefits of catabolic collapse are significant enough that a new period of prosperity normally follows the collapse, resulting in another round of infrastructure buildup and a repetition of the same cycle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The pulse of anabolic expansion and catabolic collapse thus defines, for example, the history of imperial China. The extraordinary stability of China’s traditional system of village agriculture and local-scale manufacturing put a floor under the process, so that each collapse bottomed out at roughly the same level as the last, and after a century or two another anabolic pulse would get under way. In some places along the Great Wall, it’s possible to see the high-water marks of each anabolic phase practically side by side, as each successful dynasty’s repairs and improvements were added onto the original fabric. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Matters are considerably more troublesome if the resource base lacks the permanence of traditional Chinese rice fields and workshops. A society that bases its economy on nonrenewable resources, in particular, has set itself up for a far more devastating collapse. Nonrenewable resource extraction is always subject to the law of diminishing returns; while one resource can usually be substituted by another, that simply means a faster drawdown of still other resources—the replacement of more concentrated metal ores with ever less concentrated substitutes, the usual example cited these days for resource substitution, required exponential increases in energy inputs per ton of metal produced, and thus hastened the depletion of concentrated fossil fuel reserves. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the usual costs of infrastructure maintenance mount up, as a result, a society that runs its economy on nonrenewable resources also faces rising costs for resource extraction. Eventually those bills can no longer be paid in full, and the usual pattern of political and economic failure ensues. It’s at this point that the real downside of dependence on nonrenewable resources cuts in; the abandonment of excess infrastructure decreases one set of costs, and frees up some resources, but the ongoing depletion of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>nonrenewable resource base continues implacably, so resource costs keep rising. Instead of bottoming out and setting the stage for renewed prosperity, the aftermath of crisis allows only a temporary breathing space, followed by another round of political and economic failure as resource costs continue to climb. This is what drives the stairstep process of crisis, partial recovery, and renewed crisis, ending eventually in total collapse, that appears so often in the annals of dead civilizations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Though he’s far from clear about it, I suspect that this is what Carson meant to challenge by claiming that the increased efficiencies and reduced capital intensity of ephemeralized technology make worries about catabolic collapse misplaced. He’s quite correct that increased efficiency, “doing more with less,” is a response to the rising spiral of infrastructure maintenance costs that drive catabolic collapse; in fact, it’s quite a common response, historically speaking. There are at least two difficulties with his claim, though. The first is that efficiency is notoriously subject to the law of diminishing returns; the low hanging fruit of efficiency improvement may be easily harvested, but proceeding beyond that involves steadily increasing difficulty and expense, because in the real world—as distinct from science fiction—you can only do so much more with less and less. That much is widely recognized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Less often remembered<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is that increased efficiency has an inescapable correlate that Carson doesn’t mention: reduced resilience. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s only fair to point out that Carson comes by his inattention to this detail honestly. It was among the central themes of the career of Buckminster Fuller, whose ideas give Carson’s essay its basic frame. Fuller had a well-earned reputation in the engineering field of his time as “failure-prone,” and a consistent habit of pursuing efficiency at the expense of resilience was arguably the most important reason why.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fiasco surrounding Fuller’s 1933 Dymaxion car is a case in point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of the car’s many novel features was a center of mass that was extremely high compared to other cars, which combined with an innovative suspension system to give the car an extremely smooth ride. Unfortunately this same feature turned into a lethal liability when a Dymaxion prototype was sideswiped by another vehicle. Then as now, cars on Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive bump into one another quite often, but few of them flip and roll, killing the driver and seriously injuring everyone else on board. That’s what happened in this case, and Chrysler—which had been considering mass production of the Dymaxion car—withdrew from the project at once, having decided that the car wasn’t safe to drive. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The rise and fall of Fuller’s geodesic dome architecture traces the same story in a less grim manner. Those of my readers who were around in the 1960s will recall the way geodesic domes sprang up like mushrooms in those days. By the early 1970s, they were on their way out, for a telling reason. Fuller’s design was extremely efficient in its use of materials, but unless perfectly caulked—and in the real world, there is no such thing as perfect caulking—geodesic domes consistently leaked in the rain. Famed vernacular architect Lloyd Kahn, author of <i>Domebooks 1</i> and
<i>2</i>, the bibles of the geodesic-dome fad, marked the end of the road with his 1973 sourcebook <i>Shelter</i>, which subjected the flaws of the geodesic dome to unsparing analysis and helped refocus the attention of the nascent appropriate technology scene onto the less efficient but far more resilient technology of shingled roofs. Nowadays geodesic domes are only used in those few applications where their efficiency is more important than their many practical problems. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The unavoidable tradeoff between efficiency and resilience can be understood easily enough by considering an ordinary bridge. All bridges these days have vastly more structural strength than they need in order to support their ordinary load of traffic. This is inefficient, to be sure, but it makes the bridges resilient; they can withstand high winds, unusually heavy loads, deferred maintenance, and other challenges without collapsing. Since the cost of decreased resilience (a collapsed bridge and potential loss of life) is considerably more serious than the cost of decreased efficiency (more tax revenues spent on construction), inefficiency is accepted—and rightly so. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s one of the persistent delusions of contemporary computer culture to claim that this equation doesn’t apply once modern information technology enters into the picture. Nassim Taleb’s widely read
<i>The Black Swan</i> is chockfull of counterexamples. As he shows, information networks have proven to be as effective at multiplying vulnerabilities as they are at countering them, and can be blindsided by unexpected challenges just as thoroughly as any other system. The 1998 failure of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), whose publicists insisted that its computer models could not fail during the lifetime of the universe and several more like it, is just one of many cases in point. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The history of any number of failed civilizations offers its own mocking commentary on the insistence that efficiency is always a good thing. In its final years, for instance, the Roman Empire pursued “doing more with less” to a nearly Fulleresque degree, by allowing the manpower of legionary units along the Rhine and Danube frontiers to decline to a fraction of their paper strength. In peace, this saved tax revenues for critical needs elsewhere; when the barbarian invasions began, though, defenses that had held firm for centuries crumpled, and the collapse of the imperial system duly followed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In this context, there’s a tremendous irony in the label Fuller used for the pursuit of efficiency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The word “ephemeral,” after all, has a meaning of its own, unrelated to the one Fuller slapped onto it; it derives from the Greek word
<i>ephemeron</i>, “that which lasts for only one day,” and its usual synonyms include “temporary,” “transitory,” and “fragile.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A society dependent on vulnerable satellite networks in place of the robust reliability of oceanic cables, cloud computing in place of the dispersed security of programs and data spread across millions of separate hard drives, just-in-time ordering in place of warehouses ready to fill in any disruptions in the supply chain, and so on, is indeed more ephemeral—that is to say, considerably more fragile than it would otherwise be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In a world facing increasingly serious challenges driven by resource depletion, environmental disruption, and all the other unwelcome consequences of attempting limitless growth on a relentlessly finite planet, increasing the fragility of industrial society is also a good way to see to it that it turns out to be temporary and transitory. In that sense, and only in that sense, Carson’s right; ephemeralization is the wave of the future, and it’s even harder to tell it apart from catabolic collapse than he thinks, because ephemeralization is part of the normal process of collapse, not a way to prevent it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s an equal irony to be observed in the way that Carson presents this preparation for collapse as yet another great leap forward on the allegedly endless march of progress. As discussed <a href=../../2013/04/the-god-with-three-heads.html>earlier in this series of posts</a>, the concept of progress has no content of its own; it’s simply the faith-based assumption that the future will be, or must be, or at least ought to be, better than the present; and today’s passionate popular faith in the inevitability and beneficence of progress makes it embarrassingly easy for believers to convince themselves that any change you care to name, however destructive it turns out to be, must be for the best.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As we continue down the familiar trajectory of decline and fall, we can thus expect any number of people to cheer heartily at the progress, so to speak, that we’re making toward the endpoint of that curve. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>

There will no doubt be any number of attempts in the years ahead to insist that our decline is actually an ascent, or the birth pangs of a new and better world, or what have you, and it may well take an unusual degree of clarity to see past the chorus of reassurances, come to terms with the hard realities of our time, and do something constructive about them.</span></div>

Most things are good to see in multiple lights, given a good chance.<br><br>The hollowing of of the Roman military came from at least two directions. One, the diminishing hard resources Rome had to contribute to maintaining the Legions; keeping that many soldiers supplied, equipped, trained, and paid was no small bill, no matter how ephemeral the costs could be made through cost saving strategies (like hiring local Allies to fill in for legions in place of actual Roman soldiers) they must have remained a significant cost to an economy still limited to harvesting resources which, all of them, had to be backed by basic muscle and photosynthesis. Two: The dominance of Roman tactics (a military resource itself) was in decline because of adaptations developing in opposing forces. Even if Roman economic support for the Legions could have held steady, the tactical decline would have continued to push costs higher. The reason for this decline has to do with rates of learning, or experimentation. The Roman Military, had many standardizations across the board, and all of those standard features could be confronted and tested in any battle, and any useful lesson won could be disseminated widely. There were many opportunities for Rome's opponents to learn widely generalizable lessons about Rome's weaknesses. The Roman military, had many encounters to confront and test its foes as well, and therefore many opportunities to acquire useful lessons about its foes; however, the Roman military's lessons were less generalizable, because they faced many foes who were not standardized; and it was harder to test responses to those lessons and spread those responses through such a structured system. Big rigid things adapt more slowly than small indefinite things.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c5226563307457283893 title="comment permalink">10/2/13, 10:47 PM</a><br><br>

Perhaps he should try one of those exercises where he has to track the flow of information, energy and matter for a household object.<br><br>It is astounding how many times people create visionary solutions that only make logical sense due to the ridiculous system boundaries they have placed in their mind. Carson prefers to ignore that his solar panels are created in a large factory dependent upon exotic materials mined and purified from ore extracted with GIGANTIC trucks powered by ridiculous amounts of diesel, not to mention the massive nickel/lead acid battery stacks for each household. The proponents of the "3D printing revolution" choose to ignore how much their fantasy is dependent upon UPS/Fed Ex and small companies specialized in shipping a ridiculous amount of small orders of ABS plastic pellets to some home enthusiast so they can pretend they are revolutionaries of economics. In fact, the reason Carson's vision of a decentralized manufacturing future that can enable middle class American lifestyles and a route to escaping the human condition is flawed stems from the UPS/Fed Ex problem. We know UPS trucks are less fuel efficient than long-haul freight and trains. Therefore Carson's increased complexity would require increased energy and and an increase in information as distribution facilities will need to sort the increased flow. You and I both know that isn't going to happen.<br><br><br>I used to think I took issue with the substitution effect in economic theory, but after understanding the religion of progress I just take issues with the view of the specific substitutes. There will always be a substitute energy source or product source, the controversial part is implying that it may be muscle power and ambient heat/UV radiation as oppose to some alternative that follows the ritual theater of progress. <br>What we do know is that complex systems are organized by the flow of energy available. For example one million years ago, It was the massive energy surplus that the control of fire gave us, that allowed our species to organize larger more complex brains. In every example of civilizations confronted with reduced energy a reduction of complexity followed. The same is true in the biological world, A body when confronted with starvation will consume fat stores, muscles and eventually organs before it ceases to be a flow/store of information. <br><br>Great post this week. <br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c5939762241459026158 title="comment permalink">10/3/13, 12:47 AM</a><br><br>

In short, non-experts have a strange habit of mistaking "smaller" for "less-complicated" when it comes to technology and infrastructure. When I first started as a programmer in the very early 80's computing was performed on mainframes - great big chundering water-cooled machines that sat in the back room and didn't do very much really, but looked awfully large and complicated: great lines of huge and noisy boxes, tape reels and printers sitting in a massive control room giving off a general air of technical awesomeness. To anyone in the computer business, they were actually pretty straightforward. In those days, straight out of college, it took me a few months to learn how to program, change tapes, run the control centers and operate the equipment. An IT generalist could learn to do most things, with a few super-geeks thrown in for some of the more complicated stuff (“the Beards” I believed we called them). But, to the executives walking by the control room all this technology looked really mysterious and complicated. <br><br>Flash forward about ten years and those same executives now had kids who were messing around with "personal computers" in their bedrooms. To these executives these small machines seemed so easy to use. "Why is everything so complicated in the IT world?" I would hear regularly, "my kids can make this stuff work, why can't you all get things done more quickly?" <br><br>OK, so we all got down to putting these PCs on the desks, and then we networked them, and then the Internet came along and we hooked them all up to that (which some marketeer re-branded as the “cloud” about ten years later). And then along came Blackberries and then smart phones and no doubt we're only a couple of years away from X-ray vision glasses and retina chips or whatever else comes next. And still, I'm sure, most of the non-expert users of this all technology assume that because what they see is so small and easy to use that it must also be easy to manage and maintain. <br><br>Thing is, if you take a look under the covers of a typical IT management operation, it is vastly more complicated and challenging than it ever was: great herds of specialist employees, sub-contractors and vendors of different sorts, many of whom live in India or the Ukraine or somewhere to help off-set (perhaps temporarily) the costs of all this stuff. Layers and layers of very complicated, expensive and vulnerable infrastructure, each needing a tender-loving specialist to keep it up and running. The IT industry has done a wonderful job of standardizing many of the interfaces between these layers, so they can talk to each other, but that has then enabled more layers to be added, and so it goes on. <br><br>So, yes, everything got smaller and easier to use. But it also got vastly more complicated to maintain. Which is probably why every other low income country these days seems to be able to make a living keep parts of the IT world up and running. I’m sure that will end well.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c5377786847586949714 title="comment permalink">10/3/13, 3:46 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps I am not his target audience.<br>For example, this sentence:<br><br>The very fact that supply-push distribution decouples production from immediate demand means enormous costs of warehousing inventory for which there is no immediate demand, shipping stuff thousands of miles, and high-pressure marketing.<br><br>My understanding is that most businesses now operate on just-in-time delivery mode so who is warehousing? Perhaps the actual manufacturer? OK, good, but I don't quite see his solution. It looks to me like he is using just one or two examples to make a very vague claim, but in order to become hopeful that things aren't so bad, I would need to see at least ten systems parsed as to their ability to be ephemeralized. Two orders of magnitude cheaper! That's a big claim.<br>How are we to manufacture solar panels without supply-push? Wait for the orders to come in? And what has that to do with eliminating the need to ship things thousands of miles?<br><br>Europeans apparently drive about 1/3 as much as Americans do, yet they seem to need about the same highway infrastructure.<br>Some of his ideas are good, such as completely changing the setup of communities to eliminate sprawl and driving, but that is not ephemeralization. I'd like to know how he expects to do away with the interstate highway system and civil aviation. He mentions them, but then moves on to talk about solar panels and wireless. <br>I think he's mixing up a few ideas. One, excessive greed and making as much money as possible as an end in itself and including the corrupt laws this generates, two, the need to go local (food actually being the primary one here) and finally the possibility that some of our products can be ephemeralized.<br><br>But the geekoisi - I got a kick out of that.<br><br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c5502894925950935347 title="comment permalink">10/3/13, 7:00 AM</a><br><br>

To extend that a bit, it's the idea that flows of energy (to run server farms, maintain the cloud, to broadcast radio signals, etc.) can replace physical infrastructure that is made up of masses of physical materials. This eventually must run into the problem that energy flows are one time, while matter is persistent. When the energy flow stops the information encoded within that flow disappears. If it was truly ephemeral and had little associated physical infrastructure, then nothing is left – it is all transient. And of course information and data cannot really provide the necessities of life, as for example one cannot eat it. So the appeal of this approach is limited to those who are already comfortable and have those necessities of life covered. <br><br>Beyond that, as an engineer who designs analog circuitry and hardware, and works in a facility that manufactures, I tend to resent the attitudes of some in the programmer/IT crowd. There is a tendency for those who do not understand the details of a field to assume there is nothing to it, and I have found this to be true of the Internet/IT/computer crowd. In fact there is a vast and complex physical infrastructure required to manufacture, support, manage and power the systems behind the apparently clean and simple (ephemeral?) world they believe they inhabit. This equipment is highly specialized and complex, and difficult to repurpose. It is only an illusion. <br><br>I see this also in regard to the electric power grid and the hand waving assumptions about how it will work with distributed, renewable generation. There is little recognition of the real, practical issues of the changes that will be required to the design of the grid and the investment that will entail. Grid tied solar power is essentially storing locally generated power in the power “cloud”.<br><br>Finally, as you have often pointed out, society must be capable of making the investment to build the systems envisioned, and willing to do so.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c6619235577019778680 title="comment permalink">10/3/13, 7:57 AM</a><br><br>

Ken Rockwell points out on his website that film is an enduring technology: large format cameras still out-perform digital in terms of resolution, the lenses and shutters made 50-100 years ago still work surprisingly well, prints and negatives still work without operating system changes, etc. I'm restoring a 100+ yr old view camera (using hide glue...so it could be re-done some day if need be, plus it allows me to work really slowly and easily clean up the drips and runs with clear water and a rag) and trying to learn about more local technologies. The amount of pre-work required to do some of the "alternative" processes is daunting. But, try finding film at a local photo store, I know I can get it on the internet, but each emulsion is different and I have no control over whether Fuji or Illford will keep making it. <br><br>BTW, it is possible to develop typical film and prints in strong coffee (at room temp). do a search on "caffenol bible." You'll still need some other chemicals incl. fixer, but this does sound less toxic. I look forward to playing with it myself.<br><br> This has me seriously contemplating going back to 1851 to 1900 technology to maintain some control over the process, but even that assumes I can buy basic chemicals (i.e. Silver Nitrate, metal halides, various iron compounds, nitrocellulose, ethyl alchol and diethyl ether, etc). If I had to make those first, I'd give up, sadly.<br><br>Similarly, my beloved oil painting: If I had to make walnut oil from walnuts, I could, I suppose. Likewise, I could probably find different colored clays and chalks and powder charcoal, and grind/mull/mix my own very limited colors. But, colors like what "powered" the impressionists in the 1800's (minerals based like the broad range of Cadmium colors reds, yellows, oranges, the synthetic replacement for precious stones like lapis for blue, along with the Tin compound that leads to cerulean blue, Cobalt violet, ZnO white, etc) are very dear to me. As are some of the modern even higher intensity colors like the Quinacridones (red/magentas), Anthroquinones (red to blue), Dioxazine purple, Azo yellos, phthalocyanine blues and greens, Titanium dioxide white. This sort of pigment (not dyes) just aren't possible without a chemical industry. The colors will be vibrant for 100's ?1000? years with proper care out of the weather, but...then there are brushes, really nice ones are amazing technology. I tend to paint on masonite, but copper sheet is reputed to be nice and regular wood works great too for the sizes I like. Canvas is too springy for me.<br><br>I should be morose about the decline in effectiveness of antibiotics, emerging zoonotic diseases, the food chain's reliance on diesel fuel, government run amok, how heating in the US mainly depends on electricity...the food, shelter, clothing and spiritual stuff endangered by human folly, but I weep for the future of visual art. Crazy, I know.<br><br>I take some comfort from the fact that charcoal is easy to make, visually powerfully expressive, has an immense tonal range (black black to as white as the surface drawn on). Paper is easy to make. And, if you have a rough surface, all that "useless" copper, brass, aluminum (silver, gold, too) can be used to make drawings.

Happily, I can’t really relate to your example of cloud computing, since I haven’t the foggiest about it, but such thinking is in evidence all around me. All and sundry seem to read the same short photo-laden magazine articles which tout growing a garden and keeping chickens as the antidote to dependence on an industrial food system with a 1500 mile long supply chain, and race right out to get their plants from Big Box Store and their chickens in the mail from a hatchery halfway across the country.<br><br>Mostly, I think it’s great. I think everyone should give it a try, and learn firsthand just how hard it is to produce food. And I love keeping chickens, and the other critters we have about the place. But I know enough of whole systems to understand that even though I no longer depend on the conventional food system for eggs, milk, and meat that have traveled to upstate NY from a thousand miles away, I still very much depend on commercially prepared grain to feed my animals, grain more often than not way better traveled than I am. So, I have gained some skills, and I am doing work I enjoy, but I understand that have replaced one vulnerability for another. Working on that, but it’s a huge challenge for me. Sharon Astyk talks a lot about this in her latest book, but I have yet to convince the kids that I need their pet rabbits to feed the barn cats. Will keep working on this too, poor dears. <br> <br>And now, when people ask me what I do for a living, instead of saying "homeschooling goat farmer", I can say (with some authority) “systems analyst”. On a (not very) related note—when I informed my new neurologist that I farm for a living and also homeschool my kids, he asked me if I also ever engage in any “intellectually challenging” activities.

Their home had been bulldozed, and they were using masonry hammers to remove the mortar from the joints, i.e. you can re-use brick as a structural element again and again as long as they aren't damaged in the demolition process. Old Roman bridges are probably similar, if the bridge is damaged the stone or brick work can be taken and used in the construction or repair of a new bridge.

Douglas Adams, in one of the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" series, explains that people can respond calmly to almost any crisis or danger, if the event is cloaked in a "Somebody Else's Problem" field. (In the book, the invasion of hostile aliens comes with just such a field.) Cloud computing rounds up a variety of inconveniences: power consumption, data backup, floor space, application maintenance, facility cooling, computing and communication hardware selection, hardware maintenance, security, etc., and makes them all Somebody Else's Problem. All the customer needs to do is define the application, send data, and send money. Cloud computing is claimed to be efficient: when one customer isn't using the peak capacity they've contracted for, another customer can be using it. The economies of scale are tremendous.<br> <br>Of course, it's fragile. No customer can control when their own peak demand will coincide with any (or every) other customer's peak demand. And no customer can sue for continued support when the cloud provider goes out-of-business. No customer can ensure that the ultra-geek that keeps everything going is paid in accordance with his worth. But those possibilities are Somebody Else's Problem, and letting them discourage you from taking advantage of the cloud would not enhance shareholder value.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c689741752481417692 title="comment permalink">10/3/13, 2:38 PM</a><br><br>

There have been suggestions that one of the reasons why the Obama administration made such a humiliating retreat on Syria was because the Russians had supplied electronic warfare technologies capable of jamming GPS signals to the Syrian military, which would have severely degraded the effectiveness and accuracy of weapons like the Tomahawk cruise missile. <br><br>http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/MID-01-031013.html<br><br>This would have forced the USAF and USN to rely much more on manned aircraft, and Syria has much stronger and more modern air defenses than Iraq or Libya had. No doubt, the US military could have overcome Syrian air defenses given enough airplanes, missiles and effort, but it would have been considerably more expensive and difficult, and there probably would have been more politically embarrassing collateral damage incidents due to reduced missile accuracy. The US Navy has recently acknowledged the issue, and has stated that the next generation anti-ship missile (LRASM, prototypes recently started testing) needs to be able to fly its mission without relying on satellite guidance. Looks like the US model of push-button and video game style warfare is approaching its sell-by date due to the development of effective counter-measures.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c2126635755766035660 title="comment permalink">10/3/13, 3:30 PM</a><br><br>

Carson deserves some criticism for that, but so do those who think that the idea of ephermalization can be dismissed simply because Kevin had a metaphor failure. <br><br>Ephemeralization is not merely the idea of doing more with less as described by others here - it is doing so using a system of design metaphysics that often demand the systemic rethinking of what we do and how we live. For example, a device like a Mike Reynolds Earthship might be considered a much more appropriate example of ephemeralization, providing shelter/heat/cooling/lighting/water gathering/drinking/bathing/'waste' recycling/and food production in one low-impact package that is more resilient than the typical alternatives. <br><br>Regarding the history of the dymaxion car - the vehicle that crashed was a 1933 prototype with a canvas roof - the design was not inherently more dangerous than any mid-century convertible. One way to reduce the risks on collision would be to up-armor it with more weight and more wheels. Another way (more in line with Fuller's idea) would be using material science to put in a roll bar and crash cage. And the idea that fatal collisions on Lake Shore Drive have been exceeding rare over the past century is highly suspect - quick research indicates that in a recent 5 year period, there were 17 fatalities just at the S-Bend (which is being redesigned). <br><br>Yes, geodesic domes lost steam - for the caulking reason you mentioned, and also because the are best at enclosing large volumes, while most houses and greenhouses really are attempts at enclosing surface areas that have a modest volume tagging along. The caulk issue is yet another example of Fuller being ahead of his time - One might also note that the dream of human powered flight envisioned by (among others) Leonardo da Vinci had to remain on hold for a few hundred years until materials science (another good example of ephemeralization) presented the stuff with a suitable strength/weight ratio. Caulking material and assembly techniques for leak-tight domes don't seem to be huge issues that would not be solved by a modest research program and economies of scale. Even then, a dome is better for enclosing a moving radar tower or a pile of coal/salt/phosphate rock. <br><br>Finally, the discussion of 'efficiency' indicates that most of the people bandying the word about think that it is some dimensionless reality that exists apart from our frame of reference. In fact, the word only makes sense when it is expressed in terms of some concrete particular that we are interested in ... e.g., US farming is very efficient in terms of production per acre or people fed per farmer, but it is incredibly inefficient in terms of energy in versus energy out or in terms of conserving or regenerating topsoil.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c2919578306967053761 title="comment permalink">10/3/13, 6:37 PM</a><br><br>

Malnutrition rates have tripled in the developing world, and even the poor of the developed world are beginning to go hungry. Due to hunger, drug-resistant diseases, and low birth rates, world population peaks around 8.5 billion and begins to decline. High-quality fossil fuels are mostly depleted, and desperate plans to harvest further tar sands along with Arctic oil, methane clathrates, and even kerogen (at very low EROEI) are being hastily implemented.<br><br>My question: how are these events reported in The Economist? My best guess is that they will run an article on how world population has peaked earlier and lower than the "doomsayers" had claimed. Therefore, overpopulation isn't an issue! They will go on to note that worldwide per-capita energy use and carbon emissions have begun to decline (because scarcity caused high prices which caused demand destruction, hence "peak demand"), so there's no need to worry too much about environmental issues either. The next article then talks about the Arctic Ocean oil boom, the efforts to liquify kerogen, and gas extraction from seafloor methane clathrates, so technology has is solving the energy crisis too! Finally, the last article mentions the food crisis by discussing new genetically modified crops with record yields, given enough (now quite scarce) fertilizer, and ends with a couple of paragraphs lionizing the billionaires who have deigned to contribute some money towards famine relief.<br><br>I think the cult of progress will manage to keep itself going for quite some time this way. In a sense, "progress" is defined as whatever happens in the future, with some rosy-sounding rhetoric to make it sound as though that future is better than the past.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c7157502771360976379 title="comment permalink">10/3/13, 6:39 PM</a><br><br>

It’s is the kind of stuff that I think can actually be aired out in the mainstream and be taken seriously, unlike some of the more (dare I say) esoteric material discussed here. I’m wondering if we’ll hear from Carson himself in this comments forum? The ironies you build up to here are indeed juicy, it would be interesting to hear the man respond…<br>As for the implications of the collapse at hand I am particularly interested in the “abandonment of excess” as a sort of forced, collective vow of poverty, if you will. Of course, once whole branches of industry, or sub-sets of systems fail to retain viability, lots of people will simply be out of work, and without services they previously considered normal/ permanent. No doubt “making do” will be an emergent theme. But as you point out regularly, for a population that consumes well above the global average, there’s probably plenty of capacity to cushion the blows of collapse as we shed superfluous “needs” and “wants”. The challenge is at the leadership level, which must frame the shift (of letting go) as something desirable, and as a way to make the best of an otherwise losing proposition.<br>Of course we seem to be stuck in a phase of only considering a winning proposition… hence the feel-good re-definition of “ephemeral”. I have come to wonder why we lie to ourselves so elaborately? We do so with such sophistication in so many areas (especially advertising). Is it simply the blind faith in Progress at work here? Is it a pre-emptive strike against the cognitive dissonance we’re trying to ignore? Is there perhaps a collective trauma from the downturns of the 20th century at play (war, Depression)? Whatever may be the cause, it never ceases to amaze me how good we are at it, even if (and more likely because) we are generally slack in our capacity for critical analysis of reality…<br><br>By the way,<br>Did anyone ever think of putting shingles on a geodesic dome?

The logic here is very much along the lines of deciding what to do when your ship's sinking: you can get people into lifeboats or you can fling all available efforts into trying to keep the ship afloat, but there isn't time to do both, and so a realistic assessment of the situation is essential -- and if the ship really is going down, any action that doesn't involve life jackets and lifeboats really is a waste of time. <br><br>Thrig, that's a classic.

This seems to be a common problem, and not just in the army. There have been at least two recent incidents of American warships running aground because of over-reliance on GPS and the atrophy of traditional navigation skills, not to mention common sense. As the saying goes, common sense isn’t very common anymore. <br><br>This has been a growing problem on the civilian side as well. There have been a number of cases of American motorists and hikers getting hopelessly lost, even dying, in wilderness areas because they placed too much trust in their GPS receivers. There was a case a few years ago in the Mojave Desert that got a lot of press when a woman nearly died and lost her six year old son because she trusted her GPS too much, ignored warning signs, took a wrong turn and got stranded on a road that had been closed for safety reasons. Experts said that if she had a map and compass and had used them, this almost certainly would not have happened. But how many Americans or other Westerners even know how to use a map and compass anymore?<br><br>There was also an airport in Alaska that had several incidents of people wandering onto one of the taxiways because of a faulty iPhone app. People blindly followed the GPS instructions even though there were warning signs, barriers, airplanes using the taxiway and adjacent runway and all the rest. One wonders if over-reliance on GPS, phone apps and other techno-toys will become a major source of Darwinian selection in the near future. I suspect it will, especially in Western countries when far too many people have blind faith in the latest electronic toys combined with a dumbed down educational system, a severe dearth of common sense and a ridiculous entitlement mentality.<br><br>As for missile guidance systems, yes there are workable alternatives to GPS such as inertial guidance and optical correlation. Actually, many GPS guided weapons do use INS as a backup, but high grade inertial navigation systems like the ones used in ICBM’s are expensive, which is why missile designers turned to GPS as an alternative. The LRASM anti-ship missile I mentioned earlier will use a combination of a high grade INS for the midcourse phase and an optical guidance system for target search and terminal homing and so do many of other recent cruise missile designs such as the Norwegian NSM/JSM and the Taiwanese Hsiung Feng 2E.<br><br>Still, there are a lot of missiles, smart bombs and other weapons systems out there that rely on GPS, and they won’t all be replaced or retrofitted in the near future, which creates a major source of vulnerability if a nation like the US is attacking an enemy with decent counter-measures. The US military got too used to beating up on enemies that couldn’t fight back and assumed that would always be the case (remember all the rhetoric about “Full Spectrum Dominance”?). This is one of the reasons for such idiotic weapons systems as the F-35, which will be highly vulnerable when faced with enemy planes like the Su-35, the PAK-FA and the J-20.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c3537606888356189057 title="comment permalink">10/4/13, 2:19 PM</a><br><br>

Like the mis-use of the term "ephemeral", "efficiency" to an economist may not actually consist of getting more productivity out of a unit of energy. (to me, growing up, efficiency was always this - miles per gallon, for example). But as you point out, efficiency has more to do with optimising profit, and is probably a concept that will have to die once the costs of energy can no longer be dismissed as negligible...<br>One great loss of resilience is the disappearance of traditional skills that we may yet need again one day. One example that springs to mind is the art of plastering a wall. Drywall is a marvelous invention, but it represents a huge investment in industrial systems - transport being key... if producing drywall is lost to us, will there be craftspeople who can smooth out a wall over lathe-boards still?... There are many examples like this.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c8203955784049665721 title="comment permalink">10/4/13, 3:02 PM</a><br><br>

You may know more about this topic than I do, but for anyone else who might be reading this who doesn't, in a nutshell, epigenetics studies molecular "switches" that reside in conjunction with many (all?) genes that make us specifically who we are. When times are good our metabolic genes move into a "land of milk and honey" setting, and we require more calories, get taller, stronger, etc. When times get tough the epigene throws the switch back to the "40 years in the desert" setting, and we can then live on far fewer calories, not get as big, (probably don't run for fun), etc.<br><br>I hope I have that right or close enough, it's been a while. Anyway, our tolerance to environmental conditions can be improved by throwing these epigene switches, and my wife and I decided that the first thing we were going to do for our children in this regard was live without air conditioning. We did move from the south Georgia coastal plain to the north Georgia mountains in the process! But we figured, hey, tackle the big energy hogs one at a time and make our grandchildren a lot more comfortable in the process.

I always understood his main goal was the intellectually exciting challenge of finding ways for all people to live well and comfortably, within the limits of renewable energy and resources available on this planet, and to copy natural systems as the main principle for engineering.<br>I always understood 'ephemeralization' to be a description of the fact that to accomplish tasks at greater scales, you use less physical tools i.e., to measure a board for a box (very short distance), you use a ruler (solid and heavy); to measure beams for a house (longer distance), you use string (flexible &amp; lighter); to survey a field (long distance), you triangulate with sight (ephemeral). I never took it to be a prescription for production, although he did spend a lot of effort exploring possibilities for building with lighter materials tried different architecture that would -- he hoped -- use less materials, take less time, require less effort and use less energy.<br>I have never seen any incompatibility between his dictum to "do more with less" and the appropriate-tech movement which, it seems to me, was trying to do exactly that: use less energy and produce less waste. The difference between the two, I believe, is in sensibilities:<br>Appropriate Tech feels to me to be about focusing on down home, hands-on, D.I.Y., almost rustic solutions to questions of energy and materials using basic materials, whereas Buckminster Fuller feels like he was about techno-triumphalism, using industrial mass production and advanced technology; in a sense, trying to bring into being the futuristic world expressed by Art Deco, the vision of Hugo Gernsback, and the expectation that all humans, everywhere, could live comfortably thanks to complex industrial technology. It is the same sensibility the drives Lovins and the Rocky Mountain Institute, that is behind "Factor Four" and I think they were not entirely wrong, once upon a time.<br>We could have chosen that path.<br>But we didn't; we chose to keep on trucking (pun intended) and so that option is now closed, or closing rapidly.<br>You make the good point, and one that is not at all acknowledged by his disciples, that some of his ideas were failures because Fuller basically ignored Sod's Law, viz., "Sooner or later, the worst possible set of circumstances is bound to occur." and it's corollary, "All designs must be made resilient enough to withstand the worst possible set of circumstances." Nonetheless, I think the spirit of exploration and experimentation that he wrote about and the ideas he propounded are well worth keeping. If we devoted our efforts to 'livingry' instead of 'killingry' we'd all be a sight better off!<br>For me, Green Wizardry is all about respecting Sod's Law, but still not different from using Fuller's goal of minimizing resource use, as well as his sense of creativity and exploration.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c1382480325602486743 title="comment permalink">10/5/13, 1:49 AM</a><br><br>

I'm a big fan of the cob cottage, wattle and daub, straw bale, slaked lime, clay slip, natural plasters, stone and "urbanite" foundations, round poles, thatched roofs, recycled windows and doors, passive solar, wood heat and cooking, shall I continue? No? OK. I've actually experimented with several of these and would love to learn how to thatch. (Though I hear it takes a good long while to even get mediocre at it.)<br><br>Then this concept of "repurposability" pops up, something I've been giving some thought to for the last few years, too, and adds another dimension to that conversation. A well-built and maintained cob house can last a thousand years or more, but you aren't going to break it down into bricks and pave a road with it. Is site permanence the wave of the future? Völkerwanderung? Cob houses are anything but portable. Makes me teary just thinking about having to leave a house I put so much time and care into building.<br><br>Then you go and talk about how the amount of wood being burned on Earth has actually continued to climb, too, not being <i>replaced</i> by later technologies. I've always been concerned that a flight from fossil fuels could spell the end of our forests (and everything else that implies) in a wood-fired economy, but maybe there's a decent chance we can pick up some good habits along the way since it apparently won't be the big ship-jump I was thinking it might be. [We were living in a 16x20 wall tent last winter and went through 4 1/2 cords of firewood keeping it warm. Ugh.]<br><br>Anyway. What a trifecta of topics!<br><br>Might I throw 2 relevant technologies into that discussion? coppicing for firewood production and rocket mass stoves. The English commenters around here will be a lot more familiar with coppicing than most of us Yanks (driven by necessity no doubt), but, although he's originally Welsh, we have Ianto Evans on our side of the pond - the guru of efficient, build-it-yourself wood burning stoves.<br><br>Just ordered his book "Rocket Mass Heaters: Superefficient Woodstoves YOU Can Build." (We don't have a bookstore in our town I'm afraid.) Going to build one of these in the basement of the farmhouse we just moved into, and see how LITTLE wood we can burn this winter.

It would be good to have a way to replace them. Storing old ones it not the best way. Perhaps future factories will concentrate on those. It's hard to make your own - it's easy to make your own low-capacity capacitors, but the electrolytic type were invented exactly to allow large capacitances in relatively small spaces.<br><br>"the profit motive is going to need some discussion ... abstract will o' the fiscal wisp..."<br><br>- May I suggest that it is part of the religion of progress.

This was (I'm not making this up) a philosophy of project management that sought to reduce costs by, you guessed it, assuming success and skimping on fallbacks, testing, redundancy, etc. I called it Bloody Recklessness and was not popular at the time :-)<br><br>Actually "reckless" (a word we don't often stop and consider) is a *very* appropriate one for describing all these ephemeralisation/efficiency cantrips.

Cheap food that doesn't nourish, cheap clothes that don't last, cheap tools that won't hold an edge... OK, I'm sounding like an old fogey but it's true.

The farm I work for burns about 40 gallons of diesel in the delivery truck a week, getting the produce to market throughout the Bay Area. And as I make deliveries at nighttime, I observe that every major freeway in the region is undergoing some sort of construction project. Most of these are simply resurfacing and roadbed reconstruction; although CA Highway 4, the last unwidened route out to eastern Contra Costa County, is finally having its last stretch expanded. Also, curiously, the easternmost extension of the BART commuter rail system is to be powered by diesel initially and electrified later. Even though these efforts represent capital goods expenditures, I can't help but think it's a bit of a Red Queen's Race. The roads are just going to need the same full-scale overhaul after another 10 or 20 years of heavy-hauler abuse...<br><br>Another amusing point along the same lines is that my hometown is the proud host of a shiny new Amazon order fulfillment center. Comedically, however, the city government is offering to refund at least half of tax revenue from this operation should Amazon meet certain sales and employment targets. They're building all sorts of new streets, and eventually a new cloverleaf freeway-onramp system, but they are willing to give up a substantial portion of the money that will maintain these streets in the future! I can't help but think that this sort of slapdash financial planning fits the catabolic collapse concept to a T.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c4145194979740090176 title="comment permalink">10/5/13, 5:39 PM</a><br><br>

Ever since my first stab at college, nearly 10 years ago, I can't help but see the modern American university as something of a vampiric institution. One way or another, it wants to have its hooks in you for life. If I want a deluxe engineering education, even from a public school, then I'm likely to take on mid- to high-five figures in debt, which will compel me to start working under somebody else's aegis immediately, rather than striking out on my own. If I genuinely wanted to become a permanent part of the system as a tenured professor, then I get to labor as an underpaid grad student/post-grad for years and years. I can't help but be allured by the idea that there's still something worth bringing back from the cutting edge, but I am also stuck with the near-certainty that getting out there will cause me to end up as something of a serf.<br><br>I am glad to work on a farm and establish fundamental skills while I grapple with the education conundrum. What's interesting about the place is that my boss obtained a PhD in organic chemistry in the era of DDT and Agent Orange, and gradually realized that he didn't want to be involved with synthetic chemistry after all. In fact, he gave a seminar in which he recanted reductionism almost entirely. He was describing his three great tanks of liquid, fermenting compost, but didn't really have anything to say about what species of microbes might be growing within, or any specific recipe for the most "efficient" reaction. He simply adds waste products when they're available, and when it seems that the tank has reached a stable state, he hooks it into the water system and sprays it on the seedbeds, and to hell with what an agro-scientist might think. It is a most impressive (and fairly consistently profitable) way of doing business, but I still feel I can't attempt the same recantation of scientific reductionism until I've gone as far as I can with it on my own.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c2614739566402924509 title="comment permalink">10/5/13, 5:51 PM</a><br><br>

It is so easy to do so that even the homeless can and do accumulate material. I would even go so far as to say it’s doing the opposite that is truly challenging in the petro-age of abundance. Whether it’s a matter of collecting cars and real estate; shoes and furniture; or hoarding “collectible” junk, material accumulation is the order of the day. Is it because we fail to value what we have? Or because what we pay for is often overpriced crap (someone else’s profit margin), leaving us wanting? Or is it because our space that we fill is just a kind of landfill-depot/ shrine to our god Progress?

I'm honored. I'd like to thank The Economist for being so easy to make fun of.<br><br>Another thing I've been thinking lately is that it seems most of the "progress" that has happened lately has been electronic in nature, taking advantage of the fact that processing power can speed up at an exponential rate for a very long time (Moore's law). Moore's law is possible thanks to the fact that it is possible to build transistors smaller and smaller and pack more of them on a chip all the way down to scales of a few nanometers, which allowed doubling of processing power every ~2 years for decades.<br><br>I think a lot of the contemporary belief in continued exponential progress stems from the changes that have occurred in electronic devices thanks to Moore's law, which is not in general true with other technologies. Energy in particular doesn't work that way - it is possible to improve renewable energy technology to some extent, but nowhere near as quickly as electronics, never mind the fact that it is competing with energy sources with incredible energy densities on the order of 10 kcal/kg. <br><br>Suppose electronic technology had hit some sort of wall around 1990. People continue to use 5.25" floppy disks and play Oregon Trail, while using their dial-up modems to have discussions on Usenet, and cell phones are large and expensive. The world moves on otherwise, but electronic technology is stuck. Do you think that the ideology of progress would be anywhere near as prevalent as it is today? <br><br>As everybody here is well aware, over the past few decades American manufacturing has collapsed, our infrastructure is crumbling, the federal government is dysfunctional, resources are running low enough that "unconventional" sources have to be tapped, education and healthcare are vastly more expensive and no better in quality, climate change is beginning to have observable effects, wealth is concentrated in fewer hands and mostly used to blow speculative bubbles while most people are experiencing economic stagnation or decline, and so on. This is an age of decline by most measures.

Basically Tom walks us through the “limits of Nature” from this particular angle, and spells out the challenges, and the predicament we are faced with (hear here!). What’s relevant here is what followed: coincidentally enough the New York Times published an article on population growth by Erle Ellis (http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/#sthash.eQT8mYiU.dpuf) soon after Tom’s initial post, to which he added a brief rebuttal: http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2013/09/the-already-written-future/ <br>The NYT piece is a marvel in its determined optimism, and expression of faith in Progress, addressing limits to growth and the carrying capacity of the planet head-on; making the claim that people who worry about these things “demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of the ecology of human systems.” And that “The conditions that sustain humanity are not natural and never have been.” (!?!?) Followed later on by this nugget: “Who knows what will be possible with the technologies of the future?”<br>The reasoning is dressed up in historical and archaeological references, and cites Ester Boserup –supposedly the antidote to Malthus (don’t get me started), but throughout, he fails to make the key distinction about our energy situation that is glaringly necessary here. <br>The smug confidence with which he offers up this facile, and lacking argument, in such a prominent media outlet is simply maddening…<br>Anyway, it’s worth reading all three…<br><br><br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c2851007484993739010 title="comment permalink">10/5/13, 7:15 PM</a><br><br>

On the positive side, I strongly suspect that growing your own food and raising your own meat and milk is more resilient, at least in the near term even if you buy your feed. Industrial farming (organic or conventional) has some legs given outright food shortages are the fastest known route to regime change. As a consequence, I expect the current farming system to continue to be heavily subsidized until there is no larger system to do so. This is not to say food will not become more expensive. I'm just saying farmers will continue to be protected. So its a fair bet you can continue to buy animal feed for sometime even as store bought food becomes more expensive and less available. The feed will become more expensive too but a modest profit margin will still be there. If not, then everyone starves. <br><br>I recently crunched the numbers for what we would have to pay to buy what we produce ourselves for ourselves. The total value of the food (eggs, chickens, fruits &amp; vegetables, maple syrup) and fuel (firewood and charcoal) was only about $5000 for the year. The cost for this was considerably less. Of course I did not include my labour. We could perhaps triple the total produce value at the most. To pass that point we would need to get a tractor with various attachments. Of course this would involve a big increase in external dependance (unless I go for a walking tractor?). I am very shy of debt, thus I don't see getting a tractor anytime soon. As for growing our own animal feed, even with a tractor the numbers just don't work right now. <br><br>I think the key to negotiating catabolic collapse is shifting reliance to more resilience parts of the current system. Nobody can really opt out of the system entirely. The main issue is availability and cost for items you really require. If I rely on a rototiller, a chainsaw, and some mowers, I'm banking on the parts being available and affordable for some time. As this equipment is relatively low tech, I can do the repairs myself and so further reduce the cost. If I have a tractor … not some much ($1000 to replace a large tire!). Similarly. if I rely on furnace oil and store bought food for my existence, I am reliant on a system I expect to falter. Not fail completely right away, just become too expensive and unreliably. Most likely such reliance would drive me into unmanageable debt first before the system itself fails completely. Nothing new here really for us peasants of empire: debt and food being two of the three themes of the Lord's prayer; the temptation to seek violent solutions to the first two problems being the third.<br><br>Nice to hear you got another neurologist. Speaking from personal experience, both home schooling and small scale farming are undoubtedly intellectually challenging as well a great fun.<br><br>Dave Coulter<br><br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c2399703327550447582 title="comment permalink">10/5/13, 8:51 PM</a><br><br>

I suspect that on a systems level that peaked on the tradeoff between efficiency and resiliency with DVD-ROMs, although on a local level terrabyte external hard drives definitely are convenient.

As I understand it, that's the main thing that keeps the dollar relatively stable, despite all the hanky-panky.

Of course they get a lot more joules out of the firewood that they put in from the gasoline, but without that gasoline catalyst their whole fuel supply chain collapses and their wood stove goes cold. <br><br>Another way to coppice is to live near a creek and steal wood from the beavers. I do this frequently.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c8776328203856872179 title="comment permalink">10/6/13, 3:28 PM</a><br><br>

For the last two or three years I was there (3rd or 4th through 5th grades), there were inkwells in these holes, which were filled with black ink every day from a large bottle with a spout built into its lid. (We all wanted to be the child who got to fill the inkwells that day.) We wrote cursive with a plain steel nib fixed into a wooden handle, with a cork collar where your fingers held the handle. <br><br>We all had blotters, which our mothers made at home for us. A blotter was a half-dozen pieces of brightly colored absorbent cloth rag, each about the size of a filing card, sewn together along one of the narrow sides to make a small book. The edges were cut with pinking shears.<br><br>To write, you stuck your pen in your inkwell, tapped it as you took it out (to get rid of excess ink), wrote a few words, and repeated the process . . . over and over. You pressed the blotter down on what you had written every few lines, waiting a few seconds before you did so, so as not to pick up all the ink from the last few words.<br><br>If you pressed too hard, the pen nib would spread, which could drop all the ink on your work and make blots. In the worst case, the nib could remain permanently spread. Then you had to throw it out and get a new one from the teacher. <br><br>The teacher used the same sort of pen, but her inkwell sat on her desk and had separate wells for black and for red ink. Fs were written in red ink, to drive home the public guilt and shame you were made to feel for doing sloppy work.<br><br>No quill pens in that school, but a friend about 10 years older than me had grown up in a Polish shtettle, and there he wrote (Polish in Latin letters, and Yiddish in Hebrew letters) with a quill pen in school, which he learned at a very early age to cut and trim just so. It's not quite the same way as professional calligraphers do it now with a reed or a quill.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c154571302049091025 title="comment permalink">10/7/13, 12:28 PM</a><br><br>

The almonds look almost ready to pick, but I'm not 100% sure when to do so as this is the first medium sized crop of them here. The other weird thing is that something is eating all of my tulips - systematically.<br><br>I joined another local food growers group recently and it is good fun making contacts in the local community and I've met some great people. The shame is that like farming in general it is mostly older people who take the time to get interested in growing food. Oh well.<br><br>Someone fed me the strangest tasting corn recently.

Dunno, though.<br><br>Hi KL Cooke,<br><br>Yeah, I remember those advertisements for x-ray glasses (although it is a dodgy premise when you think about it. hehe!).

While it’s true that they have perfected certain technologies that make the whole package a better, user-friendly drive, making them more accessible to all manner of driver… this may help in the auto-makers’ quest for efficiency of profit, but does little to boost the resiliency quotient of the average car, since the sheer mass/volume of the vehicle fleet is probably the biggest strike against the otherwise useful technology…<br>I’m not sure what I got myself into when I made that off-the-cuff remark about a resilience index, egged-on by an archdruid… Not even sure I am qualified to do such a thing, but a few thoughts have come to mind: I so far came up with four main categories of criteria for non-food items, namely 1) Durability – Is the product meant to last and will it? Is it repairable? By whom? Or is it disposable, recyclable etc.?; 2)Function –How useful, purposeful, necessary is it? Does it complexify or simplify? What systems does it support/ rely on?; 3) Manufacture – what are the socio-political implications of the product? Is it locally made or foreign? Sweat-shop, union or other? Who profits? &amp; 4)Energy &amp; resources – what non-renewables are required in operating?<br>As for cars, I actually think that after 100 years we should expect more than ten years from a vehicle, but that we should expect to use them much differently, and abandon the personal ownership model. I also suspect that as proven as the technology is, the gasoline engine is probably our best option moving forward, but only if we can manage to curtail its use dramatically through some pretty fundamental shifts in attitude and policy… only then would the resiliency quotient for cars move up from what I suspect should be a pretty low figure compared to, say, bicycles! <br><br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c8465542446424125568 title="comment permalink">10/7/13, 6:27 PM</a><br><br>

I guess you could sum up my view on this issue as it is incorrect to assume that it is impossible to come up with something better all round or (Ahriman), at the same time even if such a system did exist it is entirely possible that finding it would require more energy amount of potential energy stored in every star in our galaxy (Lucifer). This ties into the NP-hard issue.<br><br>As to the NP-Hard label. I personally learned about it at University and am faintly ashamed to say that I can't really remember any specific good books on the matter. That said I am now interested in looking into it myself and could tip you off to any I find. Apparently the book "Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness" is rather good.<br><br>To give a brief overview of the subject however. A decision problem is a problem for which the answer is either yes or no. A problem is solvable in polynomial time if you can construct a computer program such that the upper bound on the running time is bounded by some polynomial expression in the size of the input. For example the time to sort of length n can be bounded by t &lt; c*n*log(n) &lt; c*n^2 for some constant c. <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_%28complexity%29 rel=nofollow>NP</a> is the set of decision problems for which if the answer is yes, then it is possible to verify that the answer is yes in polynomial time. For example if a Sudoku puzzle is possible to solve, once I have solved the Sudoku puzzle it is reasonably easy to check to whether it is a correct solution and thus whether or not the Sudoku puzzle is solvable. Note that it is in general a lot harder to find such a solution, or to prove that no such solution exists. A problem "C" is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete rel=nofollow>NP-Complete</a> if it is both in NP and it is possible to convert every problem in NP into the problem "C" in polynomial time. The problem of whether or not a given logical argument is satisfiable is an example of such a problem. Because all problems in NP can be converted into an NP-complete problem in polynomial polynomial time that means that if any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time that all of them can be. <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-Hard rel=nofollow>NP-Hard</a> problems are basically the same as NP-Complete problems except they don't have to be in NP, that is to see the run time complexity to solve a problem which is NP-Hard is at least as bad as the worst problem in NP. An example of one of these problems is the travelling salesman problem, which asks given a set of n different cities what is the optimal route to visit each city at least once while travelling the smallest distance. Why is this at all interesting? Because as far as anyone knows the best upper bound for the run time of an NP-Complete problem is 2 to the power of n, that is to say exponential. It is of course important to point out that that is the worst case scenario some times you can solve one of these in a few seconds, even with large n, sometimes you'll have to switch of the computer after a year, or however long you want to wait.<br><br>Hopefully that wasn't to long winded.<br><br>Also if your interested in looking into this you will probably be particularly interested to know that many of the heuristics (methods of finding a decent solution in a decent amount of time) are based upon natural processes, evolution in the case of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm rel=nofollow>genetic algorithms</a>, and how ants find food in the case of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms rel=nofollow>ant colony optimization</a>.<br><br>Also you may wish to look into the related problem of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem rel=nofollow>Undecidability</a>. These particular they are what lead me to doubt whether progress could save us from this mess. Designing a sustainable society sounds pretty NP-Hard to me.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c4445293167858320335 title="comment permalink">10/8/13, 3:09 AM</a><br><br>

IE whereas you talk about the cost of infrastructure in catabolic collapse, Tainter's theory revolves around the slightly more abstract concept of 'complexity', where he says societies always invest more and more effort in 'complexity' (whether that be physical infrastructure, social hierarchy, etc) over time as a problem-solving response, and unless this involves side-effects of discovering new resource-extraction measures (e.g. the industrial revolution's somewhat accidental start via the symbiotic relationship between coal and the steam engine) this accelerating cost of complexity will get us in the end. See e.g. http://citizenactionmonitor.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/can-joseph-tainter-save-us-from-ourselves-pt-4-why-societies-become-complex-how-complexity-triggers-collapse/<br><br>It is an appealing theory - but similar to your views on an 'efficiency-resiliency' tradeoff, I'd quite like to see a response from an ecology perspective.<br><br>E.g. I wonder if some natural ecosystem, as a virtue of long-term evolution, show both a fairly high degree of efficiency and resilience _partly_ via applying complexity?<br><br>As I understand it this is arguably what permaculture is all about - whole systems design where the right set of components is selected that have "greater than the sum of their parts" complementary interactions. Easy to say on paper, hard to do in practice of course! And perhaps they talk a lot about redundancy in their designs too, I don't know as a non-practitioner.<br><br>Tangential point:- I've read a bit of Carson's work and you miss in your reply that he's a fairly committed Anarchist, of the big-A decentralised society with no need-for-a-state rather than the "smash-random-things-up" modern vulgarisation of the term.<br><br>So his ideal of a 'better future' is at least quite difference to a majority of people's - where he looks for / lionises techno-social change that reduces a need for state intervention in favour of decentralisation and greater self-management.

Here,Tennessee, is North America's answer to the Amazon basin, in terms of forest diversity and productivity (and also fish diversity, by the way -- as many species of freshwater fish here as in all the rest of the U.S. combined). Tulip poplar is widely used for lumber and firewood, it is a "soft hardwood" that grows very fast and makes acceptable fuel. My 130 year old farmhouse is made of it. Old growth heartwood like the structural parts of my house was very dense and durable, but of course it is also essentially non-existent in the wild anymore. Younger growth is similar to pine structurally, but a bit harder and not resinous (i.e. much better for fuel). It coppices quite well, but outside of it's native range it might not do so well. It is not a true poplar of course, being in the Magnolia family. <br><br>Black Cherry also does well here, as well as Red Maple. Poles even a few years old are dense and burn well (and can be used for finish carpentry -- trims and moldings, etc.). <br><br>One tree that seems like it might be a good choice is Black Locust. I planted some but have had no luck with it as fuel wood since the beavers like it too much, but it is reported to have good heat content and it definitely grows rapidly and resprouts from stumps readily. However, outside of its native range be careful as it can become an invasive weed species, spreading rapidly via aggressive roots. <br><br>Black Walnut here does the same as what you describe for pecan. I've tried singling them (cutting all but one shoot) to see if I can grow something useful. Definitely the early growth is very lightweight and brittle. <br><br>Sycamore is useless for anything but poles and fuel, but it is not necessarily bad for those purposes. It has a weird spiral grain and brittle structure that makes it impossible to split, however, so don't let it get too big. Its heat content is not great, but it just grows and grows so that might compensate some. <br><br>Oaks coppice pretty well, but the harvest cycle is slow. You need to limit the number of shoots per stand or you get just a bush of a dozen beanpoles that won't give you any useful wood for a couple of decades. <br><br>Again, just my experience in my bioregion.

I can offer a suggestion:<br><br>You first need to get up to speed on the computer science topic of "Time Complexity"; from wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity<br><br>Briefly, NP-hard (and NP-complete) problems lie within the domain of computer science denoted by "Time Complexity". This refers to the amount of time an algorithm requires to process a given quantity of data (or number of search paths, say). So, for a given data set of size N, an algorithm requires X amount of time to process it. The Time Complexity of the alogorithm refers to how much the computation time X increases as a function of the increase in N. So if the data set size is increased to 2N, then how much longer would the algorithm take? X times 2N?, N squared?, N cubed?, 2 to the N?.... When the time complexity involves an exponent, especially involving N, then you get into computational intractability, where it might take weeks, years or the age of the universe for the algorithm to finish.<br><br>Sometimes, you can come up with a faster algortihm. But many computational problems seem to not to have algorthmic approaches that allow solution in any reasonable amount of time. This property has been named NP-complete (or NP-hard which is an even worse category).<br><br>In the 1980's when I was a young electrical/software engineer, Time Complexity was a germain, vital topic. The mil-spec'd (military specified) hardware I worked on then was severely de-rated in performance as a trade-off for physical robustness. So it was slow even by 1980s standards. So getting algorithms to work on time with the anticipated data loads was a big deal, and a very tough problem for the programmer.<br><br>Nowadays, you'd assume that fast harware and clock-speeds would solve the problem. NOT SO!!! I recently obtained some source code (from some hotshot software students out of the Univ of Grenoble, France) to operate a simple brainwave biofeedback device. The application was trivial, and would have been a snap for me to have programmed back in 1981 with an 8 bit, 2 megahertz microprocressor; it would have built in 3-5 minutes, max. But on my modern 1.7 Gigahertz, 32 bit system, the software build-time (compilation and linking) took 24 hours!!!!!!!!<br><br>Those programmers just stitched together of bunch of software packages to perform the build task, with no thought at all given to Time Complexity, and produced a software package that would be unusable if it needed to be run more than once.<br><br>Since programmer time is so valuable, and computer time is so cheap, I suspect no one thinks about time complexity any more. I've recently met new computer science grads who have never heard of NP-complete problems or time complexity, and I often suspect that the slowness we see on the web, and in the systems and software that we run everyday reflect neglect and even ignorance of this topic. If I'm right, this problem will only get worse.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c6077945091171916815 title="comment permalink">10/8/13, 12:39 PM</a><br><br>

But just try heating the house, or heating water, or cooking, or even providing decent lighting, on pedal power!

I haven't darned for decades, but I still remember how to do it, it's so easy.<br><br>Ah, well, Deborah, now you've put me in an elegaic mood. I really don't want those skills to go lost, no more than I want all the (occult) magic I learned as a boy to go lost! I've passed some of all this on to my sons and former students, whatever each wanted to learn, but no matter how much I taught, it never felt as though it were enough against the rising tide of history. Of course, that's because it isn't enough, really, and can't ever be. Nothing could be. <br><br>We were all so capable back then -- so many skills are nearly lost now. I knew how to do almost any simple thing with wood, and some simple things with metal and stone.

What usually happens is that if the effort rises, we come to an epiphany in which we realize we didn't want that thing so very much after all.<br><br>My wife and I find clean dishes desirable. Washing them is work. We had a "labor saving" device that washes them for us, and since it was "free" (it came with the house, and the cost of running it was folded into a composite cost that doesn't break out this do-dad from all the other do-dads), we simply used it.<br><br>It recently developed a leak, which is highly undesirable. We have many options for addressing this, including buying a new machine. We looked at the cost of a new one -- not the cheapest possible replacement, but something that will work the way we'd like -- and that option tipped the whole concept toward the highly undesirable. The remaining solutions involve figuring out exactly where it is leaking, finding materials to repair it, fixing it two or three times because neither of us has done this before, cleaning up the leaks that result from our having done it wrong, worrying about whether the water was maybe doing more damage than we thought. Or we could hire an expert to fix it for us, but we'd still have to worry about whether he was the expert he claimed to be. The machine became so undesirable by this point that we decided to put off any decisions and just wash by hand.<br><br>For the two of us, we find that the labor cost of washing by hand is actually LESS than using the machine, because we've put in some true labor-savers, like a decent drying rack and new dish towels. Plus, we no longer run out of glasses and forks -- with the machine, we tried to use it efficiently, which meant running large loads infrequently, which in turn led to running out of dishes: we'd look for a clean cup, find the cupboard empty, open the machine, take out a dirty cup, and wash it by hand ANYWAY. Plus, the big pots wouldn't fit, and some of our items aren't dishwasher-safe. Plus, you <i>must</i> pre-rinse, or you end up with crud crusted into every hollow of every upside-down mug. Plus, if you reheated pizza in the microwave, the melted cheese wouldn't wash off the plates, so you still had to do them by hand, but now with petrified cheese atomically bound to the substance of the plate. Plus....<br><br>That machine was a bloody pain in the rear. It had <i>always been</i> a bloody pain in the rear.<br><br>Note that there was nothing "environmental" about our choice. It was purely a matter of economic good sense, and the fact that this machine simply tipped over the line from desirable into undesirable because of the maintenance and use cost -- not unaffordable, but <i>undesirable</i>. We don't think back with a tear in our eye about the "good old days when we used the machine."<br><br>Now, before I get pilloried for the middle-class <i>gaucherie</i> of this trite little story, I think it's worth pointing out that we live in a culture that aspires to exactly this middle-class <i>gaucherie</i>, and our global economic and environmental problems are merely mountainous piles of such triteness. <br><br>The instant we actually have to <i>work</i> to charge up a battery, the electronic trinket market will dry up, and no one will look back on it with any love at all.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c7215370413160610315 title="comment permalink">10/8/13, 6:34 PM</a><br><br>

I also have several hackberries in the area immediately around the HQ, and they come in in the fencerows and other sheltered areas, but not like the pecans and sycamore.<br><br>I also have honey locust, but not the black locust you mentioned. I'm also thinking about bodock (osage orange) or trifoiate orange, which is a native I was going to use in hedgerows.<br><br>As far as the biodiversity is concerned, I'm sure you're right. Topography here doesn't lend itself to a lot of ecotones, and the corn, soybean, and cotton monocultures don't help, either.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c1347060806586339491 title="comment permalink">10/9/13, 7:41 PM</a><br><br>

I would like to see the Quadrivium make a big comeback - if we're headed backwards in time, it might be useful to start drawing hard lines below which we don't want to do, and education could use an overhaul anyway. Are you interested in classical education? Let me know if you want my email.

It makes sense to have a power dishwasher in a restaurant or commercial kitchen, where you go through hundreds of plates/cups/bowls per day and they are washed fresh (not dry and crusty). It makes sense to have blenders and power mixers in an industrial kitchen.<br><br>But in a home kitchen these gizmos tend to suffer from error of scale, or negative returns; the dishwasher story above is a perfect illustration, and so is the poor time equation of most blenders and food processors -- you spend more time cleaning the gizmo after use than you saved by using it!<br><br>I suspect that this all has to do with the fetishisation of industrial style and "efficiency", such that people now feel compelled to remodel their home life in a more industrial mould. It's a marvellous incentive for consumerism as we over-buy, over-tool, load ourselves down with gear that is either appropriate, or pretending to be appropriate, to much larger-scale activities. You see trophy homes with magnificent stainless kitchens suitable for a mid-size restaurant, and the family is living off microwave meals. You see monster 4WD "Ram Tough" trucks being driven to the shopping mall and back. Get my drift?<br><br>There's a false attempt here to bring the "magic of industrial efficiency" (i.e. scale and power) into our personal lives -- these items and styles I am convinced are totemic rather than functional. Maybe JMG is going to go here (a territory that has long fascinated me) in future posts on "efficiency" as cult and fashion. We could also talk about the militarisation of pop culture, but that's a whole 'nother can of worms.<br><br><a href=the-flight-to-ephemeral.html#c45551545564297656 title="comment permalink">10/10/13, 7:58 PM</a><br><br>

Anyway, there was heavy rain, and the whole dome leaked massively. It pleased me that the stupid dolls got soaked.
