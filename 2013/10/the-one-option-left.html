<div class=MsoNormal>
The recent round of gridlock in Washington DC may seem worlds away from the mythological visions and spiritual perspectives that have been central to this blog over the last few months. Still, there’s a direct connection. The forces that have driven American politicians into their current collection of blind alleys are also the forces that will make religious institutions very nearly the only structures capable of getting anything done in the difficult years to come, as industrial civilization accelerates along the time-honored trajectory of decline and fall.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To make sense of the connection, it’s necessary to start with certain facts, rarely mentioned in current media coverage, that put the last few weeks of government shutdown and potential Federal default in their proper context. These days the US government spends about twice as much each year as it takes in from taxes, user fees, and all other revenue sources, and makes up the difference by borrowing money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Despite a great deal of handwaving, that’s a recipe for disaster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you, dear reader, earned US$50,000 a year and spent US$100,000 a year, and made up the difference by taking out loans and running up your credit cards, you could count on a few years of very comfortable living, followed by bankruptcy and a sharply reduced standard of living; the same rule applies on the level of nations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Were you to pursue so dubious a project, in turn, one way to postpone the day of reckoning for a while would be to find some way to keep the interest rates you paid on your loans as low as possible. This is exactly what the US government has done in recent years. A variety of gimmicks, culminating in the current frenzy of “quantitative easing”—that is to say, printing money at a frantic pace—has forced interest rates down to historically low levels, in order to keep the federal government’s debt payments down to an annual sum that we can pretend to afford. Even a fairly modest increase in interest rates would be enough to push the US government into crisis; an increase on the same scale as those that have clobbered debt-burdened European countries in recent years would force an inevitable default. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Sooner or later, that latter is going to happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s the unmentioned context of the last few cycles of intractable financial stalemates in Washington. For more than a decade now, increasingly frantic attempts to kick the can further and further down the road have thus been the order of the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In order to prevent a steep economic contraction in the wake of the 2000 tech-stock crash, the US government and the Federal Reserve Board—its theoretically independent central bank—flooded the economy with cheap credit and turned a blind eye to what became the biggest speculative delusion in history, the global real estate bubble of 2004-2008.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When that popped, in turn, the US government and the Fed used even more drastic measures to stave off the normal consequences of a huge speculative bust. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
None of those measures has a long shelf life. They’re all basically stopgaps, and it’s probably safe to assume that the people who decided to put them into place believed that before the last of the stopgaps stopped working, the US economy would resume its normal trajectory of growth and bail everyone out. That hasn’t happened, and there are good reasons to think that it’s not going to happen—not this year, not this decade, not in our lifetimes. We’ll get to those reasons shortly; the point that needs attention here is what this implies for the federal government here and now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At some point in the years ahead, the US government is going to have to shut down at least half its current activities, in order to bring its expenditures back in line with its income. At some point in the years ahead, equally, the US government is going to have to default on its $8 trillion dollars of unpayable debt, plus however much more gets added as we proceed. The shutdown and default that have absorbed so much attention in recent weeks, in other words, define the shape of things to come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This time, as I write these words, a temporary compromise seems to have been slapped together, but we’ll be back here again, and again, and again, until finally the shutdown becomes permanent, the default happens, and we move on into a harsh new economic reality. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary at this point to remind my readers again that this doesn’t mean we will face the kind of <a href=../../2006/09/economics-avoiding-y2k-fallacy.html>imaginary full stop</a> beloved by a certain class of apocalyptic theorists. Over the last twenty years or so, quite a few countries have slashed their government expenditures and defaulted on their debts. The results have included a great deal of turmoil and human suffering, but the overnight implosion of the global economy so often predicted has failed to occur, and for good reason. Glance back over economic history and you’ll find plenty of cases in which nations had to deal with crises of the same sort the US will soon face. All of them passed through hard times and massive changes, but none of them ceased to exist as organized societies; it’s only the widespread fixation on fantasies of apocalypse that leads some people to insist that for one reason or another, it’s different this time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I plan on devoting several upcoming posts to what we can realistically expect when the US government has to slash its expenditures and default on its debts, the way that Russia, Argentina, and other nations have done in recent decades. For the moment, though, I want to focus on a different point: why has the US government backed itself into this mess? Yes, I’m aware of the theorists who argue that it’s all a <a href=../../2007/09/searching-for-scapegoats.html>part of some nefarious plan</a>, but let’s please be real: to judge by previous examples, the political and financial leaders who’ve done this are going to have their careers terminated with extreme prejudice, and it’s by no means impossible that a significant number of them will end up dangling from lampposts. It’s safe to assume that the people who have made these decisions are aware of these possibilities. Why, then, their pursuit of the self-defeating policies just surveyed? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That pursuit makes sense only if the people responsible for the policies assumed they were temporary expedients, meant to keep business as usual afloat until a temporary crisis was over. From within the worldview of contemporary mainstream economics, it’s hard to see any other assumption they could have made. It’s axiomatic in today’s economic thought that economic growth is the normal state of affairs, and any interruption in growth is simply a temporary problem that will inevitably give way to renewed growth sooner or later. When an economic crisis happens, then, the first thought of political and financial leaders alike these days is to figure out how to keep business as usual running until the economy returns to its normal condition of growth. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The rising spiral of economic troubles around the world in the last decade or so, I suggest, has caught political and financial officials flatfooted, precisely because that “normal condition of growth” is no longer normal. After the tech-stock bubble imploded in 2000, central banks in the US and elsewhere forced down interest rates and flooded the global economy with a torrent of cheap credit. Under normal conditions, this would have driven an investment boom in productive capital of various kinds: new factories would have been built, new technologies brought to the market, and so on, resulting in a surge in employment, tax revenues, and so on. While a modest amount of productive capital did come out of the process, the primary result was a speculative bubble even more gargantuan than the tech boom. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was a warning sign too few people heeded. Speculative bubbles are a routine reality in market economies, but under ordinary circumstances they’re self-limiting in scale, because there are so many other less risky places to earn a decent return on investment. It’s only when an economy has run out of other profitable investment opportunities that speculative bubbles grow to gargantuan size. In the late 1920s, the mismatch between vast investment in industrial capital and a wildly unbalanced distribution of income meant that American citizens could not afford to buy all the products of American industry, and this pushed the country into a classic overproduction crisis. Further investment in productive capital no longer brought in the expected rate of return, and so money flooded into speculative vehicles, driving the huge 1929 bubble and bust. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The parallel bubble-and-bust economy that we’ve seen since 2000 or so followed similar patterns on an even more extreme scale. Once again, income distribution in the United States got skewed drastically in favor of the well-to-do, so that a growing fraction of Americans could no longer support the consumer economy with their purchases. Once again, returns on productive investment sank to embarrassing lows, leaving speculative paper of various kinds as the only option in town. It wasn’t overproduction that made productive capital a waste of investment funds, though—it was something considerably more dangerous, and also less easy for political and financial elites to recognize. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The dogma that holds that growth is the normal state of economic affairs, after all, did not come about by accident. It was the result of three centuries of experience in the economies of Europe and the more successful nations of the European diaspora. Those three centuries, of course, happened to take place during the most colossal economic boom in all of recorded history. Two factors discussed in earlier posts drove that boom:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>first, the global expansion of European empires in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries and the systematic looting of overseas colonies that resulted; second, the exploitation of half a billion years of stored sunlight in the form of coal, petroleum, and natural gas.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Both those driving forces <a href=../../2012/03/america-two-empires.html>remained in place through the twentieth century</a>; the European empires gave way to a network of US client states that were plundered just as thoroughly as old-fashioned imperial colonies once were, while the exploitation of the world’s fossil fuel reserves went on at ever-increasing rates. The peaking of US petroleum production in 1972 threw a good-sized monkey wrench into the gears of the system and brought a decade of crisis, but a variety of short-term gimmicks postponed the crisis temporarily and opened the way to the final extravagant blowoff of the age of cheap energy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The peaking of conventional petroleum production in 2005 marked the end of that era, and the coming of a new economic reality that no one in politics or business is yet prepared to grasp. Claims that the peak would be promptly followed by plunging production, mass panic, and apocalyptic social collapse proved to be just as inaccurate as such claims always are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What happened instead was that a growing fraction of the world’s total energy supply has had to be diverted, directly or indirectly, to the task of maintaining fossil fuel production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Not all that long ago, all things considered, a few thousand dollars was enough to drill an oil well that can still be producing hundreds of barrels a day decades later; these days, a fracked well in oil-bearing shale can cost $5 to 10 million to drill and hydrofracture, and three years down the road it’ll be yielding less than 10 barrels of oil a day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These increased costs and diminished returns don’t take place in a vacuum. The energy and products of energy that have to be put into the task of maintaining energy production, after all, aren’t available for other economic uses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In monetary terms—money, remember, is the system of tokens we use to keep track of the value and manage the distribution of goods and services—oil prices upwards of $100 a barrel, and comparable prices for petroleum products, provide some measure of the tax on all economic activity that’s being imposed by the diversion of energy, resources, and other goods and services into petroleum production. Meanwhile fewer businesses are hiring, less new productive capital gets built, new technologies languish on the shelves:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the traditional drivers of growth aren’t coming into play, because the surplus of real wealth needed to make them function isn’t there any more, having had to be diverted to keep drilling more and more short-lived wells in the Bakken Shale. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The broader pattern behind all these shifts is easy to state, though people raised in a growth economy often find it almost impossible to grasp. Sustained economic growth is made possible by sustained increases in the availability of energy and other resources for purposes other than their own production. The only reason economic growth seems normal to us is that we’ve just passed through an era three hundred years long in which, for the fraction of humanity living in western Europe, North America, and a few other corners of the world, the supply of energy and other resources soared well past any increases in the cost of production. That era is now over, and so is sustained economic growth. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The end of growth, though, has implications of its own, and some of these conflict sharply with expectations nurtured by the era of growth economics. It’s only when economic growth is normal, for example, that the average investment can be counted on to earn a profit. An investment is a microcosm of the whole economy; it’s because the total economy can be expected to gain value that investments, which represent ownership of a minute portion of the whole economy, can be expected to do the same thing. On paper, at least, investment in a growing economy is a positive-sum game; everyone can profit to one degree or another, and the goal of competition is to profit more than the other guy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In a steady-state economy, by contrast, investment is a zero-sum game; since the economy neither grows nor contracts from year to year, the average investment breaks even, and for one investment to make a profit, another must suffer a loss. In a contracting economy, by the same logic, investment is a negative-sum game, the average investment loses money, and an investment that merely succeeds in breaking even can do so only if steeper losses are inflicted on other investments. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s precisely because the conditions for economic growth are over, and have been over for some time now, that the US political and financial establishment finds itself clinging to the ragged end of a bridge to nowhere, with an assortment of alligators gazing up hungrily from the waters below.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The stopgap policies that were meant to keep business as usual running until growth resumed have done their job, but economic growth has gone missing in action, and the supply of gimmicks is running very short. I don’t claim to know exactly when we’ll see the federal government default on its debt and begin mass layoffs and program cutbacks, but I see no way that these things can be avoided at this point.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor is this the only consequence of the end of growth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In a contracting economy, again, the average investment loses money. That doesn’t simply apply to financial paper; if a business owner in such an economy invests in capital improvements, on average, those improvements will not bring a return sufficient to pay for the investment; if a bank makes a loan, on average, the loan will not be paid back in full, and so on. Every one of the mechanisms that a modern industrial economy uses to encourage people to direct surplus wealth back into the production of goods and services depends on the idea that investments normally make a profit. Lacking those, the process of economic contraction becomes self-reinforcing because disinvestment and hoarding becomes the best available strategy, the sole effective way to cling to as much as possible of your wealth for as long as possible. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This isn’t merely a theoretical possibility, by the way. It occurs reliably in the twilight years of other civilizations. The late Roman world is a case in point:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>by the beginning of the fifth century CE, it was so hard for Roman businessmen to make money that the Roman government had laws requiring sons to go into their fathers’ professions, whether they could earn a living that way or not, and there were businessmen who fled across the borders and went to work as scribes, accountants, and translators for barbarian warlords, because the alternative was economic ruin in a collapsing Roman economy. Meanwhile rich landowners converted their available wealth into gold and silver and buried it, rather than cycling it back into the economy, and moneylending became so reliable a source of social ills that lending at interest was a mortal sin in medieval Christianity and remains so in Islam right down to the present. When Dante’s
<i>Inferno</i> consigned people who lend money at interest to the lowest part of the seventh circle of Hell, several notches below mass murderers, heretics, and fallen angels, he was reflecting a common belief of his time, and one that had real justification in the not so distant past.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Left to itself, the negative-sum game of economics in a contracting economy has no necessary endpoint short of the complete collapse of all systems of economic exchange. In the real world, it rarely goes quite that far, though it can come uncomfortably close. In the aftermath of the Roman collapse, for example, it wasn’t just lending at interest that went away. Money itself dropped out of use in most of post-Roman Europe—as late as the twelfth century, it was normal for most people to go from one year to the next without ever handling a coin—and market-based economic exchange, which thrived in the Roman world, was replaced by feudal economies in which most goods were produced by those who consumed them, customary payments in kind took care of nearly all the rest, and a man could expect to hold land from his overlord on the same terms his great-grandfather had known.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All through the Long Descent that terminated the bustling centralized economy of the Roman world and replaced it with the decentralized feudal economies of post-Roman Europe, though, there was one reliable source of investment in necessary infrastructure and other social goods. It thrived when all other economic and political institutions failed, because it did not care in the least about the profit motive, and had different ways to motivate and direct human energies to constructive ends. It had precise equivalents in certain other dark age and medieval societies, too, and it’s worth noting that those dark ages that had some such institution in place were considerably less dark, and preserved a substantially larger fraction of the cultural and technological heritage of the previous society, than those in which no institution of the same kind existed.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style='font-family: Times; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>In late Roman and post-Roman Europe, that institution was the Christian church. In other dark ages,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>other religious organizations have filled similar roles—Buddhism, for example, in the dark ages that followed the collapse of Heian Japan, or the Egyptian priesthoods in the several dark ages experienced by ancient Egyptian society. When every other institution fails, in other words, religion is the one option left that provides a framework for organized collective activity. The revival of religion in the twilight of an age of rationalism, and its rise to a position of cultural predominance in the broader twilight of a civilization, thus has a potent economic rationale in addition to any other factors that may support it. How this works in practice will be central to a number of the posts to come.</span></div>

A similar situation to America is brewing in my own country New Zealand. Basically we spend a LOT more than we earn, and though no one likes to admit it, our economy has been steadily contracting for the last 40 years. In the typical disinvest style you just described, our government is busy flogging off our state owned assets to the wealthy (who else can afford them really?)- under the guise of limiting public debt. On the other hand, despite our shrinking economy, our dollar is still high, because foreign currency investors, (for example our prime minister) deem our currency to be a safe one.

I will be forwarding the link to several people as a means of introducing some of the ideas raised in a clear and precise manner.<br>There is however the issue of making a strictly proportional connection between growth and hydrocarbon availability. Western Europeans consume about half the energy per capita of what Americans do with a similar level of technology and material civilization. This suggests that the US has considerable potential to increase wealth creation even without energy growth. <br>For many people in developing countries a very modest investment in alternative energy (e.g. 100 watt solar system) can greatly increase their ability to create wealth in goods and services. Thus although there is no doubt economic stagnation related to peak hydrocarbon energy; in the short to medium term there remains potential for increased wealth creation i.e. growth.<br><br><a href=#c2769632386406087240 title="comment permalink">10/16/13, 8:43 PM</a><br><br>

I've become a huge fan of his. His account of the late 20th/early 21st century crises differs somewhat from yours: he argues that these crises tend to arise only when the notion that capitalism <i>cannot</i> fail takes a firm hold of our collective imagination. In other words: these crises only happen when we start to think growth is inevitable. The rise of neo-liberalism and its thinly disguised left-wing equivalent, (Third Way Social democracy) in the nineties, followed by our present straits, certainly fits that hypothesis.<br><br>What is even more interesting, to the philosophically-minded, is that his account and yours are equally true.<br><br>However, his view of the Middle Ages is a lot less eurocentric than yours - he sees Europe for the economic and intellectual backwater it probably was in those days. This leads to a different assessment of the post-Roman world. He points to the rise of the Islamic merchant adventurers in the Near East (Which he, gently screwing with our minds, calls the Near West, Europe being the Far West).<br>These merchants and their non-interest bearing activities kept the economy going, in a world as post-Roman-collapse as any you could care to mention (please bear in mind that Islam, in those days, was dominant in Spain - one of the westernmost parts of the Roman Empire), and they certainly kept their part of the post-Roman Ages a lot less Dark than Christian Europe became.<br>They were deeply religious, of course, but they were not a religious organistation in any way.

It's one of the consequences of rent-seeking — charging for the use of capital, including lending at interest — that the sum of workers' wages is necessarily less than total sales, since that has to pay for both their wages and capitalists' rent on their income. Capitalists do not tend to rededicating 100% of their income back into purchases… so who's buying it all? (The answer of course, is that the public has to go deeper into debt every year to balance the equation.)<br><br>The standard pro-rent response is that this is only a problem if the total amount of wealth in the economy is not growing from year to year.

Of course, that particular strategy involves a currency collapse, which might just have even more devastating consequences than an outright default.

They can therefore never be forced to default (if somebody wants back what the government owns them, the Fed can print more dollars). Of course they can always choose to default but this is a choice, not a necessity. They don't need taxes in dollars to pay for expenditures. Rather taxes are what gives the currency value. In return for the government's dollars it gets real services in return (army, teachers, fire departments ...) We all need dollars as we all need to pay taxes in them, so we work to acquire them. However tempting the metaphor is, a government issuing its own currency is nothing like a a household. Does this mean that the government can print all they want and party like it is 1950? Of course not. Shortage of raw materials and energy and the resulting impossibility of continuous growth are real. The government could now spend more without causing inflation until the economy is at full employment IF there are enough of raw materials and energy. You are absolutely right that this is the real problem and I admire this blog's efforts to always uncover the root causes of predicaments.<br><br>Everybody's spending is somebody else's income. This means that as the government is in deficit, the private sector is in surplus (= savings of the private sector). Government surpluses mean private sector deficits. It is therefore no accident that the Clinton surpluses ended in a crisis, as it meant that debts were accumulating in the private sector. The government should be in debt to accommodate for the wish to have savings in the private sector. How large should the deficit be? Large enough so the economy to be near full employment, not more to avoid inflation.<br><br>Quantitative Easing in practice (as so far I understand it) is nothing more of transferring numbers on accounts inside the Fed. More specifically from savings accounts to checking accounts. Obviously this has had hardly any effect on the real economy. It is not printing money at a frantic pace. <br><br>European countries got into trouble as they put themselves onto something even more strict than a gold standard: the euro. So they indeed have to borrow to be able to spend and have to act like a household and can be forced into default.<br><br>There are many real financial problems: greater income inequality, loosening of oversight rules, ... but these won't be solved by being concentrated on the budget deficit. <br><br><br>Will current monetary system survive the upcoming Long Descent? Probably not, but that will be because of real shortages, not monetary shortages.<br><br><br><a href=#c5965512527852405723 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 5:36 AM</a><br><br>

My understanding is that this can be seen even today in the third world, and it leads to impoverished people who have to become raw material producers for the industrial nations. If so is it likely that future religions will have injunctions like you will not trade in goods made with/from or having anything to do with oil/gas/coal, in order to deal with the problem that while for individuals it seems like a good thing that they can buy goods cheaper, it pumps wealth out of the community?

Electricity consumption in China usually correlates well with the pace of economic growth.”</i><br><br>Guess older industrial world, Europe and European Diaspora has ‘stayed in balance', just about, meanwhile, on the back of China’s coal miners, and on ‘economies of scale’ keeping down unit costs (for examples; solar PV panels cost reduced by 90%, most reduction in the last 10 years, and containerisation on vast cargo carriers keeping down ocean transport unit costs. However, 7% per annum growth means doubling every 10 years anywhere it happens. To put it another way, it’s during the ‘final doubling’ when it gets seriously tricky! :(. The USA is not going to ‘double again’ and it scarcely seems credible that China will either?<br><br>So, it looks like we just got there then in terms of global ‘affordability’?

Contraction and run away inflation meant that investment wasn't happening, even when it would have been productive in real terms. Money lost its ability to hold value and wages became worthless. On the other hand, every family was intensely active in making use of what resources they did have and translating them into all the other stuff they needed. If you had a house you took in someone who didn't, but who might have access to a truck or medical training. If you had access to a dacha garden you hooked up with someone who had the root cellar that you didn't have and so on.

The other great resource that will inevitably figure into it is kinship. Kinship is the basic, universal means of organizing a social world - and it gets extended out into extended families, into the links of marriage and fostering that merge families, into the often mythologized stories of clans and tribes, into the management of wealth and power among nobilities, and eventually, in a diluted form, even structures more abstracted social organizations like the mythologies of nations and religious "brotherhoods".<br><br>Kinship as an organizing structure is thoroughly broken in our current society, so I'm very curious how kinship gets mobilized and reconstituted in the coming generations. I think that is as big a question as the religious and economic issues you are developing in this discourse here.

If the economy does indeed seize up in a low or no growth situation, then we might indeed fall back to the point where feudal and religious structures are the primary means of organizing humans. But your simplified picture that freezes up is pretty pure capitalism. If government intervention in the economy of similar scale as the current flailing to maintain growth were used to incentivize working together in a low growth economy, there are many ways it could work. Of course the problem is that 3 centuries of growth have led so many people to expect it to continue forever that it will take some bigger shocks than we have seen yet to produce a large enough consensus to work together in an economy with growth rates fluctuating around zero. <br><br><br><a href=#c5932003430716830983 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 7:19 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the note of sanity. <br><br>PhysicsDoc, one of the problems that has to be faced in any discussion of religion is the tendency, pervasive in the Western world to see everything through the filter of Christianity -- or, more precisely, through a version of Christian history filtered through a rationalist polemic. I'd encourage you to do some reading in the history of other religions that filled the same role I'm discussing here -- Japanese Buddhism and ancient Egyptian religion, which I cited, will do for starters. You may be surprised to find that persecution is not a universal feature of religion as such -- just of certain religions. <br><br>Steve, thanks for the reminder! A book well worth reading. <br><br>Isis, in your place I'd use that money to pay for classes in one or more useful skills. That's an investment that will fit in even a very small studio, and can be transported readily across national boundaries!<br><br>Think Again, thank you for a spirited and courteous reply! I'm quite familiar, though, with the claims you're making; you're hardly the first person to make them here, you know. Of course there are people looting the system in various ways -- I've discussed the culture of executive kleptocracy that's punching holes straight through the foundations of our economy more than once -- but there are also real crises building, and blaming those crises on political and financial elites has become a common way for people to try to evade the hard reality of our predicament. The pervasive detachment from realities that so often afflicts ruling classes in their final years is also a massive factor -- I'd encourage you to read John Kenneth Galbraith's <i>The Culture of Contentment</i>, which makes an edgy and well-documented comparison between the American elites Galbraith knew well and the French aristocracy on the eve of the Revolution. More generally, you might want to reflect on why it's so comforting to find someone to blame for our rising spiral of crisis, and whether that pursuit actually motivates constructive action -- or not. <br><br>PCMcGee, thank you. <br><br>Steve, maybe so, but until it gets a priesthood (or priestesshood!), special buildings, and the other institutional forms of religion, there are going to be sharp limits on what it can accomplish. More on this shortly. <br><br>Jason, over here we don't have zero hours contracts, but a huge number of full time employees are being reassigned to part time hours so their employers don't have to pay for Obamacare, and the number of permanently unemployed with no benefits keeps on rising. It's going to be a bitter winter. <br><br>Russ, I'm very familiar with that! All we can do is keep on doing the right thing, and hope that the people we care about get a clue eventually. <br><br>Chris, it depends. More often than not, it's actually a divide between a handful of very big urban areas and the rest of the civilization -- there are plenty of cities in the US that don't correspond to "urban America" in the sense the media has in mind, so we're not unusual there. The Second Religiosity, though, takes root where there's an opening, and a lot depends on whether the culture's traditional religious forms or new religious movements provide the basic framework. <br><br>Unknown, oh, granted -- it's simply a metaphor to make a point that a lot of people want to dodge these days. <br><br>Yupped, you may be right -- in which case things may get very messy indeed. There seems to be a rough correlation, historically speaking, between the cluelessness of an elite class in its last years and the fraction of the same class that ends up guillotined, torn apart by screaming mobs, etc. in the denouement.<br><br><a href=#c5019787916866753423 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 7:51 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps the credibility of the dollar; I don't know, but certainly not the ability of the Gov't to print it's way out of debt.

That might sound kind of absurd this late in the game, but I think there's still a part of my mind that thinks "collapse" and goes off to science fiction adventures in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. In real life, it just means unpleasant things happening at greater frequency.<br><br>I also note that while the government was "shut down," military strikes were conducted in at least three different countries (Aghanistan, Somalia, Libya.) That would seem to argue very strongly against any lingering hope that the US might manage the collapse by unwinding the empire, bringing the troops home, and finally enjoying some hint of the "peace dividend" that we didn't get in 1990. Nope, first on the chopping block are the national parks, food safety inspectors, and NASA.<br><br>The other thing that struck me was your mention of the Roman laws forcing business people-- in other words, middle class people-- into their fathers' profession... and how many of them fled the empire to barbarian kingdoms. This shows us something else that empires do when their economies start to unwind: They force people to keep participating, whether they want to or not. I think these laws have a precise parallel in the laws which make it impossible to discharge student loans through bankruptcy and of course the new law which forces us all to buy health insurance. (The latter also establishes a precedent whereby we can be forced into any other tanking market. Maybe the next democratic president will solve the housing problem by forcing every adult American to purchase a mortgage). <br><br>I know a number of Americans in their 20s and 30s who have moved to Asia and left their student loan payments behind.<br><br><a href=#c4340810261936341742 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

Oh, wait... ;-)<br><br>As for socialism, though, too true. I may just have to reread and link to that essay by George Bernard Shaw in which he talks at length about why exterminating millions of useless people isn't a moral problem, since it's for the greater good and all that. <br><br>Kristofv, money is a system of tokens we use for distributing real wealth; its movements and vicissitudes are therefore useful for tracking what's happening in the world of real wealth. When a major power has to pay its bills by printing money, that's a symptom that something has gone massively wrong in the creation and distribution of real wealth. You're right that it's not, in and of itself, something that matters, but it's a convenient signal for troubles that are otherwise more difficult to track. <br><br>Dagnarus, it's been tried a few times, and it doesn't work, because secular institutions by and large can only draw on the incentives available to the rational mind, and in times of crisis, those don't cut it. Most human motivation is nonrational, and nonrational motivations are also far more powerful than the rational kind; you'll see very few people cheerfully sacrifice their lives for some rationally thought out reason, while people do so all the time out of love, loyalty, and religious faith -- and that's the level of commitment that it generally takes to have an impact on a collapsing society. <br><br>As for your second point, that's the mechanism by which what Toynbee calls the internal proletariat gets formed. Those are the people who are in a civilization but not of it, who pay the costs but get few of the benefits, and who respond by withdrawing their loyalty. It's when they find an alternative banner around which to rally that the civilization generally comes crashing down. <br><br>Phil H., fascinating. The potash thing is worth watching -- and another good incentive to get a composting toilet in place and learn organic methods of growing food!<br><br>Andy, that's common practice in hard times all over the world, and yes, it's also one of the reasons I dismiss fast-crash hypotheses as the warmed-over apocalyptic fantasies that they are. <br><br>Jess, excellent! As circumstances permit, see if you can find some old accounting textbooks from the pre-computer days, so that you can learn how to do all the same things on paper, by hand; that way, when computers start pricing themselves out of the market for small businesses and the like, you'll have a profitable career teaching double-entry bookkeeping to those who need to learn it in a hurry. <br><br>Andy, it's common for kinship structures to be shattered in late civilizations, and to reconstitute themselves slowly and painfully in the dark ages that follow. I don't know of anyone who's discussed that in detail, but there may be something out there in recent historical writing I haven't seen yet. <br><br>Ganv, exactly -- a weekly blog can only go into so much detail. The problem with trying to stabilize things in a no-growth economy, as I see it, is that before we get there we're going to have to see a lot of contraction -- a negative-growth economy in which most people are going to draw the short straws. That's not a recipe for cooperation and consensus. <br><br>Nano, many thanks for the link -- a useful dose of sanity.

Without a default (or hyperinflation) in the next few decades, I can see the United States slowly, but surly transform into a third-world nation. As the government decides to cut it's national programs so it can continue to borrow money, I assume that it will be a matter of time before taxes are spent on paying interest on debt rather than essential government programs. For the media to not mention this, shows the cluelessness of the elites.<br><br><a href=#c4830304187629649399 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 8:35 AM</a><br><br>

It’s safe to assume that the people who have made these decisions are aware of these possibilities."<br><br>It's a quibble because it doesn't materially matter if this is a global conspiracy by the disguised lizard-creatures of the underworld, or if it is the result of a clueless bag of lemmings lurching randomly toward the cliff's edge: I get that. However, I think you're wrong at both ends of the spectrum.<br><br>First, I don't think it's safe to assume that the decision-makers are aware of any of these possibilities. There's plenty of evidence that people construct filter-bubbles for their perceptions, and simply <i>don't see</i> the truck barreling down the road directly at them. This recent government shutdown is a case-in-point: exactly what did the Tea Party get out of this, other than a damaged brand? Humiliating failure was the best of the predictable consequences. It's hard for me to credit this shutdown to people who are <i>aware</i>. I certainly don't think the possibility of hanging from a lamppost is anywhere on their map.<br><br>Second, there are at least two distinct poles for conspiracies.<br><br>One is the sort of conspiracy that must be planned and executed in secret, and if exposed, is easily shut down. The conspiracy to assassinate Giuliano di Medici in 1478 is a classic example, complete with the conspirators meeting at night in the labyrinthine bowels of a castle. The great task for the "good guys" is to discover the conspiracy and make the proof public. After that, everything magically takes care of itself.<br><br>The other is the sort of conspiracy that takes place in plain sight, according to an open plan that is (or becomes) a "virtuous" ideology. Any guerrilla or resistance movement is an example, as are military coups and "power plays" by people like Lenin.<br><br>The United States is positively rotten with conspiracies of this second kind.<br><br>The Tea Party is one of these open conspiracies. It's an open secret that the Tea Party wants a Federal Government shrunk to a size that can be "drowned in a bathtub" -- i.e., they want the federal government destroyed. Many of its members are closet anarchists who, despite mocking the Kumbaya attitudes of the sentimental Left, seem to think that people can get along just fine without any sort of government at all: the "magic of the marketplace" will, once freed of "government interference," bring about a "mercantile paradise" where everyone (but the lazy) become rich.<br><br>A certain subset of the wealthy forms a variant of this. Many of them believe that a) wealth is created by virtuous hard work, b) their own wealth is evidence of their own virtue and hard work, and c) whatever worked for them will work for anyone/everyone. Therefore, anything that stands in their way stands in everyone's way. Taxes, for instance. Environmental laws. Minimum wage and health insurance. Eliminating these obstacles is good for everyone. What's good for GM is good for America.<br><br>These are among the thoughtful wealthy. There's also the unthinking sort that doesn't aim so high, they just want the money. The unthinking sort will most certainly suck a pension-fund dry if they think they can get away with it, and if they can do it without risk of prosecution, so much the better: indeed, if there's a legal loophole, you can bet that there's a whole crowd of people -- an open conspiracy of people -- clustered around it.<br><br>Cluelessness <i>and</i> conspiracies abound. They just don't make any real difference.<br><br><a href=#c7027478880545437805 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

He was a true sage and knew nearly everything about farming. At some point when the discussion of Peak Oil came up, he stood up and started talking about Potash/Potassium. He felt strongly that Peak Potassium was going to get us before Peak Oil did. He stated that it was getting harder and harder to find (in terms of sufficiently large mine-able deposits) and it was taking more and more energy to get (familiar themes, no?) and it is an essential mineral for growing food plants and also for our bodies. He also talked about the lack of minerals in the soil and how depleted the soils have become of other essential minerals our bodies need.

And there were other highly paid people around them blindly following along, in full cheer-leader mode, apparently having switched off their critical faculties, so willfully blind to absurdity, so willfully in denial of facts and common sense. <br><br>I learned the hard way that when people are in these "reality distortion fields" (to borrow a term used in connection to Apple) it is pointless to talk sense to them. They don't listen. <br><br>Seems that people would rather crash a company and wreck careers and reputations than re-examine ways of thinking and doing. I don't know why this is, maybe it's a conservatism (I really didn't want to say laziness) that's inherent in the human character. People would rather follow than think. They'd rather walk along established pathways. This, they say, is the way we've always done it, dammit, and it's always worked. And that's it, full stop, end of discussion. And so the doubter walks off with his tail between his legs, muttering to himself, well, yeah, maybe it worked before but times change.<br><br>It's not just people in one industry (ie real estate) that live in denial. I've worked in two very different sectors of the economy (my skills were easily transportable) and I saw similar habits of mind. <br><br>There's nothing that the Fed is doing that anyone with a high-school education can't see as being utterly divorced from reality. But such is the power of group-think (and I've seen it up close), so deep is the intellectual rut, that the people running the Fed are blind to any other way but theirs no matter how laughable. <br><br>Other people, not having been part of Fed official-dom's long academic tradition, not having invested so heavily in it, not having been steeped for decades in its particular ways of thinking (and maybe not having been awarded Ivy League degrees), see it otherwise. But these others are not employed by the Fed.<br><br><a href=#c6506537313747924862 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 10:30 AM</a><br><br>

Further, a conspiracy of deception by the plutocrats and oligarchs has some telling supporting evidence: for example, not long after the long Cold War against Communism's violent attempt to retrain people to share with each other ended in the early '90's, we entered into a new ideological/religious war, against Islamo-terrorism - a war without boundaries, against no state, but against anyone who would use force to oppose the American/West empire. Samuel Huntington predicted (prescribed?) this in his work The Clash of Civilizations, which was released shortly after the end of the Cold War. It also bears acknowledging the neo-conservative heritage, particularly rooted in Strauss' suggestions that a population, particularly one so diverse as the American, in order to be united, must have a common enemy. What better common enemy than Communism? or after that is gone, Islamo-terrorism? And to conclude, there are enough reasons to suspect that the official accounts of events of 9/11 ought to be seriously questioned, that one should pause with the suggestion that those in power are bumbling along like everyone else. Air defense systems failed for 90 minutes while four planes strayed off course, even though in the prior year 57 such stray passenger planes were intercepted within minutes of leaving course by Air Force fighers. The buildings came down at free-fall, although designed to withstand airplane impact; and steel melts at higher temperatures than jet fuel burns. One building, not impacted by planes, came down of its own, likewise at free-fall, like a controlled demolition. There are many engineers and architects who continue to reject the official account of events of that day, a day that ushered in a war that can never be won, an event that counts as the first strike on American soil since 1812, and a first strike of fear into the comfortable American psyche, and an event that continues to justify our "defense" of "freedom" for Americans, by widespread military presence in countries and among people that have nothing near the capacity to harm us - but that do have those cherished treasures underground.<br><br><a href=#c9098301484214358189 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 10:31 AM</a><br><br>

One result is the greatest capacity for violence, and the greatest level of intellectual sophistication, in human history, and it is largely driven by America. It must be pointed out that while there are historical parallels, history is not a sure guide either, and every moment is unique. What is unique now, are the capacity for violence, which is a government monopoly, and the capacity for propaganda, a well-studied and well-utilized art.<br><br>to carry the narrative a bit further (and I concede, it is nothing more than a narrative, not reality, but narratives are the field in which the mind of language plays): the Presidents are figureheads of our nation. We followed a philandering, dallier in Clinton, who managed "economic growth" well (as fictitiously two-dimensional as that might have been), but led us into moral decay (right? this is a common narrative); with a bumbling cowboy who could do little else but sign where the generals and CEO's told him to - perhaps the worst President in US history; with a black man with a Muslim name - a peace offering to the global South, and a target for loathing by all who find American exceptionalism to be their own sub-religion.<br><br>The cultural, economic divides in America are a recipe for mass conflict. they show no signs of being healed. While it is hard to imagine orchestrating this, it's hard to imagine it happening by chance either. Again, the way to unite people is to give them a common enemy. I see the elites manufacturing conflict in this country in order to control people, on both the red and blue sides, making our neighbors into our enemies along ideological grounds.<br><br><a href=#c6521924596002963676 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 10:43 AM</a><br><br>

They are, on the whole, not the most intelligent or far-sighted people in the room. They can easily combine, just like other people, to further their common interests in the short term. But *effective* long-range planning seems to come no easier to them than it does to other people. If they were to attempt a long-term conspiracy, it would soon become a failed conspiracy.<br><br>However (in contrast to the rest of the room), they are by far the most energetic, the shrewdest and the most ruthless people I have met at my university. This is what they rely on to sustain their wealth and power, not on some conspiracy. <br><br>They are affable people, easy to talk with and easy to get along with, but in an instant they become very dangerous people, once you have *seriously* threatened any of the things they value most. They will not waste the force of a trip-hammer to crush a fly, but they will remove any such threat to their wealth and power in the most effective and least costly way possible. And they understand very well the role of trust and reputation in maintaining their wealth and power, so threats to those things are dealt with as ruthlessly as material threats.<br><br>Also, a certain fraction of them truly believe that they, or at least their university, stand entirely above the law. Over the years, two of my university's trustees informed me, each independently of the other, that my university, having been founded under a charter from the Crown of England, has never been and is not now subject to the authority of either the Federal or the State government. <br><br>Of course, this is madness.

Its whole basis is the sort of broad morphological comparison of historical societies which you (JMG) seem to specialize in. Also at the end of the book he draws a remarkably similar conclusion to your theme this week: he claims that, across history, the 'progression' from barter and debts of honor (actually it goes the other way, according to him) into hard currency such as coins and metals, and then paper currency, is not a linear progression as economists try to teach us these days. It is a cycle which seems to reliably reverse direction and go the other way periodically. He claims the shift from hard currency and strictly quantified numerical debts, to and from a more qualitative attitude where numbers do not dictate decisions and honor and trust is more important, seems to parallel similar religious and philosophical shifts in a society. He notes we seem to be on the verge of such a shift right now, but he can make no claim about whether the specificity of money drives a flight to or from transcendence in religion, or vice versa, or if some third causal factor governs both.<br><br>"Debt" is available as a _free_ audiobook here: <a href=http://www.unwelcomeguests.net/Category:Audiobooks rel=nofollow>Unwelcome Guests</a>, a podcast that is well worth listening to, often dealing with collapse issues.<br><br><a href=#c2224461692049786796 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 11:19 AM</a><br><br>

Rather than urging the emperor to be more fiscally responsible, Mephistopheles—disguised, revealingly, as a court jester—suggests a different approach, one with disturbing parallels to our own age.<br><br>Noting that the empire’s currency is gold, Mephistopheles maintains there is surely plenty of undiscovered gold underneath the earth belonging to the emperor. Thus, he argues, the emperor can issue promissory notes for the value of this yet-to-be-found gold, thereby generating fresh monetary resources for the government and solving its debt problems.<br><br>Not surprisingly, the emperor and his treasurer are delighted with this idea. It means the monarch can avoid making hard economic choices while simultaneously providing the empire with desperately needed currency. Mephistopheles subsequently deluges the court with paper money, and Faust is praised by emperor and commoner alike.<br><br>The results, however, are not what are expected. First, the issuance of paper money does not solve the emperor’s spending problems. Instead the ruler and his court become even more extravagant, knowing they can always print more paper money to cover their ever-growing expenses. Second, the devil has subtly but fundamentally changed the basis of the empire’s currency. Instead of being rooted in the solidity offered by a tangible and valued asset, the currency is now based on flimsy paper promises.

If the economy expands with no new money, we see deflation as the it takes less money to but the same amount of stuff. Growth based economies are set up so that this is a bad thing and almost never happens. If the currency supply expands with no concurrent expansion in the real economy, we see inflation, as it takes more money to buy the same amount of stuff.<br><br>Expanding the money supply to avoid a debt crisis works in terms of preventing default but should lead to inflation as the economy is not actually growing. If this happens, it amounts to a tax increase, as the government gets the same amount of real value (albeit in more dollars) while everyone else sees their dollars worth less than before. <br><br>If the real economy is stable, the money supply is expanding, and inflation is not being observed, that means that something, somewhere is being assigned a value far above its real-world worth. A speculative bubble, in other words, that is guaranteed to pop.

There are several points I'd like to make.<br><br>First no question Lenin was a cruel utopian ideologue with very little regard for human suffering and some of Trotsky's activities during the Russian Civil war would be classed as war crimes by modern standards. Some people on the far left like to blame all the Soviet horrors on Stalin but the reality is that Lenin and Trotsky created the instruments of tyranny for Stalin to pick up and some of the more destructive Stalinist policies such as forced collectivisation of the peasantry were first advocated by Trotsky.<br><br>That said civil wars tend to be particularly vicious as events in Syria demonstrate. <br><br>http://vineyardsaker.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/a-few-basic-reminders-about-wars-civil.html<br><br>But condemning socialism in its entirety because of that is no more reasonable than damning the whole Christian religion because of the Inquisition or modern Druidry for the actions of the ancient Druids for that matter. As for Shaw there was plenty of authoritarianism and contempt for the "inferior" masses among British intellectuals at the time but they weren't all socialists by any means. There's a book The Intellectuals and the Masses by Peter Carey that goes into this. <br><br>I would argue that Soviet communism was a socialist heresy. Lenin never gave all power to the soviets, the elected councils and cooperatives of the working class. He gave all power to his Party state. Socialism was originally intended to give control of the means of production to labour not necessarily the state. So the problem is not so much socialism, or even Marxism, but Leninism. There were several other socialist parties in Russia in 1917 before the Bolsheviks crushed them.<br><br>One of the lessons of the tragic twentieth century is that socialism needs to be based on democracy and the rule of law. Provided you have free speech, free elections and independent courts there is no reason why socialism should lead to tyranny any more than conservatism.<br><br>The Indian Nobel Prize winning economist Amyarta Sen has calculated that the lack of an effective welfare state in India may have led to a hundred million avoidable deaths since independence. That's a similar figure to all those deaths ascribed to communism throughout the entire twentieth century. And that's just India. <br><br>How many poor Americans have died over the last fifty years because US capitalism is more concerned about the profits of the insurance companies than the lives of the poor? Quite a few. <br><br>Rather than the nonsense of Obamacare it might be worth copying Britain's NHS. Rather than get government out of healthcare get the insurance companies out of healthcare. If a poverty stricken Third World country like Cuba can run a healthcare system that gives Cubans the same life expectancy as First World America it might be worth considering some socialism. <br><br>It's possible that if socialism does come back it will be in a very different form than in the twentieth century. My guess is that if it does it is more likely to look like Distributism than the Soviet Union.<br><br>http://vineyardsaker.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/distributism-first-impressions.html<br><br><a href=#c5867014639143827169 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 12:20 PM</a><br><br>

As a heavily based in the early Roman Principate governement form, we shouldn't really expect anything else than this ( that is, a increasingly military-centered economy ), and your quib about the mandatory hereditary professions in late Rome only adds to that ( well, you left out the worst example, the decurions: from strictly voluntary prestige function ( that is, it was not even a job ) to enforced under death penalty and confiscation of personal fortune if the tax Rome thinked you had to deliver didn't came out of the backs of the populace ... ) . <br><br>Anyway, on the meat of the post: it is quite clear to me that pretty much everywhere ( except on the relative winners of the current situation ) everyone is expecting that the other's economies recover to jump start their own ones :/ and that pretty much explains why the global economy is how it is: waiting for a recovery that depends on their recovery to come :p And given how a good lot of the economies in the "western" world is cutting left and right just to try to balance out minimally the budget ( like my own government, that has been piling " extraordinary solidariety contributions" and tax increases for the last half decade just to spend 105 when they collect 100 :/ ), any recovery of the type they crave is clearly out of the scope of atleast one generation or two ... and that is the optimistic view ( I'm actually quoting my own governement that does not expect to recover from this crisis fully until 2028 even in the best case scenario of a "deus ex machina" world economy recovery ... OFC they don't tell this in public, but it is clearly stated in their deals with the IMF )<br><br>On the religion in times of decline, in spite of you have not yet spoken clearly on the subject, I hope you don't skim out the possiblity that the state simply single out what they perceive to be the "wave of the future", target a group in it that is pliable enough to work with the regime and mesh the two groups ( a "sensible" dose of non-compliant with the regime suported ideology persecution probably needs to be applied though ) in a "sacred governement" entity. Rome did it for a quick example ( hence the canonical term for that being Cesaropapism :D ) and , if you count with the Bizantine experience as a continuity from Rome, it held for 3 times the duration of our "Industrial Revolution" , but it comes from far earlier ( atleast from the aftermath of the Alexander adventure, with a lot of his sucessors claming to be "soter" like the Gods ... ). I know that you are aware of that possiblity ( the governement in "Star's Reach" has clear shades of that, in spite of not being a full example ), but in this series of posts you have been hinting to be working in top of the internal proletariate theory of a certain very famous denier of the perpetual ascension doctrine, that, in spite of useful , does not explain all of the cases very well :/<br><br>( cont ... )<br><br><a href=#c6335452025188413401 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 1:33 PM</a><br><br>

In fact, finding the pester John was one of the five official reasons to maintain the naval discoveries "project", in the middle of more mundane considerations like profit and making war to the "Moors" and the official reason for the da Gama voyage as stated when he finally got to India was " to find christians and spices". With a start like this one, it is not exactly weird that the Joachimite vision of a triumphant ascension of the mankind to Heaven is heavily stuck to the core of the "western" values ...<br><br><a href=#c4300258428291169355 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 1:40 PM</a><br><br>

In 1933 and 1971 it defaulted on its obligations to pay gold. Currently all US obligations are only for currency, not gold. The US can and will always pay all obligations in currency, because it can print it up at will. Whether that currency has value is another matter, but you cannot force the printer to default, ever. The printer prints.<br><br>The countries such as Argentina, Russia, etc. that defaulted all had obligations which they could not print away, either in foreign currency (dollars) or gold. No country which can print its obligations has ever defaulted or will. Instead, they hyperinflate their debts away while paying them off nominally, in full. This is what the US will do. <br><br>The European countries you cite currently belong to the Euro; therefore their national governments cannot print their problems away. They gave up that right when they gave up their individual currencies, but don't worry, their current problems will be resolved. They joined the euro for a reason, and that reason will become evident after the dollar hyperinflates. No, they aren't stupid. Did you notice that Estonia just joined? There are good reasons. <br><br>The ECB, and the US, have lots of gold, and gold will play a major role in the next reserve system, for reasons I won't go into here. No, we aren't talking about a gold standard; we are talking about freegold. <br><br>The US is well aware of the endgame, and is only seeking to drag out the end of the dollar reserve currency role for as long as it is useful. At some point soon either foreign governments, or the US will terminate that arrangement. Yes, the US can and will hyperinflate the dollar if that becomes more beneficial to their position. Remember, they have a lot of gold and a plan. <br><br>After that the US will have to live within its' means, shipping real goods to trade partners instead of shipping dollars in a perpetual trade deficit to nations which cannot spend them and must simply stack them as Treasuries.<br><br><a href=#c421764596017909142 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 5:36 PM</a><br><br>

Jensen II (badocelot/shiningwhiffle)</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Bill Pulliam,<br><br>My take is that conservative rhetoric has made socialism (though not necessarily Marxism specifically) potentially a ticking time-bomb waiting to go off.<br><br>One reason is the one JMG has mentioned multiple times: the Republicans keep calling anything and everything they don't like (including quite a number of things the public likes very much) "socialism." That sort of sloppy rhetoric has a good chance of eventually creating a backlash in which a large number of people who would never consider socialism embrace it just to spite the Republicans.<br><br>The second reason has to do with how much the Right's rhetoric actually has in common with socialism. Both have a distributive conception of economic justice and an aversion to free-riders, it's just that, to use Utah Phillips' terms, socialists are more concerned about "the bum on the plush" — the bosses who collect rent on the use of capital — while the Right is more concerned about "the bum on the rails" — the poor who live off welfare and theft.<br><br>It was an I.W.W. leader, Big Bill Haywood, who once said, "For every dollar the boss has and didn’t work for, one of us worked for a dollar and didn’t get it." Replace "the boss" with "a welfare queen" and you get the conservatism I grew up with.<br><br>Another factor is the potential influence of libertarian socialism. With the public's anger currently being directed at both government and Wall Street, an ideology that proclaims Big Business and Big Government to be two sides of the same problem might find a lot of takers. (The other obvious candidate here is, of course, distributism, but I suspect that's just too sane to catch on any time soon.)<br><br><a href=#c4680508645505084098 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 9:09 PM</a><br><br>

They know about the implication of peak oil, exponential debt, what have you, and they have know idea what they can do about it, other than try and keep business as usual going as long as possible. For example lets say someone/a group within the elite is fully aware of the problems we are facing. He thus decides to try and move us towards a sustainable/steady state economy, but he starts running into problems, firstly others in the elite are completely out of touch with facts on the ground, there not going to go along with his Eco-fascist gobbledegook, still others want to make certain that whoever has to make sacrifices during this transition, it isn't them. Then you've got the general population who most certainly does not want to take a cut to their living standards, you Eco-fascist you. Then you have to consider the consider the Geo-political considerations of how you keep other nations sending you enough resources to cushion your fall and at the same time preventing a new power from rising to clobber you.

There are always plenty of those to go around.

I wonder how many of them have realized that fifteen minutes after the rule of law collapses, their hired guards will accidentally point their Uzis in the wrong direction, and scoop the pot. <br><br>Gary, well, we'll see. Do you think people will be comfortable having less when "having less" amounts to abject poverty? That's what we can expect, you know. <br><br>Janet, I'd suggest that you start with <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/L/The-Long-Descent rel=nofollow>The Long Descent</a> and <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/E/The-Ecotechnic-Future rel=nofollow>The Ecotechnic Future</a>, in that order; those sum up the basic viewpoint I've been exploring here. <br><br>Roger, I've seen the same thing many times over, especially in situations where a deeply held belief system happened to conflict with what was actually happening. Thus my suggestion that that's what's happening here. <br><br>Chris G, I've been saying all along that the neoconservatives cooked up a war against the Arab world in an effort to get control of as much oil as possible, once it became painfully clear that the Reagan strategy of letting the free market take care of petroleum depletion was failing catastrophically. That's business as usual -- and you'll notice that the neocons got tossed out on their ears when their plan failed messily, as of course it was bound to do. So? That doesn't justify the claim that every unwelcome turn of events must be caused by some undefined conspiracy or other. Also, I'll grant the greatest capacity for violence, but intellectual sophistication? No, there you're letting the myth of progress twist things around. Modern industrial society is far less intellectually sophisticated than it was a hundred years ago, by almost every measure you care to use -- even our propaganda is embarrassingly crude by 1912 standards. <br><br>Robert, I've met a few of them; I've also met their kids and grandkids, who in my experience tend to be detached from reality to an almost schizoid degree.

A dollar today is not necessarily worth more than a dollar a year from now -- if I'm putting money into a retirement fund, for example, the opposite is true. The assumption that money is more valuable now than later may be a function of the generally inflationary nature of modern economies. <br><br>Robert, are you a Marxian socialist, or one of the various other kinds? If the latter, you get a pass, since none of those have been tried on a large scale. If the former, I'd point out that Marx's program has been applied a good many times outside of the former Soviet Union and its immediate empire; at one point quite a few regimes tried it out. Nobody managed to make the thing work without prison camps. If you want to propose a new democratic socialism, fair enough; if you want to propose social democracy on the European model, better still, as it seems to work fairly well; but if we're talking Marx, the gulags aren't the result of a heresy -- they're the normal product of the internal contradictions of Marxist theory when put into practice. <br><br>Marcello, the principal reason I expect a Marxist revival in the US is the huge publicity boost the Republicans are giving Marx just now. If they keep on calling any use of government funds to meet human needs "socialism," sooner or later you're going to see young American intellectuals reading <i>Das Kapital</i>, and away we go. <br><br>Ando, funny you should ask that. Stay tuned... ;-)<br><br>Mike, no argument there. There's no way this can end well. <br><br>Ricardo, all very good points. The attempt to construct a pseudoreligion out of politics has a specific name in modern usage, though it's one that has been misused so spectacularly for so long that it's going to take me several posts to clear away the muck. Yes, it's one of the options, and yes, I'll be exploring it as we go -- but it's not a good choice, and there may be ways to forestall it. More on this down the road a bit. <br><br>Bill, no, as I said to Marcello, it's purely because the GOP is engaging in such a loud and effective publicity campaign on behalf of socialism just now. <br><br>Rita, look into it and I bet the company is trying to sell shares of its allegedly hot new stock. In stock market jargon, it's called a "pump and dump operation" -- you pump the stock up with lavish news releases, dump the shares you hold on the chumps at inflated prices, and then let them take the loss. There's a huge amount of that going on in the fracking scene just now. <br><br>Enrique, funny. Many thanks. <br><br>MawKernewek, bingo.

Have you had them tested? Or is it simply that your view of things requires them to be psychopaths? It may seem to you that hubris, peak oil, and the conflict between reality and a set of unquestioned assumptions about the world are insufficient to bring about the mess we're in, but that's exactly the point at issue; to me, those more than adequately account for said mess, and bringing in hypothetical psychopaths -- for whose alleged mental condition you have no evidence -- is unjustified. <br><br>Jeff, to my mind it depends on just how much clout the financial industry actually has in Washington DC. If the big banks really run things, it'll be a default, because that way the immediate losses focus on specific instruments that are subject to default -- say, T-bills -- and other dollar-denominated investments retain their value domestically, at least for a while. If we get hyperinflation, everybody's holdings become equally worthless. So I remain agnostic on which one we'll see; the one thing we can agree on is that the debt is not going to be paid. <br><br>Think Again, once again, what justifies your insistence that there must be some hidden circle of psychopaths in there somewhere? The factors I'm using to explain the situation are all readily visible, and -- as I've pointed out in posts <a href=../../2006/06/conspiracy-theories.html rel=nofollow>since the early days of this blog</a> -- the motivations behind conspiracy theories are not hard to tease out, either. Thus I see no need to hypothesize an evil cabal of madmen to explain the events of our time. Clearly you disagree, and that's your right, but your arguments seem distinctly unconvincing to me. <br><br>Mister R., you get speculative bubbles whenever too much wealth flows out of productive economic activities into pure speculation; you get really huge speculative bubbles when the flow of wealth out of productive economic activities happens because productive economic activities no longer make money. That's the difference between the tech stock bubble (an example of the first kind) and the housing bubble (an example of the second).<br><br><a href=#c5142106514101864002 title="comment permalink">10/17/13, 10:52 PM</a><br><br>

It cost all up only a few hundred dollars, but a whole lot of labour. The only item purchased new were the concrete stumps and cement to anchor them and the shed itself to the ground. Even the nails and screws holding it together are second hand. Under the zincalume roof sheeting there is a commercial grade fire blanket that was a left over product from building the house. I hate waste.<br><br>The original intention was to build the house out of recycled / re-purposed materials too, but during the permit stage the rules completely changed (which are in legislation here) and that idea had to go out the window! There was a bit of unhappiness that day for sure.<br><br>I really appreciate you writing that as it was an excellent observation on your part.<br><br>For some reason when I say owner-built, people think the place is going to be some sort of mud brick special, half finished.

Government will sacrifice the currency to save the banking system, which it desperately needs. Those big banks only need to perform nominally, not in real terms, so the financial institutions will protect themselves by pressuring the government to liquify their holdings. Then they will spend the money, and since the banks are closest to the printer, they will gain the most use from those dollars which rapidly devalue as they are passed down the line.<br><br><a href=#c1816888772600328118 title="comment permalink">10/18/13, 4:56 AM</a><br><br>

As late as the 1990s, the U.S. was paying down its debt. That can be done in a decent economy with sensible taxation. Sensible taxation is the key. One constantly hears that the government is "going broke." If so, it's only because we won't tax sensibly. There is more money sloshing around in the economy than ever. We just aren't taxing it. And even in this sluggish economy, the U.S. is getting GDP growth close to 2 percent, more than enough growth to balance the budget if the political sanity to do so existed. I don't totally disagree with you about the end of growth. I'm just talking about the deficit right now, today. We could wipe it out instantly if we had the political will.<br><br>And second, about religion and the Dark Ages. I seriously doubt that religion explains it. Christianity, when you boil it down, is a quirky, soul-depressing, guilt-inducing religion with pathetically weak texts. Christianity contains nothing to serve as a guide for the preservation of civilization. Granted, the human religious instinct can be a powerful motivator and social glue, but it's easy to imagine theologies less soul-depressing than Christianity that would have been of greater benefit to people.<br><br>It's not about religion, it's about the smart people and where and how they collaborate. Today we might call them the creative class. In an economic breakdown, where do they go? After Rome, lots of them went to the monasteries. Why not? Monasteries were relatively safe, the food was better, there was order, there was learning, they were networked. It's not about religion. It's about smart, creative people. So the trick is to try to figure out where our creative class would go in a breakdown, to figure out what arrangements they would make for safety, food, order, learning, and networking, and to figure out what their organizing principles would be.<br><br>I suspect we would end up with two competing (and to some degree cooperative) types of institutions, just as we did in the Dark Ages. There would be the places where the rich would go to exploit without adding much value (the fortresses), and there would be the places where the creative classes would go. The creative class will keep the lights on and guide the rebuilding, not because they're religious but because they're smart and creative. Outside those places, life would be harsh.<br><br><a href=#c3279619544031455115 title="comment permalink">10/18/13, 5:10 AM</a><br><br>

It'll be interesting to see what happens once Obamacare is fully in force and its inherent (large) faults become obvious to both major parties. Will the push be towards a single payer universal system (which we likely can't afford) or to an unregulated "market-based" system (which will exclude massive numbers of people)?<br><br>Of course as I have said multiple times here in the past, Peak Oil also means Peak Socialism, in a practical sense. Socialism is a child of industrialization, and it requires a functional fossil-fuel-based industrial economic system to actually work. So there may be a push for it, but we're just not gonna have the resource base to implement it in the way those promoting it would want. For one thing, our financial system is a ponzi scheme. If we want to raid the treasure hoards of the plutocrats to fund socialist reforms, we're going to find nearly all that "wealth" is paper (electronic), and it evaporates as soon as you try to "cash it in" en masse and turn it into actual goods and services.<br><br><a href=#c5782932820805448350 title="comment permalink">10/18/13, 7:24 AM</a><br><br>

I wish to test your reply and apply some intellectual weight to your reply in order to see if it can hold - minding that you reply to everyone here, but I do appreciate recommendations on further reading either inside or outside your work, as you provide readily to near-all who solicit.<br><br>I see Television, radio, and the internet, as fairly monolithic in this country, and where not, to some extent, the exception proves the rule. There are a diversity of voices available on the internet - and many are quite misleading. It takes a pretty exceptional degree of critical thinking to muddle through the noise, a capacity not too many have. Many people, in turn, leave aside that struggle and simply accept the blather of the mainstream. The biggest case in point: near-total blackout on discussions of peak resource, although it underpins the whole world economy, thus the polity, thus the culture - and thus even the noosphere and (I like your term) theosphere.<br><br>Evidence of the monolithic mainstream can be no more readily apparent than the general ignorance about and unwillingness to deal with a future of less energy. This is not to say that there have been no voices to the contrary, some even have gone nearly mainstream, such as E.F. Schumacher. the corporate-controlled mainstream ignores it. Their motive, while unknown, seems to me fairly easy to imagine: keep the average American doing what the average American does best: consuming more and more, keeping the economy growing, enriching the owners of property (both tangible and intangible), and as much as possible keeping those people from accumulating either real property or political power. Divide and conquer is the order of that conspiracy.<br><br>I concede, what I'm describing, what other commenters are describing, is not, by definition, a conspiracy; rather it is an unspoken acceptance that we will either a) ignore the future, b) accumulate as much ownership as possible to ward off the coming ill general effects to the economy in the future, or c) just keep doing what we've always done.<br><br>Now as I write and think about this subject, it becomes a little clearer: it's not so much a consciously manipulative propaganda by a conspiracy of wealthy bankers as simply a general acceptance, and an inherent result of the mechanisms of the current system, that we will ignore the future and keep on pillaging resources from future generations, as though they will never exist. It is essentially, greed and selfishness - more powerful, subconscious forces than any conspiracy could ever possibly be. Now I get it. :)<br><br>What built-in economic mechanisms, what underlying belief system? the former is, I believe, the pressures that debt puts on everybody to continue to produce the energy resources to pay back that debt; the inherent inequalities in the debt system (which is what capitalism is, in many ways, at its core) that divide people from each other, mitigating the chances of developing a common project for sustainability; and, as I look around, as I talk with people - the unspoken assumption that humankind has escaped from nature, no longer bound by the earth, now a transcendent Ubermensch whose destiny is for the world to become his Will and Idea. I get it now: those subconscious beliefs, products of a few centuries using up millions of years of concentrated energies, has made us hubristic, deeply.<br><br>Suddenly it reminds me of one of those Ben Franklin quotes: "Only a fool must learn be experience."<br><br>We're a bunch of sophomores.<br><br>It is simultaneously heart-breaking, and liberating. I don't have to worry about trying to stop it.

In terms of the world economic system we are (forgive me Italians) "Guido the enforcer". We can't win wars, but our ability to blow things up is fairly motivational. The U.S. Navy performs the role that the British Navy played in the 19th century. Yes, we keep the sea lanes open for our own purposes, but it also benefits everyone else's Merchant Marine.<br><br>Hence, China, Europe and others in the "developed" world give the U.S. a lot of slack economically.

It completely breaks down when you come to the $5.6 trillion in debt to foreign governments however. Let's say that Obama visits president Xi Jinping tomorrow with $1.3 trillion dollars to pay off the US debt owed to China, what Xi Jinping going to do with it? He can't use the money to buy US exports, for that to work the US trade deficit with China would have to disappear, Most people would probably object to selling China the western Sea board, so really China has to park the money back into US treasuries if it wants to be able to do anything useful with them.

The elite are not (generally) stupid, even allowing for the tendency for large groups to exhibit a collective IQ well lower than that of the mean of its members. <br><br>I recall a comment made by George W. Bush in response to a question about the Saudis raising oil production to reduce the $148 spike in oil prices. George said he'd already asked them, and that they would do it “if they can”. This speaks volumes: they know about peak oil. Never mind what politicians, or economists, or the corporate media say, the elite know. <br><br>Concerning the global fiscal and economic crisis, another comment made by Mr. Bush while president with regards to the massive bailouts after the consequent fiscal meltdown was also telling. He explained these were necessary because otherwise “this suckers going down”. Well put I'd say. <br><br>Its certainly possible some of them are self deluded or stupid. But lets face it, if George W. Bush (not generally regarded as the brightest spark in the fire) understands peak oil and the threat to the global economy, then, stupid or not, so does the rest of the elite. <br><br>Then again, JMG is correct, people do no generally consciously act contrary to their self interest. So how do you explain the behavior of the elite in face of the obvious? They act like they don't care. Here's why they act this way: they don't. The elite of any society, collectively, care no more about the people they exploit than a parasite cares about its host. This is so for the simple reason that this is in fact the relationship of the elite of any society to the rest of that society.<br><br>Now they certainly do care about their wealth. And not (generally) being stupid people they cannot not know this is based on the global economy made possible by cheap energy. So why don't they do something. Simple, they can't. There is nothing they or anyone else can do to make energy cheap again. Even keeping the price at about $100 involves poisoning you quicker (tar sands, deep sea, fracking etc.). A price they are willing to pay because you pay it more than them. I'm not saying there are not things they could do to help the rest of us. I'm just saying they have no interest in this for the reason just given. Call these “sins of omission.”<br><br>A comment made to me by a local interpreter for the UN in Sudan a few years ago comes to mind. He described the period, called the “Interim Period” in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between North and South Sudan, as the “Period of Looting”. The elites were looting the treasuries of the “Disputed Areas” in anticipation of another war. The reason for such looting was clear. When you have no faith in the future, you grab everything you can.<br><br>I think this explains the behavior of the global elite today. They are not deliberately undermining the basis of their wealth. No, they are grabbing everything they can while they still can. This is the period of global looting. <br><br>Regarding “never wise to blame on conspiracy what can adequately be explained by stupidity!”. I recall a conversation I had with a military intelligence officer who worked for years for the United States government (on loan – spying on Americans). We were discussing the stunning series of intelligence failures of the various intelligence organizations in the USA to anticipate the events of September 2011. We came up with the phrase “Incompetence explains more than conspiracy.” Though such incompetence does not explain away the evil coincidence of having a “Pearl Harbor” moment just when you wanted one. Perhaps we could now add “Yes, but sins of omission explain even more then incompetence.” Conspiracy requires too much coordination. Failing to act is dead easy.<br><br>On the other hand, the sort of deliberate “disaster capitalism” Think referred to in his second post is well documented by Naomi Klein in her book “The Shock Doctrine”.<br><br><a href=#c500356760295865816 title="comment permalink">10/18/13, 7:23 PM</a><br><br>

You're claiming that one small subset of people belonging to the financial elite shows some characteristics of psychopathy, therefore they all must be psychopaths, because their actions had consequences you don't like and therefore they must have deliberately and maliciously intended those consequences. If you're going to get into psychological concepts, I'd encourage you to start with Jung's concept of "projecting the shadow."<br><br>Jeff, I'm familiar with the effects of default, as well as those of hyperinflation. Default can be aimed -- the government can decide which pieces of federal paper are written off entirely, which ones simply have payments suspended, which get rolled over into bonds due in 2100, and so on. Hyperinflation shreds everyone equally. There are arguments in favor of both, and opposed to both -- thus my agnosticism. <br><br>David, you might consider being a little less smug and making fewer assumptions. Of course the US was paying down its debt in the 1990s -- it was riding the last gasp of the age of cheap abundant energy, with petroleum prices hovering not far above $10 a barrel. There may be more paper money sloshing around than ever, but real wealth? Quite the contrary. As for religion, you might try some actual historical research into the roles of Christianity and other religious traditions in dark ages, rather than simply regurgitating talking points off some atheist website. <br><br>Liquid, I read the captcha as a warning that orcs have been after your precious bodily fluids since August of 1991. It's at least as reasonable as some of the claims being made these days! <br><br>Phil, good question. A lot of people on this side of the pond are stumbling toward civil war; the last time that happened, even the people who played the largest role in setting it off had no clue what they were going to get. I suspect the same thing will be true this time around, if that's what we get. <br><br>James, if you want to get some other kind of socialism into circulation, I have a suggestion: do something to make that happen. It's not going to happen just because you want it; it might happen if you get out there and start getting the ideas you prefer an audience. <br><br>Bill, oh, granted. I don't think the far right has any idea what kind of backlash it's likely to set in motion. <br><br>Sunyata, many Americans are already feeling it. Many others aren't. To paraphrase Bruce Sterling, collapse is here, it's just not well distributed yet -- but it's getting better distribution one pink slip and local disaster at a time.

As for the US military, though, my take is that it's more likely to turn out to be an 800 pound white elephant as the ability to pay for it goes away. <br><br>Marlow, exactly.

I'm not sure, but one certain voice is that of Hazel Henderson, who said:<br><br>"...The basic nature of the painful transition involves a necessary shift from economies based on maximizing labor productivity (and thereby<br>continually increasing the capital and energy intensity of their<br>industrial production), which heretofore has been based on non-renewable energy, to economies that must now conserve capital, energy and materials and more fully employ their human resources.

A lot of collectibles have had their value inflated substantially in recent years, and may lose a lot of that apparent value in a hurry. <br><br>Anselmo, well, there we disagree. Today's Druidry is not the same as the traditions of the ancient Celts; as for Masonry, it's survived some pretty harrowing experiences already in its history, and organizations along similar lines have shown quite a bit of staying power elsewhere in the world. I'd encourage you not to be too quick to be sure you know what will survive and what won't!<br><br>Onething, of course there are psychopaths in positions of power, just as there are in every other walk of life. There are also psychopathic housewives; this does not justify claiming that all the world's housewives are cackling and rubbing their hands together as they plot the destruction of society. <br><br>Think Again, fair enough; it's reasonable to bring up the issue of personal action. If you've been reading here for a while, you'll likely have some idea of what my take on things has inspired me to do to get ready, and to help other people get ready, for the Long Descent. What are you actually doing to fight these hypothetical psychopaths of yours and their evil system? Posting diatribes on the internet doesn't count, by the way, since all that does -- if your theory is correct -- is make sure the NSA has your name on a list...<br><br>Thrig, excellent! A very good book; I hope Think Again takes the time to read it. <br><br>Agent, a good case can be made that there's a whole lot of looting going on, and some of it may be inspired by a conviction that things are going to fall apart in short order. Some of it may also be inspired by simple greed, and the fact that you can get away with looting the company you're supposed to manage in today's culture of corporate kleptocracy. <br><br>Still, you've raised a crucial point here, which I haven't discussed recently as much as I should; the ruling classes are not a monolithic body. They're a fractious, squabbling tangle of competing power blocs, each trying to maximize its own access to wealth and influence and each also trying to block others from doing the same -- which is to say they behave like human beings everywhere do when there's no outside pressure to play nicely with each other. It's entirely plausible that some of them have a sense of what's coming; others show absolutely no sign of it; and no doubt there's 2% or so of psychopaths in there somewhere. Nearly all of them, though, went to the same handful of universities, grew up in the same narrow range of social settings, and participate in a distinctive groupthink, as aristocracies always do. It's the mismatch between that groupthink and the facts on the ground, to my mind, that explains most of what's been going down over the last decade and a half or so. <br><br>PhysicsDoc, I could cite a fair list of atheist groups that have engaged in savage persecutions of rival religious and nonreligious movements -- and I trust you'll spare me the circular logic by which those supposedly don't tell us anything about atheism, while equivalent actions on the part of religious groups tell us all about religion. That dysfunctional behavior is pretty much a human universal, in other words, and it does no credit to atheists to watch them pretend that it only applies to people they don't like.<br><br><a href=#c1814711579511647301 title="comment permalink">10/18/13, 10:22 PM</a><br><br>

Having rubbed shoulders for half a century with a number of these wealthy men and women, and seen their blind spots and limitations up close, that view seemed to me -- to speak bluntly -- ridiculous. <br><br>Your more nuanced views, in terms of a widely shared set of values and attitudes among the wealthy, do have merit to them. <br><br>But I still find myself very deeply troubled by what seems to be your call for righteous indignation and justice against these people. <br><br>Frankly, I have never believed in either the possibility or the desirability of Justice -- not even when I was very young. Justice is always a very sharp, two-edged sword with a poisoned hilt. When it is unsheathed, it almost always ends up creating havoc instead of the better world that its proponents hope for. Nothing is so easily exploited by the corrupt as a call for justice, embraced by the multitudes. The corrupt give it lip service while using it as a warrant to rob and bully. <br><br>And righteous indignation seems to me an even worse waste of our limited energy. I do not think that there ever will be, or that there ever *can* be, a morally or ethically better world than the mess we live in now, simply because of human nature. <br><br>So any call to put one's energies into any such far-reaching project for justice, whether individual or social, just deflects our limited energy from our far more important tasks: growing food, bandaging wounds and soothing hurts, raising individual children to master themselves before trying to master others, doing what we can to help these same children live as inherently flawed human beings in their irremediably flawed society, and seeking what limited wisdom and love we are capable of grasping.<br><br><a href=#c4013498725826811206 title="comment permalink">10/19/13, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

I am pretty ignorant about economics, so I am not in a position to comment myself):<br>"Some of this is interesting. Some of his facts are way off. He is not apocalyptic but overstretched on some things, in my opinion.<br>1. The govt does not spend twice of what it makes.<br>Wikipedia says: "During FY2012, the federal government collected approximately $2.45 trillion in tax revenue, up $147 billion or 6% versus FY2011 revenues of $2.30 trillion. "<br>"CBO's preliminary estimate of the 2012 "total budget" deficit was $1.090 trillion."<br>So it "makes" about 70% of what it spent. 2012 is a bad year because the economy is still limping along with high unemployment. I imagine most years are better than that.<br>If the economy grows faster we potentially can outgrow deficits to some extent. That of course assumes the myth of "growth" which does not take into account destruction of the environment and using up resources like oil, soil, etc<br><br>We do have an inherent problem as do the Europeans , that Social Security and Medicare are growing problems since people are living longer and fewer workers are paying for more retirees. Eventually something has to give- higher taxes or lower benefits or both. However, higher taxes can certainly be handled , especially by the rich (although that may not be enough).<br>2. You can't use an individual as an analogy for a gov't. It just doesn't work.<br>3. Quantitative easing is NOT a way to keep interest rates LOW. In fact it is criticized by the right as a cause of inflation. In fact we have not seen much inflation despite the quantitive easement although the direction of the effect is to increase money supply and thus cause inflation, whether you actually see inflation depends on all the other factors pushing the economy. e.g. If you spend an extra $5 on candy it does deplete your finances but doesn't likely bankrupt you.<br>4. "They’re all basically stopgaps, and it’s probably safe to assume that the people who decided to put them into place believed that before the last of the stopgaps stopped working, the US economy would resume its normal trajectory of growth and bail everyone out. That hasn’t happened, and there are good reasons to think that it’s not going to happen—not this year, not this decade, not in our lifetimes." this is probably not correct and is a bit of catastrophizing."<br><br><br><a href=#c1972162338237957813 title="comment permalink">10/19/13, 2:51 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, that's already a significant factor in global economic shifts, though I don't know of a mainstream economist who's willing to think about it in those terms. One of the reasons that so many jobs are being outsourced to the Third World, though, is precisely that it's very often cheaper these days to hire people at Third World wages to do something than to build a machine to do it. <br><br>PhysicsDoc, in that case, no argument at all. <br><br>Think Again, "what I do isn't bad compared to what those truly awful people over there are doing" is the essence of projecting the shadow; as I said, you really should learn something about Jung's concept, rather than simply brushing it aside as an impediment to your hunt for scapegoats. As for trying to be a nice person and using a little less -- tell me, if you were on a sinking ship, would you consider being nice to your fellow passengers and not taking up quite so much space on the last bit of deck above water to be an adequate response? The point this blog has been trying to make all along is that the industrial world is facing an immensely difficult and challenging concatenation of crises that will leave few lives untouched. There's a huge amount of hard work that needs to be done in order to get anything of value through it, and the distractions of scapegoat-hunting don't contribute anything useful to that. <br><br>As for the NSA, one of the things I've noted with some puzzlement is that the very people who insist most loudly that the current order of things is run by psychopathic maniacs, or what have you, are the last people to consider what this claim implies for their own lives. If you're right, and the people who run this country are deliberately dynamiting the last scraps of constitutional government and the rule of law, then anyone who goes around denouncing the current regime in public needs to live with the very real possibility that at some point in the years ahead, they may wake up at 3 in the morning to find armed thugs breaking down their door, and get dragged out into an unmarked van, driven to some isolated area far from help, shot in the back of the head and dumped in an unmarked grave. That's how things are done in societies run by psychopaths, and it's something that takes place in quite a few countries right now. If you're right, in other words, the last thing you should be doing is mouthing off online, where your comments can be monitored and your name can be put on a list. If you insist that that can't happen, then are you sure you believe in the claims you're making? <br><br>Michael and Yulia, it'll be interesting to see if that transmits itself to younger generations. If it does, it's far from impossible that the Orthodox churches may become much more influential in worldwide religious affairs than they've been in recent centuries. <br><br>Unknown, I'm not sure that equating groupthink with a deliberately malign conspiracy really works. As for your practical points, though, no argument there at all. <br><br>Das Monde, a precise and, to my mind, quite accurate summary.

As for the purported benefits of internet copyright theft, well, all I can say is that Gaiman may attract a different sort of thieves than my books do.<br><br>Andy, if I may be frank, that's malarkey.

Some constituents are more powerful than others, of course, and they all have wildly different motives. But what they have in common is that what they do depends on the system in which they operate continuing to be intact. <br><br>Many of these constituents we would probably agree are wearing the "black hats": certain wall street bankers, certain politicians, certain CEOs, etc. It's probable that some of them know the system must end at some point, and there are even a few who go public and write books and blogs about that. But the vast majority of them just prefer to continue operating within it because that suits them better. So they continue to get super-rich and powerful, because that is what they do and, as Woody Allen said, 80% of life is just showing up. <br><br>Then there are lots of others who we might agree are wearing the "white hats" that are also working to keep the system going. My dear daughter, for example, is a newly graduated inner-city social worker working in a program that helps high-functioning young adults with various behavioral problems get a higher education. Wonderful program, absolutely wonderful. But it is as dependent on funding from the system as anything else is. <br><br>This is not in any way to draw some sort of moral equivalence between social workers and bankers, of course. But perhaps it illustrates that different constituents of the system, good and bad, are just continuing to do what they do within it, IMHO. This will continue until it doesn't. And I don't think anyone would ever accuse a bunch of social workers as being greedy conspirators because they prefer to keep a system going that funds their work.<br><br><a href=#c348542619032424742 title="comment permalink">10/19/13, 3:46 PM</a><br><br>

The more interesting thing is even with his fine-tuned understanding of most of the distortions that our printing of money is causing, it hasn't occurred to him the current move to robots is increasingly a cheap money phenomena.

To invent something in 1700 was very different from inventing something in 2000.<br><br>The original idea was to allow an inventor time to commercialize and profit from an idea which would, after 17 years, become part of the public domain, or the common wealth. That's why the patent has to make a full disclosure: no secret ingredients allowed. The technology is disclosed, and after 17 years, anyone can use it. In the meantime, people can study it and try to improve on it.<br><br>The law of diminishing returns makes it difficult to take any new patent to market and make any money back in 17 years: most, if they contain any real innovation at all (many don't) require major capital to bring to market at all, and will probably come nowhere near making that back in 17 years. So the usage of patents has changed.<br><br>As they are now used, patents are bargaining chips for corporations to cross-license so they can avoid being sued for infringement. It basically works like this: you've patented "black," so you can sue me for infringement for using black ink on my letterhead. But then, I've patented "white," so I can sue you for even having letterhead. Rather than pursuing this in court and me forcing you to use pink paper, and you forcing me to use red ink, we "cross-license" black and white, and now both of us go on about our business.<br><br>If you don't have any patents, or don't have enough, you start to take on troll-suits, and you have no leverage to make them stop. For tech companies, not having patents is like not having teeth.<br><br>The innovative content of most modern patents is near zero. One of the most successful patents in the last fifty years was the "pentanut" -- a five-sided hex nut. Why successful? Because I think it was GM that patented it, or AMC, and they started to use it on their vehicles. That meant every repair shop in every one-saloon town in the country had to buy a new set of wrenches, and guess who got a cut of each wrench with the patented "pentanut" technology? This was a "successful patent."<br><br>There are a bunch of highly technical and fairly gray rules about what can and cannot be patented, and every submission has to be compared against existing patents, so a full patent filing is expensive and time consuming. I'm just now in the process of finishing up a disclosure for a patent, and once the legal team takes it on -- they've already expressed the thought that they should move ahead with it -- it will be about two years before we find out if it can, in fact, be patented. <br><br>So the patent is not really intended to block invention, but they way it is now used certainly has that effect.<br><br>Copyrights are not generally used this way.<br><br><a href=#c259099352418098782 title="comment permalink">10/19/13, 9:09 PM</a><br><br>

Andy does have a point that fees inhibit the sharing and use of information. Free peer reviewed publications are more cited and influential than subscription peer review journals. (Unfortunately, I don't have time to track down the source on that) However, academics are under a lot of pressure to publish these days and, needless to say, the articles would be produced whether the journal is free or not.<br><br> Intellectuals, such as yourself, that live outside of academia have bills to pay and no professional need to publish. You do, however, have a financial need to publish. To clarify, that means you can only be a professional writer if writing pays the bills.<br><br> Therein lies the problem. The use of information is best when free but the generation of information is best when rewarded. This is a simple matter of incentives that gets very complicated when reality is invoked. The exact trade off that benefits society most is not a simple thing.<br><br> The founding fathers laid down a mandate for copyrights and patents in the constitution. The rules for patents have not changed much with respect to time frames but the time frames for copyrights have been greatly extended. In my view this is because business had a need to profit from patents and to use them cheaply but not so with copyrights. Copyrights are mostly produced by individuals or companies and then acquired by large businesses and sold to the public.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=#c7756306434249841924 title="comment permalink">10/19/13, 11:12 PM</a><br><br>

Books, patents, academic articles, etc., while some oil goes into their production, once produced carry and multiply their value (i.e. attract rent) with almost no marginal outgoing expenditure of oil (since the Internet, virtually nil per unit). It's one of the important ways to return USD to the American economy and prevent a disastrous trade imbalance.<br><br>The problem-- Stirling Newberry pointed this out-- is that the mechanism permitting minimal-oil distribution also readily encourages theft, so the state and the cartels have to adopt some aggressive legal strategies to try to cut losses, which are increasingly ineffective/counterproductive and which rub a lot of people the wrong way. A noxious byproduct is that some people feel righteous about depriving book authors of income.<br><br>For me this dynamic also explains a lot about academic career and publishing trends, to say nothing of the business approach that has stalked the academy since the 90s. Having dipped my toe into the lit-crit establishment, I'm struck by how the dominant discourse structures encourage work that is endlessly recombinant without much in the way of a stimulating idea to show for it. This chiefly creates a great deal of uninteresting paper that can be monetized, and incidentally serves the career needs of the million naively aspiring postgraduates (while harnessing their starry-eyed willingness to work for free). But of course it's a sin to deconstruct the deconstructivists.<br><br><a href=#c3175549629992034940 title="comment permalink">10/20/13, 8:51 AM</a><br><br>

The other solution is to double its "income."<br><br>Someone pointed out that our money-as-debt model has reached its logical conclusion: the government doesn't pay for its programs with tax money at all; it pays for ALL of its programs by borrowing money, which is created out of nothing. When it taxes, it simply destroys the money it already borrowed into existence. <br><br>Right now the system is badly out-of-balance because the government isn't destroying money as fast as it's creating it, which would normally devalue the dollar and lead to inflation -- or hyperinflation, at the rate it's being created. One of the things that mitigates the inflation is the growing gap between the rich and the poor. The rich are becoming outrageously rich at a phenomenal rate, but that money doesn't go into circulation, it idles in closed loops within financial markets. You could create a thousand-trillion dollars, and if debt-bonds were all held by the same person who pocketed all the cash, there's no net effect. There's enough money leaking into circulation to cause pretty stiff inflation, but what's mostly inflating is speculative trading in the stock and bond markets.<br><br>It would be a fairly simple matter (on paper) to tax back and destroy all of that stagnant currency. That is, in fact, exactly what is going to happen (but more catastrophically) when US currency collapses, whether through default or some other mechanism. All the paper wealth will vanish into the thin air it was made from. It would make vastly more sense to tax it out of existence in a controlled way, but that would never be tolerated by those whose paper wealth was being destroyed by taxation. So I think a future collapse is virtually guaranteed, but it isn't that there aren't alternatives: it's that the alternatives are unpalatable to short-term thinking, particularly by those who have the most influence in the game.<br><br><br><a href=#c4552352545942851781 title="comment permalink">10/20/13, 10:39 AM</a><br><br>

For instance, I think many, many people love nature deep in their hearts, just as it is; but surrendering the power we have now - which is, at its core, a desire to escape, rise above, or transcend nature... this is hard, and arguably futile, since pretty much everyone else is more than willing to step forward and exercise that power instead of you. It is like the Nash equilibrium: the game will still continue without me, and my sacrifice will be in vain. It reminds me, loosely, of following the ancient path of "renunciation", whence came the Upanishads and Vedas, among the oldest known writings in the world, and arguably the origin of much of our metaphysical, spiritual and religious thinking ever since. But the renunciants never did a damn thing to stop selfishness and greed from happening throughout history, just as it did.<br><br>I think much of the ideas that came from those renunciants, say, 5000 years ago or so, was the idea of the oneness of all things. Religion is about that oneness, about the personal self being "re-bound" into the larger whole, of the tribe, or city, state, nation, humanity, life, or what have you. The Upanishads and Vedas also reflect a recognition of the failures of language: how things can both be and not be at the same time, same place, same respect. How there is a consciousness that can reflect reality, with all its contradictions, just as it is.<br><br>Later in Hinduism came the more refined and sophisticated ideas of dharma and karma. the core teaching, IMO, is that one should hold fast to what is right and good even in times of chaos: Dharma lasts through the hard times- without being attached to outcomes or results. that is the central teaching of Hinduism. <br><br>This is how the many elements of a human society can be re-bound together into one. this is a worldly image of the oneness the renunciants discovered by rejecting society many years before. this is how pyramids get built, or rockets to the moon. Religion: being bound into a single project.<br><br>"sychopath" and "sociopath": we're talking about people who do not see other people as people, but as instruments or means to ends, are we not? But aren't we all doing that to some extent? It brings to mind the axiom from the native American elder: "we do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children." Even if we are doing what are good works in themselves (caring for the poor, the disabled, the elderly, the unfortunate) we are, at this point in history, using an unusually high level of resources to do so. My paying employment now is to be care-taker to an elderly man (who was a nuclear physicist, no less!) who cannot walk, bathe, eat, on his own. It is not my labor that supplies his needs, it is the fossil fuels we borrow from our children that do it. But I ferry the goods to his mouth and his body into the little death each night, and get the much-needed paycheck. I'd rather not participate in a system that steals from the future. but there is no more space in the forest, so I don't know how to renounce this system.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c289761507680112964 title="comment permalink">10/20/13, 12:25 PM</a><br><br>

Money is a means of exchange for trade goods and services. But it also entails debt. Debt entails that labor will be added: one gets a loan, and over time one repays the interest by adding labor. The debt burdens now are so large, and have been for so long, the only way of repayment is to continue to plunder the energy (i.e. labor) resources. Selfishness and greed - wanting more and more and more - like a psychopath or sociopath - are institutionalized; those motives are built into the system. No one knows where the off-switch to this machine can be found: it is inside each of us, and symbolized by the abstraction of desire: the currency.<br><br>One could offer solutions, such as debt-free currency, a negative-interest currency, or a "Jubilee" - a grand debt-forgiveness. The key barrier is that those who have more are loathe to surrender their advantage in a time of increasing scarcity, in the zero-sum game, with so many people on the planet, so many appetites, from the ancients here to the new babes everywhere. Couple that with the underlying non-rational belief system that progress will rescue us from scarcity, as well as the inability to agree with each other about how to challenge the ownership class or to take political power from them, not to mention the fear that has been stoked in people's hearts, a fear that keeps the US government spending well over half of our resources on defending our resource advantage...<br><br>It's madness. Because of the great boon in resources that we found in the earth some 200 years ago, the "black gold" or "the black semen of the earth" that appeared to end slavery (for a time), our religion went from one that was about the personal self being bound into the greater whole, to one of the personal self being bound to take as much as one wants as quickly as one can.<br><br>"conspiracy" is to go "with" "Piracy" - that is, with "deprivation" of others - to go around the law. "Dharma," a very ancient term, includes in its meaning "law" but means more too, something non-rational: a belief in the oneness of all. But we're all involved in that conspiracy: in a twist, in this time of massive energy surplus, now waning, the law has become conspiracy.<br><br>The rational mind nitpicks, squabbles, looks for exceptions, looks for advantages, something to make the personal self feel good. this is a barrier to shifting course from our current religion of the self (bound up with progress).<br><br><a href=#c7219048139212882602 title="comment permalink">10/20/13, 12:26 PM</a><br><br>

In speculative bubbles, such as our own mortgage bubble or the commercial RE bubble in East Asia in the '90's: after the bubble bursts, the ownership class purchases at a discount those properties that passed through loan default. The ownership class does so using the money created by the government-controlled central banks. thus, we see the stock market growing, but no increase in employment domestically, and the middle class evaporating. The stock market U.S. increasingly represents ownership of foreign land, resources, corporations, and IP.<br><br>The effect is to centralize control of property among those who already have property, in its many forms. Thus, the system ferries more and more people into the rentier class, fewer among the ownership class. And it is world-wide.<br><br>As for the idea that we will someday hang the CEOs, politicians, et al among the ownership class from the lamp-posts: it's not a certainty. First, the capacity for violence in this age is staggering. Second, most people don't know what's going on, and are easily misdirected by the propaganda machine. thus, in large part powered by the same energy resources that are the sub-text in all the blog posts here - and it should be remembered, largely ignored in mainstream discussion - the ownership class could effectively hamper efforts to deal them justice, simply by having all of us "have-nots" fight amongst ourselves. this is pretty well reflected in the politics in the U.S., where the vast majority of people are divided equally into two warring camps, thus neutralizing their political influence and ensuring that the status quo continues as it always has.<br><br>On top of this, most everyone gets their information about the world from the mainstream media. Translation, corporations- the owners of resources in an age of increasing scarcity. So people can't work together on common purposes, end up spinning their wheels in the flood.<br><br><a href=#c4238115440739475666 title="comment permalink">10/20/13, 1:37 PM</a><br><br>

But Joseph neglects a point. <br><br>Banks are 'private' and ostensibly must be profitable concerns. Their power to issue credit in <i>Fractional Reserve Banking</i> effectively increases the supply of 'money' and takes power away from Government, who then is not the key authority issuing money.(Banks themselves do not necessarily borrow what they lend and do not hold in deposit more than a small fraction of what they lend.)<br><br> We can remember, for example, that the prompt cause of the recent western financial crisis was the lending by private Banks et al of money to people who used it to make money - and to service their 'debt' - from assets that were believed to be priced on a rising trend. When this 'bubble' failed, from want of real return on this kind of 'investment', governments decided to take over more of the monetary supply. Somehow this has come to mean that the same business plan, even in the absence of real returns from an expanding economy, must continue. <br><br>JMG seems to have the nub of it - a stalled economy is increasingly now being asked to not circulate money through normal government supported services, for the duration, whiles that previous dodgy private lending is wound down. The hope is that real profit margins will recover. But the resulting smaller 'real economy' and thereby a decline in real 'returns' has meant that consumption must suffer, with the risk that business with tangible assets producing goods and services increasingly becomes unprofitable as sales decline. There is a risk that productive business cannot take on new debt (real investment) or even service the cost of original private debt. And perhaps can no longer meet obligations such as company pensions, thus again contracting aggregate consumption.<br> <br>If, as seems the case, declining profitability (margins) and real incomes were already becoming the norm through the last decade or so, despite the increase in private lending and borrowing, then governments 'stepping in' will not easily solve the matter, even if there is temporary restoration of growth. And we have witnessed something like this during the last 5 years. The old business model does indeed look inadequate, even if GM &amp; airlines etc did not go entirely for scrap! And new high-cost oil does not an economy make!<br><br>I don’t really pretend to join all this together, but thought it worth giving it a shot.<br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><br><a href=#c8626369857496980419 title="comment permalink">10/20/13, 1:41 PM</a><br><br>

This was one area where I disagreed with you in this post. I think that part of the reason for universality of government debt throughout the world is that for the last 300 years or so the world economy has been a positive sum-game whereas double-entry bookkeeping is zero-sum. In other words in order for the private sector to be in surplus the public sector has to be in deficit (either that or your net exporting to a different country which has a deficit in either the private/public sector or both). Thus the massive public sector debt isn't so much a bug, but a feature of the current economic system, and in some measure a requirement for it to work properly. I think a more obvious problem for the US is the balance of trade deficit of roughly $700 billion, and of course the balance of trade deficit with mother earth which is about to come due. That said I agree that the US will likely default in the not so distant future.<br><br><a href=#c5022521891842215825 title="comment permalink">10/20/13, 6:27 PM</a><br><br>

I tried to convert between scales by heart, and obviously made a mistake. Thanks for correcting it :).<br><br>About this socialism discussion going on here, I must go with Bill Pulliam: "Peak oil means peak socialism" is a brilliant observation. <br><br>I have been born and raised in country based on social democracy, and problems of this system have been visible for long. Support base for Social Democratic Party has been shrinking fast, and especially blue-collar male workers in traditional core trades of social democracy support base have been deserting en masse to right-wing populism. I know, because I used to work in heavy steel industry myself and belonged to Steel Workers Union, one of the biggest and most politicized unions of this nation. Even there majority of younger (under 40 yrs old) guys were practically antagonized against Social Democratic and old People's Democratic Parties, being either totally hostile towards politics in general or supporting nationalist right-wingers from True Finns... I was no exception from this rule myself.<br><br>Trying to discuss why this is so leads invariably to heated polemic with lot of straw men flying around with nasty Halloween masks on, so let's not go there. My personal belief just is that if Social Democracy cannot pass it's legacy to new generation even here, where whole nation is build around it's basic principles, how it could do so in any other part of the world? Social democracy is like rotting corpse of zombie, that has not yet noticed it is time to say goodbyes. It is sub-cult of religion of progress, and because it was such for those in the bottom who have been already sucked into abyss of globalism and diminishing margins of profit, it's traditional support base has been lost to neotribalist message banging drums in bowels of society. Jack Donovan is right: we are tribal animals.<br><br>Vision about what good future holds by party leaders coming from exclusive circle of academically trained, invariably upper-middle class background and those actually working in coveralls has just drifted too much apart to be reconciled anymore. Actual workers and those claiming to represent them live in separate but parallel realities, miraculously sharing the same space. Things considered "liberal and progressive" by aristocrats of party leadership are actually bringing destruction and havoc to those working class neighbourhoods they claim to stand for. So I see no resurrection of social democracy possible, at least in the Eastern Europe.<br><br><a href=#c6376920032994572569 title="comment permalink">10/21/13, 12:52 AM</a><br><br>

I'm extremely lucky in that I *want* to be part-time to have more time for my own projects, but many of my coworkers are already dependent on several forms of state aid, and reducing their inadequate incomes by a further 1/4 doesn't help anyone. However, as the "resident hippie," I have noticed a distinct uptick in the general interest when I mention things like pressure canning my own meats, raising poultry, coppicing/wood heat, and buying cheap veg direct from farmers to stow for the winter. Several people have approached me privately for advice on improving chronic medical conditions with natural means, and a few have asked me for a split from my mother vinegar culture. The times, they are a-changin'.<br><br><a href=#c4325917844661151788 title="comment permalink">10/21/13, 6:03 AM</a><br><br>

One is the financial game. The other is the real economy.<br><br>The real economy gave us the illusion of exponential growth for a short century or two, and the math is straightforward. Place a population of clever yeast on top of a large pile of sugar covered with a thin layer of inedible plastic. One yeast discovers how to dig through the plastic, and lives the good life; all the excess energy he produces goes into digging for more sugar, and distributing it to the other yeasts for "profit." Some of the other yeasts learn how to dig, and produce more and more usable sugar. A supply-and-demand economy ensues, with producers and consumers, but since the amount of excess energy available for economic expansion remains a fixed percentage of the total energy produced, you end up with the capacity for exponential growth in the resource stream. This allows an exponential growth in the population of consumers. So demand and supply both increase exponentially, and the economy grows exponentially.<br><br>Then they hit the bottom of the sugar pile in spots, and some digging expeditions come up empty-handed. They now regularly waste some of the excess energy on fruitless effort, and the value of the exponent shrinks -- it's still exponential growth, but where they got 10% growth before, it's down to 8%, then 6%, and finally 1%. At some point, they start to expend more energy digging up sugar than the amount of energy they get out of the enterprise. It has peaked. The economy starts to shrink.<br><br>But our yeasts <i>demand</i> economic growth, particularly the investment class, which feels <i>entitled</i> to exponential economic growth. In fact, if they don't get their expected yields, they threaten to take their investment capital elsewhere. So some yeast comes up with the clever idea of unhitching the money system from the real economy. Unlike sugar, money can be created out of nothing, for no effort at all. Yeasts distance themselves from the "dirty" business of sugar-mining, and rely entirely upon money to procure their needs. The money supply can and does grow exponentially, but the sugar doesn't, so you get monetary inflation. It gives the illusion of exponential growth of the economy, but it doesn't mean diddly in real terms. It only looks like economic growth because ... well, frankly, because yeasts are clever, but not terribly bright.<br><br>There are lots of detailed games in managing the money economy -- the Fed, fractional reserve banking, chained inflation measurements, the GDP as a metric, trade deficits, currency devaluation -- but none of them matter, because the money economy is pure fiction. You can do anything you like to "fix" the economy, including negative interest, jubilee years, payment holidays, tax holidays, recoinage, adding "In God We Trust" to the dollar bill. None of this changes the fact that the sugar takes a bigger chunk of our excess production every year, just to keep producing it.<br><br><a href=#c9205549472396716065 title="comment permalink">10/21/13, 7:10 AM</a><br><br>

JMG has written about the different regions of the US splitting apart based on cultural and other factors, and I think religion will be one of those. The South tends to be very Christian and to have (IMHO) a lot of human ego invested in it. Probably not so good for minority religions. In VT or the general NE or here in the PacNW, some of the least religious states in the nation, I expect more tolerance of different faiths. I do expect people will turn to faith, but I I don't expect it to be too traditional in form...for one thing, many churches here have already closed their doors. Dh and I attended various churches for years. One of the things that discouraged us was how many - how MANY - people in the different churches we visited or attended were over age 50, and, usually, most were much older than that. What will happen when those people die and cease their support of those institutions? In today's youth, 1 out of 3 fall into the "none" category of religion - only 15% fall into "evangelical". I suppose there could be reverse discrimination....just because people lose their religion doesn't mean they lose their disastorous human tendencies. It will be "interesting" to see how it all plays out, that is for sure......will there be a mass return to religion? Or will it be a mass turning to something else?

I find JMG's model to be quite generous, given that he makes the bulk of many of his books available to readers free online in blog format well before they're edited and published. I buy his books and drop some money in the tip jar because I'd much prefer he make a living writing than working in a nursing home or flipping burgers.<br><br>As for academic journals, there's no such thing as a "free" one. There are only journals that pay storage, editing, reviewing, and publication costs by different means. Some charge readers money, some charge researchers money (often $2-3k a pop to publish an article), and others skim resources from taxes, universities, or corporate revenues to cover their expenses. Regardless of the model, the real economic costs of time, expertise, data storage, and web (or paper) distribution are paid by someone, or the journal ceases to publish. <br><br>Given the (ahem) ephemeral nature of computer-based information storage and distribution, this whole "information wants to be free" fad is not likely to last as long as a solidly bound copy of, say, <i><a href=http://www.scarletimprint.com/bloodoftheearth.html rel=nofollow>The Blood of the Earth</a></i> printed on low-acid paper, for example. <br><br>Tying this to this week's topic, it's precisely because of the monasteries of Western Europe after the fall of Rome that many great works of the ancient world survived and were able to be shared in the West during the Renaissance and Enlightenment. The monks who chose voluntary poverty and self-sufficiency enabled themselves to cover the costs of maintaining and sharing those works over the period of centuries. Given JMG's assertion that an age of catabolic collapse of especially secular institutions is upon us, and that religion is the one option left to motivate collective action, it's worth seeing what lessons the past offers for our current predicament if our goals include the preservation and dissemination of information in the future, regardless of our preferences on who pays for such services today.<br><br><a href=#c237507276463663421 title="comment permalink">10/21/13, 10:16 AM</a><br><br>

We're not; anybody can take any piece of actual information from, say, my book <a href=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/G/Green-Wizardry rel=nofollow>Green Wizardry</a> and, with proper citation, splash it all over the internet; this is only fair, since I took it (again, with proper citation) from other sources. <br><br>It's not the information that's at issue, it's what literary property lawyers call, not inappropriately, "the work" -- the creative ordering and presentation of that information in the form of a book, or what have you. Insisting that asking people to pay for the books they use, either personally or via tax dollars that support a library, does not restrict access to the information, especially not in today's media environment; anyone who wants the information and is willing to invest their own time in getting it can easily do so. <br><br>Babylon, if anyone around the time of Augustus Caesar was asked about the future of Roman religion, it's safe to bet that they would have been confident that for many centuries to come, sacrifices would be offered to Jupiter and the other gods in their temples. That didn't turn out to be the case, as you know. I'm far from sure that Christianity is as firmly fixed in place in the American collective imagination as you seem to be, and the statistics aren't trending that way, either; while I think it's entirely possible that American Christianity may survive as a minority religion, the future contains more possibilities than a simple revival of existing forms. <br><br>As for being a Druid, well, it's always a gamble to do the right thing rather than the popular one, you know. <br><br>Phil, many thanks!<br><br>Richard, I may just have to do a post one of these days about the weird obsession with cultural necromancy that's seized so much of the modern collective imagination. How many rehashes can you do of the rehashes of the rehashes of what was once an original idea? We're clearly going to find out. As for deconstructing the deconstructionists, all in good time; it's worth remembering that deconstruction is what jackals do to dead lions -- and eventually, to dead jackals as well. <br><br>Joseph, in theory, yes. In practice, raising taxes to the level that would support current extravagance would be economically disastrous as well as politically impossible. <br><br>Iuval, my assumption here is that the US government is playing jiggery-pokery with figures to make the deficit look lower than it is, just as it's doing the same sort of massaging to the unemployment and inflation rates, etc. Thus the very rough rounding upwards to "around half." Is it an estimate? You bet. Could it be wrong? Of course -- but even so, a nation that pays a third of its bills by borrowing is not in much better shape than one that pays half of them by borrowing, you know. Either way, the rising debt load ends up breaking you. <br><br>Chris, just as a matter of detail, "conspiracy" does not come from the same root as "piracy"! It comes from Latin "con-" and "spiro," to breathe -- literally to breathe together; the image is of people clustered around a table so closely that they're breathing each other's breaths. Beyond that -- well, it would take a full post to respond to any of your major points, and I'll pass just at the moment. ;-)<br><br>Phil H, exactly. Will it get better? Maybe, temporarily -- but my guess is that it's going to get a whole lot worse first. <br><br>Dagnarus, I'd encourage you to check your theory against economic history. The US government, for example, had a strictly balanced budget through the late 19th century, when private business was heaping up unparalleled fortunes; thus I think there's something amiss with your claim that the public sector has to run a deficit for the private one to run a profit!<br><br><a href=#c7793758054743126878 title="comment permalink">10/21/13, 10:42 AM</a><br><br>
