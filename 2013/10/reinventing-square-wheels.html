<![endif]-->The issues raised in last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report </i>cut far closer to the heart of our predicament than many of my readers may realize. It’s not just that the production of every kind of good or service in an industrial economy depends on the expectation that somebody or other can make a profit out of the deal, though of course that’s of huge importance. Every other mechanism we’ve got for circulating wealth depends directly or indirectly on the same expectation: taxes, fees, rent, interest on loans, and much else assumes that every business ought to produce enough profit that its banker, landlord, local and state governments, and so on can all be supported off a share of the proceeds without bankrupting the business. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nowadays, that’s not necessarily a safe assumption. If you walk down the main streets in the old red brick Appalachian mill town where I live, for example, you’ll see any number of empty storefronts in excellent locations. Most of them haven’t had a tenant in forty years. Now and then a new business opens in one of these spots, or makes the attempt, but it’s very rare for one of these to be around a year after its opening. Cumberland, Maryland is a classic Rust Belt town, and the factories that were once its main employers all shut down in the early 1970s, pushing it through the same deindustrial transition that most of the rest of the United States is facing right now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Businesses here have to survive on a very thin profit margin. The difficulty is that bankers, landlords, local and state officials, and so on still want their accustomed cut, which is substantially more than that margin will usually cover. This isn’t mere greed—they all have their own bills to pay, and an equal or larger number of people and institutions clamoring for a share of their own take.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The result, though, is that storefronts stay empty despite an abundance of unmet economic needs and an equal abundance of people who would be happy to work if they had the chance, because the businesses that could meet those needs and employ those people can’t make enough of a profit to keep their doors open. The inability of most economic activities to turn a profit in an age of contraction is already an issue at many levels, and one with which contemporary economic thought is almost completely unprepared to deal. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The one reliable way of dealing with that inability, of course, is to move productive activities into spheres that don’t depend on the profit motive. The household economy is one obvious place, and so is that expansion of the household economy—pretty much universal in dark ages—in which each family cultivates grains, legumes, and other bulk food crops for its own use on village farmland. Gift economies hardwired into the social hierarchy are also standard in such ages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’s a good reason why the English word “lord” comes from an<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Anglo-Saxon term meaning “giver of loaves,” and it’s the same reason why generosity is always one of the most praised virtues in feudal and protofeudal societies:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>from Saxon England to Vedic India to the First Nations of the Pacific Northwest coast, giving lavish gifts to all and sundry is the most important economic activity of the aristocrat. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, as discussed last week, religion is among other things a critically important source of motivation for unprofitable but necessary activities, and it tends to become paramount in ages of decline. There are certain complexities here, though, and the best way to grasp them is an indirect one. As so often in these essays, that route leads along unexpected byways—in this case, past two communes in rural Massachusetts, of all places, during the first half of the nineteenth century. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first of them will be familiar only to who know the history of the Transcendentalist movement, America’s first homegrown counterculture. Its name was Brook Farm; it was founded with high hopes and much fanfare in 1841 by a bunch of Boston hippies—for all practical purposes, that’s what the Transcendentalists were—and it imploded in a series of crises in 1846 and 1847, having followed a trajectory that will be painfully familiar to anybody who watched the aftermath of the Sixties. As usual, the central conflict pitted middle-class expectations of adequate leisure, comfort, and personal independence against the hard economic realities of subsistence farming, and both sides lost; unable to support its members’ lifestyles solely from the results of their labor, the community ran through its savings and as much money as it could borrow, and when the money ran out, it went under. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the commune’s founding members, Nathaniel Hawthorne, set his novel <i>The Blithedale Romance</i> at a lightly fictionalized Brook Farm. Back when American public schools still had students read literature, you could count on getting assigned to read Hawthorne’s
<i>The Scarlet Letter</i> or <i>The House of the Seven Gables</i> , but not <i>The Blithedale Romance</i>. Partly, I suspect, that was because its edgy portrayal of the psychology of the true believer, via the character of Hollingsworth the social reformer, cuts far too close to the bone; partly, though, it’s because America has long suffered from a frantic terror of all the most creative dimensions of its own past. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Brook Farm, in point of fact, was one of several hundred known communes in the United States in the 19th century, which built on a tradition going back to the late 17th; the first American commune I know of, Johannes Kelpius’ “Woman in the Wilderness” community of Rosicrucian ascetics, was founded in the trackless forests of Pennsylvania in1694. There are dozens of good books on these communities from 19th and early 20th century historians—Charles Nordhoff’s 1875 survey <i>The Communistic Societies of the United States<i> </i></i>is a classic—and a flurry of research on them in academic circles more recently, but you’ll rarely hear about any of that in any public venue these days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a post to be written about the spectacular falsification of the American past that unfolds from our efforts to flee from our own history, but that’s a subject for another week. The point relevant now is that, during the years when Brook Farm was stumbling through its short and troubled life, there were several other communes in the neighborhood, and one that deserves special mention here was only thirty-five miles away by road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Long before Brook Farm’s rise and long after its fall, it was a prosperous egalitarian community with around 200 members, growing all its own food and meeting all its financial needs with room to spare. The Harvard Village, as it was called, was everything Brook Farm’s founders claimed they wanted their commune to be, and it was also everything Brook Farm’s founders rejected most heatedly in practice: that is, it was a Shaker community. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers from outside the United States may never have heard of the United Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing, better known then and now as the Shakers. To most Americans, for that matter, those words might at most stir some vague memory of spare but elegant handicrafts and a few notes of the classic Shaker hymn “Simple Gifts.” I have yet to see a discussion of the United Society find its way into the ongoing conversation about lifeboat ecovillages. That’s a pity, because the Shaker experience has important and highly relevant lessons to teach in that context. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The United Society had its start in Manchester, England, where Ann Lee—“Mother Ann” to Shakers ever after—led a tiny group that spun off from the Quakers over the course of the 1760s. In 1774, Mother Ann and eight followers came to what was about to become the United States, and found no shortage of interest in their new gospel. From 1787 on, the United Society was run by its American converts, and these latter proceeded to accomplish one of the most remarkable feats of convergent evolution in human history: starting wholly from first principles, and with apparently no knowledge of the historical parallels, they reinvented almost every detail of classic monasticism.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Like monks and nuns everywhere, Shakers were celibate—one of Mother Ann’s revelations was that sexuality is the most potent source of human sinfulness—and lived communally, owning no personal property. Men and women lived in separate dormitories in a Shaker village and led essentially separate lives; Shaker meetinghouses, where Sunday services were held, had two doors, one for Brothers and one for Sisters, and the two sexes sat on opposite sides. Despite the rule of celibacy, there were always children in Shaker villages, some of them orphans, some left by destitute or deadbeat parents, some brought into the United Society when their parents joined; they had their own dormitories, one for girls and one for boys. The children could choose to leave or stay when they reached adulthood. To stay was to give up sexuality, family, property, and a great deal of autonomy, but it was a choice many made. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were consolations, to be sure, and not all of them were wholly spiritual. The opportunities open to women among the Shakers were much more substantial than what was available in what Shakers called “the World.” Both sexes had equal roles in each village, each regional bishopric, and the entire Society—the Central Ministry, the body of four senior Shakers who ran the organization, always consisted of two Elders and two Eldresses. Ordinary members could expect a life of of hard work, but that was common enough in 19th century America, and the lifelong support of a close-knit community provided by the Shaker system was something most people in that rough-and-tumble era did not have. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Shakers thus had to be on the watch for freeloaders—“bread-and-butter Shakers” was the usual term—who wanted to join the Society for the sake of free meals and medical care, but had no interest in the religion or, for that matter, in putting in an honest day’s work. Still, the United Society found so many sincere converts that new Shaker communities were being founded into the 1830s, and membership declines didn’t become an issue until well after the Civil War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Nor is the United Society quite gone even today; there are still a few members left <a href=http://www.shaker.lib.me.us/ >at the last remaining Shaker village</a> at Sabbathday Lake, Maine, supporting themselves by the utterly traditional Shaker trade of drying and selling herbs.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Compare a Shaker community with a Christian or Buddhist monastery and the parallels are impossible to miss. The classic Christian monastic virtues of poverty, chastity, and obedience are all present and accounted for; so is the commitment to labor as a form of religious service. For that matter, the clean, simple, spare esthetic that the Shakers made famous in their furnishings and architecture has a great deal in common with the elegant simplicity that Zen Buddhism introduced to Japanese art and design, or the close equivalents in Christian monastic traditions. The parallels aren’t accidental: set out to live on a monastic plan, and the kind of simplicity prized by Shakers, Cistercians, Zen monks, and so many of their fellow monastics, has a great many practical advantages. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Whether it takes the form of a Shaker village, a Catholic abbey, a Zen Buddhist monastery, or what have you, the monastic life is one of the few consistent success stories in the history of communal living. That’s exactly the problem, of course, because the vast majority of people who imagine themselves living in a communal setting these days aren’t willing to push their enthusiasm to the point of giving up sex, family personal property, and personal autonomy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The result, predictably enough, has been a steady stream of projects, proposals, and actual communities launched by people who want to have their cake and eat it too: that is, to live in a self-supporting communal setting while still retaining comfortable middle-class values of ownership, autonomy, and unhindered sexual activity. Brook Farm was one of those attempts, and it lasted longer than most. Throughout American history, the average lifespan of a commune has been around two years. There are counterexamples, to be sure, but it’s remarkable how often those have ended up adopting at least some of the traditional monastic values, such as community ownership of property.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a wholly pragmatic reason for those failures. The kind of lifestyle most people consider normal in industrial societies is only possible if you’re helping to burn through half a billion years of stored sunlight via a modern industrial economy. You can’t support such a lifestyle with hand labor on a rural commune. Even the much less resource-intensive lifestyles of the Brook Farm era were too costly to be met by working the land, which is why Brook Farm went broke in five years. Most of the communes of the Sixties crashed and burned sooner than that: unless there was a sugar daddy available to cover the bills, the amount and kind of work the residents were willing to do usually failed to meet the costs of the lifestyles they wanted to lead, and collapse followed promptly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The exceptions have almost all been religious communities. In the Sixties, that usually meant that they clustered around a spiritual leader who was charismatic or convincing enough to get away with telling his followers what to do. Some religious communities launched by the Sixties counterculture thus are still around; others got past the economic problems that wrecked most of their secular counterparts, only to crash headlong into one of the other standard traps that face communal projects. You can see all these same patterns traced out<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in the communes launched by earlier American countercultures, from the Transcendentalists on—and by and large, the only ones that survive their founding generation are those that conform more or less precisely to the model of classic monasticism sketched out above. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I spoke of convergent evolution earlier, and the borrowing from biology is a deliberate one. Darwin’s theory, at its core, is simply a recognition that some things work better than others, and those organisms who stumble across something that works better—in physical structure, in behavior, or what have you—are more likely to survive whatever challenges they and their less gifted counterparts face together. Why one thing works better than another may or may not be obvious, even after close study, but when one set of adaptations consistently results in survival, while a different set just as consistently results in collapse, it seems quite reasonable to draw the obvious lesson from that experience. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That inference seems reasonable to me, at least. I’m quite aware that most other people in the modern industrial world don’t seem to see things that way. I can point out that <i>X</i> has failed every single time it’s been tried, without a single exception, and people will insist that this doesn’t matter unless I can detail the reasons why it has to fail; then, when I do so, they try to argue with the reasons. In the opening lines of his essay <i>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon,</i> Karl Marx commented acidly: “Hegel says somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.” One of the most potent forces driving those repetitions, by turns tragic and farcical, is the endlessly repeated insistence that this time, the lessons of history don’t matter. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus it’s an interesting question why celibacy should be so important a factor in the long-term survival of monastic systems. Perhaps celibacy works because it prevents sexual jealousies from spinning out of control, as they so often do in the hothouse environment of communal living. Perhaps celibacy works because pair bonds between lovers are a potent source of the private loyalties that, left to run free, so often distract members of communal groups from their loyalty to the project as a whole. Perhaps celibacy works because it’s only when your followers are willing to give up sex for the cause that you can be sure they’re committed enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Perhaps celibacy works because all that creative energy has to go somewhere—the Shakers, like so many other monastic traditions, birthed an astonishing range of artistic and creative endeavors, from a musical corpus of more than 11,000 original hymns, through graphic arts, architecture, and a style of furniture and other crafts that’s widely considered one of the great traditions of American folk culture.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Perhaps it’s some other reason entirely. The point that needs to be kept in mind, though, is that in a monastic setting, celibacy works, and most of the other ways of managing human sexuality in that setting pretty reliably don’t. It’s possible to be utterly correct about the fact that
<i>X</i> is the case while being just as utterly clueless about the reasons why <i>X</i> is the case. The fact that medieval philosophers believed that rocks fall because they’re passionately in love with the earth, and desire to be united with their beloved, thus did not prevent those same philosophers from recognizing that rocks do indeed fall when you pick them up and let go.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The value and the limitations of history as a guide to the present and the future come out of the hard fact that history tells us what happens, but not why it happens. More than three centuries of communal experiments in North America, and more than three thousand years of similar experiments elsewhere, have a lot to teach about what works and what doesn’t work when people decide to pursue a communal lifestyle. Those who are willing to learn from those experiences have a much better chance of coming up with something that works than those who insist that the past doesn’t matter and thus repeat its most common mistakes all over again. Reinventing the wheel has its uses, but if your efforts at reinvention consistently turn out square wheels, it may be helpful to look at other examples of the wheelwright’s craft and see if you can figure out what they got right and you got wrong. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Ironically, that’s an insight the Shakers could have used. I mentioned above that they managed to reinvent almost every detail of classic monasticism, but one of the few details they missed turned out to be their Achilles’ heel. Quite a few religious movements have started out wholly monastic; those that survived for more than a few generations figured out that they also needed some mode of participation for people who admired their ideals and believed in their teachings but weren’t ready to take the plunge into a celibate lifestyle. The Jain and Buddhist religions, to name only two examples, started out as wholly monastic traditions, but figured out early on that they needed to make room for laypersons as well—and discovered that the more room they made for lay involvement, the more often it happened that people got sufficiently used to the idea of monastic life to say “You know, I could live with that.” It’s by way of that process that successful monastic systems keep themselves supplied with novices. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If the Shakers had such a community of supportive lay believers as a waystation between the World and the formal Shaker life, it’s quite possible that they would be a major American denomination today. If the lack of that bridge is what finally brings the United Society’s story to an end, as seems likely just now, they won’t be the first victims of that particular trap, and doubtless won’t be the last, either. That’s why it’s important to pay attention to the lessons of history, especially when there’s reason to suspect a mismatch between your expectations and the facts on the ground. The decline and fall of contemporary industrial civilization bids fair to bring a bumper crop of that sort of mismatch into play—and in such times insisting that despite all the experience of the past, wheels ought to have square corners, is not exactly a useful habit. </div>

It may be worth mentioning that some communes from the 1960s succumbed not to internal frictions but to hostility from local communities.

The police bulldozed many of the unpermitted buildings on the property, and would have destroyed a great many trees to get to the remaining structures had residents not chosen to burn down their own houses rather than permit this to happen.<br><br>From that time to this, mainstream society has gone out of its way to make it very difficult for groups or individuals to opt out of participating in the economic system which is currently destroying itself along with its global life support system.<br><br><a href=#c9020686463267781914 title="comment permalink">10/23/13, 11:18 PM</a><br><br>

This week's post doesn't claim to discuss every possible arrangement in which human beings live in close proximity; it explores one set of practices that work, as a comparison to a much more popular one that generally doesn't.

In dark ages, monasteries have very often been the core around which the wreckage of a collapsed society regroups -- it's only when things get organized again that they become less central.

I think your analysis is pretty convincing. It seems to be a special case of sorts - how a kind of communist bubble can persist in a larger society of ownership and unsustainability. Interesting that these communes can seem a material step down in periods of excess, but a way of preserving culture and material well-being in times of contraction and disarray. In neither case, of course are they models for a society, but rather a community within a society from which they stand apart.<br><br><a href=#c7142114317208348266 title="comment permalink">10/24/13, 5:42 AM</a><br><br>

It had to do with hunger, and that the drug lords fed families, so the families would protect them. She remarked "when your children are starving, you only care to feed them, not who feeds them". When the Repbulicans made so much noise about cutting food stamps recently, I thought "we're opening the door to the drug lords".

Further, I'm currently reading "The Christian Druids" by John Minahane that details how the Druids in Ireland creatively assimilated Christianity, and a lot more about how these Filid's operated from the 5th century onwards. (For an interesting Bardic comparison I was also led to start learning about the Griot's of West Africa who are still a going concern.)<br><br>As much as the OTO is growing as a magical order, I don't think it will have any monastic offshoots. Plus the heavy individualistic stance Thelemite's have may very well come down to a matter of "broken Will's" during the industrial decline. One reason the Abbey of Thelema failed as well is that some people just can't keep their trousers buttoned.<br><br>I'm glad you mentioned the way some religions have coped with the manner in which to bring people into the monastic lifestyle.

It's a "low" aristocracy, true, but Bilbo has the The House Under The Hill, hypenated relations, and enjoys a lot of leisure time, as does Frodo, his nephew/ward, particularly in their youth.<br><br>We don't hear as much about the tenant class, such as Sam Gamgee's grandfather, The Gaffer.

As someone pointed out here, there have been some spectacular failures as well as many successes. And as you mentioned, there are always the little details that can derail an otherwise successful community.<br><br>As an example of learning from history, I recommend Elinor Ostrom's book "Governing the Commons", a study of communities organized around managing a common pool resource. Based on considerable study of a large number of such communities, she proposed a set of principles that seemed to characterize the successful ones:<br>- Clearly defined boundaries<br>- Appropriateness of the rules for use to the nature of the particular commons<br>- Democratic determination of the rules<br>- Active monitoring of the usage of the commons<br>- Graduated sanctions for violations of the rules<br>- Conflict resolution mechanisms<br>- Minimal autonomy: ability to self-organize without challenge from external authorities<br>(I've edited and abstracted a bit.)<br>The book was published in 1990. These principles have held up well in subsequent research, and are revisited in her 2005 book "Understanding Institutional Diversity".<br><br>(There's another, unintended lesson in these two books. For a non-academic, they're pretty heavy going; Ostrom was a scientist, writing mostly for her fellow scientists. I fear that the valuable insights learned over a long career may not be accessible to those communities trying to manage a commons. There's a definite need for someone with a foot in both worlds, and the ability to translate effectively between them.)<br><br>Finally, a couple of contrasting references relevant to the overall theme of the "second religiosity":<br>- <a href=http://makinapacalatxilbalba.blogspot.com/2009/06/ape-and-essence-forgotten-masterpiece.html rel=nofollow>Ape and Essence</a>: a sardonic look at the shadow of triumphal Christianity and the religion of progress.<br>- and for something completely different: Bill Moyers' recent interview with <a href=http://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-wendell-berry-poet-prophet/ rel=nofollow>Wendell Berry</a><br><br><a href=#c6238890309783398057 title="comment permalink">10/24/13, 9:50 AM</a><br><br>

But from what I've heard, they've changed a lot since, to a form no longer recognizable as the communes they once were. E.g., the famous communal meals and communal childrearing are mostly gone. As for their economic survival, it has been thanks to preferential treatment by the surrounding state (on things such as access to land, water, contracts, etc), and (since 1967 as you said) more and more exploitation of hired labor from the outside - a practice that would have been abhorrent to previous generations of kibbutzniks. To me it seems that the history of the kibbutz movement shows both the promises and the pitfalls of such endeavors. Apparently the ideological fervor was diluted enough by the third generation to pretty much demolish the original intentions. It did last more than the few years most US communes managed. But it was also embedded into a larger society that was fairly socialistic (and supportive) through the 1970's or so, but swung towards all-out capitalism since, affecting the kibbutz society.<br><br><br><a href=#c3382805859265519803 title="comment permalink">10/24/13, 10:27 AM</a><br><br>

A lot of American communal groups followed a similar path, shedding more and more of their communal ethos until eventually they were indistinguishable from the society around them. <br><br>Mark, good heavens, you should know the answer to that one! There is no single "worthy goal for humanity" -- there are many options, many possibilities, which lead in many different directions. If communal living inspires you, pursue it; if not, find something else. <br><br>Kutamun, it's an occupational hazard. <br><br>Magifungi, that's also an occupational hazard. I may have to do another post on that soon. <br><br>Tom, exactly. It's not that most middle class people actually want simple lifestyles, you understand -- they want to daydream about their notion of what a simpler lifestyle would be like, and then go back to living their cozy and privileged lives. <br><br>Compound F, life has no prime directive, which is why celibate monastic systems so often flourish despite your claim that they shouldn't. It's a lot more useful to start from documented facts and work from there to abstract principles, you know, than it is to start from abstract principles (such as your hypothetical "prime directive of life") and try to work back to facts on the ground. <br><br>Notes, I suspect that most celibate communities end up with a large contingent of asexuals anyway. <br><br>Marcello, extreme violence is just as much a part of the feudal mindset as extreme generosity; the two in no way contradict each other, you know. <br><br>Phitio, of course a monastery needs a surrounding noncelibate population -- I discussed that in my post. As for the medieval level being reachable or otherwise, I'll be talking about that at quite some length as we proceed; a lot of people forget just how catastrophically things came apart in western Europe in the wake of the Roman collapse. More on this soon. <br><br>Phil K, thanks for the reference!<br><br>Matthew, I wouldn't recommend getting land at this stage of the game unless you're prepared to work it, live on it, and pay for it for the rest of your life. <br><br>Chris, many thanks!

What set the hippies apart, to my mind, was how quickly they crumpled when they encountered that normal rite of passage. <br><br>Yupped, my guess is that it's both. <br><br>Andy, of course it's not a model for society as a whole -- it's one piece of the patchwork, not the whole quilt. As for sustaining commons, it's actually quite easy, as I pointed out in a previous series of posts: all you have to do is make sure that the people who get the benefits also have to pay an equal share of all the costs, and you're home free. It's our unwillingness to do that in modern America that's dragging us down. <br><br>Twilight, my take is that all we can do is lay foundations, which those who come after us may or may not build on, and save things that they may or may not use. That still seems worth doing to me, but there are no guarantees. <br><br>Janet, exactly. If planners of ecovillages would just take the time to learn a little bit about what mistakes doomed previous communal projects, they might do better -- but that kind of historical vision is utterly taboo in our society. <br><br>Sky, I'd have to come up with all the money up front to buy the books, then arrange to have them sold and mailed out -- and I barely have enough time to keep up with current projects as it is. (Nor am I exactly rolling in spare cash; a writer's income depends to some extent on the state of the economy as a whole.) Thanks, but your best bet is probably to pick up a copy at your local full service bookstore and have me sign it at a peak oil event. <br><br>Zach, third or tertiary orders are a very useful model indeed, and I also know people who are involved in a couple of them. <br><br>Justin, if Thelema's going to make it over the long term, I'd suggest, it's going to have to grapple with the tough question of differentiating between the True Will and the yammering crowd of moment by moment wants. I've known way too many Thelemites who can't tell the difference between those. Unravel that knot, and you've got a basis for Thelemite monasticism: a group of people whose True Wills are in alignment with a given monastic rule, and who therefore submit those yammering wants to its discipline. <br><br>Paradigm, you're welcome and I'm glad it helped. The wallowing in despair that's become so large and unappealing a feature of some parts of the peak oil scene is a waste of everyone's time; I'm probably going to have to address that again, soon. <br><br>Kevin, it's always tempting to engage in reasoning by anecdote: here's an example of X, therefore X is a general rule. I'd encourage you to reflect on why it's appealing to insist that it's society, rather than the internal flaws of communal projects, that prevents communal projects from thriving. <br><br>Michelle, a very broad and unhelpful overgeneralization. I'll be discussing that when we get to the sequence on Dark Age America. <br><br>Magicalthyme, excellent!

I would suspect, pulling from more successful societies than the shakers, that strict rules regarding sex, marriage and children are more important than celibacy itself. Although celibacy represents the most "pure" form of those religions' sexual views, it would be an evolutionary dead end if they didn't come up with a way around it to get new members.<br><br>My experience with the Quakers, for me, confirms your overall assertions, although they hew less to a monastic life, it is still much closer than anything else in my otherwise American childhood. I wouldn't know a lick about farming or cooking or canning or fermentation or living communally, or even how to just sit quietly and listen contemplatively, if I hadn't lived in a Quaker commune for a portion of my youth. <br><br>In some ways, that life does resemble the Shire, in that it is a small, simple, happy life, less concerned with outside news, and obsessed with nature and the seasons, and a humble devotion to a personal god. <br><br>I was a punky, atheist, anarchist at the time (still am, a little), and didn't see the beautiful little truths they were showing me because of the religious overtones (the whole religious thing still sticks in my craw), but I came back to it reading this post from a new light, of the value of the life lived and the value of living simply, rather than the little fibs and fables of Sunday morning service... thanks for letting me see a bit of my past in a new light!<br><br>I hope, down the line, we can find some common ground between living a simple, sustainable life, and believing in a mythos that is not demonstrably false, patriarchal, and classist!<br><br><a href=#c1525809651514234591 title="comment permalink">10/24/13, 1:02 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you for your continued willingness to share thoughts in such a public way!<br><br>Ummm . . . I'm going to barge in with a nitpick, but an interesting one: the origin of the word "lord" actually isn't "loaf giver," but "loaf protector" (hlaf = loaf; hweard = warden). It was, as far as I've been able to determine, a job description more than a title, though for obvious reasons the title developed. I also like the fact that the origin for "lady" seems to have been something close to "loaf maker." <br><br>On another note, your illustration of the Shakers made me think (as it has others here) of that other rather successful communal model, also based around a strict social contract involving shared religious doctrine: the Amish.

The institution of rent on land (or anything else) which is much more parasitic than productive, if you look at some measure of the landlord's value added, e.g. money made per hours of labor put in, or per money spent. The profit is mostly from the mere fact that the landlord owns a necessary-for-life resource and the tenant doesn't. Are you saying there is less egregious (but socially acceptable, and rationalized in a similar manner to slavery) exploitation in "dark" ages of decline?<br><br>2. Intentional communnities: I actually had a whole blog about Brooke Farm a while ago and also read the Blithedale Romance. You neglected to mention that they (in analogy with startup businesses) were promised support from some venture capitalists and philanthropists (e.g. Emerson) who withdrew their support, that after they built their workshop to support 3 cottage industries and hadn't insured it yet, the building burnt down (within a week of being built), that they all got a nasty flu right around then, and then Nathaniel Hawthorne sued them for not being able to repay him the money he lent them.<br><br>You also neglected to mention the role of the anglo-saxon and transcendentalist culture of rugged individualism. Israeli communes have had an easier time of it, as people seem to have an easier time cooperating coming from jewish culture. Monogamous marriage seems to be the norm there...<br><br>But I agree that the factors you mentioned were also important. It is very difficult to start a new society in the midst of the old and there are both internal and external obstacles to it. Oneida, where a complex form of polyamory was thriving would have made it if it wasn't for external foes, in my opinion. Twin Oaks, Dancing Rabbit and a few others seem to be doing OK. There are general principles of systems theory and evolutionary biology at work which I've talked about on my blog, but I agree that it pays to see what actually works regardless of the reasons. It would be great to come up with a theory of what are the necessary and sufficient ingredients for a successful intentional community. I have tried to do that to some extent on my blog and youtube video, but it is hard to test it in a predictive manner. After 8 years of trying to either find or create an intentional community I have not been successful (I did start one where other people live, who will hopefully thrive).<br><br><a href=#c7284602182423947830 title="comment permalink">10/24/13, 3:52 PM</a><br><br>

Despite the fact that the Puget Sound area, where I grew up, was crawling with communal experiments all through the late 19th and early 20th centuries, no mention of that was included in my high school history classes, and that whole end of history has received vanishingly little attention in any context available to the general American public. <br><br>That's part of a broader trend. Your spouse the historian doubtless knows of the cooperative movement of the late 19th century, the extraordinary history of American religious innovation, and all the other expressions of this country's once-famous radical rejection of the conventional. How many people outside her profession are acquainted with any of that? In my experience, very, very few. <br><br>For decades now, both sides in the ongoing culture wars in this country have pretended that America was hopelessly square until 1965 or so -- the pseudoconservatives so they could project their imaginary golden age onto the past, the pseudoliberals so that they could always have something to pretend to rebel against. They've dominated the collective conversation to such an extent that very few people realize just how toothless current American dissent is compared to its predecessors, or for that matter how little today's "conservatives" actually conserve. <br><br>Dltrammel, true enough. The fact that the Right understands the local nature of politics, and the Left by and large doesn't, has contributed mightily to the Left's failure to achieve much in the political sphere in recent decades. <br><br>RPC, also a plausible theory. <br><br>Moshe, thanks for the suggestion!<br><br>Orc, true enough. Maybe it's that getting some distance between you and the world is a good way to figure out what aspects of the world most need saving!<br><br>Chapel, thank you for getting it. Of course I'm not trying to say that everybody ought to become a Shaker, or any other kind of monastic; my point, as you've noted, is that the monastic system is one very potent way that religions can keep things going during a dark age like tghe one we're facing, and that anyone who wants to try doing the same thing might want to pay attention to the last three thousand years of experience. <br><br>Justin, do you know John Plummer? Small world. Yes, he was one of my consecrators -- a fascinating man, and one of the most sincere Christians I've ever met. As for the book cited, that's the handbook for one of the branches of AODA; we've been busy unpacking some of the teachings and traditions we inherited, and getting them up and running again. <br><br>John, a different way of looking at things is rarely enough; what's needed, most of the time, are carefully chosen changes to structure and context -- for example, if you want to use square wheels, you're going to have to invest the time and resources to build at least one inverted catenary road. That said, I have no objection to people trying one more time; I'd just like to see them respond to the failure of the last umpty-dozen identical attempts with some less vacuous response than "Oh, but it's different this time." <br><br>Trog, I'm still trying to parse that.<br><br><a href=#c1015554011024498716 title="comment permalink">10/24/13, 4:00 PM</a><br><br>

Sometime soon, though, I'm going to have to do a post on the blind spot in rationalist critiques of religious mythology. The very short form? Having grasped that the stories don't necessarily make sense when interpreted in the most pigheadedly literal of senses, it seems never to occur to rationalists to ask, "In that case, is there another sense in which these stories do, in fact, make sense?" More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Brian, there is no one size fits all response. Your best starting point will depend entirely on your situation, your resources, and your interests and passions, among other things. I suppose you could say that the best place to start is by thinking hard about what the best place to start would be!<br><br>Adrian, there are a number of communes from the Sixties that are still around -- Dancing Rabbit is one of 'em, and no doubt my readers could name others. It would be interesting to see a good comparative study on what kept them going when so many hundreds of others crashed and burned. <br><br>Anna, hmm! Thank you for the correction; I must have misremembered. <br><br>Marcello, and yet several people have commented already on how many Latin American drug lords have realized that a little noblesse oblige toward the local poor gets them loyalty and support that can really come in handy. <br><br>Brazenraddish, a hundred square meter allotment is an entirely different matter! By all means see what you can do with it, and use it as a learning experience -- that's exactly the kind of small but helpful step that's worth pursuing at this time. Here in the US, a great many people in the green scene like to talk longingly about buying hundreds or thousands of acres off somewhere rural or even wilderness, very often without the least thought of the commitment they're making or the challenges they're likely to face.

I'm sure that the great majority of communes have disintegrated from internal causes, as you say. But this doesn't mean that such communities can't suffer at the hands of external enemies, as medieval Irish monasteries did at the hands of the vikings. <br><br>I know I'm not cut out for the monastic life, so I have no personal commitment to believing one thing or another concerning its strengths or vulnerabilities. I doubt that I'd enjoy it in any case. <br><br>I'm aware that in the same geographic area as the commune I've referred to - in the very same county - is another intentional community dating from the same period that persists to this day. It has survived because of a secure economic foundation - it operates as a popular clothing-optional hot springs resort - and because the founder is apparently a canny individual who has wisely refrained from developing a personality cult around himself as a spiritual leader: although, when you read between the lines, that's exactly what he is, in a quiet, unassuming sort of way. This latter community is geographically isolated from the nearest town, keeping pretty much to itself except insofar as is necessary to maintain good relations, and I fancy that probably has also contributed to its long-term survival. <br><br>My beef with the way the commune I've mentioned was destroyed is that I feel that it symbolizes the way in which the agenda of the counterculture was for the most part suppressed and destroyed, a phenomenon which was concomitant with the some very bad choices that American society made around 35 or 40 years ago, leading us to the situation in which we now find ourselves. Had certain elements of that agenda succeeded (environmentalism, anti-materialism, energy conservation), we would not now be facing the dire consequences of two more generations of runaway debt-based consumerism and environmental degradation. I suppose than in my mind, Morningstar represents some kind of ideal, a radical transfiguration of society that might not have worked out anyway and that people just weren't having. But it also reminds me that at a critical moment in history, America said NO to some very good ideas that might have saved it from a dismal fate. We blew it. And that makes me PO'd.<br><br><a href=#c4390555973100001922 title="comment permalink">10/24/13, 4:19 PM</a><br><br>

We have no difficulty, under the normal usages of English and its culturally related languages such as French and Latin, in terming Buddhist contemplative communities monastic - exotic though those saffron robes may initially appear to European eyes.<br><br>The Essenes who conserved the Dead Sea Scrolls near 1st-century Jerusalem likewise count as a monastic movement, in the ordinary English sense of the word - culturally, geographically, and temporally distant though those ancient Essenes are from modern Europe. <br><br>A group of people founding an ascetic rule-governed community may or may not be monastic. The prayer-centred Shakers were, and are. The 1840s Massachusetts Brook Farm, on the other hand, seems to me to have been secular, i.e., seems to me not to have been monastic. <br><br>If the community founders are Christians or Jewish, and perhaps also if they are Muslim, or indeed of various other confessions (Baha'i?), the question "Is religious contemplation at the centre of their communal life?" can be phrased a little more tightly: "Is prayer at the centre?" <br><br>A few weeks ago, JMG offered some religious art, in connection with the concept of ascension. I would today like also to cite some art. Following the 2006 book <i>Sister Wendy on Prayer</i>, I suggest that the essence of religious contemplation, and therefore the essence of the monastic, is captured by Albert Herbert's 1991 painting <i>The Mountain</i> (easily found through Google Images). <br><br>Here we see a stylized, childlike Moses close to, but not quite at, the summit of a mountain at the base of which are other people and a few beasts. <br><br>Sr Wendy Beckett writes: "He [the stylized Moses] is terrifyingly high, planted as solidly as he can manage, with feet set apart and body tense with desire. He has reached this height by ways we cannot fathom - the mountain is precipitous, right-angled in its rejection of the easy ascent, and we realize that Moses has clambered to the meeting place with immense difficulty. No wonder he is stripped to his shirt, and his face is dark with fatigue. /.../ It is a beautiful mountain, alive with so much color and fascination, yet Moses has to labor on through it all, leaving everything behind, if he is to be present before his God. /.../ Herbert takes such loving artistic pains to show us the sweetness of the innocent and material world that we cannot but feel that Moses, too, related tenderly to it. But nothing can go up with him except his bare self. Humbly, he does not press on to the uppermost peak, but stops on a convenient plateau, where God can address him and he can listen. /.../ Mystic after mystic has written of this solitary ascent and the need to labor along the way, the need to strip the heart of all that is a distraction..." <br><br><br><br>Sincerely, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br>Catholic layman near Toronto, Canada<br><br><a href=http://www.metascientia.com rel=nofollow>www punkt metascientia punkt com</a><br><br><a href=#c6797845472197290058 title="comment permalink">10/24/13, 5:25 PM</a><br><br>

It is likely for this reason that monasticism, in the West and even in (e.g.) Bangkok, tends to prescribe celibacy. <br><br>(2) The labour of religious contemplation is immense, all-consuming, exhausting, unending, like research mathematics. Some attempt it, whether from choice or from harsh necessity, as hermits. Benedict of Nursia is probably right, however, in remarking that the religious work becomes easier when attempted within the supporting liturgical and material structures of a monastic community. <br><br>(3) The specific modes of religious contemplation developed in Christianity, and perhaps in other modes of theological contemplation also, find prayer to be most authentic when incarnated in a life rule that incorporates physical labour. Such labour is performed in a love which seeks to benefit also the world outside the monastery walls. <br><br>A modern expression of the connection with prayer and manual labour was in the medical (village-clinic) outreach of the martyred Trappists at Tibhirine, in 1990s Algeria, as documented in the film <i>Gods and Men</i>. <br><br>The same idea is expressed in the ministries of ecological remediation exercised at the formerly Byzantine monastery of Deir Mar Musa al-Habashi near Damascus (in recent years a centre of Christian-Muslim dialogue), under its now-abducted Jesuit refurbisher Fr Paolo Dall'Oglio. <br><br>(3) The authenticity of the Shaker charism emerges from the Sabbathday Lake site, <a href=http://www.shaker.lib.me.us/ rel=nofollow>http://www.shaker.lib.me.us/</a>. Here is prayer made incarnate through, among other things, a humble, home-improving, tradition in the making of furniture.<br><br>(4) If we promote monasticism with the objective of conserving elements of civilization, we forsake the contemplation-centred purity of the monastic vocation. If, on the other hand, we pursue the vocation for its proper purpose, making the religious contemplation central, we may find that as a byproduct we also are succeeding in some tasks of cultural conservation. It is a bit like happiness: aim for it directly, and you sully the soul, perhaps even becoming outright unhappy; aim, on the other hand, for love of God (including love of neighbour, as an incarnation of love for God) and the happiness supervenes, unsought and almost unexpectedly. <br> <br>(5) It may be the Dmitry Orlov's new blog posting "The Sixth Stage of Collapse" is right in portraying humanity as dying. In that case, monasticism still has a role, as the terminal-care physician has a role in the hospice. The role of monasticism in this contingency will be to help humanity die worthily and in dignity, in a Tibhirine condition of moral clarity. <br><br> <br><br>Sincerely, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br>Catholic layman near Toronto, Canada<br><br><a href=http://www.metascientia.com rel=nofollow>www punkt metascientia punkt com</a> <br><br><br><br><a href=#c2211688577222885272 title="comment permalink">10/24/13, 5:26 PM</a><br><br>

The fuel rods have several years since been removed from cooling pools into cold, dry storage and are awaiting removal. Maine/Central Maine Power successfully sued the US government for not removing them per contractual agreement, and received a large chunk of change which is being paid back to CMP users through lower electricity costs, IIRC. In the meantime, according to a local co-worker of mine, the Wiscassett high school has at least one cancer patient in every class. I've seen a couple in the hospital lab where we work. If Yucca Mountain opens, or if they decide to go for storage under the salt lakes area (I vaguely remember reading a couple years back that would be a safe area), then the rods will eventually be removed. Otherwise, at least at this point they do not present the sort of danger that an active nuclear plant, not to mention Fukushima, does. Finally, the last time I was in Wiscassett, I noticed the dome had disappeared.

With regard to your anger, though, my question is this: what are you going to do with it? Anger, once it passes through the filter of reflection and self-knowledge, can become a powerful motivating force for constructive change; it can also be left to fester, or get vented in useless displays of indignation. Which will you choose -- and if you choose the way of change, what are you going to do about it all? <br><br>Travis, in that case you'll have to discuss the matter with somebody who knows the fine details of nuclear engineering. <br><br>Moshe, that's classic Shaker behavior, and an example of one of the things I find very appealing in the United Society. <br><br>Cathy, anybody's guess at this point. I don't know that anybody can predict in advance which religion will seize the collective imagination of the next few centuries -- how many Romans would have thought that Christianity would still be around in a century or two? <br><br>Toomas, that's a valid point. I'm not promoting monasticism as a tool for preserving science and culture; I'm noting that this is one of the things monasticism often does, and that monasticism itself is a common response to the conditions of decline and fall, partly because it's relevant to a broad view of history and partly to encourage people who are daydreaming about ecovillages to take the time to think through the implications of what they're imagining. <br><br>Trog, next time you see any sign of asceticism and religious faith among gamers, please do let me know. <br><br>Matt, exactly. What the Shakers had and Brook Farm lacked was discipline, and without that, a communal enterprise is pretty much guaranteed to crash and burn. <br><br>Ventriloquist, rights are the result of agreements among people, and nothing more; they don't exist somewhere off there in an eternal realm, you know. What gives bankers, et al., the right to profit off other people is the same thing that gives you the right to own property or run a business, that is, the collective agreements among people that structure how we hold and exchange wealth. If you dislike those agreements, they can be changed -- but if you want to change them, you have a lot of hard work ahead of you. <br><br>Xhmko, that's good. <br><br>Mary, thanks for the clarification.

As a result, the degree to which we are exposed to titillation on a daily basis is, like so many things nowadays, amplified by the drives of the petro-powered economy. If you are plugged into the urban environment, there is no escape. If you watch television, follow pop music, and take in mainstream movies you expose yourself further to the idea that you’re just not gettin’ enough, no matter how much you’re getting’. How immune to these notions comes down to psychological fortitude and personal (religious?) discipline. It can be challenging to separate one’s natural desires and biological needs from artificially stimulated sexuality. Kids especially are terribly vulnerable to these pressures.<br>I don’t know if what you’re getting at is motivated by a perceived need to address such matters, but the need is clearly there for those who care to perceive it. The most obvious benefit, I’d say, is that of not being distracted from the more significant narratives of our times (such as peak oil). Of course sex is just one of the tools in the toolkit that service the spectacle of distraction. Anyone committed to business as usual, and especially those who profit greatly from mass participation in it, will embrace whatever gimmicks and sideshows that are at their disposal, including the most obvious trance-inducing one we know…<br>So clearly, as you point out, there are advantages to divesting from a sex-obsessed, distracted society and shifting the collective focus away from particular ego-centric habits that go with it. But getting from “here to there” so to speak, is a huge challenge. Where is the incentive for the average citizen? And where are the religious institutions that have the wherewithal to embrace and nourish the monastic traditions and update them with the needs of the post-industrial, but otherwise modern mindset? Or are we talking about something for a truly select few?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c4250298495933554093 title="comment permalink">10/24/13, 8:30 PM</a><br><br>

If not, what forms might sexuality take?<br><br>Matthew and Brazenraddish: in an earlier comment, I mentioned an interview with Wendell Berry. If getting land (or living on the land you have) is a concern, I recommend Berry's essay "People, Land, and Community" in his book "Standing by Words". Here's a teaser:<br><br>Berry draws parallels between marriage and farming:<br> "I have talked of marriage as a way of talking about farming because marriage, as a human artifact, has been more carefully understood than farming. The analogy between them is so close, for one thing, because they join us to time in nearly the same way." <br><br>He says of both:<br>"I take it as an axiom that one cannot know enough to get married, any more than one can predict a surprise. The only people who possess information sufficient to their vows are widows and widowers." "Marriage is ... a not entirely possible solution to a not entirely soluble problem. ... We can commit ourselves to anything -- a place, a discipline, a life's work, a community, a faith, a friend -- only in the same poverty of knowledge, the same ignorance of result, the same self-subordination, the same final forsaking of other possibilities."<br>"But our decisions can also be informed -- our loves both limited and strengthened -- by those patterns of value and restraint, principle and expectation, memory, familiarity, and understanding that, inwardly, add up to <i>character</i> and, outwardly, to <i>culture</i>."<br>"These patterns constitute a knowledge far different from the kind I have been talking about. ... Indeed, if we study the paramount documents of our culture, we will see that this second kind of knowledge invariably implies, and often imposes, limits on the first kind: some possibilities must not be explored, some things must not be learned."<br><br>From here, he begins to talk about time as relevant to serious, life-work enterprises like a committed marriage, or a commitment to lifelong farming of a plot of land. "During the last seventeen years, for example, I have been working at the restoration of a once exhausted hillside. Its scars are now healed over, though still visible, and this year it has provided abundant pasture, more than in any year since we have owned it. But to make it as good as it is now has taken seventeen years. It can be better than it now is, but that will take longer. For it to live fully in its own possibility, as it did before bad use ran it down, may take hundreds of years."<br><br>By the way, the phrase "the shape of time" kept running through my head as I read his essays; in a rather different sense than in John Michael's earlier posts. I hope to have more to say about this later.<br><br><a href=#c8542938324551246760 title="comment permalink">10/24/13, 10:00 PM</a><br><br>

It sprouted from the last paragraph of the post and probably also from the fact that I live in a rural part of France that went through the Middle Ages under the quite stable model of one medium size town, its net of small villages and farm, and several monasteries. <br><br>While I haven't researched the matter thoroughly, I would at least suggest that small pre-industrial villages are as long lived community models as monasteries. Yet, my point here is not to start a fight between these two community models along the secular/regular binary. On the contrary, I would suggest that the two models are, in fact, symbiotic. <br>If I look at the cistercian monasteries that existed around where I live, they needed the surrounding villages for commerce and for a supply of new members (since we abandoned mitosis, members of celibate orders don't reproduce). It can be (at least to me) a bit more challenging to understand why the villages around needed the monasteries. <br>I have started to think that in addition to the secular benefits like the occasional tending to the orphans and sicks, some technical prowess here and there, and the consistent biassing of the literacy average towards a larger value, monasteries didn't also play the spiritual role that bones play in our body. It would be hard to argue that religion was not a fundamental part of people lives in the Middle Ages. In that context I don't find it all that challenging to see how monasteries could provide a spiritual "North" that would remain fixed even when the more regular parts of the clergy strayed a bit. I would even argue that this point is supported by the consistent re-emergence of poor orders when the older ones tended towards more complacent ways. <br> <br>On a very secular level, I also got thinking about monasteries as an implicit birth control mean. It takes away the loaded problem of telling people how many children they could have, leaving the procreative powers to play their role unhindered. It then redirects the outcome in ways that seem very profitable to all in the end. And all this happening by itself, based on peoples inner callings, instead of by the force of law. Of course that would need much research and work to get further than the nice little narrative stage. <br><br> <br>Seb<br><br><a href=#c4649412004603734453 title="comment permalink">10/25/13, 1:41 AM</a><br><br>

Sex, or to be precise, the control of sex, is key to allowing large groups of people (larger than the clan of 60 or 70 individuals and approaching the village of about 150-200) to work together somewhat smoothly. Unfortunately, the best way to control sex is to control women. So many social rules dictate who we can have sex with and when, with established rituals for brides, a virgin’s purity, separation of the sexes, penalties and ostracizing for offenders, etc. And, of course, there are lots of hypocritical exceptions and ingenious ways to cheat. It appears that advanced civilization requires quarantining sex in a box of specially designed rules or eliminating it altogether. I wrote an essay about the restrictive rules required by societies. Please see http://philosopherspeashooter.blogspot.com/2011/05/well-governed-sharks.html.<br><br>Concerning drug lords as protectors of their tenants the way feudal lords were, I’m reminded of the God Father, who was the Don of his territory which ran on the exchange of favors. I’ve often thought that Roman Senators were just Mafia Dons that agreed to meet and negotiate running the patchwork of clans that actually made up the empire. This might be why all politics are local. People can’t identify with anything larger than their clan or village. What made the Senator/Dons legitimate or not was simply a matter of how you define ‘legitimate.’ A legal empire, like Rome, has a legal Senate. Take away the legality and you have territorial power lords (power, through the business of drugs, prostitution, smuggling, etc.) but with an honor code within.) Sometimes the best strategy is to cooperate with the adjoining village, sometimes it is to rob from them. Either way, take care of your own.<br><br>Jon.<br><br><a href=#c7312747691106223905 title="comment permalink">10/25/13, 8:21 AM</a><br><br>

She said that when an orphan reached adulthood, the Shakers would offer a choice: become a Shaker yourself and join the community, or go back to the world. In the later case, the Shakers would finance your return to the world and be available for help, advice and counsel as you made the transition to your new life.

A common sense which is practical, pragmatic, and above all sensible. Grounded in what is both possible and appropriate for the situation.<br><br>While you may see monasteries practicing GW skills, which are really just appropriate tech and sustainability, I for one hope the culture of GW never adopts the mind set of the librarian who is the guardian of knowledge we all associate with monks studying their books, but instead embraces the idea that its something to be share.<br><br>So while the Green Wizard Community many years from now will no doubt evolve their secret handshakes:<br><br>"Nice garden you have, are you a friend of the Archdruid?"<br><br>And their rituals:<br><br>"Let us now share on the Winter Solstice a bowl of Stone Soup..."<br><br>And their traditions:<br><br>"We sit down now in this circle of seats around this open fire to discuss today's problems, in hope we can find common ground in which all can grow..."<br><br>I hope it never becomes a religious profession.<br><br>BTW Symbology is powerful magic and there's a good reason I choose "circles" for the different areas of GW skills.<br><br>Mazes are often circular, yet the GW maze of knowledge would have a clear path that walks straight to the center as well as meandering pathways around the boundaries of each set of skills.<br><br>But more over, like King Arthur's choose of a round table for his knights, a circle brings equality.

There are too many uncertainties in those systems for my liking.<br><br>I haven't read the comments yet, but the - well advertised, I’m sure - policy of monasteries being celibate was a successful strategy because it simply takes a whole lot of resources to raise a child.

The integration of ‘social norms’ with practical life and its necessary technologies has often been accompanied by ‘monastic’ arrangements across cultures and religions. Something fundamental seems to keep them fired-up!<br><br>I have been keeping an eye open for practical historical agricultural and social arrangements suited to more austere conditions. It must be more than 30 years ago that I went to a lecture sponsored I think by Scotland’s Association for Mental Health. The lecture was about “<i>Mental Health in Ladakh</i>”. Ladakh seemed to have better mental health than our western societies.<br><br>Later I came across a useful set of geographical studies of traditional Ladakh in one book (see below). Tibetan Monasteries on the central plateau had been huge and dominated their agrarian populations, much as the great Abbey of Tours took a hub position in Europe emerging from the post-Roman Dark Ages. In the feudal governance of Europe, subsistence farming became legally bonded to the land (apparently there were 20,000 serfs at Tours forming the monastic estate). In Ladakh a more ‘horizontal’ form was integrated with village and family life, and it has to be said with ‘breeding strategies’ relevant to the constrained agricultural land area.<br> <br>I wrote the following as part of a comment on another forum in 2012.<br><br> "... Rather than the more grand ‘civilizations’, for the longer term I look for knowledge from agrarian systems and cultures, which successfully adapted to long term to meagre conditions without [incurring] gross population overload and without benefit of modern industrially based methods. The Buddhist villages of the Himalayas are just one example. I can just imagine perhaps some of John Michael Greer’s science/eco-tech ‘monasticism’ grafted on to the dual village/monastery systems used in that Buddhist culture.

If somebody requests, I will go and search in local library.<br>A monk/sanyasi is not allowed to stay more than 3 days in a place, strict rules for asking alms.Shankarcharya improved the rules in 11 th century and they are final.<br>In budhhism,gautam buddha wrote rules for his bhikhu sangha.They still exist. Although Buddhist monasteries disappeared from India due to Muslim invasions some Tibetan monasteries still exist. I met few of Indian Buddhist monks while traveling.<br>The Jain monks are slightly different. Unmarried celibate Jain monks are voluntarily supported by other married -rich Jain disciples. A man /women can become monk after raising children, marrying them off and renouncing wealth.<br>The Muslim monks/Sufis were supported by Muslim king and other rich people. The surrounding Muslim populace also offered alms to Muslim monks/sufis. Although, meeting Sufis is getting difficult now a days.<br>One can still get glimpse of Buddhist, Hindu, Jain monks in India.<br>The existence of these monasteries strongly depended on nature of economy/king.<br>A monastery also existed to fulfill one purpose which people seem to forget here. The early Greek-Christian monks were devoted to their religion.<br>Buddhist monks reflected on ashaswat /temporary nature of universe and tried to free of it by achieving nibbana.<br>The hindu sanyasi focused on understanding nature of universe and were more successful philosophically. Some philosophies like vedanta,upnishads,sankhya,yog,advaita arose out of their contemplation. The monks were also excellent astrologers, scientists, doctors, consultants.<br>A lot have been discussed of celibacy over here. Our texts say celibacy is to be ordered by guru/master to disciple only when he is ready. It can never be forced. Only when a devotee is tired of sex, he will gladly accept celibacy. Again main question is not celibacy but desire itself. Many gurus sent back their disciples to get married after finding their craving for sex.<br>As far as Buddha is concerned, he was strictly against allowing women monks in his bhikhu sangha.He was traditionalist in that sense. While Mahavir allowed women to become sanyasi even in younger age.I still see many women Jain monks in India.The earlier religions were more concerned about children.

How is it related to failing political and economic modes of organization, and the usefulness of religion as a mode of organizing human activity? Is it simply to discuss what hasn't worked as a preliminary to a discussion of what might work?<br><br>I think the communal vision is pretty basic in the human psyche, a kind of racial memory or Jungian archetype that won't go away based on reason. It does explain the popularity of movies like Fiddler on the Roof and LOTR (and the books of Tolkien). But it doesn't have to manifest as a commune. It could also manifest as a rural, craft based village or monastery. People (and the natural world) who are connected economically through local production and consumption of goods and services (instead of through the intermediate of a global industrial or other imperial variants economy) may have more of that communal need met, and it also synergizes with religious and social needs.<br><br>I am going to play fiddle at the local farmers' market now, though my hands hurt from moving dirt yesterday. Here's to hard physical labor, meticulous craft labor, scholarship and music/dance! I do think we can have it all, at the expense of some comfort and privilege (many of my friends make a living from the mere fact of owning housing, i.e. landlording).

Yes! I feel a lightbulb happening. ... A thought occurs: You have already introduced Darwin to the discussion; maybe he and his scions can help shed some light on it! I'm not sure I can do much more than you have above. But consider: While the monastic life is about shared property and the like, from an evolutionary perspective, what is a finer currency than surety of mating and good conditions for child-rearing, etc. Sex is serious wealth! Evolutionary analysis often devolves (ironically) into just-so-stories, a pattern which I feel compelled to follow here, for lack of data: Imagine being a felllow or gal unable to find a mate in an otherwise egalitarian society. Why is that? Well, perhaps your face is overly asymmetrical, or you have a difficult odor or something: In short, you are sensed not to carry adaptive genes. Perhaps in another sort of society, you could bring to be bear certain resources which would tend to rebalance the evolutionary calculus in your favor, despite offering a fairly defective package as your half of the bargain. That is, further material resources might aid in creating a scenario for prospective mates in which 50% of their genes are assured of being carried forward to the next generation, albeit paired with a kind of crapshoot for the other half of the genotype. It may be adaptive to make this sort of bet, you see, instead of sticking with the genetically superior but by some unlucky circumstance materially less-endowed partner. On a behavioral level, this may be manifested as a sense of anxiety on the part of those who sense that the game has been tipped out of their favor. Now, how in the world monastic conditions which include celibacy can come into being from an evolutionary perspective is another question. Probably, it would inevitably have to be viewed as an evolutionary accident, unless some sort of systematic cheating also exists. Well, perhaps there could be adaptive reasons for it. But it is not so very obvious. A just-so-story would fail to satisfy, there, and so I am placed out of my abilities.<br><br><a href=#c8999796192092973583 title="comment permalink">10/26/13, 7:35 PM</a><br><br>

You've given them one long term answer, but they have not been trained to think that far into the future? I could be wrong, but that is what I'm seeing.<br><br>People also seem to miss the point of finite resources over a number of consecutive generations. A farm succession within a large and growing family over a number of generations is clearly unsustainable, but a good example of the predicament. It may help some people to think of it in those terms. How do you divide up the family farm, and what is then left?<br><br>The Chinese have a saying that wealth rarely lasts three generations!<br><br>Also, I don't suspect that some of the commenters have ever known serious hunger.

If the authors had written this book in the middle of this century instead of in the early 1990s the attitude would have been different. They remark the growing lack of wood and higher prices of it for making needed steel, salt, glass production, etc. as motivating in finally using "stinking coal" in greater amounts. Of course to get down to the depths where it was at they needed to pump out water and all the tricks they used were not enough so the development of the steam engine <br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Savery<br><br><br>was the bassis innovation which allowed the industrial revolution but all the basic nneeds and the mentality of work division and our whole culture had developed by then so that monastic dependence was long since over. <br><br>What sort of collapse can bring us back to such a state of dependence on monstic life for redevelopment of society? Communes are hobby things when unserious but otherwise potentially important technological and cultural motors for renewal of our society as the cistericans were or the shakers.

Kibbutzniks were ideological and their collectivist arrangements were founded upon socialism as a secular religion. The loss of interest in communal child rearing and the dependence on hired labor on the kibbutz arose in the context of an expanding Israeli economy after the Six Day War. <br><br>The kibbutz I visited in 1971, before the social and economic outcomes of the Six Day War had taken hold, still had communal meals and child rearing and used no hired labor. (In 1971, the mayor of Jerusalem was a liberal and a bareheaded young woman in blue jeans could walk right up to the Western Wall and be bothered by nobody.) <br><br>The current conditions don't tell us how kibbutzim or moshavim will fare in a contracting low fossil fuel economy.<br><br>The economy of the State of Israel was once dependent on handicrafts, agricultural exports (still important) and donations from abroad but now it is knowledge based, exporting software, pharmaceuticals, armaments and medical research. <br><br>I don't know anything about contemporary moshav cooperative farms. Moshavim were developed by a different group of Jews and always allowed a good deal of familial autonomy. My guess is that they joined together for the practical reasons of mutual defense and pooling resources.<br><br>I would also like to observe that although Judaism has had various traditions of holy men and mystics, starting with the Biblical Nazarites, it only had one brief foray into monasticism during the Roman period. Mainstream Rabbinic Judaism opposes celibacy. Possibly this attitude came about when the Jews and Christians were separating from each other with a good deal of mutual animus. The Jews have managed to hold together their culture in many circumstances, some of them very adverse, without any asexual intentional communities separated from ordinary family life. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c8156069386183985200 title="comment permalink">10/27/13, 12:20 PM</a><br><br>

I think they are not merely necessary, but rather a inherent part of the monastic system. <br>While I don't really wish to produce a Marxist reduction of everything to economics, if you will permit a morphological comparison, I think that, in pre-industrial times, the monastery, and also the baronial manor house, functioned with respect to the wider world in the same way as an industrial factory. <br>The difference is that, where the factory produces material goods for sale and the baronial estate produced agricultural products or raw materials (e.g. a stone quarry or wood from a forest) to trade with the wider world. Monasteries are manufacturing spirituality for sale to pilgrims and devotees seeking salvation (or at least buying absolution for their sins.) That is what kept the monasteries in business for a thousand years, because the wealthy paid the monks to pray for on their behalf. From what little I know of Tibetan Buddhism, that was true of their monasteries, too. As well many monasteries were also landlords and gained wealth just like any other landlord, from lands willed to them.<br>Just as a factory requires a town to provide its workers with the necessities of life, so the lay community that grows up around a monastery to provide the necessities for the monks that they cannot produce for themselves. The monks may have had artisans in their ranks, but that was not their primary function and no monastery could provide for every need and had to have some relationship with the outside world.<br><br><a href=#c6980770456213216721 title="comment permalink">10/28/13, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

(Yes, there is a complex story there with multiple spiritual dimensions, and any number of potential sidetracks, including why the BoC's calling includes such a project in an affluent region of the United States. But I don't want to post a book just now.) Their order was founded in the early nineteenth century rather than in the near aftermath of the fall of Rome, and their lifestyle is organized around service in the world rather than the more cloistered situation this discussion has generally focused on. But nonetheless they are a religious order under Catholic auspices who have taken lifelong vows of obedience, poverty, and celibacy. So, because there's been some curiosity and speculation about it here, I'll ask them at the next suitable opportunity how they see the vow of celibacy as strengthening their organization.<br><br>In the meantime, here's what <a href=http://www.brothersofcharity.org/ rel=nofollow>their own web site</a> says about it: "Observance of the vows of obedience, poverty and chastity may not seem the best way to live a life of pleasure. It has a profundity that often is ignored due to a great many misunderstandings on this subject. Like the marital vows, the religious vows are only means to an end. They enable the person who takes them to reach a higher goal. The <b>three most common vows: poverty, chastity, and obedience allow us to serve a great number of people.</b> Thanks to those vows, we are free to accept a special commitment in the world. We are not subject to the desire to accumulate material wealth, we attach less importance to family and other intimate bonds, and we have no particular tendency to defending our own interests tooth and nail. We represent a counterbalance in this world where far too often the emphasis is on money, sex, and power. The vows remind mankind that the false gods that they sometimes adore are mere ersatz for the love of God, who constantly appeals to man to live his vocation to the full." (Emphasis in original.)<br><br>So the reason they offer publicly, not surprisingly, is that the vows increase their ability to focus on their calling to service. A further link between the vows and organizational resilience is not quite explicitly stated, but as I read it, it's there between the lines.<br><br><a href=#c6764086347164162759 title="comment permalink">10/28/13, 10:14 AM</a><br><br>

(If one has read, for just one example, the Hare Krishna commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita, one of the biggest concerns is "unwanted children"). Mostly, these problems have been avoided because of the big resource bonanza. Actually, I think what JMG is getting at is that celibate communities are part of the norm; and this era is the exception that proves the rule.<br><br>A hypothesis is that celibate communities will tend to pop up in over-populated areas. The Shakers count: American colonists were fleeing the over-crowding in Europe. Coming out of Roman rubble, the Catholic monastic communities preserved knowledge, served an ecumenical (uniting) and pedagogical (teaching) function, as well as slowing the up-and-down problems of run-away human population growth and the following disease and famine. The main point being really, at just about any stage in the process, controlling population growth is as important to a surviving species as population growth itself. <br><br>E.O. Wilson, the famed evolutionary biologist, is noted for suggesting that certain behaviors that appear maladaptive such as homosexuality, asexuality and the like, are actually adaptive for NOT contributing to population growth.<br><br>Celibacy, which appears as a maladaptive behavior looked at from the narrow perspective that any species should grow as much as possible all the time, actually helps for the health and stability of the species. <br><br>Further, celibacy functions even better when coupled with religious and pedagogical functions. The Catholic Church has been among the strongest educational forces in our Western society going back centuries. Education is at the heart of the Scholastic mission (as Spengler suggests, the Scholastics are the beginning of the Western civilization, and we are at its end.) Education is done better by the celibate because they have fewer other commitments and responsibilities. The life/work balance is really: life=work. I have many teacher friends who struggle to care for their own kids and other people's kids. Not so for a monk, priest or nun.<br><br>This line of thought drew some reflections on the problem of clergy members abusing children. Nowadays, in an age of abundant energy, much of the really gut-level, visceral need for a commitment to celibacy is lost and it becomes rather just rationalistic, but the formal traditions are preserved in the Catholic Church. I would suggest that the monastic and clerical role in the Catholic Church has been used as a safe harbor for the socially dysfunctional. Often, many of these individuals were abused themselves; and then, knowing nothing else, turned to the same kind of abuse. I would go further that in an age of resource decline, such problems would probably... just not be tolerated at all. Clemency is a luxury of the well-off.<br><br>Lastly, to give the celibate life a religious dimension is natural and pretty much inevitable, as people will want to understand their role in connection to the larger community and larger process. But putting it in such rational terms is like an undressed mannequin. To open up this comment thread, Shakya Indrajala concluded: "...I've never met a monk or nun who reported being depressed or suicidal. Life is simple, but rewarding." It's not for everyone, but it takes all kinds.<br><br><a href=#c5003215898388270867 title="comment permalink">10/28/13, 2:35 PM</a><br><br>

You are not going to get a critical mass by piling an handful of rods together in the air. Now, of course as it is the spent fuel pools are generally overcrowded and if you were to simply walk away from them there would indeed be BIG trouble and fast. But provided the plant has been shut down for a few years and the fuel has moved beyond the need for active cooling then in a pinch even rudimentary dispersal and disposal will do. No, it won't be pretty, it won't be optimal, it will not do anything for all that irradiated steel left in the plant etc. but survivable in the big picture, yes. It depends of course on how the decline will play out but provided people don't lose their heads and basic measures are implemented it should be possible to prevent most of them from turning into Fukushima.As it is the trend in the West is shutting them down and not replacing them, so we are kinda getting there in a roundabout way. <br><br><br><br><a href=#c2595338310596045289 title="comment permalink">10/29/13, 1:32 PM</a><br><br>

My family of four is currently in our second co-housing/co-farming relationship, and we certainly have some stories to add to that conversation.<br><br>Actually, just this morning I submitted our 60-day notice to vacate the farm and house we're in right now (and we haven't been here very long). With winter coming on, and a tiny and homely wall tent on the receiving end of that departure, one could probably guess how frustrated we are with the current situation. MY WIFE is actually excited to be moving back into our tent! Now you know something's wrong.<br><br>In addition to the concerns you laid out in your blog post, I might consider radical income disparity to be an issue. So far we've teamed up with wealthy benefactors who wanted us on their team for our skill set, but it's fairly difficult to feel like an equal partner when the ones with all the money seem to be making all the decisions. And there's never as much room for compromise as I feel like there should be, especially since I'm there mostly for my ideas, not my resources.<br><br>JMG talks about the transition to an ecotechnic future requiring many generations to really get a hold of, suggesting that we early technics might not really even understand what a sustainable technic society might look like, much less how to build one. I might also tender the idea that tight, integrated, communal living could be something largely beyond our current skill set at this point in technic history. We haven't EVER had to utilize K-selected strategies, really, more than temporarily anyway, in our culture's history, so why should we know how to utilize them now?<br><br>We can learn those strategies, very slowly, and that has indeed been my experience over the last 5 years, but I keep coming up short on the skill set required to live a more cooperative existence. Maybe my children will be better at it. Or their children.<br><br>But at this point, my vote is for private property ownership in a neighborhood and larger community that would really LIKE to work together, support local businesses, build their own houses, grow their own food, make their own wine, and take charge of their collective destiny, but not be absolutely REQUIRED to do so.<br><br>This whole transition is painfully slow - probably excruciatingly slow for the rapid collapse types like a lot of Kunstler's clan - especially for people who are used to a fast-paced world, but it seems that that's the only way it's going to happen. Making slow, incremental changes in our lives seems to be the only way anything ever sticks. And I'm just not ready for communal life.

I think it was the whole christian narrative. Why did we (gruesomely) kill our god? Why would he forgive us after something like that? He LOVES us, but allows the devil to exist, blah, blah, blah... <br>More importantly, and more on-topic, is that it took a different narrative, or perhaps a different "religious sensibility", to get me to realize the problems inherent to a strictly rationalist approach to life. And it was this more nature-centered narrative, not denying objective fact, but allowing for the subtle nuances of consciousness to blend with everyday reality, that eventually "flipped" me. <br>That said, I still distrust how people will use another's sincerely held belief as a stepping stone to power, and how willingly believers can be utilized as a tool for political power plays and other unsavory behaviors.

They are located on an 80 acre parcel which is owned communally by the Sowing Circle (http://oaec.org/sowing-circle-intentional-community), which is the community organization which exists within OAEC.<br><br>The relationship between the organizations is complex (and there are lots and lots and lots of meetings, I am told) but basically, the core of the Sowing Circle is also the core staff of OAEC, but there are SC members who do not live on the land, and there are OAEC employees who do live there but are not SC members.<br><br>The community is interesting because they practice communal ownership of the land and buildings, but otherwise have personal property, sexual freedom (as far as I can see) and a great degree of personal autonomy. (And example of the last item: all communal meals are vegetarian, but some of the residents are not, and are free to go offsite or cook meat at home, and there seems to be no negativity associated with that choice.<br>Note that the residents do maintain private homes. I'm not sure what the ownership arrangement is exactly, though.<br><br>From what I have seen (three weeks total as a resident while taking classes) they do not practice a middle class lifestyle, but they definitely enjoy a middle class standard of living.<br><br>This community has been around for nearly two decades and appears to be stable and prosperous.<br><br>Now the key to all of this might be that they make a good deal of money by running classes and holding plant sales, which allows them to maintain a middle class standard of living. They are not by any means self-sufficient, nor do they attempt to be. (Although if the hammer comes down, I'll bet they will do pretty well for themselves.)<br><br>On the other hand, the Shakers and many others communities also practice this, selling furniture, farm goods, and crafts. So I don't see this making OAEC/SC unique in any way.<br><br>Probably the most unique thing about them are the people. I do not know all of the SC members, but the ones that I do know are some of the most extraordinary people I have ever met, bar none. Maybe this is why they are able to keep the community going without a lot of arbitrary (but apparently important, per the historical record) rules. They are all very smart people who are deeply committed to their community and are willing to spend lots of time in meetings to make it all work.<br><br>I really don't know what their secret is. But in my mind they stand as a clear counterexample to the failure patterns you describe. Apparently it is possible to make this work without monasticism - though granted, it's may not be likely under most conditions.<br><br><a href=#c3141718977911364434 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 2:07 PM</a><br><br>
