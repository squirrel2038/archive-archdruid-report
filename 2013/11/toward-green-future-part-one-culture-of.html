To understand the predicament of industrial civilization, it’s not enough to grasp the outward shape of the crisis of our time: the looting of a finite planet’s stock of resources, the destabilization of the global climate, the breathtaking cluelessness with which politicians, pundits, and ordinary citizens alike insist that the only way we can get out of this mess involves doing even more of the same things that got us into it in the first place, and the rest of it. Follow the roots of our predicament down into the soil that feeds them, and you’ll find yourself in a murky realm of unspoken narratives and unacknowledged desires—the “mind-forg’d manacles,” as Blake called them, that keep most of us shackled in place as the great rumbling vehicle of global industrial society accelerates down the slope of its decline and fall.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the last seven months, I’ve tried to open up the obscurities of that subterranean realm using the language of religion as a tool. This is <a href=../../2007/01/this-faith-in-progress_10.html>far from the first time</a> that I’ve discussed the religious dimension of our blind faith in perpetual progress in these essays, but it’s the first time I’ve done so at length, and the sheer intensity of the emotions roused on all sides of the discussion is to my mind a sign of just how important that dimension has become.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The distinction made in an earlier post <a href=../../2013/09/a-sense-of-homecoming.html>between religions and religious sensibilities</a> is crucial to making sense of all this. Most discussions of the interfaces between religion, ecology, and the future have missed this distinction, and focused either on specific religious traditions or on the vague abstraction of religion as a whole.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The resulting debates were not especially useful to anybody. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A classic example is the furore kickstarted by the 1967 publication of Lynn White’s famous essay “The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis.” White argued that the rise of Christianity to its dominant position in the religious life of the western world was an essential precondition for the environmental crisis of our time. The old polytheist religions of the west, in his analysis, saw nature as sacred, the abode of a galaxy of numinous powers that could not be ignored with impunity; Christianity, by contrast, brought with it an image of the world as a lifeless mass of matter, an artifact put there by God for the sole benefit of human beings during the relatively brief period between the creation of the world and the Second Coming, after which it would be replaced by a new and improved model.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By stripping nature of any inherent claim to human reverence, he suggested, Christianity made it easier for post-Christian western humanity to treat the earth as a lump of rock with no value beyond its use as a source of raw materials or a dumping ground for waste. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The debate that followed the appearance of White’s paper followed a trajectory many of my readers will find familiar. Partisans of White’s view defended it by digging up examples from history in which Christianity had been used to justify the abuse of nature, and had no trouble finding a bumper crop of instances. Opponents of White’s view attacked it by showing that the abuse of nature was not actually justified within a Christian worldview, and by and large they had no trouble finding a bumper crop of good theological grounds for their case. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, both were right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the one hand, there’s nothing in Christian theology that requires the abuse of nature, and a very strong case can be made, from within the context of Christian faith, for the preservation of the environment as an imperative duty. On the other, over the course of the last two thousand years, very few Christians anywhere have recognized that duty, and a great many have used (and continue to use) excuses drawn from their faith to justify their abuse of the environment. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Factor in the influence of religious sensibilities and the paradox evaporates. A religious sensibility, again, is not a religion; it’s the cultural substructure of perceptions, emotions and intuitions that shape the way religious traditions are understood and practiced within a given culture or a set of related cultures. The religious sensibility that shaped Christian attitudes toward nature, and of course a great many other things besides, wasn’t unique to Christianity in any sense; it had already emerged in the Mediterranean world long before Jesus of Nazareth was born, and only the fact that Christianity happened to come out on top in the bitter religious struggles of the late classical world and suppressed nearly all its rivals gave White’s condemnation as much plausibility as it had. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As I sit here at my desk, for instance, I’m looking at a copy of <i>On the Nature of the Universe</i> by Ocellus Lucanus, a philosophical treatise probably written in the second or third century before the Common Era. Ocellus, like many of the cutting-edge thinkers of his age, wanted to challenge the popular notion that the cosmos had a beginning and might therefore have an end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was part of a broader agenda—one that’s left significant traces in many contemporary currents of thought—that dismissed everything that came into being and passed away again as illusion, and tried to find a reality outside of the realm of time and change. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That commitment led to strange convictions. The fourth chapter of Ocellus’ treatise, for example, is devoted to proving that human beings ought to have sex. If, as Ocellus argues, the cosmos is eternal, it needs to remain perpetually stocked with its full complement of living things, and therefore human beings ought to keep on reproducing themselves—as long as they don’t enjoy the process, that is. Back of this distinctly odd argument lies the emergence, then under way, of that strain of thought we now call puritanism: the conviction that biological pleasures are always suspect, and can be permitted only when the actions that bring them also have some morally justifiable purpose. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the generations following Ocellus’ time, that sort of thinking became standard in intellectual circles across the Mediterranean world, in modes ranging from the reasonable to the arguably psychotic. For all their subsequent reputation, the Stoics were on the mellow end; most Stoic thinkers classed sex as “indifferent,” meaning that it had no moral character of its own and could be right or wrong depending on the circumstances surrounding it. (Stoics criticized adultery, not because it was sex, but because it was breaking a promise, which they found utterly abhorrent.) The spectrum ran all the way from there to religious cults that made castration a sacrament or considered reproduction the most horrible sin of all because it trapped more souls in the prison of the flesh. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was the religious sensibility of cutting-edge thinkers all through the world in which Christianity emerged, and since the new religion inevitably drew most of its early converts from people who were unsatisfied by the robust life-affirming traditional faiths the people of that time had inherited from their far from puritanical ancestors, it’s hardly a surprise that Christian teachings and institutions ended up absorbing a substantial helping of the attitudes that arose out of the rising religious sensibility of the time. Every human cultural phenomenon is complex, contested, and polyvalent, and the religious landscape of the western world is no exception to this rule; religious attitudes toward sex in that setting ranged all the way from the Free Spirit movement in late medieval Europe, which indulged in orgies as a sign that its members had returned to Eden, all the way to the Skoptsii of early modern Russia, who castrated themselves as a shortcut to perfect purity. Still, the average fell further toward the puritanical side of the scale than even so ascetic a pagan movement as the Stoics found reasonable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve used sex as an example here, partly because people perk up their ears whenever it’s mentioned and partly because it’s a good barometer of attitudes toward the biological side of human existence, but the same point can be traced much more broadly. White pointed to the sacred groves, outdoor worship, and ecological taboos of classical Mediterranean pagan religion, and contrasted this with the relative lack of veneration for natural ecosystems in Christianity. It’s certainly possible to point to counterexamples, from St. Francis of Assisi through the Anglican natural theology of the Bridgewater Treatises to the impressive efforts currently being made by Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople to establish<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>ecological consciousness throughout the Eastern Orthodox church; the fact remains that so far these have been the exception rather than the rule. Given the sensibility in which the Christian church came to maturity, it’s hard to see how things could have gone any other way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the theist religions of the west gave way to civil religions, in turn, the same patterns held. Once again, that wasn’t true in a monolithic sense, and the first great wave of civil religion to hit the western world—the nationalism of the 18th and 19th centuries—went the other way, embracing reverence for nature and the irrational dimensions of life as a counterpoise to the cosmopolitan rationalism of the age. That’s why the first verse of “America the Beautiful”—consider the title, to start with—is about the American land, not its human history or political pretensions. Still, the ease with which that thinking was dropped by the self-proclaimed patriots of today’s American pseudoconservatism shows how shallow its roots were in the collective consciousness of our civilization. Back in the Seventies, you would sometimes hear that first verse sung in a rather more edgy form: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<i>O ugly now for poisoned skies, for pesticided grain,</i></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<i>For strip-mined mountains’ travesty above the asphalt plain,</i></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<i>America! America! Man shed his waste on thee,</i></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<i>And milled the pines for billboard signs from sea to oily sea.</i></div>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Back in the day, that stung.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Sing it now, when it’s even more true than it was then, and the most common response you’ll get is blustering about jobs and the onward march of progress. Other ages have seen the same process at work: it’s when the balancing act among traditional narratives, mystical experience, and religious sensibility finally fails, and the theist religions of a civilization’s childhood and youth give way to the civil religions of its maturity and decay, that the underlying logic of its religious sensibility gets pushed to the logical extreme, and appears in its starkest form. In our case, that’s biophobia: the pervasive fear and hatred of biological existence that forms the usually unmentioned foundation for so much of contemporary culture. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Does that seem too strong a claim to you, dear reader? I encourage you to consider your own attitudes toward your own biological life, that normal and healthy process of ripening toward mortality in which you’re engaged right now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Life in that sense is not a nice clean abstract existence<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s a wet and sloppy reality of blood, mucus, urine, feces, and other sticky substances, proceeding all the way from the mess in which each of us is born to the mess in which most of us will die. It’s about change, growth and decay, and death—especially about death. Death isn’t the opposite of life, any more than birth is; it’s the natural completion and fulfillment of the process of being alive, and it’s something that people in a great many other cultures have been able to meet calmly, even joyfully, as a matter of course. Our terror of death is a good measure of our terror of life. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s an equally good measure of the complexity of religious sensibilities that some of the most cogent critiques of modern biophobia come from Christian writers. I’m thinking here especially of C.S. Lewis, who devoted the best of his adult novels—the space trilogy that includes <i>Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra</i>, and <i>That Hideous Strength</i>—to tracing out the implications of the religion of progress that was replacing Christianity in the Britain of his time. Into the mouths of the staff of the National Institute for Coordinated Experiments, the villains of the third book, Lewis put much of the twaddle about limitless progress being retailed by the scientists of his time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Why should we put up with having the earth infested with other living things? Why not make it a nice, clean, sterile planetary machine devoted entirely to the benefit of human beings—or, rather, that minority of human beings who are capable of rational cooperation in the grand cause of Man? Once we outgrow sentimental attachments to lower life forms, outdated quibbles about the moral treatment of other human beings, and suchlike pointless barriers to progress, nothing can stop our great leap outward to the stars! </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You don’t hear the gospel of progress preached in quite so unrelenting a form very often these days, but the implications are still there. Consider the gospel of the Singularity currently being preached by Ray Kurzweil and his followers. I’ve commented before that Kurzweil’s prophecy is the fundamentalist Christian myth of the Rapture dolled up unconvincingly in science fiction drag, but there’s one significant difference. According to every version of Christian theology I know of, the god who will be directing the final extravaganza is motivated by compassion and has detailed personal experience of life in the wet and sticky sense discussed above, while the hyperintelligent supercomputers that fill the same role in Kurzweil’s mythology lack these job qualifications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s thus not exactly encouraging that writers on the Singularity seem remarkably comfortable with the thought that these same supercomputers might decide to annihilate humanity instead of giving them the glorified robot bodies of the cyber-blessed in which Kurzweil puts his hope of salvation. It’s equally unencouraging when these same writers, or others of the same stripe, say that they don’t care if our species goes extinct so long as artificial intelligences of our making end up zooming across the cosmos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The same logic lies behind the insistence, quite common these days in certain circles, that our species can’t possibly remain “stuck on this rock”—the rock in question being the living Earth—and that somehow we can only thrive out there in the black and silent void. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m pretty sure that this is why the recent film
<i>Gravity</i> has fielded such a flurry of nitpicking from science writers. What believers in progress hate about <i>Gravity</i>, I suggest, is not that it takes modest liberties with the details of space science—show me a science fiction film that doesn’t do so—but that it doesn’t romanticize space. It reminds its audiences that space isn’t the Atlantic Ocean, the Wild West, or any of the other models of terrestrial discovery and colonization that proponents of space travel have tried to map onto it. Space, not death, is the antithesis of life:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>empty, silent, cold, limitless, and as sterile as hard vacuum and hard radiation can make it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Watching Sandra Bullock struggling to get back to the only place in the cosmos where human beings actually belong is a sharp reminder of exactly what lies behind all that handwaving about “New Worlds for Man.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Turn from the mythology of progress to the mythology of apocalypse, the Tweedledoom to Kurzweil’s Tweedledee, and you’re at least as likely to find biophobia, though these days it often takes an oddly sidelong form. Consider the passionate insistence, heard with great regularity on one end of the peak oil scene, that something or other is going to render life on Earth extinct sometime very soon—the usual date these days, now that 2012 has passed by without incident, is 2030. A while back, the favored cause of imminent extinction was runaway climate change; nuclear waste became popular after that, and most recently the death of the world’s oceans has become a common justification for the belief. None of these claims are backed by more than a tiny minority of scientific studies, but I can promise you that if you point this out, you will face angry accusations of pedaling “hopium.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The people who spread these claims very often make much of their love for the Earth, but I have to say I find that insistence a bit disingenuous. Imagine, dear reader, that one of your loved ones—let’s call her Aunt Eartha, after one of my favorite jazz singers—has been told by a doctor that she has inoperable terminal cancer. Being aware that misdiagnosis is epidemic in today’s American medical industry, she seeks a second opinion, and you go with her to the hospital. A few hours later, the doctor comes to meet you in the waiting room, and tells you that he has good news: the first doctor has made a mistake, and there’s every chance Aunt Eartha still has many healthy years ahead of her. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Would you be likely to respond to this by becoming furious with the doctor and insisting that he was peddling hopium? If the doctor proceeded to show you the test results in detail and demonstrate why Aunt Eartha was in better shape than you feared, would you then go on to insist that if she wasn’t about to die of cancer, she was bound to die soon from diabetes, and when the tests didn’t bear this out either, would you start insisting that she must have severe heart disease? And if you did so, would the doctor perhaps be justified in wondering just how deep your professed love for Aunt Eartha actually went? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, those who talk about hopium have a point; the popular faith-based response to the crisis of our time that relies on the sacred words “I’m sure they’ll think of something” is a drug of sorts. Still, it bears remembering that the opposite of a bad idea is usually another bad idea, and hopium isn’t the only drug on the market just now; another is the equally deliberate and equally faith-based cultivation of despair. By analogy, we may as well call this “despairoin;” just as opium can be purified of the natural phytochemicals that make it hallucinatory and refined into heroin, hopium can be stripped of the hallucinatory fantasies of a bright new future, refined into despairoin, and peddled to addicts on the mean streets of the industrial world’s collective imagination. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve suggested in the past that one of the things the paired myths of inevitable progress and inevitable apocalypse have in common is that both of them serve as excuses for inaction. Claim that progress is certain to save us all, or claim that some catastrophe or other is certain to doom us all, and either way you have a great justification for staying on the sofa and doing nothing. I’ve come to think, though, that the two mythologies share more in common than that. It’s true that both represent a refusal of what Joseph Campbell called the “call to adventure,” the still small voice summoning each of us to rise up in an age of crisis and decay to become the seedbearers of an age not yet born, but both mythologies also pretend to offer an escape from life, in the full, messy, intensely real sense I’ve suggested above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>

I wonder about reclaiming a child-life awareness that is otherwise rejected as "superstition" because its literal interpretation is debunkable. Carl Sagan wrote a book I admire called "A demon haunted world", I love one of his sensible conclusions: "Science has taught us that because we have a talent for deceiving ourselves, subjectivity may not freely reign." So that's very true, but it leaves open how subjectivity should reign, if not freely. <br><br>So I carefully accept Sagan's scientific caveat, I also stand with Carl Jung's equal warning "Primitive superstition lies just below the surface of even the most tough-minded individuals, and it is precisely those who most fight against it who are the first to succumb to its suggestive effects." So apparently objectivity can't freely reign either.<br><br>I like the Jungians willingness to recognize our fragmented nature, divided desires and contradictory needs, and see the ancient polytheism had advantages in recognizing our inherently divided for allegiances, and so you can have one god who loves war, and one who loves love, and they can be siblings, and both are in all of us, and they're never going to agree, and we take absolute sides between divided gods at our peril.<br><br>So I'm not entirely sure what to make of that, except to remember most of what we are is unconscious, and we're sleep walking in life more than we realize, so having access to these archetypal points of view, without letting them master us. <br><br>You mentioned Joseph Campbell's "Call to adventure" and his mythic understanding seems right center for briding objective and subjective domains. So we can see perhaps hopium and despairism are equally subjective retreated that should not freely reign within us.<br><br>Lastly, a key religous trick for me, is the awareness of "other" whether that other is another person, or an animal, a figure in our dreams, or God, anything alive outside our ego who risks our closed self-concept, so we must open a "theory of mind" to see ourselves from the outside, and then find ways to validate and integrate what we find in those counters and reflection.<br><br>That's my best guess, at age 45, terminally agnostic, how to see a religious sensibility. It's always a relation to other, however we can imagine and experience that. Sorry if that was too long. :)<br><br><a href=#c1993650887214207342 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 12:15 AM</a><br><br>

They are a group which is countering biophobia, specifically concerning death. Here is a section of their mission statement:<br><br>"The Order is about making death a part of your life. That means committing to staring down your death fears- whether it be your own death, the death of those you love, the pain of dying, the afterlife (or lack thereof), grief, corpses, bodily decomposition, or all of the above. Accepting that death itself is natural, but the death anxiety and terror of modern culture are not."<br><br>I also encounter very strong biophobia almost any time the topic of menstruation comes up. I think this is also tied up with sexism/misogyny, which ties in with what Tom says above. Pretty much any time the topic comes up, the first thing is a warning that people who are easily grossed out, particularly people who don't menstruate, should go away.<br><br>I know that I started feeling much better about my own menstruation when I switched to using reusable products (first cloth pads, later a menstrual cup, which is what I use now). The people who sell disposable pads/tampons generally market menstruation as being something shameful which should be kept discreet. In any case, having to regularly throw away your own bodily fluids in the trash does not help one feel comfortable with one's own biological processes, not to mention the guilt which comes with having to use and waste natural resources in such a way.<br><br>By contrast, most of the marketing of reusable products emphasizes environmental concern, and that menstruation is a natural process that nobody should feel ashamed of. Personally, I think sending my menstrual flow to a sewer is an improvement over sending it to the landfill, but it's even better to offer my menstrual flow to iron-hungry plants in my garden (you can do this with cloth pads or a menstrual cup - you can't do this with disposable pads/tampons).<br><br><a href=#c6713296888428134681 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 12:29 AM</a><br><br>

We've always been careful to poison our drinking water with chlorine, and we've always had a Calvinistic attitude about how cleanliness is next to godliness, but it seems to me in the last 30 years that American germ-phobia has really reached epidemic proportions.<br><br>Granted, American germ-phobia in its most unreasoning form really gained a head of steam after the discovery of AIDS, which is without doubt a very nasty disease. <br><br>But just talk to Sandor Katz, an author who's made a career out of re-discovering traditional cooking recipes with natural fermentation, about how much disgust and incredulity he witnesses when he explains to cityfolk that commonly eaten, clean, packaged foods such as cheese and yogurt actually originate with foods left at room temperature to decompose. I swear if you explain to the typical American lite beer drinker or the sophisticated uptown cocktail mixer that all alcohol is a by-product of microbes, instead of a drug mixed in a lab, you're more likely to put them off the sauce than to persuade them that it's safe to brew their own buttermilk at home.<br><br>According to Sandor and numerous other sources, eating live microbes is one of the oldest, most traditional, and healthiest forms of cooking... and there really isn't any difference between the microbes cloned in a food processing plant, versus the ones that will drift into your sauerkraut if you leave it on your own kitchen counter. If anything, your immune system will be stronger if you welcome the distinct local microbes into your body as opposed to the monocultured ones from food factories. But Americans are so removed from the process of natural food fermentation that they invariably assume that any food left in the open air at room temperature even briefly must be rotting and diseased.<br><br>Ironically, this germ-phobia is arising at exactly the same time as medical science is starting to recognize that the "human" cells in our own body are outnumbered by symbiotic microbes to a ratio of around 10:1. And that the diversity and health of those microbes may actually have a huge impact on the health of their human host.<br><br>Thanks for the column and I'm awaiting your next one!<br><br><a href=#c7289337568906940171 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 12:37 AM</a><br><br>

I don't know if it's been mentioned here or not; I imagine someone would've brought it up in the comments, but I don't recall seeing it. Anyway, aside from my generally being flabbergasted that the people behind the project apparently believe that they're going to set up a human settlement on Mars within 10 years--using a reality TV model, no less--I was amazed at how enamored they seem to be with Mars itself.<br><br>Now, granted, I've enjoyed some Mars-centric science fiction tales (I particularly like an old scifi/horror romp, <i>The Season of Passage</i>, by a favorite author from my youth) but that ain't what's actually out there. The planet's pretty much a lifeless, unending, rocky desert, so far as I can gather.<br><br>So here was the most dumbfounding thing I found on the Mars One site. In the FAQ, they claim that the astronauts living in the Mars One settlement "will not just be ‘doing their job’, they will be living their lives, complete with all the emotions and struggles that are part of normal everyday life; but they will be doing that <b>in the most exciting habitable place in the solar system</b>, complete with its own completely unique challenges." (Emphasis mine.)<br><br>What the holy heck? Thinking Mars is the "most exciting habitable place in the solar system" has to be some form of biophobia. I read that sentence and almost started yelling. To whomever wrote that: Please, go outside. Then look at a couple pictures from the Curiosity rover. Then really think about what you wrote.<br><br><i>Earth</i> is the most exciting habitable place in the solar system. This planet and our lives on it are a grace--an incredible, humbling grace. Living in cramped, ugly, human-made quarters on a lifeless planet is a nightmare. Honestly, I can't even comprehend the worldview on display here.<br><br><a href=#c1265954448508005830 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 12:39 AM</a><br><br>

I have to say, some years back, reading the ADR often caused pangs of anxiety as I wrestled with the implications of the predicament we find ourselves in. These days, however, reading you has the opposite effect.<br><br>Last night, unable to sleep, I flipped open the laptop and was confronted by the latest doomer essay from everybody's favourite Aunt Ertha. Reading about how we are all likely to die in the near future certainly put paid to any prospect of sleep for a further couple of hours.<br><br>But I notice that these writers never reveal the exact mechanism of our demise. Instead it's just left up to our imagination and, yes, it usually involves a fiery ball of smouldering planet. I hope they are wrong. Where, for example, did the idea come from that Fukushima has the power to wipe out all life in the northern hemisphere? <br><br>Is this biophobia on their part? I don't claim to know. Seems to me more like an over-rationalised fear coming from minds that have dwelt for too long on collapse - and now face the prospect of reaching their own end date having been roundly ignored by the mainstream. Sorry if that sounds a bit cruel.<br><br>I don't take these things lightly. I too am deeply worried about climate change, ocean acidification, nuclear proliferation and all the rest of it. But if I let the doomers win then I wouldn't have planted 200 acorns yesterday, or started preparing the hugelkultur beds or started experimenting with a new method of composting that - biophobics beware - involves handling plenty of earthworms. Fear, it seems, disempowers everyone part from the fear monger.<br><br>So, that seems like a useful piece of advice for surviving the post industrial future: steer clear of intellectuals standing on the street corners of cyberspace offering you wraps of hopium or crack doomaine.<br><br><a href=#c5010134247247708368 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 1:10 AM</a><br><br>

This one pierces right to the heart of the matter.<br><br>Your quote regarding Ocellus sparked a random association: "tried to find a reality outside of the realm of time and change." Isn't this exactly what geekoise culture is trying to achieve as well? It does seem a rather abstract mental process to me and I've often wondered at the point of all that abstract wish projection that they go on about?<br><br>By the way some commenters were a bit snarky last week about "off the grid people". I didn't twig until much later that such a descriptive means different things Down Under than they do in the US. Off the grid here means simply not connected to the electrical grid and nothing more. My gut feel is that it means more in the US due to people’s dysfunctional relationships with their various Governments and vice versa.<br><br>As to the doomsteaders (I had to look up what this entails), there is no greater advertisement to a roving war band than a well-stocked bunker hide out. It is actually a perfect place for a bandit operation... This is no place to avoid them or make peace with them. Not good.<br><br>I haven't come across people Down Under doing a doomsteader sort of thing so it is possibly lost in translation here. Here, it is more about small holdings (River Cottage style) than preparations for the apocalypse!<br><br>By the way the power company sent me a letter today (I was only included in a mass mail out) and it included the following paragraph which is an admission of the reality of the situation:<br><br>"Reduce your risk. If you need constant electricity supply, have a backup power supply available and install power surge protection equipment."<br><br>Truly, nuff said on the matter.<br><br>Top work with this essay, you really nailed it.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c5137299818485703595 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 3:59 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you for describing what I'm aiming at more comprehensively than me:<br><br>Well, this is a difficult thing. I wouldn't agree that Christianity stripped nature of any inherent claim to human reverence, I think Christianity's followers did that. Just as Buddhism speaks nothing of a plethora of gods, let alone monotheism, and yet so many of Buddhism's followers today worship diverse local deities which they inherited from the culture they came from, I think Christianity inherited it directly from Judaism. Even today, you'd probably have an easier time compiling a list of famous Jewish athletes, as the old joke goes, than Jewish nature lovers. I don't claim to know why that is, and perhaps Sharon Astyk would disagree with me, but I think it's incidental, a quirk of circumstance likely due to a desert origin, or more likely the repeated destruction of the thriving organic agriculture Jews developed over and over throughout their history. <br><br>In the same way, if Druidry were to take off in the next millennium, its followers would likely see failed apocalyptic predictions all over the place. That wouldn't be a characteristic or tenet of Druidry per se, it would just be incidentally inherited from the circumstance that one of its well known founding fathers had an interest in such things. And, over the centuries, a paranoia about apocalyptic fantasies could very well develop into a pathology, just as a near-pathological hatred of nature (and "the body") seems to have developed in some Christian circles today.<br><br><a href=#c8022580053998700225 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 5:21 AM</a><br><br>

A global array of 444 potential uncontrollable Chernobyls has no precedent that I can think of. Mass extinction events have of course happened before, and they are a regular recurrence in the long, leisurely history of the planet. But the human-driven mass extinction event which we are in the midst of is new at least to the extent that it is human-driven and has no precedent in human history.

But if you think about it, shepherds are smelly, and transgressive of established order (read Le Roy Ladurie on Montaillou!), and live by rules and rhythms not of human making. Most importantly for the discussion of biophobia, shepherds have constant intimate communion with the commerce of blood that sustains human life: sheep are to be cared for, sheep are to be slaughtered, sheep are to be raised.<br><br><a href=#c7885455522722827746 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 5:47 AM</a><br><br>

I wanted to get myself out of the relentless juggernaut (our monstrous version of ‘Jagannath’?) of gross surfeit I saw all round me. And I did not like modern food chains. I drove regularly behind wagons of highly stressed animals going for badly done slaughter.

Better veggie was the easiest way to get there once I had done some quick re-thinking.

Our youngest took a similar line when she grew up; aboriginal hunting ok; shooting purpose-reared pheasants for sport ‘not on’.

Biophobia has never been much of an issue for me, and the cultural anxieties about mortality have always mystified me. On the other hand, my own biophilia brings its own dilemmas. The natural world is my adopted church, but it can be heartbreaking to see what we have done / are doing to it. I do want to hold on to some anger and resistance and to bear witness to that. But the challenge to overcome with biophilia is to not allow it to prevent me from finding joy and beauty and spiritual solace in a landscape like the one I was hiking, which shows 370 years of hard use by Europeans, which is overrun as much with imported invasive species as it is with native species, which is hemmed in by houses and powerlines – but which is after all, nature as it is – nature engaged in a dramatic and dynamic conversation with humans and their culture.<br><br><a href=#c1512751926888751394 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 8:00 AM</a><br><br>

I'll be able to put all kinds of information for those interested in using Ham Radio in pursuit of Green Wizard goals. My view of Green Wizards Radio is that it has two main purposes, first to provide a pool of people who are dedicated to preserving and providing a means of long-distance communication that can be supported with lower-level technologies. Second is to provide Green Wizards working in other circles a way to communicate with each other to share ideas and support without being dependent on a highly complex and expensive Internet.<br><br>My own interests in the realm of "digital" communication are similar to yours, I'm mainly interested in Morse Code. In the past I have been deeply involved in many of the other digital modes but as I've seen the hardware to support them becoming increasingly complex and expensive, I'm falling back on the simpler methods. However I do keep up with current technology in these areas and am completely willing to assist and support those interested in any digital modes.<br><br>I'd appreciate any ideas that you or any of your readers have for content that you'd like to see there. I'd hope that conversations regarding using GW radio would take place on the Green Wizards site, I just want the radio site to be a repository of information. The site is just bare-bones at the moment, I wanted to get something up and gather information.

What holds us back on the other hand, running interference as it were, would be human flaws such as greed and egoism. But another problem might be that catastrophes have occurred rather more often than we would like to think. For example, as Rome was falling and dark ages setting in, there appears to have been an event, perhaps volcanic, around the year 500. For about two years, trees didn't grow. Episodes like this, in which large areas can barely grow food, accelerate decline and forgetting of knowledge. Then, in its wake, there is a void which gets filled with various nonsense.<br><br>So, placing blame is certainly an attempt at analysis, but it turns out that people are so eager to condemn the accused and be done with the trial that they take the first victim at hand, in this case, the Christian religion. But it takes very little thought to see that the atheist communist regimes have despoiled their environments as enthusiastically as we have, and with differing underlying cultural narratives to boot. And that is just one example. It seems to me that despite the various religions, when people want to do something, they ignore its precepts. Perhaps it is that the desires are really much stronger, or the religious sensibilities are much stronger, than the religion itself which is rather shallowly rooted in the people who profess to follow it.<br><br>Ocellus' attempt to lose the distinction between the ultimate absolute and the kaleidoscope of our reality is a step backward in my view. The nonsense which follows his cosmic worldview is neither here nor there, as one can use almost any platform to promote one's ideas. So the question here is why, really, did the antisex attitudes arise? One thought I have had is catastrophism. People seem to immediately feel chastened by the divine when bad things happen. Genesis records exactly that. At the end of the last ice age, the Americas suffered particularly. And there might have been more recent disasters we don't know of. I've always been impressed with the extreme lengths the Aztecs went to in setting up and performing their living heart sacrifices and their reason for it: So that the sun would continue to rise. What happened to make them think the sun might not rise?<br><br>Sometimes people here have expressed that we moderns would dislike nature much more if we had to actually make our living from it, but this analysis here shows that this is not the case, the distrust and aversion to nature is growing, not receding as we get further away from it into technology and its barricades.<br><br>I think that these sci fi ideas of achieving a kind of immortality through technology and artificial intelligence with perhaps artificial bodies, comes from a hard atheism, in which the reality of consciousness is negated. If there s no true consciousness, then an artificial one is as good as it gets anyway.<br><br><a href=#c6932547119225171230 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 8:38 AM</a><br><br>

Of course this mind set very quickly dovetailed into a callous attitude towards human life itself and the very bizarre idea of developing the technology to be able to dump the planet together with downloading our brains into some form of computer and enjoying virtual reality for ever! All in one!<br> <br>On the other extreme, I have a few friends who are just as intelligent who advocated doing nothing for we are doomed anyway! In either cases, I found that it is next to impossible to continue any sort of meaningful debates with either. Best to leave them alone. <br><br>However, the worst is when a callous, biophobic attitude crosses over with a rigid materialistic outlook of limitless progress whereby only physical matter and energy exist, and nothing else, in that case you have people who literally go crazy if you have the audacity of mentioning anything about spirituality! <br><br>Sometimes I ask myself if the religion of progress + materialistic atheism + biophobia are not equal to some form of hugely dangerous ideology capable of the worst!

A couple of books spring to mind -- The War on Bugs by Will Allen which traces the connections between military/industrial culture (and some other interesting historical threads) and the enemising and attempted extermination of insects. Also -- don't throw food, please -- D Jensen's book about the culture of logging in the PNW, Strangely Like War. I know Jensen is not everyone's cuppa, but he makes some interesting points about the organisation and mindset of logging: Nature as Enemy, the bush as hostile territory, logging as epic battle.<br><br>Recently I saw a computer game which looked -- from the packaging, typeface, etc -- like a war game. It was an industrial farming simulator! and iirc the blurb actually contained language like "do battle with pests" ;-) the cover image was not of happy animals or unfurling leaves, but of giant mechanised equipment rumbling across a field, I suspect consciously modelled on tank warfare imagery. And here's an anecdote from personal knowledge, a bit of interview buried in 3000 pgs of oral history collated by a friend of mine at UC: interview with an organic farmer of the 70s who invited a more conventional neighbour over to see his fields. Organic farmer holds up a handful of beautiful rich soil that he's been painstakingly building -- loamy, chocolaty, friable, rich -- sniffs it, says Mmmmm, ain't that grand. Neighbour, horrified, points with shaking finger at various half-earthworms hanging out and waving gently: "My God, you have to kill that!" Should we laugh or cry?<br><br>I'd also second the opinion that biophobia has deep roots in patriarchy, and that at least *some* of the desperate attempt to purge/transcend all the wet&amp;sticky and ascend to some kind of otherworldly perfection springs from a desperate need for warrior males to distance themselves as far as possible from the female in every form. There's a pervasive disgust in patriarchal cultures for women as inherently wet&amp;sticky -- what I call the eeeeyew factor -- menstruation is disgusting and unclean, childbirth is messy and scary, women represent the "dark unconscious animal nature," Eve is the instigator of all sin, and besides, what manly man wants to recall that he was once wet, squalling, and helpless in a woman's arms? there's a contempt for the female/fertile/fecund/squishy and an admiration for hardness, coldness, sterility and lethality that runs like a nasty little splinter all the way from gatherer-hunter bands through the present day structures of industrial civ. No wonder so many little progressniks are in love with space, the final frontier: as cold, hard, sterile and lethal as it gets. Tres manly :-)<br><br>[comment too long, part II coming up]<br><br><a href=#c2655401420635038969 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 8:44 AM</a><br><br>

Harsh chemical antiperspirants -- now how crazy is that, trying to prevent your body from regulating its temperature by sweating? -- and deodorants, many containing disruptive compounds that damage the body. A horror of death and decay that inspires widespread embalming of corpses, a jealous and selfish with-holding of our own flesh from the nutrient cycle. A phobia of our own excreta so extreme that we can't bear to recycle them into the soil but prefer to ransack the planet for synthetic NPK, contaminate perfectly good drinking water by using it for sewage transport, and then eutrophise and/or poison our greater waters with (a) concentrated raw sewage or (b) "treated" sewage full of chemicals... OK, I'd better stop. But the eeeeyew factor is hard at work in all of these civilisational neuroses.<br><br>People today feel a big eeeeyew moment when they encounter the w&amp;s (thanks JMG for the trope) and yet most feel no frisson of alarm or horror when they encounter the synthetic, the artificial, the industrial -- even when it may be toxic or entail horrendous "externalities" of production. I have myself known people who were horrified to see me eat plums off some random tree in a backyard, yet themselves would happily consume a Twinkie.<br><br>People who would throw an entire backyard apple away if there was one wormhole in it, yet eagerly consume a factory-farmed apple loaded with unspecified pesticides. Biophobia is good for industry: it makes people afraid to consume or even touch anything that is not Product. It traps the sufferer not only in a dysfunctional relationship with Life, but in a wholly dependent relationship with the money economy and the factory system. OK, that's all for now... clearly I have a bit of a bee in my bonnet to write a book called "Biophobia" :-)<br><br><a href=#c5934478731184212548 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 8:45 AM</a><br><br>

I wonder if you will write about some of the ideas of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (I believe you alluded to this when responding to a comment a few weeks ago). He comes to mind whenever you discuss Christianity, the Earth, and progress. He surely had a notion of progress, but I see it as somewhat different from the technologically driven model that the Kurzweils of the world adhere to.

I'm becoming an addict here, I fear. It's not that I always agree what is written, but I find that, by getting the larger-picture views so present here, I am able to both see and think more clearly about matters occurring around me. So, thank you for that. <br><br>My children both participate in the Deep Nature Connection movement (basically, skilled facilitators get the kids outside all day in sensory-awareness / nature skill exercises disguised as play). There are groups using these techniques all over the world now, trying to get kids reconnected to nature. It's still too small, too late, I fear, but at least there are beginnings. <br><br>Back in the 1990's, I remember being surprised at some of the churches in my area jumping on the "global warming is a leftist hoax" bandwagon. I remember wondering why they even found it necessary to address it, and why it would be so threatening as to necessitate instant derogatory dismissal. Now it makes more sense. Most unfortunate, however. (And lest I am accused of picking on Christians, I will note that the extremist Islamists in Africa are one of the groups really targeting elephants for slaughter ($$ for ivory), giving thanks to Allah every time they wipe out a herd). I think permaculturist Toby Hemenway is right, when he states that humanity's switch to "monotheistic sky gods"(as opposed to more polytheistic, earth-based religions) was the beginning of separation from/unthinking destruction to the earth.<br><br><a href=#c3995446131709874291 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 10:35 AM</a><br><br>

I plan on saying something about that next week. <br><br>Ares, excellent! I'd point out that "objectivity" does not exist -- there is no standpoint outside anybody's consciousness from which the universe can be known -- so the choice Sagan offers us is between different ways of guiding subjectivity. Do we use the traditional narratives of myth and religion to sort out our subjective experiences, do we use the tools of science, do we use the tools of art and literature, or what? The obvious answer, to me, is that we use all of them, each in its appropriate sphere. More on this in an upcoming post. <br><br>Notes, no, I didn't know about the Order! It sounds like a very worthwhile project. As for menstruation, well, of course I have no direct experience of that, but my wife's been using reusable pads for decades now and for us, it's just another bodily fluid. <br><br>Thomas, if I'd wanted to cover all the manifestations of biophobia, the result would have been a book, not a post! Of course you're quite right: the fermented, the raw, the unprocessed, the living, are all equally horrifying to the common biophobe. <br><br>Joel, yes, I've seen that, and laughed. I recommend that they all move to an isolated trailer park in the middle of Nevada for two years, right now, just to help themselves get used to the level of pulse-pounding excitement they'll be experiencing every day if they ever make it to Mars. <br><br>Jason, oh, granted, what drives the apocalyptic believer is partly the thought of watching the world blow sky high and saying, in the last few moments before the blast hits, "I told you so." Still, the fixation on universal death seems to me to unfold at least in part from biophobia: the gloating over a dead planet is just a little too blatant for me to explain otherwise. <br><br>Unknown, well, yes, that's what I was guessing. <br><br>Gregorach, excellent! I didn't have that song specifically in mind when I wrote that passage, but I'm sure it was somewhere in there. As for "meatsuits" et al., another fine example, yes. <br><br>Les, we've got the same sort of regulations here. Remember that most of what they're there for is to keep you from being able to take away market share from the big corporations. One way around that is to focus on the gift economy -- make your own pickles et al and give them to friends, knowing that you're building social capital which will come back in the form of homebrewed beer, repairs from a handyman friend, etc. <br><br>Cherokee, true enough -- here you've got the enduring hostility between backwoods culture and the urban centers of government on the coasts, and a fair number of off-the-grid folks here are reacting to that -- not always unreasonably. As for doomsteads, well, yes -- we'll get to that in an upcoming post. <br><br>Stephen, yes, I've been following it. Given that the Gulf Stream is showing increasing signs of slowing to a crawl, the results may be a little more challenging than that -- imagine Europe suddenly getting a climate like that of Labrador for the next millennium or so, while warm water piles up in the tropics and generates one gargantuan hurricane after another.

As for alchemy, though, thanks for the book suggestion -- I wasn't familiar with the Hughes book -- and the struggle between alchemical and mechanical visions of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries was a major turning point in western cultural history. I may want to discuss that here someday. <br><br>Phil, a case can be made that the cult of the machine is a cult of lifelessness, and mass death on the altar of the machine certainly makes sense in that context. <br><br>JLD, I've worked in nursing homes, many of my close friends in the Freemasons are well up in their 70s and 80s, and I've already begun to feel the impacts of aging on my own body -- and accepted them. Don't assume that because you can't handle the reality of age, the rest of us are similarly handicapped. <br><br>K-dog, excellent! Thank you. <br><br>Joseph, delightful! I trust everyone said a thank you to Strongheart for the gift of her body. (I recall a bit of ritual from decades back: "Take, eat, and rejoice, for all things have died that you might live.")<br><br>Blue Sun, now go back and reread the post, focusing on those places where I talk about the way that the existing religious sensibility shaped Christianity in ways that are by no means implied by Christian teaching. <br><br>Steven, "but it's different this time" is the perennial cry of those who want to insist that their favorite myth ought to take precedence over what actually happens. If you'll read more broadly in the relevant sciences, and stay away from those websites that cherrypick the news for bits and pieces that support a preconceived vision of imminent doom, you'll find that things look a lot less apocalyptic than you currently imagine. <br><br>Richard, that's quite plausible. I also expect to see the idea of the church as the body of Christ receiving much more attention in a post-biophobic Christianity, but that's for other reasons. <br><br>Phil, if a vegetarian diet works for you, excellent! Many of the people I know who eat vegetarian or vegan diets are entirely cool about it. It's purely those who insist on yelling at everyone else who irritate me. For my part, I follow the Druid diet: "Figure out what makes your individual body feel healthy and strong, and eat that." <br><br>Robert, thank you! As for reading, I plan on talking about that in some detail when we get to the series of posts about education. The capacity to read and reread a book until you actually grasp what the author is saying, get inside his or her thoughts, and become able to make use of the worldview contained therein, is a hugely powerful and vastly neglected skill set these days. <br><br>Wildwood, we'll get to that next week. (BTW, I'm going to take you at your word; anything you post from here on in better be something you're willing to see left up for the long term, because I'm not willing to keep going back and deleting comments when you have second thoughts.

Odums maximum power principle (MPP) in explaining the cultural and religious behaviours during this millennia of growth. It seems plausible to me that religious sensibilities emerged and where selected on the basis of there overall assistance in helping that particular culture grow and gain greater access to resources and energy. Puritanism is one such example, in that it encourages maximal breeding rates and work so that the overall religion can grow and gain greater access to resources. I think many others are obvious too...<br><br>All the growth that many religious sensibilities and cultures have been dialing in on through the lens of MPP might be seen as an inevitable pursuit of earth as living system to maximize total power throughput in the global system. Constructal theory, and maximal entropy production theory also suggest that its a property of all emergent systems. That they evolve to dissipate energy at maximal rates and in the process produce information. Human systems are no different, we are going to maximize our energy burn rate and in the process produce massive amounts of complexity. The narrative of progress is nothing more than positive feedback loops in a system seeking maximal power. Of course the dynamics change radically during times of resource decline....<br><br>But if the global system is seeking maximal power on its own i think that there will be emergent selection in the upcoming periods to soften the descent, at least over large time scales. Many many different dynamics that may accomplish this, some could be harsh... <br><br>Anyways just wondering if you have thought about the descent from the perspective of MPP, whether it has merit and wether you think it informs us of what type of religion may be selected to help support maximal power production during a time of energy descent? Thanks as always for your great work on this blog!<br><br><a href=#c5203421132254602092 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 1:26 PM</a><br><br>

However, it's interesting to note that the most powerful scene, the destruction of the space station, is dependent on biological elements just as much as mechanical grandiosity. Sandra Bullock's shocked, suffering face occupies the foreground of the image, while the rest of the scene is focused upon man's invention being torn apart by implacable forces. To my mind, this scene is effective because we're biologically hard-wired to recognize other human's faces, and it wouldn't be nearly so powerful if the character had her back turned and we were staring at a space-suit instead. I expect to see this trick ripped off ad nauseum for future 3D films.<br><br><a href=#c8078291361538450563 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 1:54 PM</a><br><br>

It offers pornography, the stimulation of erotic responses through symbols of sexual desire. That's why it has to keep on pushing the boundaries -- it gets boring to watch the same few actions endlessly repeated. <br><br>Rumighoul, I don't have a lot of authors to suggest just now -- so many thinkers seem incapable of seeing religion as a historical phenomenon that can also relate to a transcendent reality!

As for questions, post a comment here marked "Not For Posting" with your email address, and I'll contact you. <br><br>Andy, excellent. The thing I find that helps with the anger is to take direct action -- say, planting seeds and providing habitat for pollinators. If I may borrow a teaching from one of the traditions in which I've been initiated, anger is usually a secondary emotion, over the top of something else -- very often feelings of helplessness, sorrow and pain.

This is the one in which only the humans go extinct, and the rest of the world continues peacefully on without us. Usually the "end of us" comes about from some pathogen, probably one we created ourselves. In much fiction that tends this way ultimately we and our technology triumph and prevent the apocalypse, but occasionally not. And as a personal fantasy, it is not an uncommon one among some particularly misanthropic biophiles...<br><br><a href=#c264030463700482424 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 2:54 PM</a><br><br>

I do not like "wet and sticky", not even in females; few things are more abhorrent to me than menstruation and childbirth. I even wonder how females can stand those organic processes, and more, such as breastfeeding. I'm always cleaning my house and the room I am currently in. All my electronics are properly wiped with alcohol at least once a week. I wash my apples (and any other fruit I care to eat) twice, cut them in half and remove the seeds before I eat them. I never ever pet animals (specially dogs), and I hate bugs - all bugs, of every kind, size and color. I am obsessed by polished and clean metal objects (such as an iPad or MacBook Pro), full of square angles and cold to the touch. My chosen field of occupation is as sterile and lifeless as possible (business law). I detest body waste products, but have no problem - no problem at all - having to clean with my own hands the insides of my electronics, or of an engine. Getting grease on my hands from my scalp makes me feel dirty, and in need of a bath, but getting my hands full of motor oil doesn't even register.<br>That is how I feel. I would love that this "progress" thing could go on forever, but it probably won't. I guess I will have to adapt.

You're right, though -- I should discuss him at some point in this series of posts. <br><br>Janet, it may be too late to keep industrial civilization from a messy end -- certainly that's my take -- but anything that helps people get out of the biophobic fantasy is a step in the right direction, and may help shape the way things proceed once the rubble stops bouncing. <br><br>Dan, thank you! Please feel free to use the term in conversations and internet discussions -- I'd like more people to grasp the idea that wallowing in despair isn't a useful habit, and if a pun will help them do that, then by all means. <br><br>Zach, exactly. I'm sorry to say that the environmentalist scene has been prone to a habit the founder of your faith criticized in cogent terms -- something about a mote in one eye and a beam in another comes forcefully to mind here -- and it hasn't done any good for anybody, other than whatever benefit's gained from a warm glow of self-righteous indignation on both sides.<br><br>Joe, very funny!<br><br>Ruben, excellent. Yes, I'll be talking about those tools, and several others -- politics and the arts are also separate spheres of human experience, not reducible into scientific or religious terms, and the same logic applies there also. More on this soon!<br><br>JD, that's an interesting hypothesis. As for the call to adventure, that's almost always very quiet -- grand as the outcome may be, the process usually starts in some silent place where somebody thinks long and hard, and finally sighs, stands up, and starts walking somewhere. <br><br>Redoak, the thought of philosophy as a vaccine against collective hubris is fascinating. Nietzsche? I'll consider it. As for Aristophanes, yes, it's been a while, and I'll do that when time permits. (Right now I'm finishing up a really dismal book on Fermi's paradox, and will be following it with a book on Goethe's scientific thought.) <br><br>Steven, no, Yergin's one of those who are claiming that it's different this time -- every other attempt to extract infinite wealth out of a finite planet has come to a predictable end, and he's out there insisting (after a string of failed predictions) that those experiences can't be used as a guide to the future of petroleum. The details are always different, but the trajectory is always the same!<br><br>Sheep, if I recall correctly from the review, the movie invented a fictitious space shuttle that's still in operation. That is to say, it's a work of fiction!<br><br>Nick, for what it's worth, my take is that the maximum power principle isn't universally applicable, because it's not always the most successful strategy. Under conditions of hard ecological limits, for example, pursuing maximum power in the immediate term very often results in failure and dieoff a little further down the road. Darwinian selection is to my mind a better model, because it leaves room for different strategies to be equally successful in different niches -- and that's very much what we see in studying the history of human societies. Are religions and religious sensibilities selected for their contribution to the evolutionary fitness of human societies?

Unpopular as it is these days, Freud's claim that this often has to do with childhood toilet training is, in my experience, much more often right than not. If you can find (and afford) a competent Freudian therapist, that might be one approach; a cheaper one is to push the boundaries of your biophobia -- do things that bring you into direct contact with the wet and squishy world of life -- and then write about the experience at length in a private journal.

Irked because they seem to put it up as some sort of holy mantra, while at the same time lamenting the obvious consequences of organisms, humans especially, following that dictum. Can't have it both ways. One of my biggest revelations, and one that seems hard to convey to people in the wider culture, was that some things are "natural" but not "good". I mean that we may consider some things (such as racism or sexism - or the urge to reproduce without end) to be immoral and yet they seem to have arisen out of natural processes. To most people, saying they are "natural" is taken to mean that they should be accepted, if not encouraged. My revelation was that some things are natural but we can choose to resist.

More than most people, I'd guess vegans would insist they LIKE animals. It's fairly hypocritical for vegans to buy factory-farmed pet food, but many do because they have pets and understand that carnivory is a part of life. There's discussion in the thread about people's alienation from their food sources, to the point that they don't understand fermented foods, etc. Another manifestation of this is that people don't know, and don't want to know, where their meat and dairy come from. Vegans are more willing to look at where meat comes from than many of the people that eat it. <br><br>I don't think factory farming is what people have in mind when they're talking about being in tune with the great circle of life and all that. You can't live without affecting other living things. Farmland displaces animals, and farm equipment kills animals. I'd say factory farming is a whole different level of needless cruelty, though. Being vegan is fine, nutritionally, and it's not very difficult. For those of us without the luxury of our own little farms, why SHOULD we eat meat? Especially when the modern production of meat is so harmful to the Nature we profess to love so much...<br><br>Regarding religious sensibilities:<br><br>I'll make the observation that you can see the same sort of tension in the history of Buddhism. You've got the older take on things, with its meditations on how the body is a disgusting flesh bag and "please let me escape the wheel of birth and death." With Zen, you've got a bunch of nature paintings, "nirvana and samsara are the same thing," and a koan in which the enlightened master exclaims that the Buddha is the sort of stick you wipe yourself with after defecating. Whether or not rocks and trees have Buddha-Nature is a theological controversy. The time frame is even roughly comparable.<br><br>Regarding the apocalypse:<br><br>I don't think I win anything if I convince people the future is bleak, but I will say this: it's reasonable to consider the facts about the climate, the water supply, the energy supply, the size of the population, and current political trends, then conclude food is going to be a serious problem and the consequences will be really bad. Like so bad you wouldn't want to be there, anyway. <br><br>If we grant the possibility that truly hopeless situations exist, then inaction in the face of those situations is understandable. It could even represent a peaceful acceptance of the impermanence of all things. I don't think someone insisting on heroic medical interventions until the end is more spiritually advanced than someone that accepts death and prefers to die at home. If what the doomers are saying is true, inaction makes spiritual sense and the hopeful people are fundamentally unable to "let go." <br><br>Eventually, it will be the future and the issue will be settled. "This time really is different" or it isn't. I just don't think the optimists have a monopoly on spiritual depth or love of the universe or whatever. Hopeless situations DO exist and have existed before. The apocalypse is already well under way for polar bears and it's already over for many other species. The present times may or may not be hopeless for humans, but we can't just rule it out a priori. A broken clock is right twice a day.<br><br><a href=#c185201539135470961 title="comment permalink">11/7/13, 8:15 PM</a><br><br>

However, people in these states don't last very long as warriors. Becoming an effective warrior requires overriding the body's natural responses to pain and fatigue. It requires mastering physical fear in order to stand one's ground and advance in the face of deadly danger. It requires quashing any feelings of empathy for an opponent in order to kill people with whom one has no personal quarrel. <br><br>People who are not psychopaths cannot do any of these things day in and day out until they learn to suppress or distance themselves from their own feelings and treat their own bodies ruthlessly.

The connection between the Maunder Minimum (the last time the solar cycle shut down) and the Little Ice Age is not definitive. For one thing, the Little Ice Age began before the Maunder Minimum appeared. Many now think it had multiple causes, of which the solar cycle was only one contributor, if it even was a significant contributor. As for the Gulf Stream, whether or not it is slowing at present as a continuing trend is also not firmly established. Not a lot of data over not a very long time period. It is certainly not slowing to a crawl; it continues moving at a brisk walk. The bigger something is, the harder it is to measure, and the error bars on the measurements of the Gulf Stream flow are still pretty large. <br><br>What concerns me the most right now is actually what may or may not be happening with the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric Jet Stream. Again, no consensus, but many climatologists believe it is showing fundamental changes in its behavior. Others strongly disagree.

But it was along the lines of that we gradually learnt techniques and technologies through natural means (trial and error) and build them up over time. At no point did something unnatural occur to make tool and machine making not natural.<br><br>It was interesting.<br><br>Another of the articles was about how stupid it was to give Africans medicine, thus providing a huge population boost, without any follow up in limiting family size and improving agriculture.<br><br>Given that population growth is shredding a lot of third world countries infrastructure. Think it was around $10,000 for every new person and they can't afford the current population.

Here in my suburban neck of the USA, I have noticed a steady decline in nature experience / awareness along with a steady increase in "fetish" interests in Death, nature and sexuality. By Fetish, I mean a focused - non -naturalistic- ( nonspritual) fascination with a particular subject. <br>Memento Mori- For example, has a significant "cult" attachment presence locally -- a fascination with death- parading zombies, obsessive gore thrills amusements, fatalistic pleasure seeking-while avoiding issues of aging/ decay/death= in any community form... therefor a fetish of sorts.- <br> Recently, a young college student told me she is a "memento morist" and hopes to be an embalmer. I commented that is a very sacred responsibility.. She may have gotten that. She mentioned that the embalming students she knew, enjoyed joking over (and about)the client's bodies, as much as any detached work done for the clients. A kind of biophobia I think. <br><br>In my grandmothers day, Babies were born at home, doctors cared for you at home, death was dealt with at home, not bagged, shipped to another part of town to be sanitized before anyone could mourn. This dis-junction,lack of positive participation, if you will- in a continuum , leads to much biophobia, I suspect and also aides some fixations that keep one out of the whole natural process of life.<br><br><a href=#c5932733484711832313 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 6:55 AM</a><br><br>

Generally, I do take a lot of positive action, but I still get stuck frequently: I think too much, over-analyze situations, try to keep my options open and generally procrastinate in various ways. I'm avoiding commitment - because commitment is supposed to be followed by action, which brings the possibility of failure and of being seen to fail. I don't want to over extend my welcome as amateur psychologist, but somewhere underneath all that I suppose is the fear of death, either physical or ego death or both.<br><br>A lot of people probably share this fear of commitment/failure, particularly with regard to the very public and counter-cultural process of changing one's life. So getting stuck in big theories of apocalypse-now vs golden-age-soon may be a form of unconscious procrastination for some. And it's hard to persuade someone to move past it with logic if it is rooted in unconscious fear.<br><br>On the topic of biophobia, a helpful meditation I've done from time to time is to imagine myself proceeding from birth through various ages, including advanced age, death and decay. I think the purpose is to build a stronger sense of oneself transcending the physical body, but I came to find imagining my corpse rotting in the casket quite comforting after while - at first it was quite uncomfortable. <br><br>Finally, I've never quite understood the tradition of open casket funerals, which is one of our society's few sanctioned exposures to actual dead people. Is the purpose there to help loved ones come to terms with actual physical death and all it's implications? Or is it to try to pretend that death can be beaten in some way by dressing the corpse up in their Sunday suit and make-up? Maybe there's reflection of our conflicted nature in there as well.<br><br><a href=#c793779643283629723 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 7:25 AM</a><br><br>

First, as for pride, the most famous and worthy philosophers were intolerably prideful (unless of course you fell in love with them), considering themselves far too good for the plebian hubris characteristic of civilization! Their promethean gift intends to inspire and ignite a similar pride in their students. Strangely, the result of this inspiration is very often perceived as radical humility often to the point of shameless self-denigration, which of course is a misperception. Assuming a role beyond the concerns of the city is intensely egotistical. That said the love of wisdom expressed through the marriage of ego and cosmos is also intensely humbling. When sifting this paradox it is helpful to keep in mind the importance of context: an ass at the bar, but a saint in the forest.<br><br>This wisdom is antagonistic to the modes and orders of the city. Usually expressed as a tension between law (nomos) and nature (physis), the philosopher’s wisdom will inevitably (and accurately!) be accused of undermining the former for the sake of the latter. So long as the modes and orders of the city are ridiculous (they often are) philosophy will continue to be inspiring.<br><br>There is a counter force to this reaction. The city is an engine of assimilation and cooption. Over time the nomos has become more and more equated directly and rationally with physis. This is of course impossible and deeply evil, but nevertheless effective and massively empowering. The Enlightenment as a whole represents the greatest effort in this assimilation, consider only the work of Bacon, Hobbes, Descartes, and Locke and their epigone. Philosophy as described above is very nearly impossible today.<br><br>But chased out the front door nature has returned in the back, and she is pissed off! Perhaps at this grand collision of nomos and physis there is a need for a return to philosophy. Maybe Hegel was right about this, “The owl of Minerva flies only at dusk.”<br><br><br><a href=#c4168501705167028625 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 7:25 AM</a><br><br>

Members of many species kill their conspecifics, sometimes for very casual reasons; murder is therefore natural, but that hardly makes it a virtue. I haven't read "The Spirit in the Gene," but I notice that you've switched from "religions and religious sensibilities" in the plural to "it" -- presumably meaning some abstraction labeled "religion;" it's useful here to recall that religions, not to mention religious sensibilities, vary far more drastically than any one abstract model will cover. <br><br>Prediction, I'm quite sure that some vegans have taken up that diet out of moral or health issues; it's a diverse movement. My experience with the comment of mine I referenced above, though, suggests that at least some of the ones who go around insisting that everyone else ought to be vegan are extremely uncomfortable with the thought of their own deaths, thus arguably biophobic. As for Buddhism, bingo -- that was one of the things I was referencing. <br><br>As for whether the future is hopeless or not, since we can't know what the future holds, we're in a Pascal's Wager position. We have two choices: decide to take action to make the future better than it would otherwise be, or decide we're all doomed and might as well just lay down and die. <br><br>If we make the first choice and the world's doomed, we may be wasting our time, but since it doesn't really matter how we spend our final hours, we haven't lost anything: final score 0. If we take the first choice and the world isn't doomed, then we have the chance to make the future better than it otherwise would be: final score +1. <br><br>If we make the second choice and the world's doomed, well, once again it doesn't really matter how we spend our final hours: final score 0. If we make the second choice and we're wrong about the world being doomed, though, we've thrown away our chance to make the future better than it would otherwise be: final score -1. Logically speaking, therefore, unless you know for a fact that there will be no future -- and human beings lack the omniscience to make that call -- it's always best to assume that there will be a future that your actions can influence, and act accordingly. <br><br>Stephen, my guess is that they're all shoveling smoke. Gordon Moore himself has pointed out that Moore's Law is no longer true, and artificial intelligence, like nuclear fusion, is one of those things that's always twenty years in the future...and probably always will be. <br><br>Bill, I was basing the comment about the Gulf Stream on <a href=http://www.wunderground.com/news/east-coast-rising-seas-slower-gulf-stream-20130213 rel=nofollow>this story</a>, which is at least troubling. Still, of course you're right: we don't know what's going to happen. <br><br>KL, now there's a blast from the past. I read that back in college. <br><br>Cherokee, warlords love peasants -- every warband needs to stay fed, and warlords very quickly realize that protecting the local peasants against other warbands and the more pointless excesses of his own followers is a good way to ensure a steady food supply and the kind of land base that warbands, like all guerrilla forces, need to survive. Yes, guerrilla warfare is a form of incipient feudalism. Much more on this as we proceed!<br><br>KL, and you'll notice that Paul was educated in Greek philosophy and was very much au courant with the intellectual trends of his time. With very few modifications, the passage you've quoted could be taken out of Pagan Greek writings several centuries older than his time. <br><br>N Matheson, let's not get into the diet wars, please! It fascinates me that nothing, but nothing, makes Americans so hot under the collar than debates about which foods are bad, <i>bad</i>, BAD to eat.<br><br><a href=#c1986808195707826827 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 9:06 AM</a><br><br>

Veganism, with its typical reliance on imported avocados, nuts, tofu, etc. is often very dependant on the same industrial "food" system that is so damaging--and ultimately unsustainable. It is true that vegans may have great concern for animal suffering, but there are other responses that eliminate suffering without relying on unsustainable industrial food.<br><br>And, you can't farm sustainably without manure.<br><br>So, to be vegan, you are either supporting industrial chemical agriculture (which is unsustainable) or you are supporting other people eating the animals that are so critical to long-term functioning of the system. Which is just kind of a weird moral loop.<br><br>The only proven examples we have of societies that have lasted for a long time without major degradation of their landscape have eaten a diet that is primarily--to a huge degree--bioregional. Being connected, being in communication, with our bioregion is important to sustainable human culture.

Irked because they seem to put it up as some sort of holy mantra, while at the same time lamenting the obvious consequences of organisms, humans especially, following that dictum.<br>I actually think i share your sentiments over MPP and people that seem to defend our behavior on the grounds of natural bhavior. i think many natural tendencies are previous adaptive strategies that must be transcended or revised at a later point for the good of the whole, and by whole the whole of life on earth. We evolve as beings, and i don't think there are hard rules on what this means, but i do think our evolution must over the long run be compatible with life as a whole simply because life is a wholestic net of interdepent ecosystems and any system that denies this will cut itself off from its deeper nature and sever itself from the flows that feed it. <br>The growth imperative which we as humans dogmatically have followed through the rise of industrialism is such a strategy. We've taken it to its clear limit and the pendulum is swinging the other direction, and so many “sensibilities” that worked in growth are now in opposition to reality and in need of evolving towards greater understanding....So believe me i've been plenty irked too by our idiotic “sensibilities” of blind growth, but have found that trying to understand at a deeper level helps me, both to transcend and to have a bit less anger at those partipicating so blindly in them. And the growth imperative is something really deep and almost innate in life. That we are making this mistake at large is perhaps not as obvious or avoidable as it might seem.....<br><br>Maybe a better concept than MPP to explain this is maximal entropy production (MEP) http://www.lawofmaximumentropyproduction.com/. All self organizing systems evolve to process energy at as great of rate as possible and produce entropy at as fast as rate as possible, the order is the counterbalancing force that makes this happen. It seems to be a universal law of self organizing systems, star formations, spiral galaxies, and many of the ordered fractal patterns in the cosmos and on earth follow this pattern. Life is no exception to this but is in fact an intensification of this process. Life is deeply opportunistic of any available energy or resource gradient it encounters, all evidence supports this fact. That we squandered and consumed the earths photosynthetic inheritance like yeast is incredibly unfortunate, one can imagine so many different possibilities had the culture had a different value set or different religous sensibility, but at the same time we as humans are probably much less free from evolutionary imperatives than we imagine. Human history has been dominated mostly by cultures that have gained an upper hand in marshalling energy and resources, and this means maximizing power production. This competive drive that probably started as one tribe versus another seems to have deadlocked us in a position where we are stuck with maximal production for fear that the other will over take us. It seems the case from individual to group all the way up to nation state. I know about some cultures and spiritualities which have largely opted out of this game, but unless everybody choose a dynamic like that it would never have changed the global outcome, it would simply make more resources available for the competive groups to consume. Anyways just wanted to clarify i'm not justifying or protecting MPP or MEP or trying to suggest that these laws will come in and help us, just exploring different views and lenses of our predicament.<br><br><a href=#c4969793536504090797 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 9:25 AM</a><br><br>

Tools, cities, books, and debates about the future are as natural for human beings as dam building is for beavers.<br><br>Steven, one of the reasons Yergin's saying that so loudly is that his own predictions have been so consistently false -- he was insisting in 2004 that oil would reach a permanent plateau at $38 a gallon, for example -- while peak oil predictions that didn't go off the apocalyptic deep end, such as mine, have been <a href=../../2013/01/into-unknown-country.html rel=nofollow>pretty much dead on target</a>. As for <a href=../../2013/09/the-next-ten-billion-years.html rel=nofollow>The Nest Ten Billion Years</a>, though, I cheerfully plead guilty; asI pointed out in the follow-up post, I deliberately exaggerated the probable lifespan of our species in order to make a point, which is that our culture's fantasies about human destiny can't even be satisfied by a really impressive but possible future; it's godhood or nothing, as far as believers in progress are concerned. <br><br>Trippticket, thank you. <br><br>Betsy, one of these days I probably need to write something about America's bizarre and necrophiliac passion for dead things -- vampires, zombies, etc. -- and its relationship to fetish culture.

As for the owl of Minerva, though, I've long thought that Hegel was understating the case: she generally flies at pure blackest midnight. <br><br>MawKernewek, granted -- the heat engine we call "climate" is exceptionally complex. As I noted to Bill, though, there's some evidence that the Gulf Stream is actually slowing at this point. <br><br>Gary, the logic used to "disprove" the existence of a minor Galilean religious figure named Yeshua bin Maryam would, with equal effect, get rid of more than half the significant cultural figures of antiquity: the only evidence we have for the existence of Pythagoras, Thales, or Socrates, for example, is derived from writings by their followers, who disagree with each other about as much as the Gospels do. We know from Josephus (and other sources such as Lucian) that the Roman-occupied Hellenistic world was swarming at that time with would-be prophets, messiahs, and cult leaders; given the extremely fragmentary nature of the available records, that a minor figure from a marginal area such as Galilee would have fallen through the cracks is entirely reasonable. That is to say, from my perspective, the mythicist stance doesn't pass the sniff test. It's impossible to prove the matter one way or another, to be sure, but unless you're willing to apply the same logic to every cultural figure in antiquity who didn't either leave writings of his own or appear in the general literature of the age, it's hard to justify applying it to that one figure.<br><br><a href=#c5475317560435277101 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 9:26 AM</a><br><br>

Which has created a rather more serious historical problem than King Arthur or Robin Hood.<br><br>My question is whether the absurdity of this position has actually <i>enhanced</i> its utility and power as mythology and religion. That obviously has some impact on discussion of future religions….<br><br><a href=#c7024101953652475845 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 10:57 AM</a><br><br>

I have Asperger's, and Asperger's people cannot stop thinking about trains. With this somewhat entertaining mental syndrome, itself no doubt an eventual part of the "kingdom", many a thing eventually gets referred to the railway. <br><br>One of the tasks, at any rate, of the Church is to transcend the biophobia that got taken on through the religions sensibility of those Hellenizers. <br><br>I think, subject to correction by JMG or others, that in the Jewish world preceding Alexander the Great, things <i>were</i> properly earthy. Isaiah or Deutero-Isaiah, for instance, writes vividly of shepherding, and Ezekiel of life coming to the valley of dry bones. <br><br>A 20th-century British theological journalist remarked that the problem with Christianity is not that it has been tried and found wanting but, rather, that so far it has not been tried. <br><br><br>Cheerfully, <br>thinking of trains burning wood, <br>run by people who worship at altars other than Commerce and Technology - of trains<br>with baggage cars containing lots of goats and pumpkins and maple-syrup tins and seed barley, etc, with the road speeds seldom exceeding 50 km/h, and with excellent vegan dishes on the various dining-car menus;<br>and thinking also of little brick-floored <br>village stations burning wood in Rumford fireplaces, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br>Catholic layman near Toronto<br><br><a href=http://www.metascientia.com rel=nofollow>www punkt metascientia punkt com</a><br><br><a href=#c8518149585128593003 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 11:24 AM</a><br><br>

Love the term 'despairoin' and I sincerely hope it enters into the conversation. Coining terms like this, I think, is absolutely essential given the sheer impact terminology can have on our thinking (which fits with your previous posts on magic).<br><br>I have a lot of thoughts on this and the upcoming posts, as this is a subject that interests me intensely - hence the switch from lurking to commenting - but I don't want to talk your ear off about them. I do have one thing I want to say, though, which I think will be relevant to your next post: I think the religious satisfaction that the ancients could take in nature is completely non-viable today.<br><br>I don't say this lightly, as the older cyclical view of the cosmos and religious sensibility of natural reverence clearly satisfied millions for a good long while. But they had one element, something I think crucial, to support the framework that we don't: eternity. Regardless of whether it is objectively true, our modern scientific consensus is one of a dying or decaying universe, an endless march of entropy which will snuff out all stars and leave us in a bleak universe of heat-death.<br><br>Thus the cycle, for the average man, loses its power. We seek some sort of immortality in religion. Some intellectuals don't, to be sure, but the general populace does. Those who took comfort in your earlier post about our future found that comfort in the idea that their molecules, and the death of our sun, would later find a place among new lifeforms admiring the cosmos and asking the same questions. But kick it up a few more orders of magnitude and those people are also dead, and their star snuffed out, and then all stars.<br><br>Even the proposed multiverse hypotheses (which I see as religious in nature), or the theoretical quantum fluctuation that could reignite the universe after a near-eternity of nothingness, would be a renewal that has nothing to do with us. We become utterly impermanent. Those who face that bleak view head-on embrace the despairoin. The rest seek hopium elsewhere.<br><br>Again, it doesn't matter if any of the above is true. It could all be utter crap. The important thing is that, in the collective Western imagination at least, the universe lacks eternity. It has a beginning, and an end, and whatever we do in it will turn to dust. Religions that circumvent this problem - by embracing an eternal soul, for instance, or even some form of endless cycle of reincarnation with an IMMATERIAL basis - can endure that reality without issue. But a mere material or naturalistic worldview cannot. Many elements of it can perhaps be integrated or reinforced in existing (or new) religions, but the view or sentiment has no legs of its own for the masses. It must always be a minority view.<br><br>Eternal progress offers a form of immortality; irrational as it is, it can even claim that insurmountable obstacles like the heat death of the universe will eventually be overcome. We'll use wormholes, exotic matter and such; that's a problem for future genius that they'll solve, not for us, blah blah blah. The extinction/despair route consists either of those few with the disposition to accept true bleakness or find an alternate hope (usually immaterial).<br><br>I'm curious as to how you think the immortality problem will be addressed by a more natural/cyclical worldview and sentiment.<br><br><a href=#c7752617468686445137 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 1:09 PM</a><br><br>

This was one of those posts that connected a few dots for me.<br><br>Yesterday while raking leaves for the compost, I was stewing on the connections between last week's post and this one, and the notion of whole systems kept coming up. Pretending that humanity can exist separately from nature has the same root as pretending that there can be a modern internet without all of the industrial infrastructure backing it up. It would be akin to trying to use compost in the garden without first gathering up the wet &amp; slimies and the dead and dried, then giving the decomposers time to work their magic.<br><br>If the notion of whole systems understanding is as essential to the new religious sensibility as my reading and reflections of <i>Mystery Teachings of the Living Earth</i> leads me to believe, the implications are much deeper than just changing our collective rejection of the wet &amp; slimy. (As an aside, I'm recalling the big-bang truism that we're all made of the dust of dead stars, and noting the omission of the countless times all that stardust became the dead bodies and sticky excreta of countless plants, animals, and other species along the way.)<br><br>Just as we are part of the whole system of the living earth, we are also social primates (with all of the associated non-rational drives); members of families, communities, and cultures; and beings capable of religious experience, as you have pointed out. Given the complexity involved, I can understand the desire to ignore or deny aspects of human life, but I do wonder at the choices we've collectively made. Trading a healthy acceptance of maturation and death for plastic surgery, irresponsibility, and fantasies of sempiternal life in robot bodies just doesn't sound good to me. Then again, I'm clearly not a biophobe. Thanks for another great post, and I look forward to next week's essay.<br><br><a href=#c6289199179560565598 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 2:14 PM</a><br><br>

I have neat system myself and have been looking at results this last 3 - 4y that have been sufficient to make a difference.<br> <br>I recently bought a revised edition of a book from our UK Centre for Alternative Technology<i>"Choosing Ecological Sewage Treatment"</i> Grant, et al 2012. Two thirds approximately of the 'N' we ingest is excreted in urine, they say, and importantly it is initially sterile and can be used directly as fertiliser. If used directly it is too salty for plants and needs dilution. We do not eat much salt, but if you eat that 6g of salt a day (bad idea) remember you must get rid of it somewhere! <br><br>I use a large bale of straw covered from the rain to take the urine. There is always some loss of nutrients - N to the air for instance- in any kind of composting, but my efforts seem to make a useful amount of manure over a year. We think we can make enough for our vegetables for two people supplementing more ordinary compost. Next year I will be spreading dilute fertiliser on a small lawn when the grass is growing strongly. The mown grass will go back to a conventional compost heap. The urine will go on the straw when growth slows down. It all needs to be very simple without it becoming too much of a chore, because the amounts of soil fertility are not large. It is nice to envisage though that with the help of clover in grass swards we will not be living off the farm's NPK, which is his most of his basic input into farm manure. We do still get the straw from him of course.<br><br>We think of the lawn (we get enough rain) not just as a source of C&amp;N for the compost, but as a glade for visiting children to play in surrounded in season by flowers and fruit trees with butterflies and insect food for small birds. Nice view to the hills as well. We get occasional deer visiting but we do not encourage them – they prefer our trees.<br><br>best<br>Phil<br><br><br><br><a href=#c6789007766745983673 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 2:17 PM</a><br><br>

There are too many people for any kind of traditional agriculture to support, and there are DEFINITELY too many people for hunting and gathering, the one thing that demonstrably works over very long time periods. Even Ted Kaczynski had to buy things from the store. We're all using computers connected to the internet. I don't think any of us are 100% innocent. <br><br>It's arguably true that if the world went vegan and nothing else changed, the population would grow even larger and we'd be worse off in the long run, because eating the food we now feed to animals is more efficient. Maybe agriculture was just a bad idea.<br><br>As I live my ecologically destructive life, I'd rather pay for imported tofu than eggs from chicken in battery cages. I'd rather eat chickpeas grown somewhere else than beef from a feedlot somewhere else. I don't feel such a strong need to eat a dead animal that I'll go out of my way to find the "pure" meat (that there isn't enough of to go around, anyway). If it's just a matter of buying different things when I go to the store, the LEAST I can do is be vegan.<br><br>I've killed quite a few more animals than most people that eat meat, in a past life as a grad student. It was not a profoundly rewarding experience that put me in touch with my primal nature. It mostly just sucked to hurt things that feel pain and fear the same way I do. Let's burn some oil to do less of that, if we're going to keep burning oil until we can't, anyway.<br><br>After the population crashes and global warming changes the face of the Earth, it will be up to any survivors to work out the appropriate living arrangements. I'd hope they choose something simple, small-scale, non-hierarchical, and, yes, bioregional. There probably won't be factories making vitamin B12 supplements in vats of bacteria, so I doubt strict veganism makes sense indefinitely into the future. But it makes sense as a least bad way to live in a city until the power goes out.<br><br>So I don't think your lifestyle is practicable by most people...yet, and I don't think my lifestyle is practicable outside the context of industrial civilization. Industrial civilization is just where we find ourselves for now.<br><br><a href=#c544279609393757212 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 3:03 PM</a><br><br>

Otherwise readers here may come to the conclusion that you're spouting nonsense. <br><br>Redoak, but a distinction between nomos and physis is also, to my mind, the distinction between philosophy and ideology. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Joseph, that's one of the reasons I mentioned Pythagoras, who was credited with miracles very much on the same scale as Jesus. So was Apollonius of Tyana, and any number of other figures whose historicity is rarely questioned. Most historians set miraculous claims aside in discussing the historicity of a person in antiquity -- except when bringing them in helps a preexisting agenda, as in this case. <br><br>Rita, if they're unique bacteria, shouldn't we declare our navels wildlife refuges instead? Save the Navel Bacteria!<br><br>Toomas, you may be right about Aspergers and trains; I have AS, of course, and enjoy train travel whenever possible -- last weekend's trip to Chicago involved two very pleasant Amtrak trips and some equally pleasant rides on the Chicago urban train system Metra. <br><br>Rita, that's a worthwhile point -- buy into the notion that humanity and nature are irresolvably separate, and that's the sort of mistake you end up with. <br><br>Janet, another solution is right between our legs, you know. Urine is very high in phosphorus!<br><br>Derv, well, except that many religions embrace theories of existence in which time has a beginning and an end, either cyclically or once and for all. In point of fact, we don't know how the universe is going to end, or if it's going to end -- all we have is speculation based on a very small collection of facts -- and an end, if there is one, is so far in the future that the human mind can't even begin to grasp that much time. I'd argue that it's another measure of biophobia that so many of the publicists of science have gone from that very slight basis to insist dogmatically on a cold, black, empty universe at the end of time. <br><br>JP, ah, you mean John Chapman, the well-knowl Swedenborgian missionary. Wait, you didn't know he belonged to a radical fringe religious movement? See my comment a while back on the way that American cultural history has been distorted out of all recognition to erase its essential weirdness...<br><br>As for Christian critiques of Pagan nature religions, it's an unfortunate fact of Christian history that missionaries routinely forget all about "thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor" when they start talking about other religions. I don't know of a Pagan faith that bases its moral system on the state of nature, but it makes a great straw man to wallop.<br><br><a href=#c2997593957309437871 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 3:19 PM</a><br><br>

Confucianism comes to mind, for instance, and it makes (of itself) no hard rulings on metaphysical matters, leaving Shang Di to others (if I recall correctly, as it's been a while).<br><br>As I said, I'm not at all implying the heat death of the universe is an objective truth, merely that it has a hold on our collective imagination (at least among those not beholden to other religions). <br><br>And you're right, the human mind hasn't the slightest ability to grasp eternity as it is, or even far-distant futures, in any practical or actionable sense. But we still loathe the idea of an existential end. We can even embrace the loss of our conscious, sentient self altogether as long as some element of our essence is joined to a greater whole (Nirvana, for instance, or your acceptance as worm food). Perhaps you'd chalk this up to a fear of death otherwise expressed, but it's utter annihilation that we can't accept as a whole.<br><br>Every religion that I know of that has held more than a handful of followers offered an answer to annihilation, material or immaterial. I'm merely arguing that, unless and until we reject the worldview constructed by science of a temporally finite universe, it will be impossible for people to embrace a solely materialistic sentiment. It can't address annihilation.<br><br>I agree that other options exist. And I know you believe at least in some sense in immaterial intellects or beings, and you mostly avoid such talk here (probably a smart move). But we're starting to touch on one of the biggest topics, namely what is it about religion that makes it a universal of human experience. From a purely psychological standpoint, I'd argue that fear of annihilation is among the most fundamental drives. It must be answered for a religion to thrive, and materialism as now understood can no longer do so.<br><br>Don't feel obliged to reply if you don't care to - I know you're busy of course and I'm one in a hundred comments - but I thought I should elaborate a bit in response.

JMG mentioned some time ago, about space exploration, popping the idea of heaven and I think this is certainly the case here.

Still, I think that the Archdruid may be being a little hard on the bubbles of abstract intellect in robot bodies zooming through deep space - they (might, someday) have feelings too! I can't argue that futurists' preoccupation with such entities and their role as a replacement for humanity is not motivated in large part by biophobia as argued in this article. As a primary goal for human development, the similarities to various forms of religious death escapism are just too striking. But what about Immortal space robots as a hobby? I don't see why we cannot try to use our creative faculties to develop AIs that might survive us as a species to wander off into interstellar space AND still have a healthy, sweaty, mucous-y existence of our own and then gracefully pass into the history books both as individuals and as a species. Such a thing may not actually turn out to be possible, but I for one find it easy to imagine up a hypothetical immortal space robot species that is far from lifeless, however far removed from our Earthly biological experience.<br><br><a href=#c4555066004570651914 title="comment permalink">11/8/13, 8:59 PM</a><br><br>

I'm a Jew as are most members of my family. Jews in Christian countries have to learn something about Christianity because we deal with Christians, but we aren't usually taught about Jesus himself, not even as a cautionary example like some of the other Jews who have gotten hailed as messiahs. I learned Christmas carols in public school and the Girl Scouts; that was about it. The first time I read any part of the New Testament was as a junior in college, when I took a class on the Synoptic Gospels out of curiosity.<br><br>I'm giving you this background to explain that I have no emotional, religious or political reason to care whether the man Jesus existed or not. I have investigated the question and concluded that he probably did. I think he is a figure more like King Arthur, who seems to have been based on an actual Welsh war leader, rather than Robin Hood, who looks to me like an archetype of a Saxon outlaw rather than a particular person whose exploits were glorified.<br><br>There isn't space even in two posts to run through all my reasoning, but I'll mention three reasons. First is that if you set the miracles to one side, most of what is said about the adult Jesus in the synoptic gospels is historically plausible. Jesus behaves in ways that are possible for a Jewish man of his time and place. Scholars think that Jesus's sayings are among the oldest texts in the NT; about half of them are similar to recorded sayings of Pharisaic rabbis about whom there is no dispute of historicity. The Lord's Prayer is a perfectly good Jewish prayer.<br><br>(continued next post)<br><br><a href=#c1426339269728937522 title="comment permalink">11/9/13, 12:16 AM</a><br><br>

People brought up in a Christian environment grow up thinking that Jesus was the most important man who ever lived. How could such a world-changing figure not have been noticed by any of the Roman or Greek writers of his time?<br><br>If you start from this mindset, it's really hard to understand that in his own lifetime, Jesus was an impoverished Judean Jew of no importance to any literate Roman. He made a powerful impression on some of the people who met him, but those people were completely unimportant too. If he was tried by Pilate, the trial would have been like traffic court with capital punishment, not the way it's depicted in the gospels. <br><br>Asking why we don't have independent records of Jesus' preaching or his trial is like asking why some guy who busked on the streets of Minneapolis in 1875 and died in a tuberculosis ward isn't mentioned in any San Francisco newspapers that survived the 1906 earthquake and fire. <br><br>Those are some reasons why I think Jesus could have been a real person. Why do I think he was a real person? Because his life, personality and teachings inadvertently started a new religion. The earliest Jewish Christians were people who, after his death, met together over dinner and talked about things that Jesus said and did. When the people who had seen Jesus started to die off, these stories and memories began to be collected and written down. <br><br>I find it implausible that one imaginative person or a group of people could create a fictional wonder-working teacher of the Law so vivid that their tales would move people to gather together in his name this way for decades after his fictional death, particularly since the way he was said to die was both terribly commonplace and dishonorable. It's much more reasonable to believe that some of these people had life-changing encounters with an actual person, were devastated by his death, held memorials with other people who knew the guy, and started a religious community to preserve what they could of what he had given them.<br><br><a href=#c4685043823585666380 title="comment permalink">11/9/13, 12:46 AM</a><br><br>

Still, not many people know how to grow stuff, mend stuff (timber and metal) or are generally all round handy.<br><br>I have bosses now, I can't see the future being any different! Someone, somewhere will want their unearned cut. However, a war band may just save me the hassle of having to do the dirty work of their messy business, thus leaving me to get on with my business. There is always give and take in any relationship.<br><br>Out of interest, how do you reckon the monastery's negotiated that difficult relationship? They could not have avoided it. That is why I mentioned taking on their brats for safe-keeping (who would have been a hassle for the war bands given their circumstances). Just thinking long term... Plus it solves the succession planning problem here.<br><br>Anyway, if this is grist for future essays then I can be patient!<br><br>As an interesting observation, I noticed that I've hit some sort of critical mass here in terms of bio-diversity. This spring, for some reason, the perennial vegetables and herbs have started simply multiplying. I'd previously noticed that the historic Hill Station gardens up this way that occasionally open to the public have a lot of well adapted self-seeding exotic plants. Most of the vegetables, fruit and herbs that we eat in our diet over here are exotics. Much of the local plant lore is simply lost.<br><br>I'd always hoped that this may be the case regarding the self-seeding exotics, but to see it in action is a true pleasure. I've been moving them all about the place. Plus, I’ve been offering them to the local gardening / food groups who, without knowing it, are acting as a de facto seed bank (just in case).<br><br>This week has also involved a truly epic burn off of dead (and not decaying) forest fuels. Hard work... Some of the oldest trees here - which are pretty massive - are really looking healthy and lush with all of the work going on. Plus the oaks are in their second year and they are looking good despite the drought earlier this year. Please people, don’t troll me about this – my forests are not your broadleaf shady forests, they were always intended to burn. My neighbour has the oldest and largest tree in the mountain range. I reckon it is at least 300 years old and its girth is truly massive. It wasn’t harvested by those crafty timber getters from Oregon because it is hollow (fire and wind damage). Some of the trees here at the farm show wounds that tell me that the Aboriginals harvested them for canoes too.<br><br>I had a flash of insight too about Biophobia. If we as a species didn't truly adopt biophobia then we couldn't use Oil to game nature for our own individual outcomes. It is a predicament. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil! Ignore it and hope that it goes away seems to be the policy of the day.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c9205839135743679039 title="comment permalink">11/9/13, 12:51 AM</a><br><br>

We had a young family, and our youngest was under two.<br><br>Whatever it was I had being doing up to that moment had obviously added up to a very bad idea. Most of the other survivors round me were older and locked into debilitating chronic deteriorating conditions with ever more frequent admissions to hospital. Ex-athletes, battle-experienced soldiers, all good family men, were fighting their losing battles alongside loving families and grandchildren. (This was not long after the peak of the British experience of the Western cardiovascular epidemic and most of us were ex-smokers – though I had given it up 9 years before when our son was born.)<br><br>My exercise stress test a couple of weeks later was terrifying – cut at 5 min - 2 or 3 major blockages and a promise of angiogram and bypass after I was tested again 6 – 8 months later. (Angiograms were too risky in those days to justify instant use.) I went into carefully calibrated progressive exercise training and asked a local ‘healer’ friend for help in relaxation. I did some broad brush thinking. I had some knowledge. Some places in the world had not had the CVD epidemic and showed very much lower age-weighted incidence. Well, the Punjab and places south and other parts of the Orient sprang to mind. The Western Diet seemed a medical disaster, even without the smoking, so I turned it on its head, lost some weight and felt much better. I was to find 9 months later that this is what Ornish had done in his small study group.<br><br>I went for my 2nd stress test 8 months later. Eleven minutes puffing and sweating, nothing on the ECG, a small flicker during cool-down. While they were packing up, I asked about the angiogram and bypass. “Thank your lucky stars” was the answer. So I was out the door and on my own with some pills in my hand. I was surprised to find that though my medication helped lower risks, the effects looked rather minor – 20% lowered by using aspirin and something similar for a beta-blocker.<br> <br>No statins in those days. Ornish had no guarantees but when I read it his intervention looked as though it might provide an 80% chance it would do something very useful for risk factor management. And his patients’ results provided a putative explanation why my arteries were not so blocked as to cause oxygen starvation and electrical disturbance on the ECG during my stress test the 2nd time round. This was very different from the inevitable ongoing decline in arterial health, and increased artery narrowing, that in those days followed even after bypass re-plumbing.<br> <br>Oh, yes, I started serious statin medication 10 years ago after a 2nd ‘acute event’. So it goes!<br><br>IMHO later biochemistry and physiological studies related to accelerated ageing and chronic disease spreading epidemically round the modern world are worth reflecting on.<br><br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><a href=#c8562235812983346169 title="comment permalink">11/9/13, 5:10 AM</a><br><br>

I think various degrees (per individual) of revulsion toward various wet, slimy, smelly, and dead things is innate or instinctive, and it builds culturally from there to a greater or lesser degree. Infectious disease loomed large in everyone's lives in prior centuries. Large enough to drive customs, if not outright natural selection, in favor of biophobia, particularly in city populations where excessive biophobia is less debilitating and insufficient biophobia is more hazardous. Even sex, necessary as it is for fitness (in the biological sense), has also been dangerous enough that a moderate aversion to it could have been beneficial overall.<br><br>The prevalence of biophobia, then, might simply track the influence of city populations on the overall culture. I suspect city mice and country mice have had trouble seeing eye to eye on the distinction between soil and dirt since there have been soil and cities. (Why is prurient writing "dirty"?)<br><br>Anyhow, very good timing on this ADR. A few weeks ago, a particularly extremist transhumanist came to the skeptics' forum I frequent, and put on a display of every facet of biophobia imaginable, including the most deeply averse reaction to the reality of sickness, aging, and death since Siddhartha Gautama left the palace. To which I responded (in part), with the above in mind:<br><br>'Never mind that we now know what our [hypothetical typical] medieval theologian could not know: that the lowliest bacterium in a puddle of decaying slime is made of machinery more elegant and intricate than any of the wonderful computer systems [the transhumanist correspondent previously stated he] would kill to preserve. That fact, easily understood intellectually, is clearly overwhelmed by primitive instincts and emotions: the slime is smelly and icky and dirty and wet, while computer circuits are shiny and hard and clean... It's clear that some people just can't deal with their own material natures.'<br><br>If that's the case, it would suggest that the shape of the emerging future religious sensibility depends partly on how much of our knowledge of biology is preserved, lost, or superseded along the way. While contributing to the recent (and, I think, ultimately transient) phenomenon of germophobia, the germ theory of disease is also one of the main changes kicking holes in the old religious sensibility over the past couple of centuries. (Evolution, for all the recent noise, doesn't compare.)<br><br>Before germ theory, it was difficult to understand disease and decay as anything other than failure of, mismanagement of, or intentional divine withdrawal of life-generating or life-sustaining divine magic. (Examples of "mismanagement" would include eating fruit of the wrong tree or rubbing the wrong body parts together.) A whole-systems understanding of material life was possible but very difficult because so many of the components are invisible.<br><br>Some of your examples of reactions against the old biophobia might instead (or also) be early glimpses of this new understanding. I like your C.S. Lewis example, but a clearer one for me is <i>The War of the Worlds</i>. A sometimes overlooked plot point of the original is that the cold calculating Martians were vulnerable to earth's microbes because they had long ago eliminated the microbial life of Mars. With our somewhat better understanding of the biosphere, that plot point is no longer quite coherent, because we realize if the Martians had done so, they would have died long ago from lack of their own bacteria and never had a chance to succumb to ours!<br><br>I remember when the only prefix ever attached to the word "biotics" was "anti-." Change happens.<br><br>I apologize for rambling a bit.

One thinks of the character played by Robin Williams in Terry Gilliam's film of the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, who lives on the moon and whose head keeps wanting to fly off his body and float around in spiritual exaltation, while the body stumbles and bumbles about on the ground.

How do we escape the twin traps of Biophobia and Anthrophobia, and live well within our biosphere. I completely agree with you that nature (for lack of a better, less dichotomizing word) thrives in many human-ordered spaces - and this "nature preserve" will be one of those. I also believe that we should preserve many spaces as free from human intrusion as possible. After all, if we accord the right to the homeowner to try to keep the flies and mice our of their pantry, it's only neighborly to leave some of our animal and plant friends have some space free from our meddling.<br><br>By the way, you'll appreciate this, I think.

Daydreams and mind chatter are considered distractions. What is interesting is that after intense practice over a year or so now after a couple of years of intermittent practice, I've noticed that daydreams and thought streams often emerge as biophysical feedback. In the process of disrupting this and defusing those daydreams and recurring thoughts, I have had new memories surface. I spend relatively little time dispatching those now that I have a very reliable technique for shorting them out, which either results in new memories/thoughts again, or the end of the reflex.<br><br>I have been amazed at how much of the source of so many things are rooted in growing pains of youth that my body is still remembering, even more so because my mind was hardly aware of them. Like the memory of the time I managed to swallow a rock when I was 7 as a possible source of a recurring GI pang when I try to sit with aligned posture and not slouch coming up. Those kinds of early memories came up after I cleared away gathering thoughts and emotions about, say, the "post-post industrial zombie environment megal-apocalypse" and other things like that.<br><br><a href=#c1239486127765484200 title="comment permalink">11/9/13, 9:46 AM</a><br><br>

I bow to your wisdom :). As a person who has been periodically immersed into communities so fierce in their Orthodox Christianity it resembles nothing as much as geographically close esoteric Buddhism of southern Great Steppes, I came to believe long time ago that holiness has many faces. Religions are like explanations made by two-dimensional beings about what three-dimensional existence means; words and dogmas cannot describe something out of dimensions where that language and those words were forged. Your description about Jewish holy man who lived long, long time ago is probably closest we can get after such a huge amount of time. What it cannot explain into this world or away from it is actual touch of divinity, or lack of it. Divine, life-altering experience for others, business as usual for others. Both views are right, but from different angles.<br><br>ROTAS OPERA TENET AREPO SATOR, words are always lacking shadow of actual experience.<br><br>And about primitive lifestyle, living close to nature... It is always perplexing to read opinions of persons who come from very pinnacle of industrial society how things should be organized in low-tech settings... It is like those French aristocrats playing shepherds before revolution, having "realistic" attitude towards pastoralism... For your record: words like "patriarchy" do not even exists in REAL LIFE low-tech societies, at least as an negative term. As an positive term it can be used from time to time to describe religious/monarchist views... I have said it before, and I say it now: "gender politics" is child of very, very sophisticated industrial society with enormous amounts of complexity, and it shall be among first things to fade away when already existing problems start to escalate... Good riddance to SCUM manifesto! Just try to sell it in Central Asia even today, and see what happens...

The recent movie directed by Ang Lee was visually breathtaking, but the book . . . the book is rich and inspired writing and resonates with many of the themes recently discussed on this forum -- like religion, faith, purpose and meaning and our relationship with nature. <br><br>The story revolves around a sixteen year old Indian boy, a vegetarian and a polytheist, who survives 227 days on a lifeboat with an adult Bengal Tiger . . .<br><br>Some quotes from the book by Yann Matel:<br><br>“Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can. But life leaps over oblivion lightly, losing only a thing or two of no importance, and gloom is but the passing shadow of a cloud...” <br><br>“It was my first clue that atheists are my brothers and sisters of a different faith. Like me, they go as far as the legs of reason will carry them - and then they leap. I'll be honest about it. It is not atheists who get stuck in my craw, but agnostics. Doubt is useful for awhile. We must all pass through the garden of Gethsemane. If Christ played with doubt, so must we. If Christ spent an anguished night in prayer, if He burst out from the Cross, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" then surely we are also permitted doubt. But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.” <br><br>“One might even argue that if an animal could choose with intelligence, it would opt for living in a zoo, since the major difference between a zoo and the wild is the absence of parasites and enemies and the abundance of food in the first, and their respective abundance and scarcity in the second. Think about it yourself. Would you rather be put up at the Ritz with free room service and unlimited access to a doctor or be homeless without a soul to care for you?...<br><br>But I don't insist. I don't mean to defend zoos. Close them all down if you want (and let us hope that what wildlife remains can survive in what is left of the natural world). I know zoos are no longer in people's good graces. Religion faces the same problem. Certain illusions about freedom plague them both.” <br><br>“I went about the job in a direct way. I took the hatchet in both my hands and vigorously beat the fish on the head with the hammerhead (I still didn’t have the stomach to use the sharp edge). The dorado did the most extraordinary thing as it died: it began to flash all kinds of colours in rapid succession. Blue, green, red, gold, and violet flickered and shimmered neon-like on its surface as it struggled. I felt I was beating a rainbow to death.” <br><br>“There are many examples of animals coming to surprising living arrangements...where an animal takes a human being or another animal to be one of it's kind.” <br><br>“I had to stop hoping so much that a ship would rescue me. I should not count on outside help. Survival had to start with me. In my experience, a castaway’s worst mistake is to hope too much and to do too little. Survival starts by paying attention to what is close at hand and immediate. To look out with idle hope is tantamount to dreaming one’s life away.” <br><br>“Fanatics do not have faith - they have belief. With faith you let go. You trust. Whereas with belief you cling.” <br><br>Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.<br><br>-Sidd<br><br><a href=#c7328111058326057645 title="comment permalink">11/9/13, 1:30 PM</a><br><br>

That conversation was among people who were avowedly not christian -- it was our regular gathering of friends who are "free on wednesday night," i.e. do not go to church for bible study on that evening. In small towns in the bible belt, nothing is ever scheduled for Wednesday night. And yet all but my wife and I clearly had a "religious sensibility" of progress. In their "spiritual but not religious way," they definitely believe in an ascent of humankind towards some higher state. And they believe in this as a long-term, whole-species process, not just as part of the passage of an individual through life. The more biophillic seemed to believe that in fact our fallen state was because we were below that of "nature," and "nature" was the heaven towards which we must progress -- the whole "back to the garden" thing. One commented that "if things aren't going to get better, what is the point of even going on?" When I expressed my lifelong puzzlement at why people even think that life must have a purpose, meaning, and goal of ascension, the response was pretty much bewilderment as though I had expressed my feeling that I had never understood why people insisted that 1+1=2. <br><br>Another issue -- progress believers seem to feel that if you don't believe in the ascension of humankind, you just accept the world and all its ills as is, and don't bother to do anything to help, fix, or improve anything. Why do you need to believe in the eternal onward progress of humanity in order to think you should feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, avoid waste and wanton destruction, and honor, respect, and try to live with the flow of the biosphere rather than against it? But apparently, that is what many non-christian biophiles believe, just the same as the christian biophobes. I realize of course that this is precisely the old religious sensibility you have written about. And I find its presence or absence is not actually strongly correlated with that of other characteristics, like biophobia, environmental beliefs, or preferred religious descriptors. <br><br>And why did I avoid acquiring these beliefs, even while those who lived and learned right alongside me are steeped in them? My upbringing was only modestly "hippie" or "alternative," much less so than some of the other guests at our Wednesday potlucks.<br><br><a href=#c4683476324755892524 title="comment permalink">11/9/13, 3:33 PM</a><br><br>

I assume that for most people, this sort of activity has a very high eeeyew factor. Not all people are ready to rise to this particular “call to adventure”. My wife is one of them. My 8 year old daughter was not so squeamish though. She was fascinated by the process. My two older children wisely stayed clear for fear of being asked to help.<br><br>Now if someone really enjoyed this sort of activity, you would perhaps be inclined to worry for them. That said, I did enjoy it. There is something very primal and ritualistic about it. Its not a perverse joy in killing for the sake of killing. The context is thankfulness and a sincere hope that I have fulfilled my side of the relationship. I'd say there are some parallels with sex; context being all important: caring and commitment mixed in with some self interest of course. I suppose this is not surprising given sex and death bracket most sentient life (rotifers are an interesting sexless exception to the rule). <br><br> Flapping wings and walking feet after (and of course before) decapitation suggest some degree of consciousness. There is something amazing about this continuation of consciousness even absent a head. Sushi chefs use ike jime to eliminated such coordinated convulsions and the consequent degradation of the quality of the flesh. Ike jime involves destroying the central nervous system of the fish by inserting a metal rod through the spinal column after decapitation. This eliminates the attempts of the decapitated fish to swim away from what one might reasonably infer is an unpleasant situation for it. Anyways, I've done it for fish and its the fastest way I know to kill a fish. I assume ike jime eases the suffering of the fish as it appears to destroy all consciousness quickly.<br><br>I've tried a similar process for chickens with modest success. The problem is the amount of blood makes finding the spinal cavity more difficult. Its also tricky restraining the chicken with your knees while using one hand to hold the neck and the old hand to insert the rod all the while trying to direct the blood into a bucket for the compost heap. I've tried slitting the throat first but the degree of convulsions are the same. I'd appreciate anyone's experience on how to make this process a less painful one for the bird. I haven't tried a killing cone yet. <br><br>Scalding and plucking are pretty straightforward, the trick is to keep the water temperature below 160F to prevent tearing the flesh and above 130F to allow the feathers to come out easily. <br><br>Now the fun part: evisceration. This is not as bad as one might suppose; really quite the opposite. The internal organs of an animal are a source of fascination … and steaming fresh! They are beautiful; the gizzard in particular. I find it difficulty not to cut it open just to find what's inside this amazing tight little hockey puck of a muscle. Who can't help taking a quick look at the liver, heart, lungs, intestines, kidneys, gonads? Haruspicy anyone? Whats not to like? Each a tiny package of life. Each is a wonder. No … necrophilia is not an applicable term here. Its not the process of death that is fascinating, its the source and process of life and consciousness that is so amazing. So biophilia might fit.<br><br>I guess the question is: “What is the source of revulsion for some people?”. Perhaps they don't want to look directly at life and death for fear of what they might find … no meaning? Just keep distracted so you don't have to look the beast in the eye!<br><br><a href=#c5894391504162229752 title="comment permalink">11/9/13, 5:01 PM</a><br><br>

Say in the first four centuries of the common era in the eastern Mediterranean: biophobia can be found under the loose rubric of Gnosticism as it appeared (often peripherally) across most religions/philosophies of the time: Christianity, Judaism, the Greece Philosophical Schools, and the Mystery Religions. Basically it can be summed up as: spirit = good; matter/flesh/body = bad. I realize even Gnosticism itself is but one manifestation of the general religious sensibility of the time and place. But it did cross a lot of religious boundaries to be considered more a sensibility in and of itself rather than a religion as such. I'm guessing the appeal of this understanding of the cosmos was that the life of the body really was fairly miserable for most people for most of the history of civilization. Matter/flesh/body really was bad: a source of more pain then happiness under empire. There had to be a way out!<br><br>This formulation of a spirit/matter dichotomy flowered in one of the truly great (and now extinct) world religions of the time: Manichaeism. Manichaeism itself was a conscious attempt to meld Gnostic Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism. The spirit/matter dichotomy got formally inserted into western Christianity via Augustine (a former Manichaean) in his doctrine of Original Sin. The so called Manichaean heresy later popped in full bloom in Christian guise with the Paulicians, the Bogomils, and finally the Cathars. As for what happened to these last, lets just say the Inquisition was established in part to curb the excesses of the Albigensian Crusade that wiped them out. “Kill them all, God will know his own” being a memorable line attributed to one of the Cathar persecutors when asked how to tell the heretics from the “true” Christians. Still some of the original biophobic religious sensibility did remain in the mainstream religions (civil and otherwise), just not as extreme as the full bore gnostic versions.<br><br>So there is a long history of this religious sensibility as JMG suggested. But life is not quite so bad for those of us in industrial societies right now. The historical trajectory can explain some of the current biophobia, but where is the gut level motivation right now? As I suggested in my last comment, my guess is its fear. Our lives are comfortable but there is no consensus about their meaning and so a great fear that they may well be meaningless. As a result we avoid anything that reminds us of death because if anything reminds us of the point of life, death does. So fill up the void, fill it up, busy busy bees. Avoid, avoid, avoid. Heh kids, lets go to Mars. <br><br>Now I understanding people being revolted by the putrid. This is just us being hardwired to avoid the stuff than can kill us. But if chicken viscera are fresh, what's the problem? Fear not so much of death itself but fear that life is probably meaningless. Just a guess.<br><br>Then again, maybe poultry entrails really are just icky ;-)<br><br><a href=#c2973784825265790909 title="comment permalink">11/9/13, 6:44 PM</a><br><br>

But when overpopulation with respect to the current environment (either due to population growth, hunting large game into extinction and/or climate change - doesn't matter) happens, the only way to survive is to begin the practice of the hard labor of farming/herding (or playing warlord over those who do ;-)<br><br>Primitive farmers/herders work harder for less gain than well positioned hunter/gatherers. During peak seasons, farmers work basically all day, and sometimes into the night. <br><br>And for them, nature - or at least aspects of nature - the pest bugs, plant/animal diseases, crop/herd predators, drought, the cranky nature of tasty plants/animals that won't grow/domesticate well, ... - is a very real enemy.<br><br>Prof. Cohen makes the point that there was no need to "invent" agriculture - hunter/gatherers knew plenty about plants/animals, and more often than usually noticed, practice things like seed dispersal, setting wildfires to clear brush/renew grass, etc.<br><br>n.b. the "invention of agriculture" is a conceit of the secular religion of progress - onward and upward from those primitive men.<br><br>But once large game was over hunted..., people had to grow - not what they liked - but what would respond sufficiently to husbandry to enable survival.<br><br>Prof. Cohen has a newer book out (I haven't read) called Health and the Rise of Civilization.

What I am saying is that I don't see a path by which the various Christian churches and communities that existed circa 150 CE could have arisen out of the environment of Judea circa 30 CE from an entirely fictional story about a person who never existed. Given the conditions of that time and place, it would have taken longer. IMHO.<br><br>Once a story gets started, there are virtually no limits to how it can develop, what other stories accrete to it, or how people take the story into their lives. The speed at which the story develops depends on many factors, including available means of transmission and how fully the culture is stocked with stories of a similar kind. <br><br>Similar is a judgment call; the Jewish and Gentile worlds were well stocked with stories about figures who resemble Jesus in some respects, and there is no question (unless you are a Biblical literalist) that some of those stories influenced the texts that became the New Testament.<br><br>There is also the question of why we didn't wind up with a salvationist religion surrounding the figure of John the Baptist, if both he and Jesus were imaginary people. I think that if one starts from the premise that John and Jesus were actual people, what comes after is less unlikely. Or was John an actual person and Jesus imaginary?

At that point, I began to question the wisdom of the Christian Church and its doctrines. How, I wondered, could enjoying carnal pleasures be so wrong? Why would God make something enjoyable and them have an injunction against enjoying it? The Priest's answers were.... unsatisfactory and lacking.<br>When I learned about ancient Celtic pantheons and ancient Roman pantheons and was basically told of their acceptance of much of what we might call, human tendencies or, as described, moral failings, i.e. they had sex without guilt or shame, that concept resonated with me. Discovering the neopagan world, I found that, sadly, a good portion of the guys were libertines, and they were still very much bound by the same doctrines I was. I forget who said it, but 180 degrees from wrong is still wrong. My pagan worship involves a lot of shuffling though bright orange and yellow and vermillion leaves in cathedrals of the forest. I am a biophile.<br>But this biophobia leaves our psyches with a huge hole, a gaping wound that others can exploit with ease. For example, advertising invariably plays off those repressed desires by aiming straight at the repressed biological desires, and I'm not referring here to the supposed subliminal sex images in ice cubes. I remember seeing an ad for jeans that didn't actually have any denim on the barely-clad nubile model. Nothing subliminal there. Car and truck ads show the vehicle crashing (and crushing) through wilderness with the delicate sensitivity of a conquistador.<br>Biophobia pops up in the oddest ways. Each spring, the accumulated pile at the stable, where I keep my horse, gets hauled away, but they never quite get all of it; there is always a good supply of rich, wormy loam from the bottom of the pile that I haul off like black gold for my friends gardens. (My contribution to their bounty that gets me fresh veggies from various gardens in the summer, because I really suck at gardening.) One of the other boarders at the barn, M.S. who has no compunction about cleaning out stalls, balked in distaste at the sight of me hauling out a tub of compost. She just couldn't quite accept that is was no longer scrapings from the stall, but now rich nutrients for gardens.<br><br><a href=#c6653742868438292666 title="comment permalink">11/9/13, 9:07 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the details. <br><br>KL, that's certainly possible. <br><br>Cherokee, yes, we'll be talking about that! The short form is that monasteries in the harshest parts of the Dark Ages were always dirt poor, thus had nothing worth robbing, and provided basic medical care, thus had something that warbands wanted very, very badly and could only get if they left the monks unharmed. A place where your kid could get taught the arcane mysteries of reading and writing, and be kept out of trouble in a harsh world, came a little later on, but was also hugely popular. The moral to this story ought to be familiar to regular readers here. <br><br>Myriad, it's an interesting issue, isn't it? I'll have to check the details, but I think the equation of sex with dirt isn't all that common in human cultures. <br><br>Shark, that's the one! You get tonight's gold star, partly for knowing history and partly for the Baron von Munchausen reference. <br><br>Justin, I've had similar experiences. Freud is underrated these days -- it's remarkable how many huge personal and emotional problems can be traced back to childhood misunderstandings and bad experiences, and how easily they can be resolved once the roots are identified and brought back into awareness. <br><br>Ruben, thanks for the tip. <br><br>John, charismatic people routinely attract stories out of folklore; those stories can serve as a measure of just how intensely these people influenced the handful of people who met them, or the modest crowds who listened to them. Depending on your preferred Christology, the miracles may or may not be of great importance -- does the achievement of George Washington, for example, depend on whether he did or did not throw a silver dollar all the way across the Potomac? Now of course the lack of historical record is a problem for those who consider the miracle stories essential to their faith, but again, not all committed Christians do so.<br><br><a href=#c7570722050660293482 title="comment permalink">11/9/13, 10:14 PM</a><br><br>

Now let's take a look at what you've actually demonstrated. Romanticism was, according to your single source, one of the many causes of one single example of nationalism, and that nationalism was one of the many causes of the First World War. You then jump from that very slender basis to insist that romanticism as such causes nationalism as such, and that nationalism as such causes genocide. I could prove, using the same logic, that nationalism prevents genocide -- consider the role that American, British, and French nationalism, among other factors, played in stopping Nazi Germany. History is a complex realm of many factors, and the sort of simplistic this-causes-that logic you've used here does a very poor job of making sense of it. <br><br>Juhana, thank you! I'm pretty sure that there will be horse nomads on the great plains of North America within a few centuries, too. <br><br>Sidd, thanks for the tip; I don't often read recent fiction, but I'll consider it. <br><br>Bill, the notion that the only alternative to progress is sitting passively on one's rump is very pervasive, and to my mind very damaging. It's as though, if you're not sure you're going to win, you won't bother to play -- or to fight. I'll be brooding over ways of countering that. <br><br>Paradigm, fascinating. I wonder if Berry read Guenon's "The Reign of Quantity"!<br><br>Agent, one of the things I appreciate about classical religion is the role of butchering, cooking and eating animals as a religious act. No, I haven't had the chance to take part in the sacrifice of an ox to Zeus, but I'd happily do so if the opportunity presented itself! The stark confrontation with the reality of death, and even more, the dependence of life on death and death on life, strikes me as well worth doing. Yes, I've chopped the heads off chickens and cleaned, plucked, and eaten them, too -- though that was before I started studying classical pagan spirituality; it was just an ordinary part of the routine at the hippie farm where I lived for a while. <br><br>August, excellent! As for carrying one of those home, 50 lbs. is within my range if the walk isn't too far; those big receivers, though, would be call-a-taxi time. <br><br>Sunseeker, Cohen's theory is an interesting one. Have you read Colin Tudge's <i>Neanderthals, Bandits, and Farmers</i>? He points out that there's plenty of evidence that people were planting and harvesting some crops 40,000 years ago, and argues that the transition was a lot more gradual than current theories suggest. I've suspected more than once that what we see c. 8000 BCE was not "the agricultural revolution," but a society under ghastly subsistence pressure, forced by extreme climate change to get by on only one small part of an older and much broader human ecology. <br><br>As for Stevenson, of course! And quite a bit of other research on the same lines, as well. <br><br>Matt, that would probably be the Waters of Life, and I'll take mine with just a splash of water, thanks!<br><br>Renaissance, nicely put! Yes, I've seen all too many people in the Neopagan scene who are still stuck trying to shock the God they grew up with.

I guess you need an already-deceased chicken (cue Monty Python routines!) to practise on, but how... a real "chicken and dead problem."<br><br>while I'm not all that biophobic -- no problem with humanure composting, handling earthworms, hurling slugs out of the garden, etc -- I am squeamish to the last degree about inflicting *suffering* -- always had a hard time doctoring my cats if it involved restraining them and inflicting pain; my hands shake if I have to help a friend dig out a deep splinter. once had to kill a chicken half-eaten by a dog (bad dog!) and it was pretty traumatic. being a spoilt little Westerner from a pretty secure life, I have little experience of serious pain, trauma, dismemberment and violent death, and even in chicken form it upset me considerably. but it was the violence and suffering, more than the eeeyew, I think.<br><br>I've been appreciating everyone's comments on biophobia tremendously -- particularly Jose's honesty (very representative feelings btw, plenty of people share 'em). for me, a turning point was... compost. <br><br>once you realise that compost is -- as W Berry said -- "resurrection"... that compost is as close as we get to eternal life -- somehow biophobia loses its hold and the wet and sticky becomes cool and amazing and miraculous. [my love and admiration for fungi increases from year to year; moldy cheese just doesn't bug me the way it once did.] anything in storage that gets eeeyewish ("that's funny, you don't *look* eeeyewish!") goes into the compost bin and is maybe a minor loss, but emphatically not a write-off. rotten stuff is almost as valuable as good edible stuff, and is a precondition for future good edible stuff. meat that gets a bit "past it" gets buried with new plantings of shrubs or saplings... what goes around comes around. I find it very comforting.<br><br>as soon as I started "farming microbes" -- became a modest, not too zealous fermento -- my fairly minor residual biophobia really started melting away. I recommend to all biophobia sufferers that they try making some home brew or kombucha, or even just sourdough bread; it's a great start on the road to considering the microbial world a friendly and happenin' place rather than a scary house of horrors. the kombu scoby is a real eeeyew candidate in theory, but if you love the drink you'll soon love the scoby and maybe even start thinking it's cute and caring for it like a pet :-) I draw the line at naming them though!<br><br><a href=#c3697200007850077304 title="comment permalink">11/9/13, 10:39 PM</a><br><br>

Oh yeah, back to the thought.<br><br>The new federal government here wants to sack 12,000 public service jobs, but somehow at the same time pursue a jobs creation strategy. Such thinking seems to be sort of mentally dysfunctional. Well, it would do psychological damage to me anyway as the two objectives are mutually exclusive.<br><br>My lady has a friend who works at the CSIRO (the government science body for research) and they are chopping heads like there is no tomorrow.<br><br>Anyway, the thought was that somehow the values of a company board have somehow snuck into the upper end of government. How could this have happened? No one noticed.<br><br>The problem is that a company board only operates for the benefit of themselves first and shareholders and employees second. Don’t believe me, ask yourself, do you need a remuneration consultant as part of your job? Hehe! I certainly don’t. However, a government has an obligation to everyone, the environment and the future regardless of people’s status as employed or otherwise. They've forgotten this.<br><br>I believe last year - and I may be wrong – the federal politicians voted themselves a pay rise too. It is a reasonably repulsive look to do that and then sack public servants. Not that anyone ever says such things. Plus there is an political expense rip off scandal going on here too.

You’ve made the case that even the most basic grasp of thermodynamics (which most people don’t have, of course) carries a powerful, cautionary critique. But the most visceral and intimate refutation of Progress is always going to be mortality and the cascading decrepitude that comes of living; it is the inescapable problem that we are each meat with a sell-by-date. (For the future beyond our deaths can be a pallid and unsatisfactory thing.) A culture with any burden of wisdom enables people to make the best of that – even celebrate it; a culture with more than its share of unwisdom may try to reject that unwelcome reality with religio-mythic sleight of hand. But it takes only the smallest modicum of wisdom to see that to reject death is to reject life. We can almost accomplish that remarkable unwisdom in our sterilized, human-made spaces – but we can certainly not accomplish it in the places (called nature) where our control slips. <br><br>So biophobia (and I count the romanticization of nature as but one more variant of this) is a crucial ally in our failed effort to transcend our earthly limitations.

I have raised thousands of them. I call them genetic mutant freaks. They are not very tolerant of heat, cold, or exposure. They are lousy foragers. They have no predator avoidance instincts at all. Their meat is relatively bland compared to most other breeds raised on the same feed (note that a home-raised cornish cross with access to forage will still taste a thousand percent better than a regular grocery store chicken!). <br><br>I have had good luck with Dark Cornish as a meat chicken. The cockerels are usually pretty cheap to buy from mail order suppliers. They are much hardier, excellent foragers, and the cockerels especially are quite aggressive (fighting cocks in their ancestry) and good at predator avoidance. They take about twice as long to reach the same weight as a Cornish Cross, but they eat about half as much feed per day. If you feed them even less feed than that and give them access to good forage, they really will feed themselves. <br><br>Handling Dark Cornish is a whole different game. They fight, bite, and scratch; sturdy leather gloves are advised. Unlike the Cornish Cross, they do not go gently, they rage, rage against the coming of the dressing knife. Killing cones are very helpful; lacking that, simply hanging them by their feet (bungee balls work well) helps.<br><br>The payoff for all of this is a much better tasting bird, with a better balance of light and dark meat. And even the light meat is rich and flavorful. Plus your birds really do eat a lot of forage, which is the key to making meat animals more "sustainable."<br><br><a href=#c4825237636092638958 title="comment permalink">11/10/13, 7:51 AM</a><br><br>

There's always the question of the contingent and the inevitable in any story about history, and the role (or non-role) of "extraordinary persons."<br><br>When I was growing up, they called it "steam engine time." Although James Watt is typically associated with the invention of the steam engine, if he'd been hit by a horse-drawn cart and killed at the age of ten, we'd still have had the steam engine at pretty much the same point in history. Lots of people had worked on developing the steam engine for decades, and continued to refine it for decades. No one person was critical to that process.<br><br>The argument could be made that the particular mix of the attempted Hellenization of the Jews, the slaughter of the Maccabean priesthood, Roman patronage/slave system, the conquest and partial assimilation of Judea by Rome, the sacking of Jerusalem by Titus and the subsequent Diaspora of the Jews as a slave class, the Siege of Massada, etc., all made the rise of a Messiah of the Jesus sort inevitable rather than contingent: the mantle had been sewn by history, and it would inevitably have been placed on someone -- fictional or factual. Jesus was the "steam engine" of first century Judea, and would have been invented whether any real person existed to wear the mantle.<br><br>The contrary argument is more commonly made, that Jesus was an "extraordinary person" who shaped the flow of history around himself: that, had he been kicked by a mule at the age of ten and died, there would never have been a Christian religion.<br><br>I don't think there can ever be a final answer to that question, certainly not an answer crafted two thousand years later.<br><br>However, I want to come back to topic, because JMG is talking not about past religions, but future religions, and one of the interesting questions (to me) is whether our current place in history is already embroidering the mantle of the next Messiah -- so to speak -- and whether it is possible to intuit the general shape and weight and color of that mantle, which is (I think) what JMG is venturing to do.<br><br>If religion develops contingently based entirely upon the "extraordinary person," then it is quite impossible to even make guesses about the role of religion in the future, because it will all depend upon who rises up out of the genetic mix-master, and when.<br><br>I'm personally inclined to believe that there is a lot more inevitability to the process than that.<br><br><a href=#c4828078952951772313 title="comment permalink">11/10/13, 8:58 AM</a><br><br>

One clue is if you get it right you do not overly upset the bird and the other birds round your feet not at all while you do it. I was well enough taught. It is really a form of respect, not just for the birds, but I guess for sentience including mine and colleagues, which is what I imagine religion can be about. And giving some of the food away also respects the broader context and whole system. <br><br>Evisceration itself if I am doing it is no big deal, but it can be a shock for small children when they first see it – depends on context as always. They might be fanciful, but I heard very painful stories about suburban children being required to sacrifice their pet rabbits at the beginning of WWII in England, which seemed a bit much.<br><br>I don't see however the need to kill if it can be avoided, and I do not partake of industrial animal farming and its killing methods. It is not the same deal for trees but something similar applies and I have known sorrow at the loss of a vigorous tree, even when it was taken for good enough reason. Sacrifice can seem OTT to me as a concept, and even a bit suspect when we ‘sacrifice’ our own interests in favour of others unless there is over-riding good reason. Normal generosity within reciprocal relationships and social settings seems adequate. I suppose though that those wonderful people who farm on the edge of one of the Indian deserts, who give away some hard won grain every year to migrating storks, have more profound relationships all-round than most of us. Hope for us yet!<br><br>'Listening' to nature can be cultivated and can become a two way conversation, but I haven't a clue about the nature of Gods. That is not too much of a personal deal for me, though it has been from time to time (given inevitable social context). I prefer the quality of doubt that goes with reflection. The notion of ‘false gods’ has given me pause for thought and I enquire carefully about who is telling the story. More generally, their choice of stories tells me a lot about other people, and something of how they 'read' off nature, including their own. There are some stories I will try to do a body swerve round.<br><br>I have been thinking about Shakers and peak-furniture design (and aesthetics also of skill and compromise with error), and about looking after orphans of the day, and abstinence in the context of gender equality and getting relationships and skills right and having better understanding of whole contexts, and presume it was a way of realising their inheritance?

For a new religion to catch on, it would have needed an organizing base or structure that didn't depend on the established order, and it would have contained a mixture of Greek, Jewish and Asian religious ideas, because that is what people expected a worthwhile religion to be like.

However, I can't help but think that the classes currently deciding resouce allocations will make even greater attempts to perform such engineering on an industrial scale, with the expectation that we plebians will continue to simply consume whatever they can produce most cheaply.

If anything, Earth becomes heaven. Its constant dazzling presence, visible but unreachable, the constant threat of a single misstep by a centimeter causing irrevocable disaster where they are, the triumphant music as the capsule at last makes its turbulent way below the clouds....<br><br>And as for biophobia... the very end comes as after having dragged herself to the shore of the tropical lake full of frogs and insects her capsule came down in, Bullock first grips the mud under her and hugs it to her face, muttering a breathless thank you. And then slowly rises to her feet, assuming the posture humans are built for for the first time in the entire film, and starts unsteadily walking barefoot through the mud towards the verdant landscape. Cue credits. I think it could hardly have ended on a more biophilic note. The symbolism of a human taking their place in the universe could hardly be stronger, and if I am right it is even reflected in where I estimate she landed (based on what she was flying over in the lead-up to entry) - the Great Rift Valley of East Africa, where so many bits of our deep ancestry have been discovered.<br><br>-Tony B.<br><br><a href=#c8747865136535580061 title="comment permalink">11/10/13, 5:55 PM</a><br><br>

At that time they had exhausted hunter-gatherer (and part-time farmer) strategies for increasing food supply, some of which was likely responsible for megafauna extinctions.

I had my own place by then. It had been several days since I'd seen them all. There was a bird that had nested in a hanging flower basket on the porch. We had been watching the eggs to see when they would hatch. Well, they hatched while I was away, and then the family cat promptly killed the mother bird. And there was no other bird feeding the (2) chicks. <br><br>My mother told me about the situation. The chicks hadn't eaten in two days. The poor naked, featherless things were screaming there little heads off. I couldn't believe no one had done anything about this. Two adults (one of which was a hunter and fisherman who had gutted more than a few deer) and three nearly grown boys all apparently perfectly willing to let these birds starve to death. (or more likely die of dehydration) <br> <br>Raising the birds was out of the question, that was pretty obvious. So I immediately removed the birds from the nest and ended their lives as quickly and painlessly as possible.

The ensuing group dynamics, as often is the case, tend to bring out the worst in people and it turns into something like "we are the only good guys, we are the only true altruists, people who disagree with us are monsters/bad/evil/selfish".Hence comes the berating of those who disagree with them. With the caveat that there is a lot to be said about the lack of sustainability of the modern meat industry I am not sure things were in proportion any better in the past as far the treatment of animals went. One only has to take a look at how pre-industrial (well, it lasted into WW2) armies on campaign treated horses; being worked to death and then being turned into soup was an all too common fate.<br>Once we revert back to what will be a rather more violent society and one in which animals being butchered and used for transportation are common sights I suspect veganism will fade away or be confined to some religious sect as people will get used again to brutality.<br><br><a href=#c2906234281688625348 title="comment permalink">11/11/13, 12:19 PM</a><br><br>

When we come to discuss the course of thought over long spans of human history, it might be worth some consideration of the effects of agriculture as it emerged in the very Old World. After all, agriculture and all its social implications are really new on a species time scale. Can’t biophobia (and patriarchy) arise from the kind of thinking that is necessary to practise agriculture? Control of what the earth brings forth is insane, radical thinking for the hunter-gatherer, but it leads directly to the idea of good/bad plants and the desire to tame nature. Is there no place for this in the discussion?<br>I sometimes wonder if you (and many others) place too much reliance on philosophical and religious explanations for human behaviour, when in fact there are more fundamental causes based on the messy, icky realities you are clearly aware of. We are bound to create more of us if the food holds out, but will probably find any number of religious and philosophical rationalizations to explain it. Maybe the restlessness to travel is merely what our species does when it gets crowded and malnourished – so the really tiny numbers who think about colonizing space are exhibiting a natural behaviour mapped onto our current situation. <br>I always liked Kurt Vonnegut’s “Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly, man got to sit and wonder: why why why ? Tiger got to sleep; bird got to land. Man got to tell himself he understand” Sometimes I think the evolutionary biologists have a better explanation for large scale human behaviours than what people tell each other their reasons are…<br><br><br><a href=#c4762523946797690405 title="comment permalink">11/11/13, 7:43 PM</a><br><br>

(which I think arises due to necessity - and not some "progress" - since faming's more work than hunting/gathering - assuming the environment will support hunting/gathering).<br><br>These best word I know for that mode of thinking is chauvinism (though that word is too modern for the "invention" of chauvinism itself). One might also call it the "cult of the warrior king". Where I think it comes from is this:<br>* once farming/herding becomes practiced sufficiently that it is a major part of livelihood, one has things worth stealing (stored grain, herd of animals, …).<br>* that level of agriculture also has a development of (private) property rights, since it's so painfully labor intensive the ethos of sharing of the hunter/gatherer is out the door.<br>* once crime can begin to pay, the lazy or ecologically stressed will try stealing (including killing people defending their hard won stuff) as survival - imperiling the survival of the farmers, so the farmers now need "police" to defend against freeloaders and/or desperate invaders.<br>* warfare now becomes important enough that specialists arise (war is now professional) and "arms races" happen, leading to larger and larger groups, not necessarily all professionals, but led/trained/deployed by professionals.<br>* armies work best with one, singular point of command, control and authority - (ultimately) <i>the</i> warrior king.<br>(males with greater upper body strength are more effective warriors than females, weaker men, …)<br>* once <i>the</i> warrior king assumes control, He organizes society to be to his liking:<br>** hierarchical control structures/models (that work so well in the army): his warrior buddies at the top, tradesmen to the rear, women and other breed stock back at camp/the city along with the rest of the property,...<br> ** simple, uniform rules so (a) any idiot can follow them, and (b) He can more easily see if people are not following His plan.<br>* the exegencies of war cause beliefs effective there to spread (not necessarily effectively) into other spheres of life, such as:<br>** bigger is (always) better<br>** "you're for me or against me" either-or thinking that limits alternatives<br>** you must obey (and support via taxes/tithes) your betters.<br>* the "religious sensibilities" (thanks JMG) of people change from projecting the seemingly intelligent causal agency behind every (kind of) tree, animal, force of nature important in people's lives onto being<b>s</b> ("Gods") who are similar to us only "more" (e.g. polytheism, including female gods) to projecting the most important thing in peoples lives - our warrior king/emperor - onto a monotheistic (male) god who is like the king, only "more" (bad-ass, e.g. "good" criteria according to the world view of <i>the</i> warrior king).<br>** Since our king has enemies, God has enemies too.<br>** thus there are enemies "out there" in the world<br>** nature is not (always) obedient, benevolent,…, so it must be an enemy.<br>* "uneasy lies the head that wears the crown" leads to a general paranoia (and nature is one of the suspicious potential enemies).<br>* any priests/shamans either keep quiet, or adapt their theology to what is politically expedient/pleasing to His majesty/..., so out go references to Goddess(es) (and thence much attention to "Mother" Nature), and in come ideas of manifest destiny, divine right of kings, no more women priests, …<br><br><br><br><a href=#c3552427188871996052 title="comment permalink">11/12/13, 4:51 AM</a><br><br>

Choose whichever of those "r" verbs reflects your own personal morals, prejudices, and views of these past social structures. Post-Roman dark age Europe was not a line-by-line rehash of pre-Roman iron age Europe.

But I'm out of my field here and vaguely quoting past conversations with more knowledgeable friends.<br><br>There's an interesting recent book, Catching Fire, which proposes that the practise of cooking is not only what turned habilines into protohumans and protohumans into recognisable humans -- but also that it may explain the invention of patriarchy or male supremacy. The argument is pretty cogent, or seemed so to me on first reading. I won't burn up space here reproducing it, but I do recommend the book, which is not brilliant prose but (for prehistory buffs) pretty gripping reading. It goes far to explain why male dominance is also documented in pre-agrarian or minimally agrarian cultures; worldwide, even "noble savages" who live by gathering and hunting maintain the "right" of a hunting male to beat his wife if she hasn't got supper ready when he comes home.<br><br>The formation of warrior bands seems like a natural extension of the formation of hunting bands (even chimps band together to hunt, e.g., colobus monkeys, though the calorific payback is slender enough that they only do so casually and not as an all-day affair). If the payback were significant (large hauls of stored food, captive slaves, etc) then specialisation and full-time brigandage might be adaptive, at least in the short term; and the short term, when talking about empires and civilisations, is pretty long from a human point of view. Many generations might continue to see advantage and prosperity in a king-centric, warlike, brigandly lifeway before the inevitable overshoot and rot of Empire kick in.<br><br>As to brutality making a comeback -- it never left. It just moved farther away from view; instead of seeing sickly, starving mill workers languishing in misery in your own home town, they are tucked away in Bangladesh or an FTZ in Mexico. Out of sight, out of mind... the brutal exploitation of labour hasn't stopped, it's just gone offshore. And cruelty to animals is practised on a scale so vast and so spine-chillingly industrial that I think we outdo even the brutal Victorians in our willingness and capacity to inflict animal suffering. People may, probably will, get used to seeing it up front and personal again. Maybe that's better; it at least offers a *chance* to respond with compassion and an attempt at betterment. The secrecy of our present systems of cruelty, their invisibility, is part of their wickedness.<br><br>I have to take minor issue with the the notion that "nature" has dished up the typhoon that recently hit the Philippines... Seems to me that the industrial age of fossil exploitation is what delivered this particular "gift", or at least magnified it to its record-setting stature. Frightening. Grief-inducing. Guilt-inducing.<br><br><a href=#c146086268924440865 title="comment permalink">11/12/13, 1:22 PM</a><br><br>
