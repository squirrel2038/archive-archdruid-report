<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i> suggested that the normal aftermath of an age of reason is a return to religion—in Spengler’s terms, a Second Religiosity—as the only effective<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>bulwark against the nihilistic spiral set in motion by the barbarism of reflection. Yes, I’m aware that that’s a controversial claim, not least because so many devout believers in the contemporary cult of progress insist so loudly on seeing all religions but theirs as so many outworn relics of the superstitious past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is’s a common sentiment among rationalists in every civilization, especially in the twilight years of ages of reason, and it tends to remain popular right up until the Second Religiosity goes mainstream and leaves the rationalists sitting in the dust wondering what happened. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d like to suggest that we’re on the brink of a similar transformation in the modern industrial world. The question that comes first to many minds when that suggestion gets made, though, is what religion or religions are most likely to provide the frame around which a contemporary Second Religiosity will take shape. It’s a reasonable question, but for several reasons it’s remarkably hard to answer. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first and broadest reason for the difficulty is that the overall shape of a civilization’s history may be determined by laws of historical change, but the details are not. It was as certain as anything can be that some nation or other was going to replace Britain as global superpower when the British Empire ran itself into the ground in the early twentieth century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That it turned out to be the United States, though, was the result of chains of happenstance and choices of individual people going back to the eighteenth century if not furthr.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If Britain had conciliated the American colonists before 1776, for example, as it later did in Australia and elsewhere, what is now the United States would have remained an agrarian colony dependent on British industry, there would have been no American industrial and military colossus to come to Britain’s rescue in 1917 and 1942, and we would all quite likely be speaking German today as we prepared to celebrate the birthday of Emperor Wilhelm VI. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the same way, that some religion will become the focus of the Second Religiosity in any particular culture is a given; which religion it will be, though, is a matter of happenstance and the choices of individuals. It’s possible that an astute Roman with a sufficiently keen historical sense could have looked over the failing rationalisms of his world in the second century CE and guessed that one or another religion from what we call the Middle East would be most likely to replace the traditional cults of the Roman gods, but which one? Guessing that would, I think, have been beyond anyone’s powers; had the Emperor Julian lived long enough to complete his religious counterrevolution, for that matter, a resurgent Paganism might have become the vehicle for the Roman Second Religiosity, and Constantine might have had no more influence on later religious history than his predecessor Heliogabalus. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The sheer contingency of historical change forms one obstacle in the way of prediction, then. Another factor comes from a distinctive rhythm that shapes the history of popular religion in American culture. From colonial times on, American pop spiritualities have had a normal life cycle of between thirty and forty years. After a formative period of varying length, they grab the limelight, go through predictable changes over the standard three- to four-decade span, and then either crash and burn in some colorful manner or fade quietly away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>What makes this particularly interesting is that there’s quite a bit of synchronization involved; in any given decade, that is, the pop spiritualities then in the public eye will all be going through a similar stage in their life cycles. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The late 1970s, for example, saw the simultaneous emergence of four popular movements of this kind:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Protestant fundamentalism, Neopaganism, the New Age, and the evangelical atheist materialism of the so-called Sceptic movement. In 1970, none of those movements had any public presence worth noticing:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>fundamentalism was widely dismissed as a has-been phenomenon that hadn’t shown any vitality since the 1920s, the term “Neopagan” was mostly used by literary critics talking about an assortment of dead British poets, the fusion of surviving fragments of 1920s New Thought and Theosophy with the UFO scene that would give rise<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>to the New Age was still out on the furthest edge of fringe culture, and the most popular and visible figures in the scientific communtiy were more interested in studying parapsychology and Asian mysticism than in denouncing them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The pop spiritualities that were on their way out in 1970, in turn, had emerged together in the wake of the Great Depression, and replaced another set that came of age around 1900. That quasi-generational rhythm has to be kept in mind when making predictions about American pop religious movements, because very often, whatever’s biggest, strongest, and most enthusiastically claiming respectability at any given time will soon be heading back out to the fringes or plunging into oblivion. It may return after another three or four decades—Protestant fundamentalism had its first run from just before 1900 to the immediate aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash, for example, and then returned for a second pass in the late 1970s—and a movement that survives a few such cycles may well be able to establish itself over the long term as a successful denomination. Even if it does accomplish this, though, it’s likely to find itself gaining and losing membership and influence over the same cycle thereafter. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The stage of the cycle we’re in right now, as suggested above, is the one in which established pop spiritualities head for the fringes or the compost heap, and new movements vie for the opportunity to take their places. Which movements are likely to replace fundamentalism, Neopaganism, the New Age and today’s “angry atheists” as they sunset out? Once again, that depends on happenstance and individual choices, and so is far from easy to predict in advance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are certain regularities:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>for example, liberal and conservative Christian denominations take turns in the limelight, so it’s fairly likely that the next major wave of American Christianity will be aligned with liberal causes—though it’s anyone’s guess which denominations will take the lead here, and which will remain mired in the fashionable agnosticism and the entirely social and secular understanding of religion that’s made so many liberal churches so irrelevant to the religious needs of their potential congregations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In much the same way, American scientific institutions alternate between openness to spirituality and violent rejection of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The era of the American Society for Psychical Research was followed by that of the war against the Spiritualists, that gave way to a postwar era in which physicists read Jung and the Tao Te Ching and physicians interested themselves in alternative medicine, and that was followed in turn by the era of the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal and today’s strident<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>evangelical atheism; a turn back toward openness is thus probably likely in the decades ahead. Still, those are probabilities, not certainties, and many other aspects of American religious pop culture are a good deal less subject to repeating patterns of this kind.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this puts up serious barriers to guessing the shape of the Second Religiosity as that takes shape in deindustrializing America, and I’m not even going to try to sort out the broader religious future of the rest of today’s industrial world—that would take a level of familiarity with local religious traditions, cultural cycles, and collective thinking that I simply don’t have. Here in the United States, it’s hard enough to see past the large but faltering pop spiritual movements of the current cycle, guess at what might replace them, and try to anticipate which of them might succeed in meeting the two requirements I mentioned at the end of last week’s post, which the core tradition or traditions of our approaching Second Religiosity must have: the capacity to make the transition from the religious sensibility of the past to the religious sensibility that’s replacing it, and a willingness to abandon the institutional support of the existing order of society and stand apart from the economic benefits as well as the values of a dying civilization.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Both of those are real challenges. The religious sensibility fading out around us has for its cornerstone the insistence that humanity stands apart from nature and deserves some better world than the one in which we find ourselves. The <a href=../../2013/11/toward-green-future-part-one-culture-of.html>pervasive biophobia</a> of that sensibility, its obsession with imagery of <a href=../../2013/09/which-way-to-heaven.html>risingup from the earth's surface</a>, and most of its other features unfold from a basic conviction that, to borrow a phrase from one currently popular denomination of progress worshippers, humanity is only temporarily “stuck on this rock”—the “rock” in question, of course, being the living Earth in all her beauty and grandeur—and will be heading for something bigger, better, and a good deal less biological just as soon as God or technology or some other allegedly beneficent power gets around to rescuing us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is exactly what the rising religious sensibility of our age rejects. More and more often these days, as I’ve mentioned in previous posts, I encounter people for whom “this rock” is not a prison, a place of exile, a cradle, or even a home, but the whole of which human beings are an inextricable part. These people aren’t looking for salvation, at least in the sense that word has been given in the religious sensibility of the last two millennia or so, and which was adopted from that sensibility by the theist and civil religions of the Western world during that time; they are not pounding on the doors of the human condition, trying to get out, or consoling themselves with the belief that sooner or later someone or something is going to rescue them from the supposedly horrible burden of having bodies that pass through the extraordinary journey of ripening toward death that we call life. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They are seeking, many of these people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They are not satisfied with who they are or how they relate to the cosmos, and so they have needs that a religion can meet, but what they are seeking is wholeness within a greater whole, a sense of connection and community that embraces not only other people but the entire universe around them, and the creative power or powers that move through that universe and sustain its being and theirs. Many of them are comfortable with their own mortality and at ease with what Christian theologians call humanity’s “creaturely status,” the finite and dependent nature of our existence; what troubles them is not the inevitability of death or the reality of limits, but a lack of felt connection with the cosmos and with the whole systems that sustain their lives. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suspect, to return to a metaphor I used in an earlier post here, that this rising sensibility is one of the factors that made the recent movie <i>Gravity</i> so wildly popular. The entire plot of the film centers on Sandra Bullock’s struggle to escape from the lifeless and lethal vacuum of space and find a way back to the one place in the solar system where human beings actually belong. To judge by the emails and letters I receive and the conversations I have, that’s a struggle with which many people in today’s industrial world can readily identify. The void scattered with sharp-edged debris they sense around them is more metaphorical than the one Bullock’s character has to face, but it’s no less real for that. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Can the traditions of the current religious mainstream or its established rivals speak to such people? Yes, though it’s going to take some significant rethinking of habitual language and practice to shake off the legacies of the old religious sensibility and find ways to address the needs and possibilities of the new one. It’s entirely possible that one or another denomination of Christianity might do that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It’s at least as possible that one or another denomination of Buddhism, the most solidly established of the current crop of imported faiths, could do it instead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, the jury’s still out.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second requirement for a successful response to the challenge of the Second Religiosity bears down with particular force against these and other established religious institutions. Most American denominations of Christianity and Buddhism alike, for example, have a great deal of expensive infrastructure to support—churches and related institutions in the case of Christianity; monasteries, temples, and retreat centers in the case of Buddhism—and most of the successful denominations of both faiths, in order to pay for these things, have by and large taken up the same strategy of pandering to the privileged classes of American society. That’s a highly successful approach in the short term, but the emergence of a Second Religiosity is not a short term phenomenon; those religious movements that tie themselves too tightly to middle or upper middle class audiences are likely to find, as the floodwaters of change rise, that they’ve lashed themselves to a stone and will sink along with it.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In an age of decline, religious institutions that have heavy financial commitments usually end up in deep trouble, and those that depend on support from the upper reaches of the social pyramid usually land in deeper trouble still. It’s those traditions that can handle poverty without blinking that are best able to maintain themselves in hard times, just as it’s usually those same traditions that an increasingly impoverished society finds most congenial and easiest to support. Christianity in the late Roman world was primarily a religion of the urban poor, with a modest sprinkling of downwardly mobile middle-class intellectuals in their midst; Christianity in the Dark Ages was typified by monastic establishments whose members were even poorer than the impoverished peasants around them. Buddhism was founded by a prince but very quickly learned that absolute non-attachment to material wealth was not only a spiritual virtue but a very effective practical strategy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In both cases, though, that was a long time ago, and most American forms of both religions—and most others, for that matter—are heavily dependent on access to middle- and upper middle-class parishioners and their funds. If that continues, it’s likely to leave the field wide open to the religions of the poor, to new religious movements that grasp the necessity of shoestring budgets and very modest lifestyles, or to further imports from abroad that retain Third World attitudes toward wealth. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m often asked in this context about the possibility that Druidry, the faith tradition I practice, might end up filling a core role in the Second Religiosity of industrial civilization. It’s true that we embraced the new religious sensibility long before it was popular elsewhere, and equally true that shoestring budgets and unpaid clergy are pretty much universal in Druid practice. Still, the only way I can see Druidry becoming a major factor in the deindustrial age is if every other faith falls flat on its nose; we have a strike against us that most other religious movements don’t have. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No, I don’t mean the accelerating decline of today’s pop Neopaganism. Old-fashioned Druid orders such as <a href=http://www.aoda.org/ >AODA</a>, the order I head, routinely get confused with the Neopagan scene these days, but we were around long before Neopaganism began to take shape in the late 1970s—AODA was chartered in 1912, and traces its roots back to the eighteenth century—and we expect to be around long after it has cycled back out of fashion. If anything, the volunteer staff who handles AODA’s correspondence will be grateful for fewer emails saying, “Hi, I want to know if you have a grove in my area I can circle with on the Sabbats—Blessed be!” and thus less need for return emails explaining that we aren’t Wiccans and don’t celebrate the Sabbats, and that our groves and study groups are there to provide support for our initiates, not to put on ceremonies for casual attendees. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, AODA is an initiatory order, not a church in the doors-wide-open sense of the word, and that’s the strike against us mentioned above. I suspect most of my readers will have little if any notion of the quiet subculture of initiatory orders in the modern industrial world. There are a great many of them, mostly quite small, offering instruction in meditation, ritual, and a range of other transformative practices to those<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>interested in such things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Initiatory orders in the Western world have usually been independent of public religious institutions—this was also true in classical times, when the Dionysian and Orphic mysteries, the Pythagorean Brotherhood, and later on the Neoplatonists and Gnostic sects filled much the same role we do today—while those in Asian countries are usually affiliated with the religious mainstream. In traditional Japan, for example, people interested in the sort of thing initiatory orders do could readily find their way to esoteric schools<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>of Buddhism, such as the Shingon sect; this side of the Ganges, by contrast, attitudes of the religious mainstream toward such traditions have tended to veer from toleration through disapproval to violent persecution and back again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Eccentric as it is, the world of initiatory orders has been my spiritual home since I got dissatisfied with the casual irreligion of my birth family and went looking for something that made more sense. <a href="http://redwheelweiser.com/detail.html?id=9781578634897">A book I published last year</a> tried to sum up some of what that world and its teachings have to say concerning the age of limits now upon us, and it had a modest success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, one thing all of us in the initiatory orders learn early on is that our work is something that appeals only to the few. Self-unfoldment through disciplines of realization, to borrow a crisp definition from what was once a widely read book on the subject, involves a great deal of hard and unromantic work on the self. For those of us who are called to it, there’s nothing more rewarding—but not that many people are called to it. </div>

I’ll be talking about that more next week. </span></div>

I find I get along well with most of the old-fashioned polytheist faiths. <br><br>Justin, even if the budget did cover billboards, we wouldn't use them. You might consider reading the book of mine I cited, which covers some of the things to look for (and run from) in assessing an initiatory order; then begin asking around. It's rarely hard to find either a local lodge or one of the groups, such as AODA, that does distance learning programs.<br><br><a href=#c3392519109942045179 title="comment permalink">11/27/13, 9:58 PM</a><br><br>

In essence rather than being centers of community, they try to be centers of the whole world. These groups cannot survive a world where religion must serve the needs close to home first.<br><br> The Neopagan groups typically divide into a number of different groups. There are the initiatory orders you talk about (I am a Master in the Rune Gild for example). There are also the highly Utopian groups. Then there are the groups who stress study of the past and trying to re-implement the social institutions from ages ago.<br><br>These groups change over time because of the interplay between all three, their own traditions, needs, and desires, and academic research. Frazer's Golden Bough gives way to Daniel Ogden's books on Greco-Roman necromancy. All sides are grappling with significant issues but missing the point.<br><br>For a religion to succeed in the new world, it can't be primarily about belief. That Hellenistic innovation that made belief a religious practice (which has been totally internalized in Christianity and Islam) does not work in a sceptical culture. Many of the people who can be reached today are not "believers" but "doers," "thinkers," and "contemplative types." To reach the reflective stage one has to accept that the trend towards nihilism is fine as a first step as long as the tradition can cope with it and help people forward.<br><br>There are some groups that are uniquely prepared for the coming crisis. These include both the Catholic and Orthodox churches, but also the more communitarian approaches to Neopaganism as well. There are few, if any. Protestant groups who stand a chance of doing much (the Quakers will probably do ok, as might the various Anabaptist groups).<br><br>But one mistake that people make is in assuming that we will see a religion spread the way we did with Rome. In Rome you had an explicit state religion with a lot of tolerance (until relatively late). In the US we have no explicit state religion and so there is a lot of room for pluralism that didn't exist in Rome.<br><br>The one prediction I would make is that instead of the Roman model of a religion succeeding the empire, I would suggest we will have a fracturing along with our political union and that we will not have a single religion that will take over, but rather a hodge-podge and a return to localism there.<br><br><a href=#c5170716462373907544 title="comment permalink">11/27/13, 10:44 PM</a><br><br>

I wouldn't be totally surprised to see a religious sensibility latch on to a mass media series past, present, or future. I know several people who have taken alot of their... lets just say spirituality from a Media series. Myself I grew up with moral axioms from Star Trek: The Next Generation, though over the years about a third have been abandoned, and a third made derivative to other values. Heck, alot of the thinking that I was going through when I became aware of peak oil and started thinking on what that meant for my life was heavily influenced by a childrens cartoon, Avatar the Last Air Bender. And with even slightly less fanciful fair it is easy to see some old plots find their way in to having happened in mythological time.<br><br>Well, something like that happening is probably a long shot, but I think that the fact that our culture is so connected in such very complicated and multi layered ways makes is especially hard to guess our a signal from the static. The idea of a media series as religious seed means to me that there could be some pretty weird black swan and odd duck religions getting there shots during the process.<br><br>Unpredictable as it is which black swan will lay the golden tradition, I look forward to more thoughts on how to distinguish Black Swans from Red Herrings.<br><br><a href=#c8629055822703599495 title="comment permalink">11/27/13, 11:12 PM</a><br><br>

Yet it also highlighted the social tensions and changing times and ultimately the self-absorption of the bored citizens whose leaders eventually abandoned a project that required a huge percentage of the industrial resources of the most technologically advanced nation on earth, swimming in fossil-energy, to create the machines that went only as far as the nearest celestial body. Now they can no longer even afford to go into near-earth orbit.<br>As we are to have a new religion for a new time, it might well become the Catholic Church, now that it is led by a man who has put the environment (biophilia) at the top of his agenda and seems to be turning the focus of the church from quality of afterlife and towards quality of life. However, as almost all the neopagans that I know are all rather poor and scraping to get by and more focused on the spiritual than the material, so it still might be a good candidate, pop culture and your experience at various festivals notwithstanding.<br>But the new religion and the changing religious sensibilty also needs inspiring words, that can keep people spiritually buoyed and motivated to carry on through the coming years of material hardship. Something more along the lines of Winston Churchill and his "Blood, Toil, Tears, &amp; Sweat" speech (http://history1900s.about.com/od/1940s/a/churchillbloodspeech.htm). His view was in months and years, of course, but his sentiment was not 'we are going to the stars because we choose to for the adventure because it is our destiny, &amp;c.' but rather 'we face hard times and it will be tough and we will have a difficult struggle, but ultimately, because we have grit and determination and will and faith, we shall survive and eventually we will recover and become prosperous again.' Not so much the depressing bitterness of Hesiod. I suspect that was the genesis of biophobia and the shift to a religious sensibility that was all about leaving this harsh, brutal Earth for a glorious future in the heavens. Just as actually going to that stark, lifeless landscape probably has much to do with the popular awakening of a new sensibility, as exemplified in "Gravity" that life is down here and it is good. (As you have probably not seen it, the final scene has a nearly naked Sandra Bullock, devoid of all technological gadgets and dripping wet from her underwater escape, walking on a beach into a tropical paradise. The symbolism is almost painfully obvious.)<br><br><a href=#c4985872264164999289 title="comment permalink">11/27/13, 11:18 PM</a><br><br>

Francis is really focusing the church on the plight of the poor. Also, the Catholic Church is supposedly loaded, so they've got an edge there. As a Catholic, I'm fine if it winds up winning out. I love the moral teachings of Jesus and like the idea of a heaven. It provides hope when your life on earth stinks.<br><br>On the other hand, I definitely feel the strong spiritual connection to nature and the cosmos that are core to the Druid teachings, and there's nothing at all about that in the Bible. Because of this lack of nature veneration in the Bible, I've been unable to come up with a way to merge Christianity with Druidism in my mind without cognitive dissonance.<br><br>I live in a suburb where man has replaced nature with artifice at every opportunity. Even the nature is fake, as this place is really a desert but has been irrigated to appear as something else. I spend much of my days working in a grey cubicle, totally isolated from nature. This makes it hard to experience the 2nd religiosity in my daily life.

I actually did a bit of research into why Buddhism in India suddenly crashed in the 3rd century. The archaeological record actually demonstrates this as do the texts.<br><br>In a nutshell, it was a capital intensive institution in India tied in heavily with merchant interests. What happened in the 3rd century? Rome's economy was failing, the Han Dynasty collapsed and the Parthians were overthrown. The international trade based economy of India suddenly halted and Buddhism fell apart at the seams.<br><br>I wrote about this if you're interested:<br><br>http://huayanzang.blogspot.com/2013/07/rome-persia-china-and-indian-buddhism.html<br><br>As a modern day Buddhism monk, I'm increasingly concerned with the capital intensive nature of Buddhist operations. As you say, in the west they tend to cater to wealthy middle class types where retreats can easily cost $700 or more. Tibetan Buddhism here in Nepal and India build castles in the sky with money from Singapore and Hong Kong.<br><br>Looking back at history, I see how the Chan school survived the end of the Tang and even thrived, probably largely due to them being self-sufficient farmers not relying on state or aristocratic support.

Our small congregation, faced with an aging building literally falling down in places on our heads, borrowed money to correct the problems and improve the design. That started, oh, about 14 years ago, when everyone was getting rich on the Tech Bubble. Since then, some of our generous, middle-class members have wandered away, relocated, or died; no one feels quite so prosperous, and (as readers of TADR know) the future is not so bright. Now, we have an annual budget of about $200,000, and an annual deficit of about $50,000. <br><br>This was enabled by a massive bequest, which is now nearly exhausted, and then What Will We Do? "The Rationalists" said that we could cut the Pastor's salary in half (accepting half-time service) and make a few other painful cuts, and balance next year's expenses with last year's income. "The Faithful" said that to cut back was simply a surrender to extinction, and that new initiatives for fund raising could support Business As Usual (as long as we all Do Our Part). <br><br>The Rationalists point out that many of the same plans and efforts had been enthusiastically announced at the start of the prior fiscal year, when disaster was yet far off. The Faithful respond that "this year, we are Serious, and more capable." (This is true, but whether or not it is enough remains to be seen.)<br><br>As for me, I turned over some idle sod near a south-facing wall of the church building a year ago, and planted a thriving garden of herbs and vegetables last Spring. It is of no economic significance. However, if someone living in an urban apartment needs to put their hands into the Earth to restore their Soul, this is a place where they can do that.<br><br><br><a href=#c4798475489600437813 title="comment permalink">11/28/13, 7:54 AM</a><br><br>

However there is a very powerful fairy tale from my childhood that always comes to mind: The grandson of Death.<br><br>There was a farmer, looking for a godfather for his newborn son. The devil comes, but is dismissed on the grounds that whatever favor he gives, will eventually result in eternal damnation. Jesus also comes, but is also dismissed on the grounds of not doing anything to lighten the burdens of the people.<br><br>Then Death herself shows up, and the farmer accepts her as godmother since she is the fairest of all: she does not discriminate anyone and levels down the rich and the powerful.<br><br>Under Death's wing, the boy grows to become a man and a most respected medical doctor. She gives him the secrets to cure every illness, but he must abide by refusing to treat those that are already marked to die.<br><br>The young doctor of course does not abide, and makes his name by saving the lifes of the king first, and then his daughter, whose hand is given as a reward. Life is sweet, nothing could go wrong.<br><br>Except Death shows up again and takes the doctor to a field with multiple candles of varying lengths. She explains every human being gets granted a candle at birth, and when it is consumed, it's time to die. <br><br>She further explains that by his healing of people whose candle is no more, she has been forced to cut off a piece of his own candle to give to the others. A small piece for the old king, but a very sizable piece for the princess. Then she shows him his candle, barely a tiny, flickering light about to fade away.<br><br>The young doctor gets to live enough to realize that by pursuing his dreams of fame and fortune and being willing to toy with powers beyond his comprehension, he is going to die before having a chance to reap his ill-gotten reward. Then he dies of a hearth stroke.<br><br>On the other hand, Death ends up broken hearted from the premature demise of her child, and pledges never to be a godmother again.<br><br><a href=#c5726387380237711651 title="comment permalink">11/28/13, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

There's an element of passion involved in the widespread acceptance of a new religion, a non-rational immersion into emotion. We're all approaching this as post-Platonic philosophers watching the classical Pagan world lose steam.<br><br>I don't see any proselytes, here. Well, at least not for anything new. There's been a fair showing of proselytes for the old, and they're not making a lot of converts. :-)<br><br>There's another aspect to this.<br><br>In the late third century, Christianity was a minority religion, accounting for perhaps five percent of the Roman population from what I understand, mostly among the slave and poverty classes. By the end of the fourth century, Christianity was predominant in Rome, and the Christians were beginning to tear down the Pagan temples and smash the religious iconography.<br><br>What made for the huge and sudden swell in Christian popularity was apparently the overt government sponsorship that began under Constantine, and escalated with later emperors. This sponsorship included, among other things, tax and legal advantages conferred by conversion to the new faith.<br><br>Let's say, for argument's sake, that the US Government decided to throw out the Bill of Rights entirely -- it's already done a fair job of that, so it wouldn't be much of a stretch -- and decided to underwrite… oh, pick any religion. Baha'i, say. Let's say that it increased the tax rate to 30% at the lowest tax bracket, and 90% at the highest bracket, UNLESS you could demonstrate "good standing" as a member of the Congregation of the Prophet Baha'u'llah, in which case you'd get the current tax rates.<br><br>Assuming that the government survived the attempt, how long would it take for all the good Christians of the United States to convert? I'm guessing Bahaism would become a majority religion within a couple of years, and would drive every other religion underground within a generation. Assuming a slow government collapse over a few centuries, even the underground churches would die out, leaving Baha'i the clear successor to Christianity.<br><br>A similar thing happened in the Soviet Union. Both Communism and Atheism were religions imposed by the state, and everyone became both Communist and Atheist. It didn't take long.<br><br>There are a lot of flaws in both Communism and in Atheism as religions -- they're civil religions, among other things -- and the SU did not collapse slowly over the course of centuries. So from what I understand, traditional religions simply went underground in the Soviet Union and enjoyed considerable covert popularity, and when the government collapsed, they came back out of hiding. We might imagine the same would have happened to classical Paganism had the Roman government collapsed completely in the late fourth century.<br><br>I don't know how overt government support of religion worked in the other historical patterns you've cited. It's certainly beneficial to the spread of a religion. Does it seem to be necessary?<br><br><a href=#c2166106553573262104 title="comment permalink">11/28/13, 8:58 AM</a><br><br>

You have absolutely nailed many of the material and metaphysical aspects of the path that many of us<br>are trying to find. For the past five years I too have followed an initiatory Druid path (OBOD), and when people ask me what I believe in, or hope to learn, I really don't have an answer. Not because I don't know these things, but because I haven't been able to explain them in a way that makes sense to most people. Now I may tell them "read this,", it's the best general description I've found. <br><br>I would add to your observation that such a path "involves a great deal of hard and unromantic work on the self," that there is no guarantee that you will attain anything more than a working knowledge of the principles of your particular path. Whether you are able to internalize these principles and apply them in a way that bridges the gap between a spiritual life and the wasteland that is modern popular culture, and make your life more meaningful and rich, is up to you. My personal choice is that it is better to be a pilgrim on the road to somewhere actively seeking something than it is to just sit and watch the whole thing unravel, as it surely will. <br><br><br><a href=#c6457367087276377003 title="comment permalink">11/28/13, 9:26 AM</a><br><br>

Such is the case with Doris Lessing and myself. Doris Lessing died November 17th the age of 94. Shortlisted for the Booker Prize three times and winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize for Literature I feel a tinge of embarrassment that I did not know of her sooner. But dwelling with this emotion is foolish. Long gone are the times when one can know all the great ones or read their works. The world is a big place. I feel the germ of an essay by itself with this observation but right now that would be a diversion. <br> <br>Finally knowing of Doris I learned she had given the 1985 CBC Massey Lecture series, "Prisons We Choose to Live Inside". I've downloaded these lectures and am now in the process of listening to them. <br> <br>In the third lecture Doris mentions a researcher at a certain university who with brainwashing techniques brags they are able to take a true believer; say a flatlander and in succession turn this true believer over a period of days into: A Seventh Day Adventist, a Stalinist Communist, a Liberal, a Feminist, a Hard Line Atheist and then restore the true believer to their original beliefs.<br><br>It is interesting to contemplate which vegetable will rise to the top of the boiling cauldron of social angst as the result of intentional and unintentional manipulations. Mass media will play a role in injecting competing memes and state sponsored memes will be favored as the mysterious 'powers that be' push their preferred versions on an unsuspecting public. A new state sponsored religiosity may bubble to the top of the pot and dominate in the end or a backlash could happen and any state sponsored religiosity pushed on the public could be rejected, perhaps violently.<br><br>The public yearns for community and connection because they don't have it. Modern life has isolated everyone into bubbles of individual experience where social connections have degenerated into tenuous and impersonal electronic links. Those who control these links are in a unique position by which they can attempt to inject a new religiosity of their choice. They may be successful or they may not. I'm not trying to answer that question. I am only suggesting the possibility that we should pay attention to what is being pushed at us and why.<br><br>In the movie <i>Gravity</i> you say: "<i>The entire plot of the film centers on Sandra Bullock’s struggle to escape from the lifeless and lethal vacuum of space and find a way back to the one place in the solar system where human beings actually belong.</i>"<br><br>At the end of the movie Sandra Bullock lands in a lake which I've learned was Lake Powell, Arizona (Wikipedia) but the movie itself shows greenery on the beach and in the movie the landscape surrounding the lake looked verdant. Lake Powell itself is surrounded by desert. I think special effects were at work and in the next paragraph I'm going to suggest a sinister interpretation of the movie. I don't claim to be right and if my interpretation has any merit and I don't claim it was intentionally done. I shall explain, but first the interpretation.<br><br>Space debris that results from a Russian missile destroying a defunct satellite produces a chain reaction of destruction that results in a storm of debris that periodically 'terrorizes' a space station where an American crew is at work. Using the fruits of technology Sandra Bullock escapes the destroyed space station and eventually is able to return to Earth. Technology saves Sandra and does so by conquering overwhelming odds. Physical laws are stretched and the true properties of space are ignored as needed so that technology can triumph in the end as it slays all dragons. The landing back on a warm and nurturing mother earth teaming with life is arrival in a promised land as if Sandra were a modern Moses leading her children out of a bleak and harsh wilderness using not tablets of stone but using technology.<br><br><a href=#c6514845327881771604 title="comment permalink">11/28/13, 9:29 AM</a><br><br>

A couple of years ago thorium reactors were pushed to mute the panic of Fukushima. Currently a ridiculous myth of Space Based Power Stations is being pushed to bolster the myth of 'Energy Independence'. The public is being lulled into a don't worry be happy attitude to obvious oil price rise. Don't worry everything will be all right. We have technology! That is the lie being pushed.<br><br>The contemporary cult of progress has prophets but these prophets are not standing before crowds screaming out their truth. The prophets of the cult of progress work deviously the behind the scenes and with money and power push an agenda of poison upon us.<br><br>Using your search engine of choice look for 'Space Based Power Stations'. Right now you will find many articles about them and I wonder how such a cluster of interest in the subject has suddenly been foisted upon us. Is it a spontaneous or planned phenomena. I think the question is worth asking.

However, Trippticket made a good point a while back: they're too long for most of today's "consumers" who have the attention span of a nervous squirrel. Shortening your usual essay into something that's pithy, punchy, and practical should do the trick. For example, your January 2013 essay here:<br>http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.ca/2013/01/into-unknown-country.html<br>could be trimmed down to just the list of 7 practical suggestions for those "who are interested in being part of the solution"<br>...and you could add the point you made just a week earlier (turn your thermostat down 3 degrees) to provide an answer to all the folks who are forever whining "But what can *I* do?"<br><br>Your articles would reach a larger audience and would have a correspondingly greater influence on society if they appeared as weekly columns in newspapers &amp; magazines.

And if it is true that today's scientific hard skepticism is a fad, so much the better. Many people make peace with the idea of nonoverlapping magisteria, but that is a stopgap measure. It's my understanding that reality is all of a piece - if there is spirituality then it has mechanism. If something exists so that we can in any way see an affect, then it in some sense is actually material. <br><br>In my opinion, if we would like to see a more nature loving, wholistic worldview emerge, then the above hoped for confluence of science with spirituality will certainly help, as we can dispense with the idea that our material existence and the spiritual things we long for are in different universes.<br><br>I am not rooting for Christianity, but it is not as devoid of nature respect as some say. The psalms have beautiful and poetic praises of nature, and old and new testaments use many nature metaphors that include the idea that nature and the animals participate in "being." The idea that animals do not have souls is actually rather new, and may be a result of the mechanistic revolution in science with the likes of Newton and Descartes.<br><br><a href=#c5071288396778768121 title="comment permalink">11/28/13, 10:24 AM</a><br><br>

That is to say, it's exactly the same logic that leads people to insist that there's some other way to evade the hard work of dealing with the age before us!<br><br>Chris, it's entirely possible that there will be a lot of religious diversity in the years ahead, whether that's distributed by regions or more generally. Still, if historical parallels are anything to go by, there'll also be a lot of integration -- that is, currently disparate religious traditions will find themselves sharing buildings, worshippers, ideas, and eventually either fusing or becoming parts of a larger religious system. <br><br>Ken, thank you! <br><br>Ray, a lot depends on how long modern mass media retains its hold on the collective imagination. It may be more brittle than most people expect. More on this as we proceed!<br><br>Renaissance, no argument there. Those are among the reasons that I think the game is way too early to call. <br><br>Beaver, you might have a look at some of the recent writings on an ecocentric Christianity -- one of the other commenters here has cited some authors. They apparently do a good job of finding justifications for a green spirituality within the Christian tradition. <br><br>Chris, thanks for the recommendation. I'll add it to the list of things to get to. <br><br>Shakya, that's utterly fascinating! Can you recommend a source or two on the economic roots of the Buddhist decline in 3rd century CE India? I'd like to include that in the footnotes when this series becomes a book. <br><br>Jeff, thanks for the references -- those will also be most useful. I'd noticed the increasingly shrill tone coming from the evangelical end of the apocalypse lobby, too. <br><br>Alan, I didn't realize you were a Friend as well as a friend! You've got company here -- sometimes I wonder if this blog has enough Quaker readers to hold a meeting. ;-) All jokes aside, yes, the Quaker tradition has already shown its capacity to weather rough times and persecution -- and the fact that a religion is challenging is actually a strength, not a weakness. Easy religions only flourish in easy times. <br><br>Luna, pretty much, yes. I field letters and emails fairly often from people who think <i>The Secret</i> is representative of the mystery schools, and it's very nearly the antithesis of what the initiatory orders actually teach -- if they're serious and honest, that is. As for "bring it on," hmm -- you may be right. That's an interesting possibility.<br><br><a href=#c3860194328168472090 title="comment permalink">11/28/13, 11:36 AM</a><br><br>

(The violent intolerance of the Abrahamic faiths is not shared by most other religious traditions.) If that happens, though, expect the same sort of syncretism that led to Ryobu Shinto back in the day -- the Wiccan Goddess, for example, being equated with Avalokitesvara or what have you. <br><br>Ursachi, I'm expecting Islam to be one of the new wave of popular religious movements in the US for the next thirty to forty years; it's got what I call the "shock your Mom" factor -- any really successful American pop religion has to upset and offend the older generation when it first emerges. Whether it lasts beyond that is another matter. <br><br>Rita, there's the line between the old and new religious sensibilities. It's possible to be very religious and very spiritual on both sides of that line...but the results are different. <br><br>Richard, only in regions where the forest ecosystem is dominant. In grasslands, a grassland-centered religion will do better -- and the Abrahamic faiths are desert religions, and show it. <br><br>DaShui, I'd vote for that -- and I'm pleased to note that whatever else happens, we've got a remarkably high number of martial artists in the Druid order I head. <br><br>LatheChuck, ouch. Well, I hope the Rationalists get their way before the church runs itself into the ground. <br><br>Raymond, that's a beautiful story! Many thanks for sharing it. As for Santissima Muerte, I was visiting Minneapolis a couple of years ago -- teaching a workshop there -- and made time to visit a botanica to pick up some products that are hard to find in a small Appalachian town. Votive supplies for the Pretty Girl were all over the place, and the botanica was obviously doing a steady business in them. So you may be right -- and of course the same culture of necrophilia that makes vampires and zombies so popular in America just now might also feed into that. <br><br>YZS, stranger things have happened. <br><br>Between, I'm far from sure you're right. It's hard to stay sound asleep when the bed collapses beneath you and lands you in a puddle of cold winter rain. <br><br>Joseph, my take on the historical examples is that government patronage is useful but not necessary, and not sufficient -- a religion can receive all sorts of support and still become an empty shell, the way most of the official national churches in Europe have become. (3% of people in Britain, if I recall correctly, bother to attend Anglican services these days.) <br><br>Ando, excellent! I was wondering if anybody would catch that reference. It was originally a correspondence course, meant to be worked through a month per chapter -- and well worth the time spent, by the way. <br><br>Ridgedruid, exactly. There are no guarantees, just a path leading away from the present mess toward distant hills.<br><br><a href=#c5675760555363426997 title="comment permalink">11/28/13, 11:52 AM</a><br><br>

To my mind, that's <a href=../../2010/11/no-time-for-lullabies.html rel=nofollow>just another lullaby</a>, something to soothe the fretful to sleep while the world gets colder and darker around them. The closer we get to really serious crisis, the more extravagant the claims and the more Utopian the rhetoric we can expect to see heaped up around the technological savior du jour. It's all wasted breath, because nobody's actually doing anything to make these things happen -- they're just murmuring "space based power systems" to themselves to soothe their fears as the night closes in. <br><br>Donkey, the problem is that I'm not just trying to communicate a list of things to do -- that way lies commodification and cooptation by the consumer economy. I'm trying to communicate a way of thinking. Newspaper syndication won't allow that. That said, I wouldn't turn down a regular column in a quarterly magazine or what have you -- that could work very well, and would be the form in which these reflections would probably see print if the internet hadn't been invented. <br><br>Onething, excellent -- it's always good to see somebody learning from history. You're quite right; in medieval times, plants were considered to have one soul, animals two, and humans three -- the vegetative soul which produced life and growth, the animal soul which produced perception and desire, and the rational soul which produced thought and self-consciousness. The early scientists who insisted that plants and animals have no soul at all were making a radical break from the past, and not a wise one, either.<br><br><a href=#c4360683744136497625 title="comment permalink">11/28/13, 12:02 PM</a><br><br>

However, the groups that generated the movement were publicly active at least as early as the mid to late 1960s. <br><br>An initiatory witchcraft tradition called the New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn (NROOGD for short) began leading public pagan rituals in the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1960s. When I first encountered the NROOGD in 1973, their open sabbats were always attended by more than one hundred people. These sabbats were a meeting place between seekers and leaders of the whole local pagan community. Other groups active in that community in the mid-Seventies included the Anderson Feri Craft tradition, Dianic witches, the Reformed Druids of North America, the Church of All Worlds, a panpagan group called Nemeton, the OTO and a few heathens. A national witchcraft organization, The Covenant of the Goddess www.cog.org was founded in the SFBA in 1975.<br><br>This community, consisting of a few hundred people, was active, collegial, creative and influential within the wider movement; I'm told that Ronald Hutton has compared it to Periclean Athens. It was a heady experience for me as a young woman to be part of it.<br> <br>The late Sixties and early 1970s were also the nascent period for the Women's Spirituality Movement, an outgrowth of Second Wave Feminism that draws from and overlaps with popular neopaganism. A community of feminists in Wolf Creek, Oregon were holding public rituals circa 1972 and published the quarterly Womanspirit from 1974 to 1983.<br><br>There were other publicly active neopagan groups from the mid 19760s onward in Southern California, New York and New England. No comprehensive history of American Neopaganism in the immediate postwar decades has yet been published.

Any religion that can actually work miracles or do effective magic (or at least can appear to do so) will have a huge advantage over religions that cannot, or do not, or will not work miracles (or magic). <br><br>One of the most useful ancient writers for understanding how and why Christianity caught on was a Pagan philosopher named Celsus, who seems to have lived in the 2nd century CE. His book against Christianity has survived only as brief extracts in a refutation penned an early Christian writer named Origen. Even in this form, it is clear that in Celsus' time, outsiders saw Christianity as a society run by miracle-workers (or magicians) who could lighten (or seem to lighten) the suffering and burden of the unwashed masses, and thereby win real power. <br><br>And precisely this was why, in Celsus' view, no self-respecting, educated, responsible person should ever become a Christian. <br><br>Either there was no such thing as miracles (or effective magic spells), and then Christianity was all just a hoax exploiting the superstitious beliefs of the masses; or, if some people actually could work miracles (or do magic and get results), they were a menace to the state and thus should be treated as criminals.<br><br>I think that whatever underlies our own coming second religiosity will be something that offers (or seems to offer) the desperate masses either effective magic or genuine miracle. As I survey the current religious landscape, the foremost contenders now seem to me to be such things as Hoodoo, the cult of Santissima Muerte, religions like Santeria and Vodou, and possibly some of the Pentecostal Churches.<br><br>This, obviously, shuts out everyone who places his or her faith in rationalism, science, technology, and so forth. It also shuts out anyone who thinks that such a thing as, say, Hoodoo, is beneath his dignity or notice, or is too heavily invested in the current intellectual order of our society.<br><br>And to those readers of the blog who firmly maintain that miracles cannot happen, and magic cannot work, except by deliberate fraud, I say, it's really not at all that simple. But discussing that right now would make this comment too long. <br><br><br><a href=#c600537257819553664 title="comment permalink">11/28/13, 2:19 PM</a><br><br>

A few of them went on to make the big time, as Neopaganism did, and became significant forces in pop culture. The vast majority didn't.

What I think I see is ad hoc creation of mass societies that not surprisingly have following the old patterns of imperialism; that is, followed patterns not uncommon during previous examples of expansion with their accompanying pressure on ‘carrying capacity’ and iterative competition for economic resources. In this case though, western imperialism has not then led to periods of extended stability or stasis; in fact the reverse, and has no prospect of doing so.<br><br> These mass societies have acquired a unique global reach and triggered even bigger collateral expansions, and developed possibly unique characteristics. In particular I see the massive expansion of what has been called “print-capitalism” morphing recently into electronic forms inhabiting our personal and collective nervous systems. This is the culture of persuaded shared imaginations – an ‘age of persuasion’ rather than reason, perhaps culminating in our present crescendo? A commentator I respect has said privately; “humanity as hive”.<br><br>I wonder, however, if the ‘pseudo-faith’ we think of as Progress will die so swiftly everywhere, even when cut-off from its fuel source? I can see it linger as a cut-down or re-interpreted credo for a good while yet in significant parts of the globe, and perhaps become incorporated in any ‘new’ widely distributed religious sensibility. These new sensibilities tend to hark back to lost antecedents?<br><br>Differently, I can imagine the attractions of rational thought continuing to have wide appeal across the globe as a means of rescuing sensibility from the suffocating limitations of dogmas, or of village life, much as even now it can be a relief in suburbia. I think of the continuing appeal across millennia and many cultures of Buddhism, with its often broader more equable place in collective imaginations –and a personal haven in our individual minds – not carrying the baggage of theisms. Once one knows these places are there, they are not so easily forgotten.<br> <br>Who can know, as you rightly point out, where the tides of sensibility will wash up, but my guess FWIW is that the USA will not be the hub for any major successor sensibility, if the world does spring a major religion inheriting the aftermath of explosive industrialisation. Mine are wild guesses as to where the retreat could take us, as we spill out from the hive we are currently dreaming. I wonder what gifts from the wide-world might re-settle America? I have been occasionally visited at night by dreams that were something more than wishful thinking and reflected brief perceptions of paradise that had escaped my conscious daytime mind: and one of them was of America – though it had nothing to do with human material achievement or failure.<br><br>Thanksgiving is not a bad idea!<br><br>Best<br>Phil<br><br><br><a href=#c8360545247621583212 title="comment permalink">11/28/13, 2:51 PM</a><br><br>

Kuṣāṇa currency, circulating over a vast territory, had been linked to the Roman currency system. The collapse of the Han dynasty in China (AD 221) contributed to changing the picture in Central Asia. By that time, we observe a change in the Indian landscape, namely, a rapid process of de-urbanisation. It is every archaeologist's experience that even in the case of continuous human occupation, post-Kuṣāṇa levels display much poorer building techniques and reuse of earlier building material. A great number of small and large towns were abandoned in the third century, and in certain areas, as is shown by territorial surveys, the collapse of a whole network of roads and small settlements, which had been kept functioning by Buddhist monasteries, is observable. This process was probably aggravated by the collapse of the trading activity with the West that followed St Cyprian's plague of the years AD 251-66, which is an important component of the 'crisis of the third century' in the Roman Empire." (page 106)<br><br><br><br>I think Verardi's work would prove quite useful for your project. He explains at length how the agrarian Brahmans had the upper-hand in India against the Buddhists over the centuries largely because, unlike the Buddhists, they didn't rely so much on trade. Village Brahmans continued their traditions regardless of how trade was going, whereas Buddhists were always dependent on commerce to support their capital intensive operations. It also didn't help that Buddhists (and Jains) looked down on farming as a sinful profession (tilling kills beings).<br><br>Such was the undoing of Buddhists in India.<br><br><a href=#c8073526994810686000 title="comment permalink">11/28/13, 7:59 PM</a><br><br>

My hope, and it's something I'm working on myself right now, is that science can be taken up by religious and magical practitioners as an additional string to their bow, just as wizards in the early Middle Ages -- I'm thinking here of the list of required studies for aspiring wizards in <i>Picatrix</i> -- had to study such nonmagical subjects as agricultural science and economics.<br><br>Unknown, I'd like to suggest that if you take a less superficial look at what you've labeled "mysticism" -- a misuse of a good word, by the way -- you may just notice that there's a lot more diversity there than current atheist rhetoric likes to suggest, and that there are indeed some systems that allow fairly direct access to their own practical dimensions. Mind you, you may also be startled to discover that those practical dimensions have at least as much to do with the workings of individual and collective human thinking as with ecology, but I've discussed that at length in an earlier series of posts. <br><br>Phil, by "age of reason" I don't mean the utopian fantasy that our age of reason, like other examples of the species, has created around itself; I mean simply a historical period in which the prevailing forms of rationalist philosophy, rather than the older religious beliefs on which they're covertly based, provide the language around which the ordinary realities of power politics and economic inequality arrange themselves. Today's apologists for political and economic injustice present supposedly rational excuses for the status quo, rather than brandishing scripture; that's the difference I'm talking about. <br><br>DeAnander, thanks for the recommendation! I've been considering writing a biography of Gaia which will cover the whole lifespan of the planet, from what we know of her birth to what we can anticipate of her death; I haven't read MacKinnon's book but will consider it. <br><br>Donkey, you can't save those who refuse to be saved. I wish there was a way to make people listen to the fact that their actions are guaranteeing them and their descendans short and miserable lives in a harsh future, but there doesn't seem to be one. That's the subtext, or one of the subtexts, behind my focus on those people who are willing to listen and make the necessary changes in their own lives. <br><br>Chris, that's quite possible. "Belief" is also a much more subtle thing than modern habits of thought suggest; it's quite common for people to doubt something on an intellectual level, and cling to it with all their strength a quarter inch below the reasonable facade. <br><br>Shakya, excellent -- many thanks! I'll definitely chase that one down. <br><br>Trog, while I'm not usually an advocate of advanced technology, there's a hot new device only five thousand years old that I'd encourage you to check out.

For example, this week I visited the Chung Tai Chan Monastery - it's a great place to learn about Buddhist art history, and it was designed by the same architect responsible for Taipei 101 (the tallest building in Taiwan, and at one time the tallest building in the world), and overall the place costs a fortune. And Foguangshan (another mainstream sect) seems to be trying to be bigger and more expensive than Taiwan's Chan Buddhis (look up the 'Foguangshan Buddha Memorial Center' if you want an example).<br><br>In Taiwan, the religion which seems to be on the rise is the Matsu cult (this is partially due to political and social factors). It's estimated that about 1 million pilgrims and 4 million non-pilgrims participate in the Dajia Matsu Pilgrimage every year, and Taiwan only has a population of 23 million people. However, the Matsu cult is also very resource intensive - the Matsu worshippers produced a full-length Disney-esque animated film about Lin Moniang (Matsu's mortal form) which there's that nice big statue at Magang (the place where Lin Moniang's dead body washed ashore). This is before we get into the hierarchy of Matsu mother-and-daughter temples, who compete with each other for resources and status.<br><br>Christianity has a foothold in Taiwan (about 5% of the population), but it's dependent on foreign funding. The exception would be the aboriginal Christian churches - they get foreign support too, but the aboriginal people have much fewer resources than the Han Taiwanese, so I can imagine some form of Christianity fused with aboriginal traditions surviving in a low-resource situation.<br><br>The mainstream Taiwanese religious practice which requires few resources is Earth God worship. Unlike Taiwan's other major deities, there are few big expensive temples dedicated to worshipping him. Earth God worship mostly happens at the zillion small shrines dedicated to him in rural areas - and those shrines can be set up and maintained with few resources.<br><br>Of course, a lot of Taiwanese religious worship is centered around home and family - many families have shrines at home honoring deities and ancestors, and while these would probably become much simpler in a low-resource future, I imagine it could continue to work just as well as it did back in the days when most Taiwanese people were poor.<br><br><a href=#c6070919578560652108 title="comment permalink">11/28/13, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

One is the frustration with the lack of response from part of the Catholic Church (and by association, of Christ himself) to the mundane problems and ordeals of the people. This rejection shows up in the tale, since the poor but proud farmer would not have Jesus as compadre, even if the offer was on the table.<br><br>Somewhat related, but much more powerful, is the sense of guilt that Catholic Church cultivates amongst the faithful. This is a subject I have studied as a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner, and what I have read states that Chinese culture do not have a very developed sense of "guilt". They feel bad if they misbehave, of course, but in that cultural context the emotion that is culturally cultivated is "shame".<br><br>There is a subtle difference between the two of them. Shame is always external, and requires a (social) context to be experienced. To feel shame, you need to do *something* shameful, probably in the context of social duties (this is very Confusian, I am not sure if the perspective is the same for Taoists or other religious/philosophical schools). On the other hand, while guilt can be felt in the same external way, it does not have to. Guilt is introyective, and it is pretty easy to develop a sense of guilt that is not pinned to any specific mischief from your part, but to a sense of personal dirtiness, or unfitness (if this does not scream "Original Sin", I do not know what does).<br><br>So, the prospective convert to Santa Muerte cult starts frustrated with non-response of religious institutions to social injustice, and with a profound sense of sinfulness that prevents him/her to pledge to God for help. I suspect these are the same forces that may push people to Satanism, but in this case the convert escapes of the apparent binary by pledging to a 3rd power. One that is perceived as fair, non-judging, and at the same time not Evil. Death being something that is indirectly experienced in everyday life (and guarantied to be experienced directly, eventually) also makes it much more tangible and familiar.<br><br>p.s. I am not sure if this is going to be a duplicate.<br><br><a href=#c6862063663982337735 title="comment permalink">11/29/13, 8:43 AM</a><br><br>

Dinner occurred during the ABC national news broadcast. During the second half of the broadcast, my husband and I watched a story with the headline Oil Boom, in which the reporter talked with an oil worker from a town in Oklahoma. The worker starts out with the line, "Did you know that there is more oil in the US than in Saudi Arabia?" He went on to state that there's an economic boom in Oklahoma from oil drilling. While he's talking, we see video of oil rigs on a treeless, rolling landscape. He talks about good jobs available for oil workers that start at $60K/year. He says the oil boom is good for the economy, resulting in lower prices for gasoline and consumer goods. At some point he told us the oil was being extracted by horizontal drilling or fracking. Then the video switched over to scenes of an anti-fracking rally. We saw earnest-looking young people with hand-drawn signs and could tell they were chanting. The oil worker's voice-over said that an anti-fracking stance is insane. I also think I remember the reporter saying that oil company execs also considered the protests insane. About here the story ended and whatever the next thing was came on.<br><br>I spent 15 minutes or more this morning looking at the ABC News website attempting to find the story, to no avail. I also tried a quick search for the town's name, again to no avail. The only witness I have to the story is my husband. We talked about it on the way home and agreed on the details above. <br><br>On one level I see how the story, aired at the beginning of the holiday shopping frenzy and by a network owned by the Disney company, is intended to soothe folks into buying as usual (elsewhere in the broadcast we learned that holiday spending is predicted to be up about 4% this year versus last). But it also might be another sign of the increasingly louder insistence that all is OK to distract us from the also increasing signs that all isn't OK.<br><br><a href=#c1314132143917562459 title="comment permalink">11/29/13, 8:51 AM</a><br><br>

A week or so ago, I heard Pres. Obama's weekly address to the nation. In it, he proclaimed the news, in a tone of voice that was at once both sober and exultant, that the United States of America, thanks to its innovative, hard-working people, had at last begun to "produce more oil than it imports". <br><br>"So what?" was my response. I mean, even if you think the fracking as fabulous and what's good for the oil industry is good for America (and hence, the Civilized World), what is the solemn significance of producing just over half of what you consume? <br><br>Yesterday, at our Thanksgiving gathering, I mentioned this speech to my father-in-law. "I heard that, too, but 'more than we <b>import</b>'? Not 'more than we consume'?", he asked. "I thought he said 'more than we <i>consume</i>'." <br><br>Thus, my fears were confirmed. The key word <i>was</i> "import", but the tone of voice, the phrasing, the pacing... it all said "this is something glorious", and so (some in) the audience heard a different claim.<br><br>You might hear that that the United States is now <b>exporting</b> petroleum. How could we export, if we didn't produce more than we consume? Without going into the details, I'll just point out that (as tabulated in the 2012 World Alamanac and Book of Facts), the USA has exported petroleum products every year since 1976, even though we've imported at least 4 million barrels per day more than we exported over that period. Through the '70s, '80s, and most of the '90s, we produced more than we imported. Now that consumption has dropped by about 10% from the 2005 peak, and production has doubled since then, we are again only half-way dependent on foreign sources for our high-hydrocarbon comfort.<br><br><a href=#c8772649788896899408 title="comment permalink">11/29/13, 11:20 AM</a><br><br>

Then "we" have 209 billion barrels of oil in reserves. 209 vs 262? Maybe fracking and tar-sands and such have tipped the balance to North America.

I've never been to the largest festival of its kind -the Burning Man festival-,but I know people who have and I've seen pictures. It takes place every year in the middle of the Nevada desert, in middle of summer hundreds of miles from a big city (Salt Lake would be closest). A majority of the 75,000 participants come from the San Francisco Bay Area which is aprox 500 mi. away one way. These attendants do not seem to care or think too much about driving their cars, bus, and motor homes all this way with their ac blasting the whole way, over the 7000 ft. Donner Pass in the Sierras at 70 mph. (no train or bus service there).<br> When they get there, many of them sleep in ac motor homes with gas generators going 24/7 to keep it a comfy 70 degrees. At night (pics online) miles and miles of desert are lit up like San Francisco on a Friday night, you can't even see the stars in the middle of a black desert. All these lights are powered by more generators. Don't forget music blasting from every stage and moving "art" display.<br><br> This goes on for a week with all the food and water having to be trucked in.For the final night,many of the wood structures (reclaimed wood? I doubt it) are burnt to the ground,thus adding to the air pollution.<br> I don't see how this can be seriously considered a "earth loving" gathering with the incredible amount of waste and pollution involved (not to mention all the waste going to local landfills). How this can still be called a "loving earth" gathering is beyond me.<br>Carl<br>p.s.

According with Le Bon (Psychology of Masses, 1878), the beliefs that determine the behavior of the masses are of two types; variable and permanent. The variable beliefs change throughout the years, the permanent ones throughout the centuries. " The beliefs are established in the masses with the condition of adopting always the religious form that puts them sheltered of discussion".<br><br>In consequence, we cannot say that the religion is in crisis, But we can say that the Christian Religion is in crisis and that there has been replaced, throughout different epochs, with new variants, as the revolutionary republicanism in the revolutionary France, the Communism, the Anarchism, the worship the democratic ideals. And with pagan religions as the nationalisms and the fascisms.<br>All these ideologies who try to substitute the christianity, present the common characteristic that they are constituted (according to García Trevijano) of a only and true idea, from the material world, and for a serie of ideas and secondary principles (logos) that develop it. In consequence, the ideologies tend explain the whole reality across them same, which he leads to the failure, since the reality cannot be defined from an alone idea. On the other hand (The menace of New Paganism, Toynbee), all these ideologies present the advantage of they prescribe to the individual the exact way of proceeding. This attenuates the distress that the Individual suffers when he must think about who really is himself (The fear of the freedom, Erich From), on the other hand they promise him a "Heaven" in the land. And, apart from the fact that this promise normally is a deception. An attainable heaven in this world, for very perfect that it will be, never be able to compete with the idea of significance and immortality provided by the promise of an eternal life beyond the death.<br><br>Both, the Christianity and the sustitutive religions, mentionated before, are in crisis. But they should have been replaced partially with the increasing or the appearance of other religions that , I think, are the following materialistic religions: <br><br>1. The Religion of the Wealth-Growth, that includes these cults: worship to the money, the worship to the progress, the consumerism, the worship to the body, etc.<br> 2. And the environmental religion, product of the archaistic movement that was the Romanticism.<br><br>Trying to imagine how it would be the religion in the world of the "Long Descent" (no necessary to say that I am speculating) It´s evident that this one might not promise a paradise in the land, in view of the general impoverishment that will come. Therefore, the only candidate who stays is the christianity and, inside this one, all the branches based on the Calvinist idea of that the accumulation of the wealth is good, must disappear. On the another hand, in a world with scarce natural resources, the individual freedom also would be restricted, and therefore all the branches of the christianity that are based on the free interpretation of the Bible would lose raison d'être. Finally the shortage of energy would make unviable the existence of big organizations (Tainter), for what the catholicism; constructed over the obedience to the authority of the Pope will be no viable. The only alternative that seems to me to be viable, is some variant of the Catharism,because it will be based on the absolute indifference about material and on the nonexistence of a infrastructure of his Church.<br>With regard to the Druidism, which deserves all my respects, I must say the following things: <br><br>1 º) I consider the Druidism a product of the Romanticism, that is an archaistic movement that cannot contribute a solution to the problems of our civilization. <br><br>2 º) The fundamental ideas of the Western Civilization are of Christian base, for what It would be practically impossible the extension of the Druidism, because our fundamental beliefs are christian.<br><br><a href=#c1362975636237986894 title="comment permalink">11/29/13, 11:08 PM</a><br><br>

This is also true for societies, businesses, governments and individuals. Lean and mean is the way to go! Jettisoning infrastructure is a really tough decision for all of those entities to come to. Most leave making a decision until it is too late. Both the federal and state governments here have been offloading public assets into private hands for the past two decades (interesting, huh?).

Construction has already begun on a giant "Cathedral of the People's Salvation" right next to Ceauşescu's "House of The People" which now serves as Romania's parliament.

I have contemplated joining some kind of initiatory order and would appreciate a good primer on what to look for and avoid. From my experience with martial arts I know many schools will point to other practitioners of their art as lesser versions (to put it mildly). I have heard that this kind of thing occurs in some initiatory orders. Given what I know of human beings it does not surprise me, but I think it would turn me off. Anyone I would want to learn from would probably keep this to a minimum, or at least poke fun at themselves for doing so. I'm curious if the book addresses this point. <br><br>Although, right now I would like to find somewhere in the Poughkeepsie NY area to learn long form Yang family Tai Chi.<br><br>I find these posts very pertinent right now as I contemplate what religion to raise my son. I was raised Catholic and I have tremendous respect for the Marianist brothers who educated me, but my wife was raised protestant and as much as I like the new pope, the Catholic teachings on sexuality are stuck in the middle ages. While Christianity is still very central to my religious worldview, I draw a lot from other religions and from the Christian hermetic tradition. I would like to see a western religion that has a closer relationship between exoteric and esoteric streams.<br><br>While I don't see humans as separate from nature, I find it important to consider why so many see ourselves this way. I think our ability to abstract and create tools makes us unlike anything else in nature, but not separate. I think people confuse this and assume because we have these abilities that the rules don't apply to us.

But at the same time, I think people will tend to want to stick with what is already in place, assuming the infrastructure is sustainable without extensive funding and that the theology is flexible and adaptive to change. <br><br>Thinking about my northeastern town, with an array of mainline churches still operating around the town green, and a good handful of house churches, yoga centers and new agey community activities all functioning, I can see more people wanting to participate in these organizations as times get harder and more uncertain. The sheer pull of ready community could be quite attractive in an uncertain world. Plus these organizations have not exactly been rolling in money for the last few decade, so they are used to fairly modest infrastructure (at least relative to most mega-church areas). It might be that areas like the north east, with both old mainline and new agey religious institutions, could be set for some sort of multi-threaded religious revival, with a bunch of different religious communities building from what is already in place. Whereas areas with churches more reliant on industrial-scale infrastructure and dogmatic theology might of see less adaptation? <br><br>Generally, I would expect any new religious sensibility to be channeled evolve quite differently from area to area, with a lot of variety and options.

What sort of spirituality will warriors, warlords, monks, nomads, bandits and beleaguered villagers living in the toxic ruins of the Age of Progress be likely to embrace? Surely nothing resembling the watered-down, liberal religiosities of this age! People have already mentioned Santa Muerte and Voudon; some other candidates to consider from the darker realms of spirituality and occultism include Theistic Satanism, Dark Paganism, Gnosticism, Vampirism, Abrahamic fundamentalism and dark Eastern paths. I wouldn’t rule out a return of practices such as human sacrifice; there is already a group called Order of the Nine Angles whose memes are highly influential in certain circles that is promoting “culling” as a legitimate activity on metaphysical grounds in the new “Sinister Aeon”.<br><br>Such ideas sound abhorrent to most of us within this rather tame age, but in a world where people are struggling with 7+ billion other humans just to survive, who can say how dark their spirituality may get? Aldous Huxley wrote a novel where a science-hating Belial cult had come to power in California following a nuclear holocaust, and that doesn’t sound far-fetched to me. I’ve noticed that as mainstream religions have gotten lighter and more “Oprahfied”, groups on the margins are growing darker and more extreme. My sense is that darker forms of spirituality have tremendous growth potential in the years ahead if the whole current “light side” order comes crashing down.<br><br><a href=#c7390879003471875818 title="comment permalink">11/30/13, 2:28 PM</a><br><br>

It's been playing perfectly into that part of me that obsesses about the future of religion. Personally, I think you're under-estimating paganism's chances, if for other reasons than the diversity of very different traditions that get lumped under that label. While the congregational new-age eclecticism that got started with the church of all worlds has it's days numbered, I imagine the various polytheistic traditionalist religions that are growing up (Celtic paganism, Asatru, Hellenism, Kemeticism, and groups like ADF) have the chance to grow into something a bit more resilient. I also don't see Wicca as a religion disappearing completely, it may change but it's only just beginning to really grow up and I don't think its story is over quite yet.<br><br>As for the next mainstream religion in the Americas, my money is on the Afro-Caribbean religious traditions, especially Santeria and Vodou. Looking at current migration trends, and the results of projected migration trends based on sea level rise, it just makes sense. Their syncretism gives them an ability to absorb and combine with whatever dominant religions and movements around them, (I've even seen Spanish language translations of some your own books popping up in Botanicas from time to time, which might be a sign of what communities may wind up absorbing our modern Western Occult traditions as we enter into the next era). Likewise, these traditions have a tendency to seep into other religions subtly. My mother works in bilingual education, and very often sees orisha altars in the homes of her students when she does home visits. Every time I go to the local flea market and see the assortment of ritual washes, amulets, seven-day candles, and magical and medicinal herbs and oils alongside fortune tellers reading cowry shells, I just get this overwhelming sense that I'm looking at the wave of the future.<br><br>Just my thoughts and observations,<br><br>-Eric S.<br><br><a href=#c7937940447001786778 title="comment permalink">11/30/13, 3:31 PM</a><br><br>

Glad to hear you're getting rain this year!<br><br>Ursachi, it's an interesting question. Most established religions have cycled back and forth many times between eras of extravagance and eras in which poverty is not merely glorified but practiced, so it's possible that the Orthodox church will get a clue in time; if not, it can and will be replaced by something else. There's a Mexican saying, "Nothing ever happens until it happens" -- that is, things can stay exactly the same for a very long time, confounding all those who expect immediate change, and then change hits suddenly and confounds all of those who believed the status quo was permanent. <br><br>Alan, if you want to call economists priests, I have no trouble with that.

This BBC article was a <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25032305 rel=nofollow>good introduction</a>, putting it in the context of a society where atrocity is a daily occurrence. <br><br>JMG and Eric: oddly, I had my radio on in the early hours this morning and, half-asleep, heard a report on the BBC world service about the favelas in Brazil. It seems the drug gangs have adopted evangelical Christianity, and are violently driving out the syncretist religions such as Macumba. I can't find a link, but there is a post on the same topic from a couple of years ago <a href=http://wildhunt.org/2009/11/religious-drug-wars-and-other-pagan-news-of-note.html rel=nofollow>here</a>. As JMG has written elsewhere, the Latino influence in the US is deep and growing, so perhaps it's a bit soon to be saying that the evangelicals are due to decline...<br><br>Mark Rice, I work in just such a divided school. When I arrived a few years ago, the economists were very much in the ascendant, holding most of the important posts, and almost embarrassed to be associated with us plebs on the business side. Their star has fallen mightily of late, and they may not even keep any separate identity, simply being folded into the Management School. Certainly the volume of student applications is now all about the hands-on side of business. Sic transit gloria oeconomicae...<br><br>Personally, in terms of belief I came to Korean Zen via Therevada. I suspect Buddhism makes sense for many Westerners coming out of the religion of progress because it doesn't require belief or disbelief in any gods: they may or may not exist, but they certainly don't get involved much, so the responsibility lies with our own individual effort...<br><br><a href=#c9208146065541779970 title="comment permalink">12/1/13, 1:43 AM</a><br><br>

A tidy bit of work! hehe!<br><br>I still read their pronouncements because just like the elves they say both yes and no – always to their profit though. Oft times however, they fail to dissemble and it is always an advantage to know what is being considered in the halls of power.<br><br>Their latest announcement here concerns raising the age of retirement to 70. This reduces the unfunded liability of the pension which - just like expensive infrastructure - is a real problem for the immediate future here. Plus the stress of working to that age should finish quite a few people off. When I was young, people used to literally drop dead and no one knew why, or sought to find the cause as long as it didn't seem suspicious. Pneumonia used to be called the old man's friend, but now relatives seem to demand treatment for the condition, only to have that sufferer recover and then be subjected to far worse.<br><br>Please people, I expect no pension by the time I get to retirement age...<br><br>However, the facts on the ground are such that I have never seen a full time 70 year old brick layer or concreter. Hard work, they both are. I have laid a few brick walls in my time and even though I am youngish, I ached at the end of those days and then for days after. Hard work and I was glad when they were completed.<br><br>Is it just me or am I the only person here to think that it is vaguely amusing to ask an Archdruid what he thinks the second religiosity will look like? Even after the essay has explicitly explained to us in no uncertain terms his thoughts? hehe! Oh well.<br><br>You mentioned that it would be handy for initiates to understand other topics such as economics and agriculture. I could not agree more, as my gut feel tells me that those who are disconnected from the realities of the world also are doomed to fail at a later date. For did not then Zen master say, "before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water"?<br><br>Life is quite cyclical here. With the holes in the bird netting over the chook enclosure the naughty parrots (rosellas) have been getting in during the day to feed upon the free range chook food. It is a precarious gamble because the rosellas cannot settle on the ground for very long as the chooks would kill them. At night as well, the rats are still outsmarting me... I am slightly in awe of them...<br><br>This afternoon the new heavy duty galvanised steel wire mesh was mostly put in place.<br><br>However, my dogs are on the watch for those naughty rosellas and they have been giving them a very hard time. Quite a few of them are now resting in the worm farm to become soil food. From the worm farm, they turn into herbage which the rosellas are even now enjoying.<br><br>On a more positive note, an <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=echidna+photos&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uhObUoC7HcWKkAXn3oHICA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCkQsAQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=878" rel=nofollow>Echidna</a> turned up this afternoon for a visit, a bit of a drink of water and a snuffle around the long herbage at the base of one of the lemon trees.<br><br>This time I had the video camera handy (they waddle pretty slowly) and will include it on the next update. However, in a strange insight into the future, my second hand video camera's battery charger packed it in so I can't shoot any more footage until the replacement arrives... <br><br>That is the future though, we'll be surrounded by some funky technology, but unless you know how to cobble it together to make it work, or find energy for it, it might as well not be there...<br><br>A good reason to learn more about biological systems!

Where we come from? What moves us?<br>We'll tell you. We are the changing times; the rising wind; the new generation. We are the answer to you, for we are your children. You've thrown us into this world, uprooted and disoriented, without telling us where to go, or where our path lies. You've destroyed every means for us to orient ourselves. You've reduced the Church to rubble, so that now only a few of us still find refuge in the ruins of that community. <br><br>You've devalued the state, so that none of us wants to serve it anymore. You've split the family. Our domestic idyll has been plunged into divorce, conflict, and violence. You've subjected love to a reductionist deconstruction, and so instead of a deep bond, only the animal drive remains. You've ruined the economy, so we inherit mountains of debt.<br><br>You've questioned and criticised everything, so now we believe in nothing and no one.You've left us no values, yet you now accuse us of being amoral. But we are not.<br>We are the heirs of this utopia, and our reality looks very different. <br><br>You buy your peace through ever-mounting debt. Today we're watching your prosperity disappear throughout Europe. For us, your multicultural society means nothing but hatred and violence. In the name of your 'tolerance,' you hunt down all who criticise you, and you call those you hunt intolerant. <br><br>We've had enough! Your utopias have lost all legitimacy for us.<br>Realize at last that we don't live in a unified world or in a global village. Wars, the poor, and the oppressed will always be with us. This world will never be a heaven on Earth. Your delusions have only accomplished one thing: you have uprooted your children. We are the lost, the homeless. 'Who are we?' we ask ourselves. 'Where are we going?'<br><br>We've seen through your answers, and understood that they are lies. We aren't 'humanity,' and don't want your paradise. So we have come up with our own answers to these questions. We turn to what you have demonised. To ourselves. We search for our identity, and find it under the rubble of your destructive rage. We must dig deep to find ourselves again. <br><br>Our history, our homeland, and our culture give us what you have taken from us. We don't want to be citizens of the world. We are happier with our own countries. <br><br>We don't want the end of history, for our history doesn't give us cause to complain. We don't want a multicultural society, where our own culture is left to burn in the melting pot. <br><br>We are less demanding than you, yet we want so much more! <br><br>While you've chased utopias your entire lives, we want real values. What we demand actually exists; to possess it is our ancestral right. We desire nothing more than our inheritance, and won't tolerate your withholding it any longer.<br><br>We are the answer to you, and to the failure of your utopia. <br><br>For we are Generation Identity."<br><br>Powerful thinking indeed.<br><br><a href=#c7844904640502966061 title="comment permalink">12/1/13, 6:11 AM</a><br><br>

It's true that there have been a few serious expectations in the past, but other than the scriptural references indicating that Jesus would return shortly after the crucifixion, the signs were never really there - until now. The strongest one is that Israel would again become a nation, and that "this generation" would not die out before all comes to pass. The most time-generous interpretation would be that the generation is those born after 1948, so they are getting on toward 65 years of age now. Another sign was a great increase of knowledge. That one is harder to pinpoint in that knowledge usually increases, but certainly that could be a very apt description of these past few decades. <br><br>The reason why some Protestant groups were sure of the coming in the mid 1800s had to do with an interpretation of prophecy in the old testament having to do with time. It was actually a pretty astute interpretation, and the 7th Day Adventists still take it seriously, but have apparently decided that we are in some sort of undefined limbo in which the time is fulfilled and the last days are here.<br><br>It seems to me that unless Jesus shows up fairly soon, or we have a mass awakening of Christ Consciousness, Christianity might lose a good bit of its gloss and reason for existence.<br><br>The sensation that these are the end times is pretty much universal in various Christian groups.

Thanks for the info. I didn't expect evangelical Christianity to be headed for history's compost, for what it's worth; give it thirty or forty years and it'll be back, once a new generation has grown up and no longer remembers the failure of the present movement -- that's exactly what happened in the 1970s, after all, when nobody remembered any more how fundamentalism crashed and burned in the 1930s.

I myself was seeking good tai chi/taiji training for a while (and I've often encountered the difference between Wade-Giles and Pinyin romanizations in the process). Ultimately, though, it was difficult to find training that wasn't all form and no fight. <br><br>Thus, I ended up getting turned on to the art of baguazhang by an author named Bruce Frantzis, who evidently now lives in Marin County and charges thousands of dollars for his seminars. Bagua is, apparently, derived from Taoist circle-walking meditation, and the various sub-styles of the art are usually designed according to the eight trigrams of the I Ching. <br><br>The thing with Frantzis was that he claimed his last master ended up training him through the process of "mind-to-mind chi transmissions," something which I will certainly only come to believe when I experience it for myself! I also can't help but think that what he was talking about was an incompletely translated cultural concept I simply don't have the context to interpret. I then found another style of bagua, the Yin Fu style, which was directly introduced to westerners by a skilled traditional Chinese doctor, and it is focused directly upon the physical aspects of the training, with very little discussion of chi or esoteric energy concepts. Additionally, bagua, at least the style I'm training, seems to focus on breaking out the various strikes and postures and training them individually, rather than tai chi, which seems to want you to perform a long form sequence.<br><br>At this point, I find myself relatively reluctant to take up the path of a Western initiatory order, as I have begun to accept the 8 trigrams as a framework of belief, and I'm worried that conflating concepts from two different systems will ultimately give me nothing in the end. However, I'm also aware that what I'm training right now is primarily a physical and not necessarily a spiritual practice. But I am approaching it with the goals of increasing my awareness of my own body and my mindfulness of the world around me. Am I off-base here?<br><br>I also can't say that this system might be the roots of some new religiosity, either. We typically train in a small group in a park, with larger formal training sessions once a year (and big overseas intensives if you have the experience and money). But the esoteric internal martial arts like tai chi and bagua have quite an uphill battle to prove themselves in the United States. The general attitude seems to be, "if I didn't see your crazy circle-walking stuff in a mixed martial arts octagon, it must be bogus!" And I'm quite fine with that...<br><br><a href=#c8290552560243759262 title="comment permalink">12/1/13, 3:53 PM</a><br><br>

One should recognize that this is a situation clearly unsustainable over a long period of time... <br><br>What is the impact of this situation on future economic growth, which most politicians are still expecting will save the day by reducing the relative size of the current high debt (in particular sovereign debt) with respect to GDP:<br><br>1) If the oil industry is now sucking from the available capital pool 180% more funds to produce only slightly more net energy than in 2000, the amount of capital available to fund other projects is considerably reduced;<br><br>2) If we have today only 14% more net energy available than in 2000 to power the world economy, there is no doubt that global growth is now hitting the "energy wall" because there is now only a very limited supply of available energy to power any potential new material economic activity... No wonder that most of the reported economic growth since 2000 was related to financial sector "paper" gains mostly derived from speculative activities, in particular on the OTC derivatives market (the largest casino on Earth)... With the currently high depletion rates needing to be constantly offset, there was simply almost no additional net energy available to power any potential new material project ! One wonders what will happen with the even higher tight oil &amp; shale gas depletion rates when that unconventional production represents a significant part of the overall oil &amp; gas production mix...<br><br>Of course this macroeconomic picture varies on a country by country basis and even on a region by region basis depending on the local net energy availability situation and on the local marginal cost of that energy.<br><br>Charles Hall's important work - as described in his seminal "Energy and the Wealth of Nations" - concludes that EROEI mathematics will make it very difficult for a complex high-tech society to survive when its average EROEI falls below 11/1... <br><br>Hence, given that the future survivability of a growing number of states is now at stake, tensions are therefore likely to rise rapidly. For example:<br><br>1) Scotland preparing to hold a referendum on independence in September 2014 and, if it wins, thereafter taking a very significant part of the North Sea oil &amp; gas reserves with it...<br><br>2) China flexing its military muscle to attempt to bring the Senkaku islands and its potential oil &amp; gas reserves within its exclusive jurisdiction...<br><br>3) China and Russia siding with Iran and forcing the US to "abdicate" a military option against Iran that would give the US exclusive control over the remaining Persian Gulf oil &amp; gas reserves...<br><br>JB<br><br>P.S: Drawing an EROEI &amp; net energy map of our emerging "brave new world" would be an interesting exercise...<br><br><a href=#c5940107920044701680 title="comment permalink">12/1/13, 4:52 PM</a><br><br>

Are there any religions that are not somewhat dependent on the support of the middle class (or wealthy elite)? The ability to survive economically depends not just on the ability to do with less, but the ability to produce more with less dependence on the empire. Of course the empire (mostly middle class liberals who whine about bad education, war and inequality, while promoting them with their lifestyle and inability to share land or be productive outside of empire) makes this hard with taxation, rents and land prices being exorbitant for poor people, but I think there is a precedent in the decline of the Roman empire, with Christians starting to form their own communities of production of basic goods and services, somewhat independently of the empire.<br><br><a href=#c6706495384218401600 title="comment permalink">12/1/13, 5:44 PM</a><br><br>

I think Howard Odum's pulsing paradigm might be a good place to start. He does propose an energetic basis for just about all phenomena, including money and religion.

This began as a documentary about youth gangs in Singapore, and was later extended into a movie. It was banned by the government, because it contained genuine gang songs. Some of the actors are gang members (at least one of whom disappeared after the making of the film).<br><br>It's fascinating because some of the songs clearly refer to initiation rituals based on ancient Chinese myth. Though the gangs are now fragments of their past selves in Singapore itself, they're still strong just across the Causeway in Malaysia. They originated as resistance movements, formed by remnants of defeated Ming loyalists; hunted by the victorious Qing, initiation based on religious ritual would have bound them together. Over the centuries, the same ties helped migrant Chinese find brotherhood in alien lands.

For some (un)fortunate reason, I recently decided to read two books on the issue of water. The first is older "Cadillac Desert: The American West &amp; Its Disappearing Water". The second is recent, "Unquenchable: America's Water Crisis". I ended up overwhelmed at the magnitude of this issue and all its different parts. And yet when was the last politician you heard even bring this issue up? Why are the things that will take us down not even being discussed? Both these books detail the dirty politics and "shove-it-under-the-rug" approach that have been pursued without abandon by pols on both sides of the ideological divide. Disturbing.<br><br>I kept thinking of the ramifications of the water crisis facing future generations, and thinking of this week's post, and trying to figure out how the religious sensiblity(ies) will change when the realities of aging dams and infrastructure, silted-up reservoirs, salted soils, and emptied aquifers finally can't be pushed into the future anymore. The magnitude of having limited access to water after being used to having unlimited access is a major worldview-shifter.

Based on what I've read, it's at least possible that such an event could make it impossible to keep anything in working condition in low earth orbit at all -- and attempts to get past low earth orbit into less cluttered regions would be a matter of Russian roulette. <br><br>Ian, Frantzis is an odd duck, no question; I'm glad you found a good school. Those martial arts with a solid internal basis are the equivalent of an initiatory order -- at most, you'll have to find someone to teach you how to circulate the qi and do the other relevant forms of Taoist meditation if your teacher doesn't happen to do them. Some close study of the Book of Changes under an experienced teacher wouldn't hurt, either... ;-)<br><br>Onething, thousands of times, starting a couple of generations after the life of Jesus. There's a huge literature on the subject -- might be worth a read. <br><br>JB, good -- you're paying attention. Yes, I saw the report also, and drew the same conclusions you did. At this point, the soaring capital requirements for getting petroleum out of increasingly hard-to-produce deposits is becoming a lead weight on the entire global economy -- but it's a weight that can't be removed without bringing the economy to its knees. More on this in an upcoming post!<br><br>Iuval, the middle class is bigger in the US than in Roman times, since we have fossil fuels and so don't have to put so much of our labor force to work producing food and other basic necessities. Late Roman society had about as big of a middle class as was possible in an agricultural society, though. As for religions, of course -- in the US, look for the religions of the poor and nonwhite, and for those fringe religions that are rejected by the mainstream as just too kooky for words (cough, cough, Druidry, cough, cough). <br><br>Dwig, I know. I wish there was an alternative. Still, to borrow a line from Tolkien, "it needs but one foe to breed a war, not two, and those who have not swords can still die upon them." In the bitter years ahead, if the monks and pilgrims of whatever faith emerges out of the ruin of the industrial world can respond to violence with strength and skill of their own, things may not have to slide as far down the slope into chaos as otherwise might happen. <br><br>KL, true enough. <br><br>Cherokee, excellent! No argument there; whatever experiential reality lies behind faery lore, it's not to be messed with casually, or without cost. <br><br>Bret, thanks for the link.<br><br>Onething, maybe so -- but again, it hasn't slowed them down yet. <br><br>Bogatyr, Singapore street gangs still follow the old Three Harmonies Society traditions, "Fan Qing, Fu Ming" and the rest of it? Good heavens! I had no idea. Thanks for the link. <br><br>DeAnander, hmm. Possibly. I'd like to see more mathematics!<br><br>Joseph, wishing isn't the same thing as hoping. I wish that Barack Obama would show some least scrap of leadership one of these days; do I have any hope that he will do so? Of course not. To wish is to express a preference with no relationship to its likelihood. As for voting, I can certainly see a point to not voting in national elections, but local elections are quite another matter -- there are very often real issues and actual divergences between candidates, and that's always seemed worth the time to me. It's also possible to treat voting as a ritual affirmation of the values of democracy, whether or not those values still have any role in contemporary American politics...<br><br><a href=#c1211222061120560397 title="comment permalink">12/2/13, 10:57 PM</a><br><br>

The British, in Malaya and Singapore, believed in allowing each racial group to effectively govern themselves, so ancient traditions continued to be practised unchanged. The Communists ended the traditions in the ancient homeland after 1949; migrants to the US and the West were largely assimilated; but in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand, many beliefs and practices remain true to tradition. In Singapore, the folk religions are now very weak, as Evangelical Christianity has been adopted by the English-speaking Chinese elite as a sign of modernity, but there's still a lot to surprise in the backs streets and public housing blocks... If you can get hold of a copy, "The Impact of Chinese Secret Societies in Malaya", by Wilfred Blythe C.M.G. (1969) might interest you.<br><br>Ian, let me tell you a story... (if JMG will indulge me). I studied for a semester at at Tsinghua University, during which time I got to know a martial arts teacher who'd gone to Shaolin at age 5, and trained there all day every day for twenty years. I studied some Chen taiji with him, and became friends with him and his French wife. Later, on a meditation retreat in Thailand, I met a young British lad who was travelling around Asia; he really wanted to study martial arts, so I gave him my friend's contact details in Beijing. I went back to Singapore after that, but when I eventually caught up with my friend again, I asked him whether the Brit had shown up. He had - and had been appalled that my friend wanted to be paid! He had a romantic idea that teachings should be handed on free to those who sincerely wanted to learn... Every teacher I know thought that was hysterically funny. Their view was that they have dedicated their lives to learning these arts - should they not receive some recompense for passing it on? In the old days, a martial arts master would be supported in his old age by his disciples. In these times, that's no longer the case; how else will they live when they're old if they don't charge for teaching? And why shouldn't fly-by-night foreigners pay more than fellow Chinese who will still be nearby and connected by guanxi in the future?<br><br>All of which is by way of saying that Bruce Frantzis is in the same position. He spent years in Asia learning this material, and I doubt he was investing much in a pension scheme during that time. He's got the right to charge what he wants for passing that on. The question is: is it worth it? <br><br>Personally, I've studied taiji in Singapore with a school that retains a focus on qi practice. I've studied Cheng-style bagua in Beijing with disciples of Liu Jingru and Sun Zhijun, and for some months had the privilege of training privately with the latter. I'm pretty familiar with the context and the environment in which Bruce trained, and I must say: he's the real deal. I have some of his (very expensive) DVDs, and there is very, very good material in there. <br><br>Bagua is easy to learn badly. Taught well and in depth, it's a very profound art. Stick with it, and you'll learn a great deal about yourself and the universe. (The same is also true of taijiquan). I do tend to agree, now, with Bruce that it's a 'postgraduate' style, and I gave it up to work on another style that developed my basics, but I certainly hope to go back to it. Good luck with your training!<br><br><a href=#c1161307422107302807 title="comment permalink">12/3/13, 1:12 AM</a><br><br>

The poor will hurt, the middle class will bitch, and the rich will laugh it off.<br><br>Fast forward to the next January 1st and bam, next unlucky few. More anger, more denial, but yeap a few weeks and we're all back to wondering about the Superbowl or discussing Grand Thief Auto 25, lol.<br><br>Now take it to 5 years down the line. Probably 15% of the population is living on less. And its hitting home to everyone. We all would know someone who had been selected. They are the people at lunch at work who eat from a brown bag. Who drink water instead of soda. Who take the bus.<br><br>Now not going into the social aspects of such a two tiered society which would be pretty significant. Lets just look at your original question, the couch potatoes you wonder about are going to slow face the idea that its going to happen to them. Many will hide their heads in video game, tv, or such but a growing percentage, as the Lottery happens year after year, are going to start thinking, "What am I going to do when it happens to me?"<br><br>Many of them will turn to drugs, alcohol, other thing to try and forget the loaming cliff.<br><br>The smart ones, will think "How do I live now, like its already happened. And how do I learn to live on less."<br><br>(Cue commercial for Green Wizards.org...lol)<br><br>I hope the percentage of the first is low and the last high, we'll see cause the Lottery is already going on.

I tried to improve myself so that people could see what it looks like to see decline with more than an idler's eyes, but now too many friends are overly inspired by my vision, instead of their own. I need to shut my mouth more and work and meditate more, or my precociousness may get me composted! In sum I have tried to have a local effect on who does what to make this area more ready for the next dogleg of decline, but I am starting to get responsibility and respect from groups of friends and acquaintances which I still feel to young and dumb for, I am not at all sure I like it. But with luck a Tool Library in the next year or too will grow where I planted a seed at a local fraternal order; a food and croppace forest on a piece of land abandoned in the area; a small community garden on what was once acres of a friends lawn; and a few green houses. Maybe my readings have made me far too sensitive.<br><br>Its been a good week, I have been rereading Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which is the book I have most often read. Winter sets in and most of my outdoor projects are well mothballed against the changing season. So the time for study and reflection has started. In practical matters I have found the I Ching to be of the highest usefulness. A reading every Sunday has certainly inspired many a modification to my stance in life, mostly for the better it seems so far. <br><br>Each reading of Zarathustra become less a collection of speeches and sayings, and more a narrative, more essentially a narrative. Its one of those books where even though the narrative is subtle and hidden in the various smoke screens of bold speeches, it is the most interesting part. I remember college, students going on about when and where Zarathustra is set. It is not a matter of saying 'here it is' or 'there it is' it is not set in one place or time, but one kind of place and time, at the closing of an age. The most basic element of the shift of religious sensibilities talked about on this blog find an early expression in it, the rejection of salvation from life, in exchange for an affirmation of life here and now and into the long now. Though maybe such a religious sensibility will only sink its roots deeply in to the hearts of hermits and those in their likeness? I wonder what Zarathustra does over the years of the narrative, between speeches, if he were so rich, I wonder what he did to support himself?<br><br><a href=#c6114886009041565430 title="comment permalink">12/3/13, 8:46 AM</a><br><br>

I generally agree that the media's current level of influence in waining and likely to decline rapidly in the next few years, but if it is to have influence on future religiosity I think it would be from seeds already dormant in the soil. Specifically media types which indicate toward inner work practices, even if in the program itself there is just a theme park version. I know folks who put honest work into working the Force, if a couple of them figure on the Jedi mind trick they are suddenly in the runnings ;); or who seem to have a very basic tap on their Qi imitating Dragon Ball Z (which is almost as ridiculous as a program can be without the benefit of post structuralism) and even if shooting blasts of Qi at opponents can't happen, focusing and raising or hiding "power levels" has some potential; I personally dig ditches and rake leaves using movements from Avatar the Last Airbender, we can shot fire, or move water and stone and wind with our Qi outside of cartoons, at least not with out help from shovels, rakes, and buckets. I made the earlier comment thinking largely of recovering video game addicts who conceptualize real life skill development as 'leveling up'. And as silly and over the top as our media is, this is nothing new, Gilgamesh, Odysseus, Faust, Beowulf would blend in perfectly as a character in dozens of comic books, or cartoons.<br><br>I suspect comics will over take TV in importance during the next phase of the decline. Over all becoming a smaller influence, fewer issues, and fewer series, but enough to maintain influence on the imagination for a while.<br><br>Anyway, anything is a long shot at this point, but I just thought it was an interesting potential to plumb. Though having seen the comments in this thread on 12 step groups I would bet on them as having the best shot of anything mentioned yet. I went to meetings every week growing up (starting at 2 days old!) and it had a most positive effect I feel! The tradition has all the workings of a religion, tested for decades, and is a response to a most paradigmatic issue of our time the pattern of addiction. Any community project I work with I partially understand from the cues I learned at 12 step meetings with my folks.<br><br><a href=#c3401037684551555403 title="comment permalink">12/3/13, 9:28 AM</a><br><br>

It only imitates the true society, kinship networks that are biologically programmed into human beings. Politics make mockery about true human loyalties. Unfortunately in the Western countries this biological, non-ideological foundation of very humanity has been crumbled by etatism and industrialism of the last centuries. Nowadays political ideologies shape the world around us, because decisions made by central state machinery (guided by political ideologies)have legislative power over us. Decisions made by indifferent bureaucracies have as much or more power over most of the population than their true, face-to-face peers. Unnatural state of things, but what can you do? So politics do matter.<br><br>I have many times wondered if people outside conditions similar to my own childhood can truly understand what I mean with this... For middle class person state bureaucracy shows it's soft face, except during tax collection. It is like benevolent but almost invisible despot, hiding somewhere in the background. For public housing kid growing up offers somewhat different experience... First of all, there is pervasive fear of violence. Many things are decided by fighting, and when you are just a kid, you better stay away from harm's way. State authorities are distant and cannot truly dictate what happens in your neighborhood. The area where you live just is not that safe place to be, even if it is not a war zone. Parents of more affluent families don't let their children go there, even if they downplay safety problems on public arenas, as long as they are contained to specific estates.<br><br>You are just this small kid, maybe ten or twelve years old, seeing things that don't happen if you believe authorities and TV news. It breaks something inside you, and after that moment nobody who has not been broken the same way as you cannot really understand the place where you live, even if you rise up to be one of "respected citizens".<br><br>It is like that even here in the Nordic countries, has been at least from 90's onwards, even if they desperately try to keep up the facade of "welfare" society in the upper echelons of the state machinery. There just are not that many "home boys" with the ability to write about their experiences with English language, or even with our native language. Only writer describing this phenomenon I try to describe with decent English that I am familiar with is Jack Donovan. Following article describes it, but he approaches this fact from very different angle compared to me. He glorifies something I do not glorify, I just think he is right. Sad but true, that's my opinion. <br><br> http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis/2011/03/violence-is-golden/<br><br>So, it is true that our beloved Earth is being depleted and left behind as barren landscape right now. It is true that our bloated population should turn away from very destructive habits and unite, work together to solve mounting crisis looming immediately ahead of us, maybe ten or fifteen years from now. <br>Nothing like that shall happen. Instead humans are going to play game of musical chairs, and one's most important duty is to ensure that his/her OWN PEOPLE have place to sit, when music fades away. Our brains, our biology, is that of tribal hunter-gatherers from Great Mammoth Plains of the last Ice Age. We as animal species among animal species are not ready to face complex dilemmas as truly rational creatures, which we are not. So it is going to be solved the old way. Through carnage, hunger, misery and disease. Through instincts. <br><br>And political games shall have very, very big role in that game of musical chairs waiting for us all. No homestead or hiding place is safe from political decisions and their influence. It is the way it has happened before, time after time after time. People from all colors, from all creeds and all cultural narratives have behaved the same way. Why should we be the one exception?<br><br><a href=#c5776556308713687216 title="comment permalink">12/3/13, 12:46 PM</a><br><br>

And we all saw how that turned out in the end. Probably the best observation from the comments section of that article was this little gem: "Seems like the Mexica lived under Cthulhu. I guess bloody Cortéz was indeed a sort of liberator, after all." <br><br>I remember that one of the themes of "Lord of the Rings" was the psychology and the self-defeating nature of evil. I also remember reading an essay about Nazi Germany which mentioned that despite the cunning, cleverness and high level of intelligence of many practitioners of evil, such people are also prone to making decisions that are unbelievably stupid, short-sighted and self-destructive. This seems to be true whether we are talking about Sauron and Saruman, the Sith from the Star Wars movies and novels or such real world examples as the Nazi leaders and many others throughout history. <br><br>One classic example from Nazi Germany was that the Nazis tied up thousands of trains shipping people to the concentration camps at a time when the Wehrmacht was suffering critical logistics problems and there were tens of thousands of tanks, armored personnel carriers, trucks and other vehicles desperately needed by the Panzertruppen piling up at the factories and railheads. Another was Hitler’s decision to launch Operation Barbarossa and then constantly interfering in military operations. If he had allowed the generals to execute the original plan without interference, the Germans probably would have taken Moscow, St Petersburg and most of Ukraine before the infamous Russian winter set in and before Zhukov and Stalin could get their defenses organized. At that point, even if the Russians had decided to keep fighting, they would have done so at a serious disadvantage.<br><br><a href=#c3321859169315928608 title="comment permalink">12/3/13, 1:49 PM</a><br><br>

It didn't (they planted the wrong species) but eucalyptus grows like crabgrass here and is about as useful. Australian understory plants were not imported and few California natives will grow under eucalyptus, nor will naturalized European plants (which do very well when competing with California natives). So there is little plant diversity or food for wildlife in a California eucalyptus forest. Stands of eucalyptus do offer shade and a windbreak. They sequester carbon until fire reaches them; then they burn very hot. The publicly managed lands are trying to eradicate eucalyptus and restore native habitat, difficult and expensive to do as the wood blunts saws.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c9154406894318582148 title="comment permalink">12/3/13, 1:55 PM</a><br><br>

You're also not the first person to tell me that he is the real deal and a very capable fighter. Ultimately, though, I felt that his method of putting culturally specific abstractions such as qi at the forefront was not for me. The Yin style I'm pursuing is a complete system, with martial, meditative, and medical components; but those all ended up in the hands of multiple students, as the lineage inheritor Dr. Xie Peiqi only had so much time left to teach once he opened the system up to Westerners. <br><br>The martial component I'm learning starts by grinding out repetitions of individual strikes, then building them up into combinations... very little discussion of qi so far, but that component will be there when I'm ready to think about it.

And, for what it's worth, they were happy to onboard a complete beginner like me, without any previous experience in another system.

I have considered and rejected the idea of sacrificing myself on the altar of Los Angeles to try to gain a film career, and my thought process was this: It's surely not going to get any easier to enforce residual payments for film and television work, and especially for TV actors, that's probably a big chunk of their income after the show's over. Upfront patronage certainly makes more sense for an author or a comic-book artist, as you've got one person (or perhaps a small team) doing the work, and that gives a much greater certainty that the work will be completed. Meanwhile, industrial-grade film arts require coordination of huge teams, acquisition of location shooting permits, etc. Easy to pay for with a strong government in a time of relative peace and abundance, otherwise not so much.<br><br>Also, I can't help but notice that the rise of television paralleled the rise of consumer society.

Self-seeded fruit trees often have root systems that massively exceed the grafted fruit trees which are usually selected for their small size and disease resistance. No one wants a 20m lemon tree! hehe! Well, maybe I’d be happy with one.<br><br>In the areas where apples evolved, there are actually apple tree forests.<br><br>As you quite rightly suggested your Californian eucalypt forests are devoid of our support species (ie. the under-storey).<br><br>Have a look at the photo: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sherbrooke_forest_Victoria_220rs.jpg rel=nofollow>Eucalypt Regnans</a><br><br>That photo is in a slightly wetter area than here, but not that far away. In the photo I can spot, black wattles, black woods, blanket leafs, musk daisy bushes and an assortment of soft and hard tree ferns. All of those trees are support species and are probably completely missing in your forests.<br><br>The eucalypt trees were actually gifted by the Australian government at the time of Federation. It is something of a poisoned chalice.<br><br>In fact you should know that many exotic species grow quite happily within the drip line of eucalypts. It may well be that in California, they are just not up for further experimentation? I can suggest quite a few based on experience here. Modifying an existing forest environment is really hard work.<br><br>Quote: "They sequester carbon until fire reaches them; then they burn very hot."<br><br>Apologies, but you are incorrect in this assertion. The trees themselves rarely burn. They may be killed by fire, but in most cases they survive only to produce epicormic shoot growth within weeks of the fire. <br><br>The fires are driven by the ground fuels, dried elevated fuels and the green leaves. The trunks of trees are usually only damaged or killed during extreme wildfires. Mostly after a fire has gone through, the blackened trunks are left standing.<br><br>The authorities in the US are probably following a process of fire suppression. They are probably also not thinning the forests and reducing the ground fuels. Both of those actions contribute to extreme wild fires.<br><br>Quote: "difficult and expensive to do as the wood blunts saws"<br><br>But of course! Welcome to my world. That is perhaps why they do not manage the forest? Eucalypt forests evolved over a short period of time to be managed by humans. The early explorers used to be staggered by how much burning off was going on all of the time! The Aboriginals were experts with fire and for good reason.<br><br>You forgot to add that the timber does not burn green, but must season for more than 12 months but preferably 24 months.<br><br>Anyway, they need to stop complaining about them and buy a proper chainsaw and learn how to hand sharpen it, like we do Down Under. hehe!<br><br>Thanks for your thoughts, but I live with this stuff and some of them are 50m tall. I spent half of the day today helping my neighbour cut up a monster tree on their property which had fallen over for no apparent reason.<br><br>There is beauty in the eucalypt, but there is terror too.
