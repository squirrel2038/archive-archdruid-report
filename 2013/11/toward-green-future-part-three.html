One of the least helpful habits of modern thinking is the common but really rather weird insistence that if something doesn’t belong all the way to one side of a distinction, it must go all the way to the other side. Think about the way that the popular imagination flattens out the futures open to industrial society into a forced choice between progress and catastrophe, or the way that American political rhetoric can’t get past the notion that the United States must be either the best nation on earth or the worst:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in both these cases and many more like them, a broad and fluid continuum of actual possibilities has been replaced by an imaginary opposition between two equally imaginary extremes.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The discussion of the different kinds of thinking in last week’s <i>Archdruid Report</i> post brushed up against another subject that attracts this sort of obsessive binary thinking, because it touched on the limitations of the human mind. Modern industrial culture has a hard time dealing with limits of any lind, but the limitations that most reliably give it hiccups are the ones hardwired into the ramshackle combination of neurology and mentality we use to think with. How often, dear reader, have you heard someone claim that there are no limits to the power of human thought—or, alternatively, that human thought can be dismissed as blind stumbling through some set of biologically preprogrammed routines? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A more balanced and less binary approach allows human intelligence to be seen as a remarkable but<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>fragile capacity, recently acquired in the evolutionary history of our species, and still full of bugs that the remorseless beta testing of natural selection hasn’t yet had time to find and fix. The three kinds of thinking I discussed in last week’s post—figuration, abstraction, and reflection—are at different stages in that Darwinian process, and a good many of the challenges of being human unfold from the complex interactions of older and more reliable kinds of thinking with newer and less reliable ones. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Figuration is the oldest kind of thinking, as well as the most basic. Students of animal behavior have shown conclusively that animals assemble the fragmentary data received by their senses into a coherent world in much the same way that human beings do, and assemble their figurations into sequences that allow them to make predictions and plan their actions. Abstraction seems to have come into the picture with spoken language; the process by which a set of similar figurations (this poodle, that beagle, the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>spaniel over there) get assigned to a common category with a verbal label, “dog,” is a core example of abstract thinking as well as the foundation for all further abstraction. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s interesting to note, though, that figuration doesn’t seem to produce its most distinctive human product, narrative, until the basic verbal tools of abstraction show up to help it out. In the same way, abstraction doesn’t seem to get to work crafting theories about the cosmos until reflection comes into play. That seems to happen historically about the same time that writing becomes common, though it’s an open question whether one of these causes the other or whether both emerge from deeper sources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While human beings in all societies and ages are capable of reflection, the habit of sustained reflection on the figurations and abstractions handed down from the past seems to be limited to complex societies in which literacy isn’t restricted to a small religious or political elite. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<a href=../../2013/10/the-renewal-of-religion.html>An earlier post in this sequence</a> talked about what happens next, though I used a different terminology there—specifically, the terms introduced by Oswald Spengler in his exploration of the cycles of human history. The same historical phenomena, though, lend themselves at least as well to understanding in terms of the modes of thinking I’ve discussed here, and I want to go back over the cycle here, with a close eye on the way that figuration, abstraction, and reflection shape the historical process. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Complex literate societies aren’t born complex and literate, even if history has given them the raw materials to reach that status in time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They normally take shape in the smoking ruins of some dead civilization, and their first centuries are devoted to the hard work of clearning away the intellectual and material wreckage left behind. Over time, barbarian warlords and warbands settle down and become the seeds of a nascent feudalism, religious institutions take shape, myths and epics are told and retold:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>all these are tasks of the figurative stage of thinking, in which telling stories that organize the world of human experience into meaningful shapes is the most important task, and no one worries too much about whether the stories are consistent with each other or make any kind of logical sense. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s after the hard work of the figurative stage has been accomplished, and the cosmos has been given an order that fits comfortably within the religious sensibility and cultural habits of the age, that people have the leisure to take a second look at the political institutions, the religious practices, and the stories that explain their world to them, and start to wonder whether they actually make sense. That isn’t a fast process, and it usually takes some centuries either to create a set of logical tools or to adapt one from some older civilization so that the work can be done. The inevitable result is that the figurations of traditional culture are weighed in the new balances of rational abstraction and found wanting. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus the thinkers of the newborn age of reason examine the Bible, the poems of Homer, or whatever other collection of mythic narratives has been handed down to them from the figurative stage, and discover that it doesn’t make a good textbook of geology, morality, or whatever other subject comes first in the rationalist agenda of the time. Now of course nobody in the figurative period thought that their sacred text was anything of the kind, but the collective shift from figuration to abstraction involves a shift in the meaning of basic concepts such as truth. To a figurative thinker, a narrative is true because it works—it makes the world make intuitive sense and fosters human values in hard times; to an abstractive thinker, a theory is true because it’s consistent with some set of rules that have been developed to sort out true claims from false ones.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s not necessarily as obvious an improvement as it seems at first glance. To begin with, of course, it’s by no means certain that knowing the truth about the universe is a good thing in terms of any other human value; for all we know, H.P. Lovecraft may have been quite correct to suggest that if we actually understood the nature of the cosmos in which we live, we would all imitate the hapless Arthur Jermyn, douse ourselves with oil, and reach for the matches. Still, there’s another difficulty with rationalism: it leads people to believe that abstract concepts are more real than the figurations and raw sensations on which they’re based, and that belief doesn’t happen to be true. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Abstract concepts are simply mental models that more or less sum up certain characteristics of certain figurations in the universe of our experience. They aren’t the objective realities they seek to explain. The laws of nature so eagerly pursued by scientists, for example, are generalizations that explain how certain quantifiable measurements are likely to change when something happens in a certain context, and that’s all they are. It seems to be an inevitable habit of rationalists, though, to lose track of this crucial point, and convince themselves that their abstractions are more real than the raw sensory data on which they’re based—that the abstractions are the truth, in fact, behind the world of appearances we experience around us. It’s wholly reasonable to suppose that there is a reality behind the world of appearances, to be sure,but the problem comes in with the assumption that a favored set of abstract concepts <i>is</i> that reality, rather than merely a second- or thirdhand reflection of it in the less than flawless mirror of the human mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The laws of nature make a good example of this mistake in practice. To begin with, of course, the entire concept of “laws of nature” is a medieval Christian religious metaphor with the serial numbers filed off, ultimately derived from the notion of God as a feudal monarch promulgating laws for all his subjects to follow. We don’t actually know that nature has laws in any meaningful sense of the word—she could simply have habits or tendencies—but the concept of natural law is hardwired into the structure of contemporary science and forms a core presupposition that few ever think to question.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Treated purely as a heuristic, a mental tool that fosters exploration, the concept of natural law has proven to be very valuable. The difficulty creeps in when natural laws are treated, not as useful summaries of regularities in the world of experience, but as the realities of which the world of experience is a confused and imprecise reflection. It’s this latter sort of thinking that drives the insistence, very common in some branches of science, that a repeatedly observed and documented phenomenon can’t possibly have taken place, because the existing body of theory provides no known mechanism capable of causing it. The ongoing squabbles over acupuncture are one example out of many:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Western medical scientists don’t yet have an explanation for how it functions, and for this reason many physicians dismiss the reams of experimental evidence and centuries of clinical experience supporting acupuncture and insist that it can’t possibly work. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the kind of difficulty that lands rationalists in the trap discussed in last week’s post, and turns ages of reason into ages of unreason: eras in which all collective action is based on some set of universally accepted, mutually supporting, logically arranged beliefs about the cosmos that somehow fail to make room for the most crucial issues of the time. It’s among history’s richer ironies that the beliefs central to ages of unreason so consistently end up clustering around a civil religion—that is, a figurative narrative that’s no more subject to logical analysis than the theist religions it replaced, and which is treated as self-evidently rational and true precisely because it can’t stand up to any sort of rational test, but which provides a foundation for collective thought and action that can’t be supplied in any other way—and that it’s usually the core beliefs of the civil religion that turn out to be the Achilles’ heel of the entire system. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All of the abstract conceptions of classical Roman culture thus came to cluster around the civil religion of the Empire, a narrative that defined the cosmos in terms of a benevolent despot’s transformation of primal chaos into a well-ordered community of hierarchically ranked powers. Jove’s role in the cosmos, the Emperor’s role in the community, the father’s role in the family, reason’s role in the individual—all these mirrored one another, and provided the core narrative around which all the cultural achievements of classical society assembled themselves. The difficulty, of course, was that in crucial ways, the cosmos refused to behave according to the model, and the failure of the model cast everything else into confusion. In the same way, the abstract conceptions of contemporary industrial culture have become<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>dependent on the civil religion of progress, and are at least as vulnerable to the spreading failure of that secular faith to deal with a world in which progress is rapidly becoming a thing of the past.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s here that reflection, the third mode of thinking discussed in last week’s post, takes over the historical process. Reflection, thinking about thinking, is the most recent of the modes and the least thoroughly debugged. During most phases of the historical cycle, it plays only a modest part, because its vagaries are held in check either by traditional religious figurations or by rational abstractions. Many religious traditions, in fact, teach their followers to practice reflection using formal meditation exercises; most rationalist traditions do the same thing in a somewhat less formalized way; both are wise to do so, since reflection limited by some set of firmly accepted beliefs is an extraordinarily powerful way of educating and maturing the mind and personality. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The trouble with reflection is that thinking about thinking, without the limits just named, quickly shows up the sharp limitations on the human mind mentioned earlier in this essay. It takes only a modest amount of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>sustained reflection to demonstrate that it’s not actually possible to be sure of anything, and that way lies nihilism, the conviction that nothing means anything at all. Abstractions subjected to sustained reflection promptly dissolve into an assortment of unrelated figurations; figurations subjected to the same process dissolve just as promptly into an assortment of unrelated sense data, given what unity they apparently possess by nothing more solid than the habits of the human nervous system and the individual mind. Jean-Paul Sartre’s fiction expressed the resulting dilemma memorably: given that it’s impossible to be certain of anything, how can you find a reason to do anything at all? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s not a minor point, nor one restricted to twentieth-century French intellectuals. Shatter the shared figurations and abstractions that provide a complex literate society with its basis for collective thought and action, and you’re left with a society in fragments, where biological drives and idiosyncratic personal agendas are the only motives left, and communication between divergent subcultures becomes impossible because there aren’t enough common meanings left to make that an option. The plunge into nihilism becomes almost impossible to avoid once abstraction runs into trouble on a collective scale, furthermore, because reflection is the automatic response to the failure of a society’s abstract representations of the cosmos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As it becomes painfully clear that the beliefs of the civil religion central to a society’s age of reason no longer correspond to the world of everyday experience, the obvious next step is to reflect on what went wrong and why, and away you go. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary here to return to the first point raised in this week’s essay, and remind my readers that the fact that human thinking has certain predictable bugs in the programming, and tends to go haywire in certain standard ways, does not make human thinking useless or evil. We aren’t gods, disembodied bubbles of pure intellect, or anything else other than what we are: organic, biological, animal beings with a remarkable but not unlimited capacity for representing the universe around us in symbolic form and doing interesting things with the resulting symbols. Being what we are, we tend to run up against certain repetitive problems when we try to use our thinking to do things for which evolution did little to prepare it. It’s only the bizarre collective egotism of contemporary industrial culture that convinces so many people that we ought to be exempt from limits to our intelligence—a notion just as mistaken and unproductive as the claim that we’re exempt from limits in any other way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fortunately, there are also reliable patches for some of the more familiar bugs. It so happens, for example, that there’s one consistently effective way to short-circuit the plunge into nihilism and the psychological and social chaos that results from it. There may be more than one, but so far as I know, there’s only one that has a track record behind it, and it’s the same one that provides the core around which societies come together in the first place: the raw figurative narratives of religion. What Spengler called the Second Religiosity—the renewal of religion in the aftermath of an age of reason—thus emerges in every civilization’s late history as the answer to nihilism; what drives it is the failure of rationalism either to deal with the multiplying crises of a society in decline or to provide some alternative to the infinite regress of reflection run amok. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Religion can accomplish this because it has an answer to the nihilist’s claim that it’s impossible to prove the truth of any statement whatsoever. That answer is faith: the recognition, discussed <a href=../../2013/06/a-question-of-values.html>in a previous post in this sequence</a>, that some choices have to be made on the basis of values rather than facts, because the facts can’t be known for certain but a choice must be made anyway—and choosing not to choose is still a choice. Nihilism becomes self-canceling, after all, once reflection goes far enough to show that a belief in nihilism is just as arbitrary and unprovable as any other belief; that being the case, the figurations of a religious tradition are no more absurd than anything else, and provide a more reliable and proven basis for commitment and action than any other option. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Second Religiosity may or may not involve a return to the beliefs central to the older age of faith. In recent millennia, far more often than not, it hasn’t been. As the Roman world came apart and the civil religion and abstract philosophies of the Roman world failed to provide any effective resistance to the corrosive skepticism and nihilism of the age, it wasn’t the old cults of the Roman gods who became the nucleus of a new religious vision, but new faiths imported from the Middle East, of which Christianity and Islam turned out to be the most enduring. Similarly, the implosion of Han dynasty China led not to a renewal of the traditional Chinese religion, but to the explosive spread of Buddhism and of the newly invented religious Taoism of Zhang Daoling and his successors. On the other side of the balance is the role played by Shinto, the oldest surviving stratum of Japanese religion, as a source of cultural stability all through Japan’s chaotic medieval era.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s still an open question whether the religious forms that will be central to the Second Religiosity of industrial civilization’s twilight years will be drawn from the existing religious mainstream of today’s Western societies, or whether they’re more likely to come either from the bumper crop of religious imports currently in circulation or from a even larger range of new religious movements contending for places in today’s spiritual marketplace. History strongly suggests, though, that whatever tradition or traditions break free from the pack to become the common currency of thought in the postrationalist West will have two significant factors in common with the core religious movements of equivalent stages in previous historical cycles. The first is the capacity to make the transition from the religious sensibility of the previous age of faith to the emerging religious sensibility of the time; the second is a willingness to abandon the institutional support of the existing order of society and stand apart from the economic benefits as well as the values of a dying civilization. Next week’s post will offer some personal reflections on how that might play out. </div>

And others have responded strongly to the narrative.<br><br>For those who are familiar with the raw milk movement, it has a strongly religious flavor. Some of this is very literal, in that you'll find many of the people who search out raw milk have strong Christian beliefs and do so partly out of these beliefs. I can't say I fully understand the connection as I simply don't have much of an understanding of Christianity or familiarity with its texts, but it seems to get back to an ideal of purity and tradition. But even aside from those who are literally religious, there are many others who seek out and support raw milk with something of a religious fervor. They believe it's better. They believe it's healthier. And it's rooted in something far more than a desire to drink good milk--which, really, is not that big of a deal if you look at it in isolation. It seems to be rooted in a rejection of a good deal of modern society and a faith in and embrace of something more traditional, more pure . . . something that makes more <i>sense</i>. And I use that term very deliberately.<br><br>I'm just starting to mull this idea, so I don't know that I can yet fully defend my theory here (if it even proves defensible.) But the way in which supporters of raw milk talk about and defend it seems rooted in figuration. The descriptors are often rooted in sense sensations. Direct connection to animals, nature, and other humans also regularly factors in.<br><br>I see this most clearly with raw milk, but it permeates the entire local food movement, in my experience. Local, whole foods are figuration--coherent and unadulterated products of the earth. Processed, industrial food is an abstraction, a terrifying mishmash of reductionist ingredients that come together to create a human-made artifact. This is the language and thought process of the local food movement.<br><br>I'm not sure here. I may just be trying to shoehorn something I think about a lot into the frame work of thinking you've outlined here. But I really do feel like the local food movement is at least partly a response to abstraction and a movement back toward figuration. And it does have a religious feel to me in many ways. If I'm at all correct, this could be one explanation for why it's been so successful in recent times, as it would be swimming with the historical currents rather than fighting them, or being lost in a side eddy.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c7394949773398633453 title="comment permalink">11/20/13, 11:39 PM</a><br><br>

Not exactly the same, but close enough to make a point: understanding the religion's main beliefs (figuration perhaps), getting the bigger picture of how it all fits together (abstraction maybe) and then a period of reflection, the main conclusion of which was that didn't really believe in the central tenets of these religions. <br><br>But I didn't completely descend into a "nothing matters" phase. I kept what worked - mostly simple values and practices, things that don't take a lot of mental wrangling to work with: sitting quietly, being in nature, attempting to treat myself and others more kindly, practicing acceptance of life's ups and downs, enjoying physical life in the moment, gratitude. <br><br>These are values, I suppose, and do take conscious commitment to practice. But they are very simple as well, and don't require a lot of theory. For example, you either decide you want to be happily engaged in daily life or not. You don't need a religious theory to support you in your choice. And then you have to follow-through and make it a habit. <br><br>So, I guess what I am saying is what has stayed with me after a few religions blew through town were the simple things that were less dependent on structured thought.

This is all fodder for a new book, I hope?<br><br>Partly inspired by this discussion, I recently finished listening through the audio lecture series <i>The Platonic Tradition: Understanding Plato's Impact Through the Ages</i> by Dr. Peter Kreeft. With that in mind, I'm going to take a stab at translating a few points into "Platonic."<br><br><i>It seems to be an inevitable habit of rationalists, though, to lose track of this crucial point, and convince themselves that their abstractions are more real than the raw sensory data on which they’re based—that the abstractions are the truth, in fact, behind the world of appearances we experience around us. It’s wholly reasonable to suppose that there is a reality behind the world of appearances, to be sure,but the problem comes in with the assumption that a favored set of abstract concepts </i>is<i> that reality, rather than merely a second- or thirdhand reflection of it in the less than flawless mirror of the human mind. </i><br><br>So, the error is not in perceiving that there is Form, but to confuse the image of the Form (the mind's participation in the Form) with the Form itself?<br><br>The error then, that the nihilist makes is to perceive the rationalist's error and conclude that therefore, there is no Form, but all is merely sense perception and appetite.<br><br><i>It so happens, for example, that there’s one consistently effective way to short-circuit the plunge into nihilism and the psychological and social chaos that results from it... the raw figurative narratives of religion.</i><br><br><i>Nihilism becomes self-canceling, after all, once reflection goes far enough to show that a belief in nihilism is just as arbitrary and unprovable as any other belief; that being the case, the figurations of a religious tradition are no more absurd than anything else, and provide a more reliable and proven basis for commitment and action than any other option.</i><br><br>Interesting.<br><br>My takeaway: therefore, don't bother trying to refute nihilism - it's self-refuting anyway. Simply note that fact, and in response - tell stories. Tell <i>your</i> story. Tell <b>The</b> Story, the sacred story that shapes the world and takes its shape from beyond the world (back to the Forms and the Good here).<br><br>And then... let those who have ears to hear, hear.<br><br>peace,<br>Zach<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c4016412494974972585 title="comment permalink">11/21/13, 8:29 AM</a><br><br>

Nicely done. <br><br>One thing that kept creeping into my mind as I read it is this: I do not know whether the authors of our prominent religious texts meant them as reliable works of history/geology/etc (as you note) but the elites of these religions have certainly used them as such. How long? I do not know. I'm not a historian myself. <br><br>But would you agree that science systematically stripped religion of its ability to do so? This is a major change it seems to me. Has there been a time when you could actually point to what previously had been thought the work of providence and say "No, this is a natural process!" And then be able to explain this process and provide proof (of some level of certainty) as to the accuracy of your claim?<br><br>Granted, such circumstances would eventually give way if your assumptions of our future pan out. Even anything resembling it would eventually render science a legend of the past in many disciplines and subjects. But that would take quite a while. <br><br>For the time being it seems to me that any religion or religious sensibility that could hope to inspire a new generation would have to have a good working relationship with science.

Give it a few decades, and it'll be interesting to see what fusions emerge from it. <br><br>Onething, societies in which literacy is confined to a minority of priests don't produce what I've called ages of reason -- the kind of period we witnessed in the West from the 18th century onward, classical civilization from the 5th century BCE onward, and so on, in which traditional religious narratives are first reinterpreted and then rejected, and the barbarism of reflection follows as soon as enough civil religions have risen and imploded. That doesn't mean that individuals don't engage in reflection -- as I commented earlier, it's a universal human capacity; it means that the social consequences of runaway reflection don't play a historical role. <br><br>As for redefining Christianity, well, you may have an interesting time there. Christianity, like all religions, is in a constant state of subtle redefinition; the people who like to sing "Give Me That Old Time Religion" are by and large practicing a faith that nobody would have recognized as Christianity a mere five centuries ago, and let's not even talk about the gap that separates it from whatever the first generations of Christians in the Roman world were and weren't doing. That said, coming in from outside and trying to get a religion to change to fit your preferences is not usually a productive approach!<br><br>Bro. Will, actually, that happens in one way or another whenever a literate society gets far enough into abstraction to challenge the traditional figurations of its faith. Ancient Greek rationalist authors savaged the traditions of ancient Greek religion in the fields that interested them -- mostly ethics, rather than science, but the effect was much the same. The Second Religiosity that emerged after the Greek age of reason thus had a good working relationship with philosophy, by and large. Thus you're probably right that the Second Religiosity of our society will focus on faiths that don't claim that their sacred texts reveal the truth about geology, paleontology, or what have you -- but since it's completely unnecessary to interpret sacred texts in that way, this shouldn't be too big of a problem.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c7567345380534223346 title="comment permalink">11/21/13, 11:30 AM</a><br><br>

Its becoming its own subculture or counterculture, despite the seeming chaos of it, and its growing very quickly, becoming a phenomenon unto itself over the last 20 years or so...<br><br>In a nutshell, these festivals are a mixture of the big pagan outdoor festivals, massive visionary art displays, bonfire rites, renn faires, and rave dance parties. Although not all have bonfires (not smart during fire season in a forest!) and not all have electronica music (Faerieworlds, for example, specializes in Celtic inspired music, much of it acoustic) there are similarities and commonalities to these gatherings.<br><br>Creative expression, imagination, free "play" like most adults haven't done since childhood is one big part of it. Lots of costumes, masks, dressing up (or taking it all off!) make-up, and body art is found in all festivals. Art is ubiquitous-- every festival without exception is a feast for the eyes, both day and night. Music and dance is the energy thrumming through the crowds, especially at night. Finally, an absolute veneration for nature, and for the sacred feminine and the Earth underlies everything-- though expressed very individualistically. The people drawn to these festivals are very diverse, yet there are common threads between them. <br><br>More here in a TEDX talk in Vancouver, B.C.-- <br> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8tDpQp6m0A&amp;feature=youtu.be<br><br>And another article written about this topic with lots and lots of links to investigate more--<br>http://www.patheos.com/blogs/wildhunt/2011/10/transformational-festival-culture.html<br><br>The music can be many kinds, much of it worldbeat or trance dance-- as often in other languages as English, even in the U.S. More and more, we're seeing acts like these: <br><br>Omnia (from Britain) - who look like a mix of hippie/goth/tribal and play all traditional instruments, including a hurdy-gurdy, and their protest song regarding the modern world:<br> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLZ_Zy1VhMI<br><br>An early favorite was Faun (from Germany) -- this song is in German, but its about the foolishness of a man's failed attempts at the healing arts, which are the province of women:<br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKaCXPVFZPg<br><br>Or Kila (from Ireland) who are phenomenal at germinating ecstatic music - (hit play on video): <br>http://www.kila.ie/detail.php?category_id=5&amp;sub_category_1_id=35<br><br>Forgive me for all the links. I find it almost impossible to explain the broad and complex concept of these festivals without a lot of help! I've been attending events of this kind for the last 15 years or so myself. The festivals are gaining such popularity that they're outgrowing their venues at a brisk clip and being forced to pour out into many versions of the original (think Burning Man as the largest and most obvious example of this.)<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c8744118402372766113 title="comment permalink">11/21/13, 11:48 AM</a><br><br>

I'm in my 40s, and these days its difficult to be MOVED anymore to a place of release, whether of grief or joy. Yet these gatherings pull me out of my walled defenses and help me live. If I sound like a convert-? Well, guilty as charged! I love the festivals, I admit it. <br><br>Although the big light shows and electronic music require a lot of energy, obviously, acoustic music, even archaic forms of it, are being revived and are becoming ever more popular. (I never even SAW a hurdy-gurdy until well into my 30s, and now they're popping up everywhere!) Buskers and individual musicians roam around the festivals and faires and it wouldn't be impossible to carry on even without all the electricity.<br><br>Another odd thing about these festivals is how nearly everyone who attends them also holds massive agreement that the biosphere is in deep trouble, and there is great grief and anger about this-- yet the act of holding the festival is almost in defiance of the idea of giving up. Few know what to do exactly instead, but most want to create and to experience the creations of others on the human side of things, as well as celebrate life and the beauty and bounty of our world. Veneration and gratitude are the dominant emotions, even in the face of all the world's issues.<br><br>Once you try going to a festival, its difficult to imagine facing mundane, cowan, muggle, norm [insert your own phrase here] life again without knowing you have the breaks these festivals offer. Its a communal spiritual experience that's FUN, and nurtures in a way that you just can't find out in the world otherwise these days. I can't help thinking there's a deep NEED these festivals are providing that somehow ties in to the changes we're facing and the dearths that are built in to our modern lives as they stand now. My suspicion is that the seeds of the future spirituality you suggest may possibly be found in here somewhere... or that it will germinate into something at a later date once its had time to take root and sprout for the sunshine.<br><br>I'm eager to compare what you believe may begin to manifest with what I suspect may well already be emerging an a very primitive and embryonic level. There seems to be something more to the festivals than a countercultural "fad" that will soon fade. Only time will tell of course, but my intuition says the undercurrents are stirring...<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c7706331573207918365 title="comment permalink">11/21/13, 11:51 AM</a><br><br>

After starting with Nietsche quite a while back, you are able to tie back in the essential role of nonrational rejection of nihlism in building any human community after a collapse. <br><br>I have walked the road of accepting a religious tradition because a choice had to be made about how to live even when a rational foundation for that choice was not available. Your insight is true. But embracing a religious tradition because you choose it without evidence is different than believing in a religion as the authoritative source of truth. In the era where we understand a lot about how bio-physio-chemical processes limit the capabilities of the human mind, it is not really possible to go back to many religious conceptions of who humans are. In my opinion, it will be a religion that fully embraces scientific rationalism and understands its limits that will follow after the religion of progress. In our age, the word religion often conveys faith in supernatural causal effects in the physical world (faith healing, prophetic foreknowledge, divine physical blessing or punishment for certain actions) even though measurements consistently can't find any evidence for these things. I suspect that kind of religion will not be effective in guiding people past nihlism and societal collapse. Of course many will try to latch back onto the traditional religions in tough times, but it seems hard to imagine how a religion with doctrines that conflict with clear measurements is going to come out dominant.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c6037968544813984742 title="comment permalink">11/21/13, 11:58 AM</a><br><br>

I've attended a couple of festivals of that sort, as attendee and speaker, and didn't have anything like the same reaction you did -- if anything, they made me think of Marie Antoinette and her courtiers playing at being shepherds and shepherdesses while France stumbled toward revolution around them. Still, I'm entirely willing to be wrong; it may be that since I have Asperger's syndrome, I'm not neurologically equipped to tap into what's going on at these events. <br><br>Ganv, I suspect you're right, if only because the same thing has happened in the Second Religiosity of previous civilizations. As I mentioned to William Church above, the criticisms leveled at ancient Greek religion by Greek philosophers focused on the ethical dimension -- that was the focus of much of the Greek age of reason, after all -- and so it was probably inevitable that the new religion that rose to prominence in the classical Second Religiosity was one that adopted most of the ethical vision of the classical moralists. In the same way, it's by no means difficult for a religion to embrace the scientific view of the material universe, while pointing out that the scientific method isn't qualified to assess claims about aspects of human experience that don't relate to quantifiable measurements of matter. <br><br>Bill, I'm glad to hear that string theory seems as nonsensical to a trained specialist in the field as it does to me!

Now you wrote:<br><br>"rationalism [...] leads people to believe that abstract concepts are more real than the figurations and raw sensations on which they’re based, and that belief doesn’t happen to be true."<br><br>- The quoted statement, like the one I questioned last week, skips over the third rail: the Real World. One can believe that neither the abstractions nor the figurations are the Real World, both are some impression of it, a way to make sense of it. What's special about the scientific approach (unlike some other systems of abstraction) is that it attempts to answer questions about the behavior of the real world in ways that can be tested experimentally. IMO the biggest discovery in science is the apparent fact the the Real World behaves in predictable ways.<br><br>"Abstract concepts [...] aren’t the objective realities they seek to explain. The laws of nature so eagerly pursued by scientists, for example, are generalizations that explain how certain quantifiable measurements are likely to change when something happens in a certain context, and that’s all they are."<br><br>- I don't think most scientists would disagree on that, except that in practice this kind of predictability has proven enormously useful, thus saying "that's all" seems inappropriate. As you later said: "Treated purely as a heuristic, a mental tool that fosters exploration, the concept of natural law has proven to be very valuable."<br><br>But you also said:<br><br>"It’s wholly reasonable to suppose that there is a reality behind the world of appearances, to be sure, but the problem comes in with the assumption that a favored set of abstract concepts is that reality, rather than merely a second- or thirdhand reflection of it in the less than flawless mirror of the human mind."<br><br>- Again I don't think most scientists would disagree. For one thing, they have seen old "laws of Nature" revised, and expect more of that to happen in the future.<br><br>"The difficulty creeps in when natural laws are treated [...] as the realities of which the world of experience is a confused and imprecise reflection."<br><br>- It's not the "laws" that are treated as reality, it's that any proposed new laws are subjected to experimental verification that attempts to reduce confusion and imprecision.<br><br>"It’s this latter sort of thinking that drives the insistence, very common in some branches of science, that a repeatedly observed and documented phenomenon can’t possibly have taken place, because the existing body of theory provides no known mechanism capable of causing it."<br><br>- Although individual scientists may poo-pooh certain phenomenal claims, it is not fair to claim that the scientific approach as a whole does that. E.g., in the 19th century the observation of what we now call radioactivity did not fit into any then-existing theories, but with enough repeatable evidence it was looked at and eventually got incorporated into the scientific model of the Real World. Some other reported phenomena have not, but that's because they do not have experimentally verifiable consequences. E.g., scientists can accept that many people have religious experiences, it is "true" that they have the experiences, but that does not prove that, e.g., god(s) exist. Only that our brains are wired in such a way that make hallucinations about gods likely. Scientists can accept that people who are close to death but recover tend to tell stories of seeing a great light or whatever, but that has no bearing on the existence of an afterlife. And so on.<br><br>To be sure, SOME scientific theorizing goes too far from reality into abstract mental constructs. I'm currently reading "the trouble with physics" and it's rather disturbing.<br><br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c380435540283909418 title="comment permalink">11/21/13, 2:27 PM</a><br><br>

His most recent book explores what he sees as dogmas in the scientific community that are holding back further exploration. He makes many points about the nature of scientific research that resemble ones you have made here, so I think you might at the very least find it worth checking out of the library. <br><br>Though I feel confident you will disagree with him on one point regarding the possibility of new forms of energy. Still, his approach to this seems practical: having a prize for a working above unity device. If someone creates one, great. If not, it would let most of us move on and put that idea on the shelf (where I think it probably belongs). <br><br>I have read some of his books where he discusses his research into telepathy. I find his telephone telepathy experiments particularly convincing. I have not read A New Science of Life, but I know the theory of morphic resonance that he outlines there draws at least partially on the idea that nature might have something closer to habits than laws. <br><br>A TEDx talk he gave recently sparked some controversy when some extreme materialists tried to have his talk removed from the site. <br><br>Also, I really enjoy this series.

It doesn't even matter if they have visited here or not. They fail to understand that most of the continent has a massive bushfire risk and more people die on the roads every single year, than in the last 100 years of bushfires. In 2003 a bushfire worked its way right into Canberra which is the capital city of the nation. How would that look in Washington DC?

Maybe a symptom of the decline. But at any stage of a civilization, most people, even if literate, do not engage in much abstraction or reflection. Perhaps only during the stages of decline do the intellectuals fall into nihilism and stop engaging in abstraction and reflection. It's funny when the masses who naturally are into figuration, end up reading books that promote nihilism, thus affirming their tendencies.<br><br>The concept of truth is one that can be subject to abstraction and reflection through category theory. It can be modeled as 3 mappings: one in the world to be modeled (which could be the "real" world), another in the higher level world and a third between them. Some maps are better than others, but what is better depends on the context. A simple example of this is geographical maps, some optimizing for angles, others for distances, others for connectivity (e.g. street maps). It is a mystery why some maps are so good, e.g. the Maxwell Equations.

Oswald Spengler once held up the British legal system as an example of a superbly adapted legal system based on practical experience and wisdom. As this case (and many others) shows, that is clearly no longer the case. Things have declined quite a lot in Europe since Spengler’s time, especially on a moral, cultural and spiritual level. <br><br>At some point, I think we will see a return to a more traditional model of justice, with strict accountability and harsh punishments for those who break the rules and social mores, and a lot less tolerance for excuses and deviant behavior. We will also see the return of things like capital punishment, labor camps, flogging and heavy fines since in a post-peak world, no society will able to afford to lock large numbers of people up in prisons without having them contribute to their upkeep and the social costs of allowing repeat offenders to get out of prison to re-offend over and over will be too high to bear, especially in a world where most people will be living on the edge of survival. <br><br>There was a reason why crimes like theft and sexual misconduct were punished so harshly, frequently by death, back in the old days. Thievery could very well deprive someone of the resources they needed to survive, thereby condemning them to death. Sexual assault could ruin a girl’s chance of marriage if she was no longer a virgin, thereby condemning her to extreme hardship, even starvation. Imagine the fate of Saleh’s victims if they were girls in his native country. So why should we tolerate such misconduct here in the West because of someone’s lofty load of manure about “tolerance” and “diversity” and criminals being “victims of society” or a misguided sense of compassion for hardened criminals, sex perverts, welfare cheats and other anti-social deviants who choose to live their lives by preying on others?<br><br>I think the present system of criminal injustice (I will NOT call the present system a criminal “justice” system) will prove to be yet another artifact of the cheap energy meta-bubble. We did a lot of unwise, even stupid things, because we had a lot of resources to waste. This allowed a lot of really bad ideas, in the legal system, academia, popular culture and elsewhere, to become entrenched. As those resources are heedlessly squandered away, those ideas and institutions will be jettisoned because we can no longer afford them and their social consequences. Those societies that cannot adapt and continue to persist in the follies of the present will not survive.<br><br>This is one reason why I expect the EU to collapse under the weight of its own stupidity and folly and why I think a Muslim takeover of Europe within the next century is the most likely scenario. A society that embraces the values of the liberal-left is simply not fit to survive, and will destroy itself in fairly short order, especially once the resources that made the present social order possible diminish and go away. One cannot build a viable society based on the values of nihilism, relativism, hedonistic individualism and the utopian fantasies of post-modern liberalism. Since nature abhors a vacuum, as what is left of European civilization undermines and destroys itself, another culture will take its place. In the case of Europe, that probably means Islam, although another possibility might be a continuation of the Orthodox revival currently underway in the former Soviet Union followed by a new Reconquista coming out of Eastern Europe and Mother Russia.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c817093474539915351 title="comment permalink">11/21/13, 8:40 PM</a><br><br>

It seems to me that the post-modern technological culture discovering this has fragmented and like poor Humpty Dumpy cannot be pieced together again. Individuals seek and find "tools" if you wish that work for them, that make some sense in a pattern language, that at least generate an order of things-even like persons coming of age in abusing families find that at least there is a family and not mere brutal nature hostile and indifferent to their personal existence. However for our time, the transition from one myth of man to a new myth of man seems to be driven by ideology from above. This is like the German Princes choosing Luther or Henry VIII creating the Church of England. My concern is that in a welter of propaganda and lies from above the new faith becomes one even less well adapted for man than the old. Jung interestingly enough writing about the European psyche suggested that turning to the East would not work as the Western mind was not built off the symbols of the Eastern mind. In this post-Christian world of ours, with a radically denatured human being, I understand the rise of Neo-Panganism can be of great psychological help but as a culture embraced by hundreds of millions I cannot fathom it occurring.

People who recognize that the direction progress is going leads nowhere any sane human being would want to go, but can't step outside the belief system in any other way, start longing for catastrophe as the only alternative they can think of.

That's another good reason to chuck your TV into the nearest available dumpster!<br><br>Iuval, Toynbee's theory about creative minorities is unpopular these days but no less valid for that. The number of people in any society who think original thoughts is fairly small; most people have other things to do, such as planting crops or what have you. It's the creative minority that passes through the stages I've outlined, and the rest of the population follows its lead -- insisting that they're being original thinkers, to be sure, when they're rehashing sound bites from the internet. <br><br>Moshe, you're changing the subject. <i>Why</i> is acupuncture rejected by many scientists? What is the reasoning behind that rejection? Pay attention to that and you'll find that in most cases, it's because current theory provides no mechanism for it -- which is the point I've tried to make, and you've tried to evade. As for Sheldrake, please read what you've just written and then look up the phrase "guilt by association." Here's my challenge for you: read a couple of his books, including one that contains some of his replicable experiments, and then <i>do at least one of his experiments yourself</i>. You don't have to tell anyone, so you won't get into any professional trouble for doing it; just do the experiment and see what results you get. I double dog dare you!<br><br>Chris, good. My reasons for talking about the Second Religiosity are, first, it's likely to be a major force in the intellectual and cultural setting in a future many younger readers of this blog will live to see, and second, it has at least the potential to become a vehicle for the preservation of science and cultural traditions into the future, and I'd like to get the current bearers of those traditions thinking about religion as a potential ally in harsh times. Also, of course, as the leader of a small and eccentric religious organization, it's a subject of interest to me, and I write about the things that I find interesting!<br><br>Stephen, bingo. In point of fact, it's precisely those effects that repeatedly pass experimental tests that come in for the most vicious denunciation and the most absolute rejection. Are you at all familiar with John McClenon's book <i>Deviant Science</i>? He takes the sociological theory of deviance, applies it to the way that most scientists demonize parapsychology, and shows that it makes an embarrassingly good deal of sense of the phenomena.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c3268095443344654501 title="comment permalink">11/21/13, 11:33 PM</a><br><br>

I have read every post and purchased some of your books for a long time, but rarely feel I have much to add.<br><br>Perhaps I can be useful now, as a member of a sizable demographic you seem to overlook.<br><br>I am one of the Atheists who share your "Gaiaist" religious "sensibility." There are many of us Atheists who reject the Science-ism prophesy of salvation through "Techno Jesus." And without abstract gods, our biome is our subject of worship, the universe our "god" and our mother earth being the most personal manifestation of it. <br><br>----------<br><br>Today, I disagree with one of the priors of your discussion here, that Nihilism is a bad thing.<br><br>And I'm not sure I'd accept that it, without the superimposed abstractions of a pre-existing religious sensibility, is responsible for negative impacts on individuals or a society. I don't think it is at all.<br><br>What really is at fault is the same misguided religious abstraction that insists that Man deserves to be more than nature has made him, finally freed from the moral and ethical restrictions of religion. A truly "Nihilistic" perspective does not try to "build palaces in the sky" through the abstractions of paper wealth, or "notches in the belt" of a Don Juan."<br><br>Those who "wallow in despair" in "Nihilism" are actually stuck seeking the bizarre values of their religious and cultural sensibilities.<br><br>And in fact, to seek abstract "meaning in life" is to assume that life itself has no intrinsic value.<br><br>So, there is another way to "short circuit" Nihilism: don't. Build on it.<br><br>The model for this is found in Buddhism, certain Daoist writers, and Epicureanism, as just a few examples. <br><br>Once you toss out these bizarre religious abstractions the most simple of all figurations remains:<br><br><i>Stuff that feels good is good. Stuff that feels bad is bad.<br>And this sort of basic life has intrinsic value. </i><br><br>This refocuses the tools of human intellect to a new pragmatic end:<br><br>To seek personal gratification as well and "skillfully" as possible.<br><br>Quickly one realizes that destroying the social fabric around you, as today's "faithful" folk often do, is not a skillful way to seek happiness for yourself of your family. Nor is living in a world devoid of biodiversity, not to mention forests, healthy food, clean air or water to drink. Or love. Or friendship.<br><br>What we need is not better religious narratives.<br><br>What we need is to continue to cut through the religious abstractions that are causing us to "build palaces in the sky" at the expense of our happiness in the real world.<br><br>And we need better cultural tools for seeking that real world happiness.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c8522027801978507592 title="comment permalink">11/22/13, 7:15 AM</a><br><br>

I agree that taking acupuncture seriously took a little longer than it should have, but I think it was a matter of an East vs. West cultural divide.<br><br>"As for Sheldrake, ... read a couple of his books, including one that contains some of his replicable experiments, and then do at least one of his experiments yourself."<br><br>- I don't have the time and inclination, but you'd think that, a decade after he did the original "telephone telepathy" experiments, somebody else would have replicated them, in a well-designed way? I havn't found any report of such. If it's only Sheldrake's claims, then they're no stronger with me than, e.g., Rossi's claims about his cold fusion device.

That's very often the issue in cases like that -- no matter what kind of medicine you're using, it can't overcome the day to day impact of unhealthy behaviors. <br><br>Ursachi, the fact that I put a comment through doesn't mean that I necessarily agree with the poster! <br><br>Bill, as I mentioned when the concept of reflection first came up, it can produce wisdom when it's well handled, and one definition of wisdom is the recognition that while every truth is partial, you still have to manage to get up in the morning and take care of the day's tasks. <br><br>Luckymortal, what you're proposing isn't nihilism; you've made a set of specific claims about what the world is like, and indicated that you consider them to be true. (On the off chance you're interested, what you've proposed is a fairly standard hedonistic materialism -- which is not a dismissal, simply a useful label for that category of philosophy.) Nihilism is the conviction that no statement is true, that (for example) the worldview and the claims based on it that you've presented are no more meaningful or true than the ravings of a psychotic or random words generated by a computer. <br><br>Herr Doktor, last I heard from the publisher of <i>A World Full of Gods</i>, it's in print again and can be ordered directly from the publisher <a href=http://www.adf.org/store/catalog/3 rel=nofollow>at this web site</a>. <br><br>Moshe, okay, good -- you've admitted that you consider it reasonable to dismiss evidence because it doesn't fit currently accepted theories, which was the point at which you originally quibbled. You might be interested to know that there have been reams of scientific studies of acupuncture, like the ones you mentioned in your last comment, ever since acupuncture got noticed by Western scientists in the early 1970s; the studies reliably end up saying "Yes, it works, but we have no idea how" -- and most scientists just go on claiming that it can't work because the mechanism isn't known. <br><br>As for Sheldrake, many of his experiments have been replicated many times over. Have those replications been published in, say, <i>Nature</i>, the periodical that originally labeled Sheldrake's book "a candidate for burning"? Of course not, for obvious reasons. The peer review process is, among other things, a very effective way of keeping orthodoxies glued in place. <br><br>Read up sometime on the way that continental drift was stonewalled in American geology for half a century: papers presenting evidence favorable to continental drift theory couldn't get published in any of the peer reviewed journals, which were controlled by opponents of the theory, and opponents of the theory then pointed to the lack of peer reviewed articles supporting continental drift to reinforce their claim that continental drift was unscientific poppycock. A very neatly circular process, driven by the same factor: nobody had yet figured out a mechanism for continental drift, therefore it couldn't happen.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c6395977914334676285 title="comment permalink">11/22/13, 10:44 AM</a><br><br>

I can completely see what you're saying here. Festivals are, by nature, the very essence of frivolity! <br><br>But here's the thing: we live in a world where we're not encouraged to venerate the female, the earth, or our own spiritual selves-- I don't mean following rules in order to be moral, I mean reaching out to embrace the divine directly. These festivals all actively encourage that mode of operation, at least within the safe space of the festival. But that aspect of accepting more into your life can begin to change how one approaches many other aspects of human existence for a great many participants.<br><br>I see the festivals as a sort of inoculation against numbness and surrender. Given what we're facing, throwing a party that can help remind you of why its worth bothering in the first place can be a very good thing. Ennui, let alone despair, can be mighty forces to confront as I'm sure you've noticed! Changing "Too hard, why bother?" into "Heck yeah, let's do it!" requires something pretty powerful these days. Logic alone rarely motivates people. The festivals cater to the non-rational side of human nature pretty effectively.<br><br>Aside from that, however, are the values that get shared at the festivals, and over the last five years especially (since the beginning of "the Great Recession") I'm noticing a more serious underlying attitude and some actual consensus on several issues. As of yet, things are still very chaotic and juvenile for sure, but it wouldn't at all surprise me if perhaps some people are inspired and invigorated to take things further. Every festival has its own schtick. Some are more spiritually oriented than others. Workshops are taking on more mature subjects and communities are beginning to develop slowly but surely. There's some potential there much further down the road.<br><br>That more and more people are being drawn towards these types of events may be indicative of other growing trends in the population that may, eventually, find other avenues of expression. If some form of this continues in a modified way as fuel to travel and energy becomes ever more expensive, maybe that's when we'll see something truly interesting begin to happen. <br><br>I grew up with a sister who has Asperger's and the person I've been friends with the longest (since age 12) also has it, so I understand what you're saying. My friend has attended a number of events that she may have enjoyed sometimes but often found utterly mystifying in many ways, so there could be something to that.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c1386693241401415071 title="comment permalink">11/22/13, 11:03 AM</a><br><br>

So what? That's much faster than a "geological" speed. And it took less than that for acupuncture. You usually take the long view, why not here? The inherent conservatism of the scientific establishment is sometimes frustrating, but does lead to solid science in the long run.<br><br>Regarding evidence for unexplained phenomena, I think we'll just end up disagreeing, but it may be useful to keep in mind the Bayesian POV that somebody here mentioned a couple of weeks back. Any observation can be explained in many ways, and thus is not by itself a "proof" of anything. It does add "evidence" for or against something. The subjective probability that one assigns to various possibilities depends not just on that new evidence, but also on prior evidence and prior beliefs.<br><br>Sorry for the typos in my previous comment, haste makes paste, there are probably typos in this one too - they're always invisible until I hit the "publish" button, must be another unexplained phenomenon!<br><br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c8048595735587889039 title="comment permalink">11/22/13, 11:13 AM</a><br><br>

For example, read any number of explanations for near-death experiences, and you will reliably encounter the same few well-worn explanations, hypoxia, hypercarbia, endogenous DMT release, etc. The problem with all of these is that they can and have been replicated in laboratory conditions, and yet never seem to produce anything close to the experiences described by those who've had an NDE. In spite of this, backer will always insist that "they must be true," because they are the only explanations that fit neatly into current dogma.<br><br>I guess it's more my personality to play around the edges and seek the anomalies or the phenomena that don't currently have good explanations, a la Charles Fort (who made a career of collecting and documenting such anomalies).<br><br>It seems that Occam's razor has, in many circles, been redefined as "That explanation which least challenges existing dogma is the most likely to be true, regardless of what Procrustean manipulation must be employed to make it fit."<br><br>For another example of the above, the question of what instigates collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics could very easily be solved by positing the fundamental existence of consciousness as something other than the byproduct of neuro-chemical reactions (brain as a receiver/tuner of consciousness rather than originator), yet this rather simple idea is dismissed as impossible, with many physicists instead supporting the idea that every time a wave function collapses, a new universe is created.<br><br>That is hilarious to me, since that has even less chance of being verified objectively than the existence of fundamental consciousness. Not only that, it is claimed to be supported by Occam's Razor. To me, "entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity" would argue against the creation of infinite universes!<br><br><br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c7999615237264806093 title="comment permalink">11/22/13, 11:55 AM</a><br><br>

(On the off chance you're interested, what you've proposed is a fairly standard hedonistic materialism -- which is not a dismissal, simply a useful label for that category of philosophy.) Nihilism is the conviction that no statement is true, that (for example) the worldview and the claims based on it that you've presented are no more meaningful or true than the ravings of a psychotic or random words generated by a computer. </i><br><br>I apologize for jumping into the conversation if there is any offense taken, I am never sure about these discussion board social protocols, I have my own neurological issues. :)<br><br>I was interested in the direction it is taking. <br><br>At this point, JMG, your discreption of nihilism is almost absurdly self-refuting. "Nihilism is the conviction that no statement is true." A conviction is a statement that is true. If the truth is that no statement is truth, then how can this statement be true or false? The equivalent is a philosophical cliche/conundrum like, "This statement is false."<br><br>My assumption when something appears to be able to boiled down to this level of simplicity is that the boiled down statement is very badly missing some essential point. Its what got me into politics during the Bush Administration WMD Iraq war, then later into the peak oil scene. A bunch of other paths too, but in all cases the same thing I found to be true, when I investigated truths that sounded too simplistic, I found them to be untruths in various measures. <br><br>However, JMG, with all due respect: I don't believe the quibbling over this matters at all to your central points in this post and I understand the general point you are trying to convey. Being hopeless results in despair, which is a painful but necessary part of the process in losing all hope. One who is without hope and who is also not in despair is generally working their asses off, no matter how terrible or good it looks in present circumstances. <br><br>My take on that is that hope is the cruelest gifts you can give someone asking for help. It doesn't follow, of course, that being mean or cruel is anything other than a less cruel gift to give them. Nor does it follow that you are obliged to offer help that you cannot afford to give. I guess that is my pseudo-defense of Nihilism.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c9023782753435223920 title="comment permalink">11/22/13, 6:27 PM</a><br><br>

I can't imagine going through daily life without being that way to a certain extent. If a stranger tells me they have a pet cat, I'll have no reason to disbelieve them, even though it's possible they could be lying or delusional. However if they tell me they have a pet wolverine, I'll be pretty skeptical. There needs to be some sort of balance. We can't take all figurations equally seriously, yet being dogmatic over abstractions runs into all sorts of problems too.<br><br>It's possible to have skepticism without dogmatism, despite the fact that so many so-called skeptics are as dogmatic as they get. I am constantly amazed at how often I hear people accuse others of confirmation bias and selective use of facts/statistics while doing the exact same thing themselves in a pretty blatant way. I guess that shows a lack of reflection. The term that I've used most often is simply "pay attention", although that's vague enough that it can be used to mean lots of different things.

I haven't found for myself that reflection leads to nihilism at all, although I can see from what you're saying how it could, and nihilism does seem to be on the rise at this time. Personally, I wonder if nihilism is an antireligion of sorts to the fundamentalist theist and civil religions that claim to know the one and only absolute truth. I always argue against there being "one true way" when that sort of dogmatism comes up, whether philosophically or in such practical matters as gardening technique, and I sometimes have people misinterpret me as being nihilistic, as if the only two options are that there is only one right path/method or else that no paths/methods are better than any others and thus it's all meaningless. Any practical example shows otherwise, there are many paths up a mountain for sure but that doesn't mean that all paths lead there, some dead-end and others lead off cliffs.<br><br>Nihilism has really never made any sense to me, I've had depressive times for sure where I felt pretty hopeless about a lot of things, but underlying that all has always been a sense of value, that there is meaning, some things are right and some things are wrong (and many things somewhere in between), even if I don't fully comprehend it all. Yes, it's true in the philosophical sense that we can never be absolutely sure of anything, but going from there to nihilism just strikes me as completely ungrounded thinking. Would anyone who is starving claim that food is of no value?<br><br>There is something else relevant to reflection that I have experienced and haven't heard discussed much, probably because it involves realizing that our minds are not unlimited. I've noticed how much the context of what is around me determines what my mind comes up with. I've found it very helpful for myself to do a simple relaxation/reflection exercise, I don't call it meditation because it's not like any meditation system I've seen or read about, I've tried some of them but none have helped nearly as much as what I just came up with, which is hard to describe in words, but makes me feel a lot more balanced, and then if I want to I can reflect on something much more clearly. I tend to be more of a nonverbal thinker so it's often a question of what patterns and images come up, and how well I can translate them into useful things. Anyway, I've noticed that reflecting on the same thing while in different places, often very different sorts of thoughts pop up. If I'm out in nature, the sense of underlying meaning and connection to everything is more apparent, while the more artificial the environment I'm in, the more that sense seems farther away, still there but more disconnected, and my emotions about the same subjects and thoughts are more negative. I wonder how much of the nihilism and depression that's so rampant is simply due to the circumstances of modern life.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c6152628485381169727 title="comment permalink">11/22/13, 6:57 PM</a><br><br>

(I.e. they used a subjective value judgement, but called it "science" meaning objective truth).<br><br>The notion that people "held out for the truth" and would only be convinced by instrument ("real") data (the gravity surveys, sonar mapping of mid-ocean ridge, …) which they deemed "truly objective" is a bit of a post-facto excuse. The issue with instrument data is, of course, who decides how objective the design/calibration/operation/data reduction/... of any given instrument is?

This gap is fundamental and it means that not only does data not imply theory but that data can't imply theory.<br><br>I don't think that realization necessarily leads to nihilism but it does lead to the downfall of the modern myth of progress and it does create a void which something must fill. One thing that can fill it is a return to culture, and a renewed sense of cultural and intellectual humility.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c5469753717604134832 title="comment permalink">11/23/13, 6:54 PM</a><br><br>

You've now admitted that in science as currently practiced, due to what you've termed "the inherent conservatism of the scientific establishment," an overwhelming body of evidence can be ignored for many decades because it conflicts with current theory, and you've claimed that it's normal scientific practice to use prior beliefs to assign a subjective probability to evidence. That is to say, you've agreed with the point I made in last week's post about the way an age of reason becomes an age of unreason: the culture of rationalism becomes so enamored of its own theories, and so unwilling to revisit them, that crucial issues can pass completely unnoticed for a very long time. I rest my case. <br><br>If I may return to a point you've tried to finesse, by the way, it won't work to claim that acupuncture has been included by current scientific opinion just because studies are being done. As I pointed out earlier, studies have been being done continuously since the early 1970s; the results have by and large been positive; but the great majority of scientists continue to insist that it's quackery, because no causal mechanism is yet known. It's a source of some amusement to me that a century ago, when logic was still taught in American schools, any bright ten-year-old could have explained the fallacy involved in the claim "The cause isn't known, therefore the effect doesn't happen" -- though you'd probably have to wait for them to stop giggling at such an obvious howler. <br><br>Nano, outside my house right now, the wind is singing. It's a cold song, but I find it well worth the listening!<br><br>Justin, nicely summarized. In the Age of Unreason, the first task of the scientist is to find some way to force the data to fit the theory, and ad hoc hypotheses are a very common bit of hardware used in that never-ending task. <br><br>Phil, oh, granted. People use alternative health care for a wide range of reasons, many of them very dubious -- though of course people use mainstream health care with the same varying motives. Nor is acupuncture, or any other form of alternative health care, a panacea -- like every healing modality, it does some things well and some things poorly, and has to be integrated into a healthy lifestyle as well as recognition that human beings get old and die no matter what medical system they use!<br><br>Greg, you're right that I disagree with Sheldrake about the possibility of extracting energy from morphogenetic fields -- to my mind he's confounding the planes, and mixing up information with energy. Still, dissensus is the key; if he thinks he can generate energy, well, by all means let him try. <br><br>Cherokee, I wonder if it'll grow up to be an International Wombat of Mystery...<br><br>Stephen, that's the one! Thanks for catching the mistake. <br><br>Justin, the fact that nihilism is logically self-refuting doesn't make it unpopular. Maybe we run in very different circles, but the claim that nothing actually means anything or matters, that nobody can actually know anything about the world, and $%#@ it, who cares anyway? -- that's fairly common these days, and tends to be equally common in the corresponding phase of every civilization. As for hope and despair, I think you've confused the concept of hope with the facile optimism of the privileged -- but then I wrote <a href=../../2011/12/hope-in-cold-season.html rel=nofollow>a post about that</a> a while back, and would refer you to that if you're interested.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c8852083154564061602 title="comment permalink">11/23/13, 11:24 PM</a><br><br>

It tends to do so under certain historical circumstances, and those may well have a great deal to do -- as you've suggested -- with the ordinary details of daily life in a falling civilization. <br><br>KL, too funny. I suspect these days more people know the pagan version of that song than the original!<br><br>Ursachi, no argument there -- and a resurgence of fascism is at least as likely here in the US, not least because so many people over here have no idea what fascism actually is, and use the word -- as George Orwell pointed out a long time ago -- as a label for "something not desirable." I'll be talking about that in a series of upcoming posts. <br><br>Myriad, it's a fascinating article, with some very solid points and some very revealing ones. In particular, it's telling that the question she thinks she was asking about OBEs isn't the question she was actually asking. She thought she was asking "Does anything actually leave the body in an OBE?" What she was actually asking is "Can I find a way to explain OBEs that doesn't require anything to leave the body?" <br><br>It's not a small difference. To answer the first question, she would have had to practice science -- that is, to come up with a hypothesis (such as "nothing actually leaves the body in an OBE) and then try to <i>disprove</i> it via experiment. To answer the second one, she had to practice rhetoric -- that is, to come up with a set of arguments to make her preferred interpretation of OBEs seem more plausible than the alternatives. The only problem with the latter is that it avoids the risk of experimental disconfirmation, and so doesn't actually tell you anything about the world -- just about the arguing skills of the rhetorician. <br><br>Hawkesbury, thanks for the suggestion. It's not a book I've read -- I may have to fix that. <br><br>Chris, evolution isn't a fast process, and a million years can be barely enough time for it to get going with a relatively long-lived species like ours. As for a return to culture, though, no argument there -- and that's a common feature of the Second Religiosity, for that matter.<br><br>Stream, hmm. Well, we'll see. <br><br>Chris, good!

I say to her "did you knwow that they did such and such in the 19th century" and she replies yes she found that out in old novels, life was different back then. <br><br>Religious stories, fables, fairy tales are "concrete abstractions" like astrological archetypes. An archetype represents all such people and then you get the point of the story as the truth of daily experience hits you in the gut. This is an emotional / moral generalization from a story which you can relate to from personal experience.<br><br>We have heroes and antiheroes in real life and in film and TV series and novels nowadays from Hitler to Kennedy, Nixon to Harry Potter, maybe dead drug addicted pop-stars (Britney's failure vs. Madonna's success or Michael Jackson as object lesson). This gives us short hand to discuss how one should and should not behave or bad things will happen to us or how if we behave well we are rewarded, (Life story of Clinton, Obama, etc.) These are like modern fairy tales that direct our lives. In personal life we might talk in the family of an alcoholic uncle who had great promise as a youth or similar. These are family fairy tales. <br><br>This gets built up into archetypes such as Loki/ Odysseus for clever. A story with a personality in it concretizes behavioral norms and consequences. Moral laws such as "don't lie, steal,etc." mean little unless you see Nixon, Stalin, Clinton, Hitler, Janis Joplin,etc. stretched out in their embarassing or horrific detail before you. <br><br>Abstract scientific theories of reality are another thing altogether and without appropriate technology or wealth and free time for abtract thinking fairly meaningless in everyday life. Galileo, Newton, Einstein have no moral behavioral sides that anyone cares to discuss. This is more like common sense level of don't jump off a cliff if you want to live longer and otherwise just argument. If two primitives or small children argue whether the sun is central or the earth this has no consequnces in daily life, anymore than for a zebra. <br><br>Only a culture with global reach can practically attain any higher truth in this sense and apply it. But then the moral elment might get lost as we apply more of our attetnion to technological and scientific progress than to universal moral principles. When science and technology gets going someone always wins out against someone else, accumulating wealth. Progress through science is just a moral tale, redistribution of wealth and civilization as a whole. When I say I have found a basic truth which is fascination (Einstein) then the cynic must ask who will profit from this, what is thhe point?

To clarify this, Jaynes introduces what he calls "The Robot" into which information is fed. Most people will understand that a robot (at least with current technology) does not have opinions, feelings, prejudices or whatever. Nevertheless by simply applying Bayes' theorem the robot will evaluate "subjective probabilities" that are conditional on the information fed into it. Because the term "subjective" is so readily and pervasively misunderstood, Jaynes phased it out but some schools of Bayesian analysis do still use this term, which causes endless confusion.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c5756552211314793000 title="comment permalink">11/24/13, 6:36 AM</a><br><br>

A child that cannot apply Bayesian analysis efficiently will not survive life's ordinary hurdles unless permanently and constantly restrained by someone who can. <br><br>Bayesian analysis is just the repeated use of the basic notion of conditional probability, so the theory of learning is just the theory of probability. Hence the 1st part of Jaynes' book title. The second part of the title reflects the observation that whereas mathematicians can make absolute statements about truth (binary logic), scientists can only ever speak of probabilities. So the theory of scientific reasoning is the particular branch of mathematics that deals with probability theory. <br><br>Taking account of prior information when analysing any given data is essential for science to make any progress at all. Failing to do so would entail attempting to reboot the entirety of science every day, or every minute …or … you get the point. Science and mathematics represent an accumulation of knowledge. Or at least they are supposed to. <br><br>This leads to a difficult and tangled subject which is addressed comprehensively by Jaynes: as you know there is never any guarantee that knowledge will always advance. It can and does sometimes regress. The history of statistical analysis from about 1920 to about 1960 represents an astonishing example of such a regression (pun not intended but, oh well, there it is). <br><br>During that period, Bayesian analysis was set aside and replaced (especially in the life sciences) by a tangled ad-hoc mess of statistical methods that are sometimes (nowadays) called classical but are also called "frequentist". Jaynes calls them "orthodox" but that is perhaps a little out of date nowadays (it depends on the discipline). <br><br>A key aspect of these non-Bayesian methods is precisely that they have nowhere to put the prior information. They analyse each new dataset as though it is the sum of all knowledge, thus ignoring almost all of the sum of all knowledge. <br><br>This attempt to do "science without memory" leads to phenomena like medical studies that that produce contradictory findings about the benefits of this-or-that foodstuff over a period of decades. As each new study comes out it is treated as though, merely by being recent, its findings somehow negate the previous studies. This is why the public gets fed-up (oops another pun) with scientific advice about diet. <br><br>In practice, even scientists trained in these methods usually manage (using common sense) to incorporate some memory into their analyses. So medical research progresses, but much more slowly than it might and with a huge waste of data that was obtained at prodigious expense. Fortunately there has been a strong resurgence of Bayesian analysis in the life sciences but there is a long way to go … basically the problem is that life scientists are taught how to generate data but they are not taught how to think. <br><br>Jaynes was a formidable mathematical physicist and he has a tendency to write as though all his readers are similarly competent. Nevertheless the early chapters in his book are hopefully more accessible and are also available for free:<br><br>http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf<br><br>Here is a huge selection of some of his other work<br>http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/node2.html<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c527377178867789954 title="comment permalink">11/24/13, 6:40 AM</a><br><br>

I don't mind, since you make interesting points. But I have not "admitted" as much as you claim.<br><br>I forget who said that "scientific revolutions proceed one funeral at a time". Individual scientists have always resisted loss of their favorite theories, so 50 years for a major theoretical shift is not slow. It was not faster back before this age of unreason.<br><br>As for something like acupuncture, one can relate to it in other ways, outside of science, but to the extent that science is to dabble in it, it will be a slow process until a "mechanism" is found. Note that that does not mean that it will be tailored to fit the current theories. More likely, if that happens, it would lead to new theory. But that theory would not be a scientific theory unless it makes experimental predictions.<br><br>For an analogy, let's take electricity and magnetism (E&amp;M). The theories devised in the 19th century did not explain them in terms of, say, Newtonian theories of gravity. We do not, even now, "know what E&amp;M are" - such a knowing is impossible, has no meaning. To say that, e.g., the electrostatic force between charges decreases with the distance squared, does not say anything about what a "charge" really is and why it exerts a force. What has proven possible is an investigation into how things behave, to the point that we can design and build, e.g., a working radio.<br><br>Somebody above said that data do not dictate the theory. I agree, but theory does predict some of the data. And eventually gets replaced with refined theory that predicts more of the data. That approach does not equate any given theory with reality itself.<br><br>Another comment above said that we are limited to our sensory input when it comes to learning about the real world. That is not quite true. Experiments we set up can translate things we cannot directly sense into results that we can. E.g., we cannot sense the earth's magnetic field (although some animals can), but we can build a compass. Similarly, we cannot directly sense quantum mechanical happenings, which apply to individual subatomic particles. But by trial and error we've found out how to, e.g., build that radio using transistors - devices designed using quantum theory.<br><br>(continued in another comment)<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c2219318987816126514 title="comment permalink">11/24/13, 6:44 AM</a><br><br>

That is not saying that we know all of nature's laws, or ever will. You said nature does not have laws, only habits, I think we'll agree to disagree on that. At most, some of the laws (e.g. quantum physics) appear to be statistical, that's a "gap" that a lot of people try to put their "god" into, but translated into macroscopic settings those statistical laws are quite deterministic. And BTW the laws of thermodynamics (which preceded quantum machanics) are already describing statistical aggregates, and thus are the least likely to be broken. So much for a long list of purported new energy sources. <br><br>When I claim that "psi" phenomena are illusory, what I am saying is that they have not been shown to lead to predictable phenomena that can be "used". "The plural of anecdotes is not data", and the subjective experience of people, even millions of them, does not lead to practical applications. If it was possible to go there, somebody would have paid for it - and there would have been a LOT of money offered. E.g., rumors are that the US military has paid some "psychics" to attempt to do things such as find the location of a nuclear bomb that was accidentally lost in the ocean. If such hirings were successful, we'd have a whole psi department in the federal government now, and Wal-Mart would be selling millions of psychophones for $27.99 a piece. (Minor examples of the hiring of some psychics, or the selling of trinkets such as "magnetic bracelets" that only "work" for believers, do not count.)<br><br>So my attitude is, if it has no practical impact on my life, then it's useless for me to ask whether it is "true". Obviously somebody who has psi experiences (which I don't) has a different perspective. And their behavior impacts me. But that impact on me is the same as if they're just hallucinating. I do get that the manipulation of ones own hallucinations, or of others', does seem to many people as a useful activity. It will certainly impact me practically when they burn us rationalists at the stake, or if they refuse as a society to do what needs to be done (e.g., stop wrecking the climate) since we're going to be "saved" by some psychic miracle instead.<br><br>The captcha is amazingly psychic: "copemb".

Of course there are flaws in the human capacity to understand the world that evolution can't fix -- like everything else, the evolution of intelligence is subject to the law of diminishing returns, and the evolutionary process usually results in "good enough" rather than optimal solutions, anyway.

Still, I'll refrain from a point-for-point response, since as I think you've also noticed, we're basically talking past each other at this point. I'll simply note that there are a lot more people putting off constructive action about the climate because they expect a scientific miracle to save us all -- the words "I'm sure they'll think of something" may come to mind here -- than there are reposing the same hope in psi.

Since the plunge into nihilism appears to require widespread literacy according to the cyclical model you've been describing, I was wondering if all literate civilizations were doomed to take this plunge. In turn, then, I was wondering if widespread literacy is really a benefit - the question I wanted to ask. But if evolution could weed out the plunge into nihilism, that answers the question well enough. And perhaps this sort of discussion, and the actions that we take from it, can be part of how that evolution occurs.

Being cautious and being dismissive are not synonymous. <br><br>Scientists are always cautious about new reported phenomena. Not because caution is fun (it really isn't) but because most such reports turn out to be false. Not complicated. Scientific caution is the result of a huge amount of experience over several centuries in which science has been practiced in its current form. <br><br>The results of scientists abandoning caution are as predictable as they are embarrassing. Do I need to say "cold fusion"? <br><br>Before continuing I should point out that it is dangerous to make generalizations about "scientists" (as we have both done) because science encompasses a variety of tribes and there are huge (I mean, truly enormous) cultural gulfs separating them.

Evolutionary biologists are an exception: they seem to use mathematics as a primary descriptive mode, so their style seems familiar to a physicist. <br><br>You claim that acupuncture is rejected due to a lack of known mechanism. But many drugs are used with little understanding of their mode of action. Indeed designing drugs with a known mode of action was such a novelty that it had to be given a specific name: "Rational Drug Design". Drugs were, until recently, discovered mainly by feeding more-or-less random chemicals to unfortunate laboratory animals. The important thing was not how they worked but that they had strong observable effects. <br><br>As for interactions between drugs, even less is known about the mechanisms there, yet interactions are reported, studied and incorporated into prescription advice. <br><br>I'm just pointing out that in medical science, mechanistic explanation is often still completely beyond current knowledge but this doesn't prevent experimental work and clinical application of new treatments. <br><br>Regarding your college course in stats. The truth is that most such courses are somewhere between bad and abysmal, and many biologists who are forced to take them absolutely hate statistics from then on.

It probably didn't help that massive academic fraud was basically business as usual in that department when I was there -- there were guys over in the computer science department who would take your data and, for a $50 bill or so, run as many tests as it took to find something that was significant to the .05 level; the experimenters then rewrote their papers to claim that whatever turned out to be significant was what they were trying to find, so they had something to publish.

My point there was that lack of causal mechanism may have been the reason stated for rejecting acupuncture but it cannot have been the real reason. My guess (and that's all it is) is that the East-West discomfort issue mentioned by Moshe may have been important. <br><br>You will have to forgive me for not launching an investigation into the history there, since I have already spent time I can ill-afford on the Sheldrake issues over the last few days, looking at some of his papers and his online experiments. The problem is that a proper investigation takes serious time. In the case of Sheldrake I've spent enough time to be sure that I don't want to spend any more time and I think there is roughly zero chance of anything interesting being discovered. In doing that I have taken into account that his theories, if they could be made to stand up, would be the greatest scientific advance of all time. So you have to try to evaluate the product of <br>"likelihood of success" with "importance of result". In this case, second factor is extremely high but the first factor is more-than-commensurately low, leading to an overall estimate of roughly zero. Every individual scientist has to make a calculation like that before committing time to a project. You can't proceed with work when you yourself don't expect for a moment that it will produce anything. <br><br>In the case of acupuncture, I think the story is probably a good deal more interesting from a scientific standpoint but I suspect the most interesting work may have already been done. <br><br>As for the scientific fraud issue, I wish I could say I am surprised … this is what happens when editors insist on the 0.05 p-value nonsense. However you will be pleased to know that things have advanced considerably. Nowadays, every biologist has access to software on their own PC and they can spend all day running hundreds of different tests until they find one that agrees with their own view of the data. So at least they find an indirect way of telling you what they actually think the data means, as long as you realize that the statistical analysis is fraudulent in the sense that they don't tell you about all the tests that didn't give them their preferred answer. <br><br><br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c6093934248829935567 title="comment permalink">11/25/13, 3:20 AM</a><br><br>

This terminology presents the same temptation to the pseudo-scientist that an open vault does to a bank robber. Why not just lift some of the goods and use them for purposes it was never intended for? This is what Sheldrake and the zero-point-artists and a whole army of other pseudo-scientists do. What are the chances that this is the way a revolution in science will occur? That you can take theoretical concepts that have a precise technical meaning in field theory or quantum mechanics and just splatter them all over the place with a healthy dose of wish-fulfillment and seriously expect that the resulting nonsense will actually work?

Now lets forget the theory and look at the experiments on the "Sense of Being Stared At". Everyone knows the feeling, and it seems obvious that it is one of the many survival mechanisms we evolved. Ogg the cave man needed to know if a cougar was looking at him, so his brain evolved the ability to integrate all his sensory inputs at a subconscious level. When the integrated signal gets strong enough it breaks through to the conscious level and we get the sense of being stared at. <br><br>This feeling occurs in situations where we are not expecting to be watched and we are not aware (consciously) of having seen or heard the watcher or any sign of them. I don't know about you but my sense of being stared at is pretty accurate, I would guess 80% accurate. <br><br>But Sheldrake claims that even once you eliminate all sensory input, there still remains a capacity to detect being watched, which he attributes to his field theories. So he has done numerous experiments and gives a web-based protocol. <br><br>The problem is that <br><br>(1) unlike the real sense of being stared at, the experimental subjects are EXPECTING to be watched. In fact, ALL they are doing is trying to detect any sign of the watcher or any pattern in their behaviour. So unlike in the real situation where the feeling takes you by surprise, these subjects are straining all their senses to detect the watcher. <br><br>(2) it is extremely difficult to eliminate all sensory inputs for the experimental subject and yet still claim that the watcher *is* using their sense of sight to "stare" at the subject.<br><br>(3) Sheldrake's internet experiments attempt to eliminate visual cues by using blindfolds, and when this is done he claims that the success rate is 53% versus 50% for chance alone. <br><br>So after eliminating only one sensory input, the success rate is already low. As mentioned above I would guess that the usual success rate of the sense-of-being-stared-at in real situations where you are not expecting it is maybe 80%. <br><br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c1989336404652766662 title="comment permalink">11/25/13, 5:08 AM</a><br><br>

If it is at 53% with blindfolds, how close will it get to 50% when more serious attempts are made to eliminate sensory inputs? The closer the result gets to 50%, the larger the number of trials you need to have any hope of separating the hypotheses that (a) "the true rate is 50%" vs (b) "the true rate is 50% plus a tiny bit"<br><br>Others have attempted such experiments and they concluded there was no signal, just noise. <br><br>http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ruperts-resonance<br><br>However, we don't need to rely on a few academics with piddling budgets to settle the issue. Instead consider two groups with essentially unlimited budgets who would each desperately like to get hold of technology exploiting Sheldrake's phenomena if it could actually be shown to work: Wall St on the one hand and the US military on the other. <br><br>Hedge funds will do anything, anything at all, to get an edge. And for them, a 3% edge (or even a 1% edge) would be a serious gold mine. Traders are actually a rather superstitious bunch and I've heard serious, well known figures mention astrology as a trading tool. I know some who claim to use astrology for trading purposes. Some use numerology. They will in fact use anything at all if they think it will give them an edge. Astrology provides patterns and they attempt to line those pattern up with market patterns. But Sheldrake's ideas would give them a much more powerful edge: insight into what other traders are doing. This is always extremely sought-after information and traders would kill to have an edge like that. But I've never heard even a whisper about Sheldrake's ideas from traders. <br><br>The US military, it hardly needs to be spelled out, wouldn't hesitate to use Sheldrake's theories if they actually worked. They are a little less superstitious than traders, to be fair, but if something can be shown to work they will use it. For them, the expense of setting up trials to do accurate measurements of a very weak effect would be chickenfeed. They already have an army (literally) of experimental subjects available, which is the main expense of these studies anyway. But again, in decades of Sheldrake's self-promotion there has never even been a whisper of interest from those who would be most able to apply these ideas. <br><br>Instead of asking myself if I should put more time into thinking about this, I instead ask myself why I've already put any time into it. Well, I've clarified a few things for my own purposes, I suppose, so that will have to do.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c1432299480969308755 title="comment permalink">11/25/13, 5:16 AM</a><br><br>

From some of the things that you mention in your articles, I assume that you are familiar with the science renegade: Rupert Sheldrake. According to Sheldrake, scientists can't even be honest when it comes to recording the speed of light. I know that you are unable to write about everything at the same time.

Equally, there's nearly a 1.0 correlation between those health care modalities that do not make money for the mainstream American health care industry, and those which today's so-called skeptics denounce as pseudoscientific poppycock.

The research team had been doing this for years; they were highly skilled at bringing in grant money, so the university thought they walked on water, and nobody asked inconvenient questions. <br><br>I've had plenty of conversations with other people who were undergrads and grad students involved in some of the more fraud-prone fields of science, such as health sciences and psychology, and almost everyone has similar stories.

The use of legonomisms seems to have been a common practice among occultists of that era, so it would not surprise me in the least.

As brother from North I support you to undermine leftist/liberal agenda in grassroots community level as much as you can, without any shame. I come myself from blue-collar community flooded with immigrants in 90's, and when totally predictable problems between cultural memes broke out, hypocritical advice from "ivory tower intellectuals" living themselves in neighborhoods with zero level of humanitarian immigration was ridiculous and self-righteous in the worst possible way. They practically poured mystical essence of "white guilt" into our necks, like our native working class community next to Russian border should hold some existential shame about past sins of West European colonialism. That response to set of problems that were basically practical and without any great zeal was absurd beyond pale, and totally counterproductive. It just made matters worse. I myself have many immigrant friends from our boxing gym (fifteen years of training and still going), but I despise and loath their "political defenders", left-wing liberals, beyond any measurable amount.<br><br>Nowadays practically whole old hood of mine supports brand of right-wing populism in my country...including me.

Once people stop using science as a justification for the civil religion of progress, and start thinking of it again as one toolkit out of many, very well suited to some questions and very poorly suited to others, it'll be possible to do with it what was done with logic in the late Classical world: sort through the good, the bad, and the ugly, figure out what it can do and what it can't, and make it available as a set of mental tools for the civilizations of the future. <br><br>Enrique, that's a fascinating question, to which I don't know the answer. I've read Evola, of course, but the only things of his I've studied carefully are the essays he did on magic for the UR Group, which are erudite but not very impressive in their practical dimension. What I recall from <i>Rivolta contro il mondo moderno</i> was mostly the way he projected Otto Weininger's then-trendy pop psychology (not to mention a good deal of Bachofen) onto the sort of imaginary past that was so much in vogue at that time.

Our brains are exceedingly good at working with very big interacting data sets when in direct contact with the ‘real world’, given enough sensory input (bandwidth) and life-training (see below).

That these models can represent something like the real shape of climate history is itself astonishing, but a tribute to our ability to discern abstractions (maps?) that actually are useful mental tools for describing the world (territory).<br> <br>I have a little story that seems to me explanatory. Back in the days when India had larger forests, big predators, usually after injury, occasionally took to preying on villagers who were farming up to the forest fringes. Colonel Jim Corbett, who was born in one such area, and had skill and a good hunting rifle, made a point where he could of ridding villagers of the danger. (He became incidentally a thoughtful conservationist).He has a tale of stalking a tiger. He needed ‘global appraisal’ informed by alertness to the signs of life in the forest where many other life-forms were alert to both his and the tiger’s presence. On one occasion at a crucial moment he became aware that he was not stalking the tiger; the tiger was stalking him and figuring ambush points.<br><br>My contention is that we are ‘hard-wired’ to see meaning in the slightest thing: and to make error of course.

And she would not (and as far as I know did not) claim to have proven that nothing leaves the body in an OBE, but rather, that her alternative cognitive model of how OBE's might be generated made certain predictions about the phenomenon that turned out to be correct when tested.<br><br>I see your point about rhetoric. Theories and models are explanations, and as such, they do overlap rhetoric's domain. But I find your argument to Blackmore's presumed motive (the implication that she set out specifically to show nothing leaves the body to preserve orthodoxy, instead of setting out to seek the best explanation for all of the qualities of the observed phenomena including the apparent invisibility and intangibility of the experienced OB viewpoint and the results of previous tests by others) saddening.<br><br>Note that if the thing that leaves the body in an OBE is invisible, it means that one very significant test, attempting to see something leaving the body, has already repeatedly failed to falsify the hypothesis that nothing leaves the body. (Indeed, if that were not the case, then the whole question would be about as mysterious as whether or not anything enters the body when we eat.) As long as the hypothesis remains unfalsified, that process of investigation cannot end; there is always another kind of camera or sensor or hidden-information test to try (and always more outs if those tests also fail to falsify the hypothesis: the thing that leaves the body is immaterial, non-electromagnetic, lacks inertia, is non-relativistic, leaves incomplete memories, is mischievous and averse to being studied, doesn't view the material world but a coextensive simulacrum on a spiritual plane...).<br><br>But in the meantime, there's nothing unscientific about proposing and testing alternative models that are, either by intention or by logical implication, consistent with the so-far-unfalsified hypothesis. There is no requirement to complete poorly-defined (detect a "something" having no known physical properties or limitations) and possibly endless tasks before looking elsewhere for insight.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c2114118513915173090 title="comment permalink">11/26/13, 7:04 AM</a><br><br>

But as far as I can tell, the actual offers are genuine. The popular dismissals (e.g. that they don't actually have the money, or that they can decide arbitrarily not to award the prize even if someone succeeds in a challenge) don't hold water. For example, the challenge I'm most familiar with, the JREF Million Dollar Challenge (MDC), is entered into as a legally binding contract, with the claimant and the JREF both agreeing in advance to every detail of how the test will be conducted, how the results will be determined, and how the prize money will be paid.<br><br>(Even if it turns out that you passed the challenge by trickery, you'd still get paid. Not only that, but you'd likely then make millions more as stage magicians lined up to outbid one another for your trick. The reason for that is there's nothing in the contract that says <i>how</i> you accomplish the test, because language like "you must use real paranormal ability" would be unenforceable anyhow. Of course, the JREF will want to design the test to try to rule out trickery, so that in theory, only someone with paranormal ability could accomplish it.)<br><br>There was a time, decades ago, when instead of being on deposit in a publicly verifiable escrow account as it has been for many years now, the MDC prize money consisted of pledges to the JREF, to be collected in the event the challenge was won. I was one of those early pledgers because I saw great value in the challenge.<br><br>The value, as I saw it then, was that it allows the claimants to decide what will be tested, and how. So if there's, for instance, a skilled psychokinetic out there, she doesn't have to try to go to a researcher, and likely be told something like "there's no funding for testing PK these days, can you do remote viewing instead?" and then end up averaged in with nineteen other test subjects in the remote viewing study. It seemed a more efficient way of finding objectively verifiable paranormal talents if they were out there to be found.<br><br>Regrettably, since then, as skeptic and pro-paranormal positions have further polarized, the rhetoric around the MDC has become less about inquiry and more about "debunking" and PR. This is obvious and it depresses me. However, the challenge itself hasn't changed, and as far as I can tell it can be won by someone who can actually do, under controlled conditions, a paranormal feat they claim to be able to do.<br><br>Thank you for that critique of Blackmore. Yes, the conclusiveness of Blackmore's NDE work is greatly exaggerated by dogmatic skeptics, which I'm pretty sure doesn't please Blackmore either. Apart from that, I have my own disagreements with some of Blackmore's reasoning on NDEs. On the other hand, anyone who talks about quantum energy patterns is making it up, and any time two sides are arguing about what an adherent of some religion or spiritual system does or doesn't "take literally" they're both wrong. A complete critique of both sides of that critique would have to be the length of a book.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c1757916348816656029 title="comment permalink">11/26/13, 8:45 AM</a><br><br>

I've been exploring the role the privatization of public goods plays in the collapse of societies -- it's a very common theme -- and the privatization of particular bodies of knowledge and skill via professional capture is in its own way a good example of that. Many thanks!<br><br>Ursachi, thanks for the reminder! I'm planning on incorporating the whole of the fascist experience into my analysis, rather than (as so many people do) fixating on the atypical example of Nazi Germany, and so yes, the Romanian fascist organizations deserve close attention. <br><br>Phil, well, once again I'm relying on historical parallels. Logic is as counterintuitive as science is; it emerged in ancient Greece under a set of very distinctive, even idiosyncratic social and cultural conditions; and yet it was picked up enthusiastically by a bevy of cultures extending from Ireland to Tibet, and became part of the standard educational system, because it allows some common human mental malfunctions to be patched. I see the scientific method as having the same sort of potential. <br><br>Myriad, I think you've missed my point -- though admittedly I gave it in very compressed form! If Blackmore had been practicing science, the first thing she would have done after coming up with her hypothesis -- "nothing leaves the body in an OBE" -- is to think up as many ways as possible to falsify that hypothesis through experimental testing. The second thing would have been to start running the experiments, or at least to publish the proposed experiments so that they could be done and the data compiled. I'm with Karl Popper here: falsifiability is the essence of the scientific method, the thing that sets it aside from other ways of knowing about nature. <br><br>The abandonment of falsifiability is to my mind the principal vice of the contemporary skeptic movement. I recall an article by Carl Sagan from the 1970s, I think it was, in which he argued that OBEs were a sort of reliving of the birth experience -- rising up a tunnel into light, etc. It's an interesting hypothesis, but he didn't present it as a hypothesis; he used rhetorical means to argue that it was the most likely explanation, i.e., the one that would allow OBEs to be pigeonholed in the structure of accepted theory. If he'd wanted to offer it as a hypothesis, he would have needed to propose at least one falsifiable test of his claim -- which wouldn't be hard: find people who were born by Caesarian section who had OBEs and see if their experience differs from OBEs experienced by those born normally. <br><br>Lacking a falsifiable test, Blackmore's supposition is rhetoric, not science -- as is Sagan's, and as is most of what's being offered these days by scientific "skeptics" to explain things that don't fit existing paradigms. <br><br>I don't think, for what it's worth, that you're wrong -- or simply restating a binary -- to suggest that a world full of psychic powers is indistinguishable from a world lacking them, but full of subjective experiences that seem to mimic them. You and I do, after all, live in the same world. The question I'd raise is, given that it's not possible to choose between these worlds on the basis of the evidence, what convinces you that one is right and one is wrong? <br><br>Tiago, I wish there was an easy answer to that quandary? Still, like most of the real challenges we face as human beings, it has to be lived through, not solved in an intellectual sense.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c7166638283894321368 title="comment permalink">11/26/13, 11:52 AM</a><br><br>

At that time she still badly wanted to find evidence that would let her validate the strange experiences that she herself had had.

She was weary, and in the end she walked away from the whole field. She wrote eloquently about this in her essay, "Why I gave up parapsychology."

Although I have only read a sentence or two of the Koranic account, it becomes perplexing to interpret the Biblical account literally, and so far as I know, traditionally, the church has not done so. I am not even sure whether you mean really literally, or just somewhat literally.<br><br>If God created the entire universe in 7 24-hour days, and you begin to imagine it, well, it just doesn't make any kind of sense. Did he fly around or just stay in one place and shout? Did he spend eons figuring out in his head the entire biosphere, with its millions of lifeforms and trillions of bits of information to set up all the genetics of each species and how they would behave as well as the way that all the elements, the respiration of trees and the tides and so on would all work together, without any trial, and then just set it up so quickly? Why would an eternal being be in such a hurry?<br><br>If I were God it would give me great entertainment pleasure to watch things unfold. Why assume that for creation he would be in a hurry, and then afterwards prefer a slow pace?<br><br>In my opinion, God works from within anyway, not as an outside tinkerer.<br><br>I see nothing nonliteral about describing creation the way the Bible does. I think it does a pretty good job. You start with a chaos and organize it from the level of the stars and planets, then our sun and moon, then watery life, and so on.<br><br>It's true the Bible says God made man out of dirt or clay, like a potter. Adam means red earth, and it may even mean blood. But perhaps we read too much into it if we think we have the right to decide that God was acting like a potter. Even if an ape genome has some historical links with ours, are we not all made of earth and do we not all return to earth? Does not all our food come from the earth and our bodies are formed in the womb from the food our mothers eat?<br><br>The question of evolution that matters to me is whether this universe has a mind and consciousness as the causative factor, versus the insistence of many that life and life forms are capable or organizing themselves due to chemistry, which actually negates life and soul.<br><br>But let us say that I am right and nothing of this universe exists without a cause of a different order, and that consciousness is the fundamental reality, a consciousness which infuses everything - as you know the physical universe and all within it is very, very, VERY complex, so what is wrong with saying in the beginning God created the universe, and it was in a chaos but he organized the chaos, and brought forth light?

I remember you once characterized fascism as a form of “totalitarian centrism”, a view which has much to commend it. Historical fascist movements such the Italian Fascist Party, German National Socialism, the Spanish Falangist movement and the Argentine Peronistas combined elements from the Left as much as the Right in their party platforms. And many fascist parties actually did grow out of the revolutionary Left. Mussolini was a prominent socialist politician before the Great War, and the full name of the Nazi Party, the National Socialist German Workers Party, speaks volumes about its origins on the radical left.<br><br>Moreover, fascism historically appealed to ordinary middle and working class people who felt abandoned by the establishment and felt that their grievances were being ignored. Doubtless this has been a major factor in the rise of the far right of today as well. I recently read that some political polls are showing the Golden Dawn in Greece in first or second place right now as far as popular support goes, and that many of the recent “converts” are disillusioned leftists from Syriza or PASOK.<br><br>It’s long past time that someone performed an intellectually honest analysis of fascism and the far right, instead of simply repeating the same old tropes and partisan propaganda from the Left.

Her bias is all over the place; she seems to think and react as a skeptic rationalist materialist every time. If she did have some hope, she felt it necessary to enter the ring with both hands tied behind her back.<br><br>As to having a hard time performing psychically in a hostile environment, I guess I am in the "of course" camp! There is a puzzling way in which skeptics seem to insist that if psychic phenomena are real, then they are to behave just like other physical phenomena, when obviously it is of a different sort. I wonder how many women could have an orgasm if they were being filmed and critiqued? It seems highly likely we are dealing with another dimension and we seem to function rather poorly in it. It's hit or miss. Some people are better at it than others. There's nothing bizarre about that. Since we are dealing with a realm that has a lot to do with thought and emotion, why would unfriendly thoughts and emotions not inhibit? The fact that most people have just the occasional psychic experience certainly indicates we don't have a strong handle on the thing.<br>There's something else as well.

Greetings to my brothers in the North. If people will go back and read my comments, they will find that my quarrel is not with Islam itself. Like you, I too have immigrant friends, including a few who are Muslim. I have far more respect for a pious Muslim such as Mansoor Khan, or even the Salafis and Wahhabis then I do for a bunch of politically correct liberals and leftists. The trouble with multiculturalism is that when you have two or more cultural ecologies that are alien to one another and don’t get along for reasons of history and values living in the same space you are setting yourself up for a conflict. The tendency of the Left to ignore the inevitable problems that result and persecute those Europeans who dare to complain or object is only making the problem worse. <br><br>Eventually, the result will be war, since the two sides are so far apart and will be competing for increasingly scarce resources as the Long Descent continues. This is neither good nor evil, it’s simply human nature rooted in our biology and the laws of ecology. If it comes down to a conflict between those of my kind and a bunch of interlopers, I will stand with those of my kind against the interlopers. <br><br>Like you, I am seeing a growing number of people who are flocking to the populist right, in spite of the political persecutions and fear mongering from the establishment. Perhaps this is one reason why the Left is so filled with desperation and fear. They know the game is almost up, and whether the right wing populists or the Jihadists win, they will lose and their utopian fantasies will be shown to be nothing but pipe dreams that had no chance of working in the real world. Nikolai Berdyaev wrote about the cult of globalization nearly a century ago and described it as a latter day Tower of Babel. He argued that this Tower of Babel shall fall just like the first, and I think we can see it starting to crumble before our very eyes.<br><br>My quarrel is with the leftists and liberals who are undermining European civilization from within in the pursuit of an extremist agenda. I find it very curious that people like Ursachi accuse me of being an extremist, when it is the Left that has been pursuing a destructive, extremist agenda that is destroying the nations of the West from the inside out, while using issues like immigration, political correctness and multiculturalism as political battering rams in the pursuit of that agenda.

I really have a hard time understanding the logic of this. As for the growing popularity of the far right, you should ask yourself why this is the case. Could it be the failed policies of the left and the liberal establishment, which are reducing so many Europeans to a state of desperation and causing them to be fearful of the future? And why is it that the only answer of the liberals and the leftists to the failure of their policies is more of the same? Perhaps we should try some new policies that don’t continue the mistakes of the present and recent past. Or maybe we should go back to those policies and principles that worked for centuries prior to the rise of the Left. <br><br>One of my professors pointed out that one of the tragedies of the late Weimar era in Germany was that because the country had gone so far down hill and because the political system was so dysfunctional by the late 1920’s, the only real choice that the Germans had by then was either the Nazis or the Communists, both of which were equally bad. I think in the not-so-distant future, the peoples of Europe will face a similar choice between the far right and the Jihadists, and I think that many on the Left will end up siding with the neo-Fascists because it will be the lesser of two evils. We are already seeing this in countries like Greece, where the Golden Dawn is now polling in first or second place according to some news agencies, and many of the recent “converts” are disillusioned leftists who defected from Syriza or PASOK.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c1590770436792903708 title="comment permalink">11/26/13, 7:21 PM</a><br><br>

Contemporary science normally falls flat on its backside when it tries to deal with consciousness, and I suspect that's the issue here. <br><br>Enrique, thanks for the vote of confidence! Fascism's a complex phenomenon, and understanding it isn't helped by the insistence on the part of the left that it's purely a phenomenon of the right. It's precisely in societies that are radically polarized between extremist stances on both ends, leaving the center to demagogues, that fascism is most likely to flourish -- thus the pervasive tendency of fascist regimes to borrow the most popular ideas from left and right alike (thus the conflation of nationalism and socialism in the name of a certain very famous party...) <br><br>Sunseeker, I'll take a look at it. Thanks for the suggestion.<br><br>Myriad, fair enough. As I see it, though, there's a significant difference between the two beliefs -- not a difference of fact, but one of emphasis and (if you will) educational theory. In many martial arts, for example, the idea of an intangible life energy (ki, qi, prana, or what have you) is a central instructional concept; students are taught to pay close attention to the life force, and to practice exercises that increase individual sensitivity to it. It may well be that those exercises actually increase sensitivity to subtle cues that have nothing to do with an intangible life force, but the exercises have a definite effect. <br><br>In t'ai chi, for example, learning to listen to your partner's qi is crucial to being able to use the art in combat; you may well be sensing nonverbal cues, or what have you, but the skills you develop by doing the practices enable a skilled practitioner to anticipate, forestall, and generally mess with an opponent in some impressive ways. An expert practitioner can put you on the floor without ever touching you -- not by energy beams, but by triggering startle reflexes and other neurological reactions at exactly the wrong moments. It's impressive to watch and, if you've ever had it done to you (as I have), rather spooky to experience. <br><br>By and large, the martial arts that are effective ways of learning these skills have the life force concept at or near the core of their philosophies. By and large, those martial arts that don't focus on the life force concept aren't very good at teaching this sort of thing. Thus the concept of qi has a definite value whether or not a life force can ever be measured on a meter; attending to the world using the concept of qi as a frame makes it much easier to sort out the things you need to grasp in order to develop the combat skills I've described. That same principle applies to many other "superstitious" concepts: whatever the ontological status of the thing they describe, they focus human attention in ways that have definite pedagogical results, and from one perspective, this is the only justification they need.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c7117114862072810144 title="comment permalink">11/26/13, 11:07 PM</a><br><br>

I've even used the same example, qi in martial arts, as an analogy when explaining on skeptic forums why I practice a religion and defend a middle ground accepting the value of various spiritual and mystical world views.<br><br>The spooky experience of being dropped without touch sounds much like the also spooky experience of being "spirit slain" by a faith healer. I've never experienced either myself, but there are accounts of skeptics participating in revival meetings on a lark and being quite surprised. (Unfortunately, that doesn't mean all those diabetics at the revival get healed.)<br><br>However, I've also seen claims (and videos) of qi masters knocking over dozens of opponents in a few seconds from across the room. <i>That</i> appears to work only if the targets are in a very accepting frame of mind.<br><br>At that point, I admit, the skeptical side of my world view takes over; such performances strike me as a cartoonish parody of the valuable methods you were talking about. Much as if an astronomer suggested exploring the stars by landing a rover on the surface of the celestial sphere. Or, if I may, much like you seem to react to Harry Potter-ish depictions of magic.<br><br>You can call that mistaking the map for the territory; overloading the model; seeing every problem as a nail; literalism; dogmatism; or fundamentalism. I see those all as forms of the same thing, and it's a problem for all world views and a cause of much of the conflict between them. It can be a judge thinking he can use astrology as a lie detector, Christians going to war against what (or whom) God hates, rationalist statesmen who think they can design utopias, or cosmologists habitually positing that the universe is a giant version of whatever system they're most trained in. (A mathematical object, for classical physicists and Pythagoreans; a random event, for quantum physicists; the active mind of God, for many theologians; a computer simulation, for an increasing number of scientists...) The consequences range from amusing to tragic.<br><br>Ah, well. If the imminent future entails a housecleaning of all such abstractions, their shortcomings will become (for a time) moot.

Still, doing good science is always challenging. <br><br>Myriad, the guys who claim to be able to knock people down with qi across a room are dismissed as goofballs in the internal-arts circles where I had my training. (I tried to find a link to a very funny article, titled "Water Boxing," about a martial artist who attended one of those seminars, went to the back of the room, got a glass of water, announced to the sifu that he was going to walk up to the front of the room and throw the water in the sifu's face unless the sifu knocked him down with qi en route. The sifu ended up very wet.) One of the advantages of the internal martial arts that's not shared with many other forms of "spooky" training is that if you claim some remarkable ability, sooner or later you're going to have to demonstrate it against a live and unsympathetic opponent, right out there in front of everybody, and there's rarely any question about who ended up landing hard on his backside and who didn't.<br><br><a href=toward-green-future-part-three.html#c5715895667556036666 title="comment permalink">11/27/13, 1:29 PM</a><br><br>

They've drastically down-sized their energy usage and "gone voluntarily into poverty." <br><br>That was sort of what I was trying to get at in my comments.
