Over the nearly seven years I’ve spent blogging on
<i>The Archdruid Report</i>, the themes of my weekly posts have veered back and forth between pragmatic ways to deal with the crisis of our time and the landscape of ideas that give those steps their meaning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s been unavoidable, since what I’ve been trying to communicate here is as much a way of looking at the world as it is a set of practices that unfold from that viewpoint, and a set of habits of observation that focus attention on details most people these days tend to ignore. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a lot more that could be said about the practical side of a world already feeling the pressures of peak oil, and no doubt I’ll contribute to that conversation again as we go. For now, though, I want to move in a different direction, to talk about what’s probably the most explosive dimension of the crisis of our time. That’s the religious dimension—or, if you prefer a different way of speaking, the way that our crisis relates to the fundamental visions of meaning and value that structure everything we do, and don’t do, in the face of a troubled time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are any number of ways we could start talking about the religious dimensions of peak oil and the end of the industrial age. The mainstream religions of our time offer one set of starting points; my own Druid faith, which is pretty much as far from the mainstream as you can get, offers another set; then, of course, there’s the religion that nobody talks about and most people believe in, the religion of progress, which has its own dogmatic way of addressing such issues. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, I trust that none of my readers will be too greatly surprised if I choose a starting point a little less obvious than any of these. To be specific, the starting point I have in mind is a street scene in the Italian city of Turin, on an otherwise ordinary January day in 1889. Over on one side of the Piazza Carlo Alberto, at the moment I have in mind, a teamster was beating one of his horses savagely with a stick, and his curses and the horse’s terrified cries could be heard over the traffic noise. Finally, the horse collapsed; as it hit the pavement, a middle-aged man with a handlebar mustache came sprinting across the plaza, dropped to his knees beside the horse, and flung his arms around its neck, weeping hysterically.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His name was Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, and he had just gone hopelessly insane. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At that time, Nietzsche was almost completely unknown in the worlds of European philosophy and culture. His career had a brilliant beginning—he was hired straight out of college in 1868 to teach classical philology at the University of Basel, and published his first significant work,
<i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>, four years later—but strayed thereafter into territory few academics in his time dared to touch; when he gave up his position in 1879 due to health problems, the university was glad to see him go. His major philosophical works saw print in small editions, mostly paid for by Nietzsche himself, and were roundly ignored by everybody.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There were excellent reasons for this, as what Nietzsche was saying in these books was the last thing that anybody in Europe at that time wanted to hear. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Given Nietzsche’s fate, there’s a fierce irony in the fact that the most famous description he wrote of his central message is put in the mouth of a madman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here’s the passage in question, from <i>The Joyous Science</i> (1882): </div>
<br>
<blockquote class=tr_bq>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Haven’t you heard of the madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran into the marketplace, and shouted over and over, ‘I’m looking for God! I’m looking for God!’ There were plenty of people standing there who didn’t believe in God, so he caused a great deal of laughter. ‘Did you lose him, then?’ asked one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>‘Did he wander off like a child?’ said another. ‘Or is he hiding?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Is he scared of us? Has he gone on a voyage, or emigrated?’ They shouted and laughed in this manner. The madman leapt into their midst and pierced him with his look. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
‘Where is God?’ he shouted. ‘I’ll tell you. We’ve killed him, you and I! We are all his murderers. But how could we have done this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How could we gulp down the oceans? Who gave us a sponge to wipe away the whole horizon? What did we do when we unchained the earth from the sun? Where is it going now? Where are we going now? Away from all suns? Aren’t we falling forever, backwards, sideways, forwards, in all directions at once? Do up and down even exist any more? Aren’t we wandering in an infinite void? Don’t we feel the breath of empty space? Hasn’t it become colder?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Isn’t night coming on more and more all the time? Shouldn’t we light lanterns in the morning? Aren’t we already hearing the sounds of the gravediggers who are coming to bury God?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Don’t we smell the stink of a rotting God—for gods rot too?</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
‘God is dead, God remains dead, and we have killed him. How can we, the worst of all murderers, comfort ourselves? The holiest and mightiest thing that the world has yet possessed has bled to death beneath our knives!’</div>
</blockquote>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>

<div class=MsoNormal>
Beyond the wild<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>imagery—which was not original to Nietzsche, by the way; several earlier German writers had used the same metaphor before he got to it—lay a precise and trenchant insight. In Nietzsche’s time, the Christian religion was central to European culture in a way that’s almost unthinkable from today’s perspective. By this I don’t simply mean that a much greater percentage of Europeans attended church then than now, though this was true; nor that Christian narratives, metaphors, and jargon pervaded popular culture to such an extent that you can hardly make sense of the literature of the time if you don’t know your way around the Bible and the standard tropes of Christian theology, though this was also true. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The centrality of Christian thought to European culture went much deeper than that. The core concepts that undergirded every dimension of European thought and behavior came straight out of Christianity. This was true straight across the political spectrum of the time—conservatives drew on the Christian religion to legitimize existing institutions and social hierarchies, while their liberal opponents relied just as extensively on Christian sources for the ideas and imagery that framed their challenges to those same institutions and hierarchies. All through the lively cultural debates of the time, values and ethical concepts that could only be justified on the basis of Christian theology were treated as self-evident, and those few thinkers who strayed outside that comfortable consensus quickly found themselves, as Nietzsche did, talking to an empty room. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s indicative of the tenor of the times that even those thinkers who tried to reject Christianity usually copied it right down to the fine details.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus the atheist philosopher Auguste Comte (1798-1857), a well known figure in his day though almost entirely forgotten now, ended up launching a “Religion of Humanity” with a holy trinity of Humanity, the Earth, and Destiny, a calendar of secular saints’ days, and scores of other borrowings from the faith he thought he was abandoning. He was one of dozens of figures who attempted to create ersatz pseudo-Christianities of one kind or another, keeping most of the moral and behavioral trappings of the faith they thought they were rejecting. Meanwhile their less radical neighbors went about their lives in the serene conviction that the assumptions their culture had inherited from its Christian roots were eternally valid. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The only difficulty this posed that a large and rapidly growing fraction of 19th-century Europeans no longer believed the core tenets of the faith that structured their lives and their thinking. It never occurred to most of them to question the value of Christian ethics, the social role of Christian institutions, or the sense of purpose and value they and their society had long derived from Christianity; straight across the spectrum of polite society, everyone agreed that good people ought to go to church, that missionaries should be sent forth to eradicate competing religions in foreign lands, and that the world would be a much better place if everybody would simply follow the teachings of Jesus, in whatever form those might most recently have been reworked for public consumption.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was simply that a great many of them could no longer find any reason to believe in such minor details as the existence of God. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even those who did insist loudly on this latter point, and on their own adherence to Christianity, commonly redefined both in ways that stripped them of their remaining relevance to the 19th-century world. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), the philosopher whose writings formed the high water mark of western philosophy and also launched it on its descent into decadence, is among many other things the poster child for this effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In his 1793 book <i>Religion Within The Limits of Bare Reason</i>, Kant argued that the essence of religion—in fact, the only part of it that had real value—was leading a virtuous life, and everything else was superstition and delusion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The triumph of Kant’s redefinition of religion was all but total in Protestant denominations, up until the rise of fundamentalism at the beginning of the 20th century, and left lasting traces on the leftward end of Catholicism as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To this day, if you pick an American church at random on a Sunday morning and go inside to listen to the sermon, your chances of hearing an exhortation to live a virtuous life, without reference to any other dimension of religion, are rather better than one in two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fact remains that Kant’s reinterpretation has almost nothing in common with historic Christianity. To borrow a phrase from a later era of crisis, Kant apparently felt that he had to destroy Christianity in order to save it, but the destruction was considerably more effective than the salvation turned out to be. Intellects considerably less acute than Kant’s had no difficulty at all in taking his arguments and using them to suggest that living a virtuous life was not the essence of religion but a suitably modern replacement for it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even so, public professions of Christian faith remained a social necessity right up into the 20th century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There were straightforward reasons for this; even so convinced an atheist as Voltaire, when guests at one of his dinner parties spoke too freely about the nonexistence of God, is said to have sent the servants away and then urged his friends not to speak so freely in front of them, asking, “Do you want your throats cut tonight?” Still, historians of ideas have followed the spread of atheism through the European intelligentsia from the end of the 16th century, when it was the concern of small and secretive circles, to the middle of the 18th, when it had become widespread; spreading through the middle classes during of the 18th century and then, in the 19th—continental Europe’s century of industrialization—into the industrial working classes, who by and large abandoned their traditional faiths when they left the countryside to take factory jobs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
By the time Nietzsche wrote God’s epitaph, in other words, the core claims of Christianity were taken seriously only by a minority of educated Europeans, and even among the masses, atheism and secular religions such as Marxism were spreading rapidly at the expense of the older faith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Despite this, however, habits of thought and behavior that could only be justified by the basic presuppositions of Christianity stayed welded in place throughout European sociery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was as though, to coin a metaphor that Nietzsche might have enjoyed, one of the great royal courts of the time busied itself with all the details of the king’s banquets and clothes and bedchamber, and servants and courtiers hovered about the throne waiting to obey the king’s least command, even though everyone in the palace knew that the throne was empty and the last king had died decades before. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To Nietzsche, all this was incomprehensible. The son and grandson of Lutheran pastors, raised in an atmosphere of more than typical middle-class European piety, he inherited a keen sense of the internal logic of the Christian faith—the way that every aspect of Christian theology and morality unfolds step by step from core principles clearly defined in the historic creeds of the early church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It’s not an accident that the oldest and most broadly accepted of these, the Apostle’s Creed, begins with the words <br>
“I believe in God the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.” Abandon that belief, and none of the rest of it makes any sense at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This was what Nietzsche’s madman, and Nietzsche himself, were trying to bring to the attention of their contemporaries. Unlike too many of today’s atheists, Nietzsche had a profound understanding of juast what it was that he was rejecting when he proclaimed the death of God and the absurdity of faith. To abandon belief in a divinely ordained order to the cosmos, he argued, meant surrendering any claim to objectively valid moral standards, and thus stripping words like “right” and “wrong” of any meaning other than personal preference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It meant giving up the basis on which governments and institutions founded their claims to legitimacy, and thus leaving them no means to maintain social order or gain the obedience of the masses other than the raw threat of violence—a threat that would have to be made good ever more often, as time went on, to maintain its effectiveness. Ultimately, it meant abandoning any claim of meaning, purpose, or value to humanity or the world, other than those that individual human beings might choose to impose on the inkblot patterns of a chaotic universe. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suspect that many, if not most, of my readers will object to these conclusions. There are, of course, many grounds on which such objections could be raised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It can be pointed out, and truly, that there have been plenty of atheists whose behavior, on ethical grounds, compares favorably to that of the average Christian, and some who can stand comparison with Christian saints. On a less superficial plane, it can be pointed out with equal truth that it’s only in a distinctive minority of ethical systems—that of historic Christianity among them—that ethics start from the words “thou shalt” and proceed from there to the language of moral exhortation and denunciation that still structures Western moral discourse today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Political systems, it might be argued, can work out new bases for their claims to legitimacy, using such concepts as the consent of the governed, while claims of meaning, purpose and value can be refounded on a variety of bases that have nothing to do with an objective cosmic order imposed on it by its putative creator. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All this is true, and the history of ideas in the western world over the last few centuries can in fact be neatly summed up as the struggle to build alternative foundations for social, ethical, and intellectual existence in the void left behind by Europe’s gradual but unremitting abandonment of Christian faith. Yet this simply makes Nietzsche’s point for him, for all these alternative foundations had to be built, slowly, with a great deal of trial and error and no small number of disastrous missteps, and even today the work is by no means anything like as solid as some of its more enthusiastic proponents seem to think. It has taken centuries of hard work by some of our species’ best minds to get even this far in the project, and it’s by no means certain even now that their efforts have achieved any lasting success. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A strong case can therefore be made that Nietzsche got the right answer, but was asking the wrong question. He grasped that the collapse of Christian faith in European society meant the end of the entire structure of meanings and values that had God as its first postulate, but thought that the only possible aftermath of that collapse was a collective plunge into the heart of chaos, where humanity would be forced to come to terms with the nonexistence of objective values, and would finally take responsibility for their own role in projecting values on a fundamentally meaningless cosmos; the question that consumed him was how this could be done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>A great many other people in his time saw the same possibility, but rejected it on the grounds that such a cosmos was unfit for human habitation. Their question, the question that has shaped the intellectual and cultural life of the western world for several centuries now, is how to find some other first postulate for meaning and value in the absence of faith in the Christian God. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They found one, too—one could as well say that one was pressed upon them by the sheer force of events. The surrogate God that western civilization embraced, tentatively in the 19th century and with increasing conviction and passion in the 20th, was progress. In our time, certainly, the omnipotence and infinite benevolence of progress have become the core doctrines of a civil religion as broadly and unthinkingly embraced, and as central to contemporary notions of meaning and value, as Christianity was before the Age of Reason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That in itself defines one of the central themes of the predicament of our time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Progress makes a poor substitute for a deity, not least because its supposed omnipotence and benevolence are becoming increasingly hard to take on faith just now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’s every reason to think that in the years immediately before us, that difficulty is going to become impossible to ignore—and the same shattering crisis of meaning and value that the religion of progress was meant to solve will be back, adding its burden to the other pressures of our time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style="font-size: small">
<span style="font-family: Times">Listen closely, and you can hear the sound of the gravediggers who are coming to bury progress. Next week, we’ll talk about what that implies. </span></span></div>

The world will disappoint any attempt to locate the Almighty in it. <br><br>Some fanciful thoughts, from my bailiwick: Christopher Marlowe's plays engage primarily with this problem. His images of transcendence are Empedoclean and perhaps a bit barbaric: dissolution of the false self in the cauldron (Jew of Malta), crucifixion on the elements in Edward II, and the sublime rapture of Love and Strife in Doctor Faustus. These are perhaps preliminary initiatory steps for the individual.<br><br>Shakespeare addresses the more fundamental crime. The ninety-five stab wounds dealt to God, "our knives" in Nietzsche, are what Macbeth inflicts on Duncan, and Nietzsche's mad consciousness of the crime (and the blood that blood will have) is what troubles that play. <br><br>Shakespeare's seeds of transcendence: dotty storm-wrecked flower-decked Lear, naked at Cordelia's foot; Anthony in Cleopatra's embrace upon the Nile. I think we've already seen both these images begin to penetrate the material world. What comes next is in Pericles, Cymbeline, Winter's Tale; but I can't yet see how the tree will grow.

And control means power, that <i>bête noire</i> of our species.<br><br>The conduct of religious institutions over hundreds and thousands of years generally falls far short of the standards they promulgate to the masses. For that reason, even though they don't appear to see it (wood-for-the-trees argument), they are authors of their own destruction over time. Just one example: the Roman Catholic Church's approach to poverty, purporting to bless and minister to the poor while at the same time taking money <i>from</i> poor church attendees every Mass, making this institution wealthy beyond calculation.<br><br>The concept of Progress being the religion of today follows the pattern. Worship the technology, worship the owners and wielders of technology, but for [entity's] sake, don't question the control exercised over you. Just pay your heavy taxes and stay quiet about the corruption of the ideal by the controllers at the top.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c2294838119483731752 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 1:49 AM</a><br><br>

However I notice you didn't really attempt to define the central theme of your column, "meaning and value".<br>Like "quality" was in the Pirsig book, I think "meaning and value" are another one of those concepts that everybody knows but nobody can put into words that aren't self-referential. Perhaps a definition of "meaning" will figure into your series as a means of getting a handle on the role of religion in modern times.<br>For decades I have suspected that the definition of "human Intelligence" itself revolves around the ability to feel meaning and value. Humans assign meaning and value to absolutely everything we come across -- even if that meaning is zero or negative/undesirable -- and the assignation is generally pretty unique to each human. I theorize that this is a result of our millions of years of biological evolution. As you discussed when speaking of Duality, our animal ancestors had to assign rudimentary meaning and value (good or bad) to everything around them, long before they started using anything we'd recognize as Intelligence, in order to consume food and run from predators. Machines as we know them today, in this musing of mine, are utterly incapable of feeling meaning and value. <br>Some people like Kurtzweil say that Intelligence is just a matter of sophisticated pattern recognition, but I don't think you can obtain humanlike pattern recognition without an authentic ability to assign meaning and importance to pieces of incomplete or corrupt pattern data.<br>Therefore if my musing is correct, it will never be possible to build a true AI, although we could build exquisite imitations. However, regardless of complexity, a machine cannot feel "meaning", "value", or "importance" -- it can only follow a dead programming code to assign those values, code which was written at its core by an intelligent human. Give the machines a few thousand or million years of evolutionary complexity and maybe they'll become intelligent, but no machine we can conceive of right now would be capable of feeling meaning.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c7166479673705309762 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 1:55 AM</a><br><br>

After years of innocence, after going around and actually seeing and working with and within populations who never had wholly grasped concepts of "enlightnement" and "progress" I understood how hypocritical and hollow these mentioned belief systems are. High priestesses of Progress indoctrinate into you what is good (female emancipation, affirmative action, more personal liberty, equality and all that stuff) and what is bad (like patriarchal family model, some 12 000 years old winner in Darwinian race of survival). What they do not tell you is WHY they good and bad. There is no value base behind all those tricky academic wordplays other than assumption this kind of progressive model should lead to greater material prosperity for all, if given enough time.

We made a Faustian bargain with fiction, turning story telling into faith, in order to take the next step beyond clan life into villages, cities and empires. Like Dawkins’ memes, these are atomic thought sacraments that are so ingrained in our psyche that we are not even aware of them. Dawkins considers religious memes as evil and scientific memes as good, but in a world where chance has supplanted cause; there is no good or evil, only success or failure.

I, for one, agree completely with the historical sketch you have provided in it. It is, in essence, a postmodernist overview of the history of worldview shifts in Western civilization over the past few centuries; and I for one believe the postmodernists have the real nature of the historical trajectory exactly right. <br><br>It is not without reason that Nietzsche is considered the originator of Postmodernism in practically all the important senses of the term in contemporary academic philosophy. And it is also quite ironic that, in my experience at least, those very academic philosophers who identify as postmodern tend to be as averse to the death of their own faith in progress as any of the parties you identified in last week’s post. <br><br>The truth is that the death of the Religion of Progress is built into the core of the postmodern perspective every bit as much as the death of the Judeo-Christian God is built into the perspective of Modernity - as 19th century denizens of Western civilization were all too slow in discovering. But 21st century postmodern academics are proving equally slow in discovering the radical incompatibility of their professed postmodernism with their own personal faith in progress.<br><br>The reality of Peak Oil, above all else, ought to be powerfully convincing them of the full logical implications of their professed postmodernism. But in point of fact, they are as little willing to abandon their “heretical” adherence to Modernity (and Progress), in general, as the average person - as I have discovered to my lasting disappointment over the years.<br><br>I was wondering what your sources are for today’s post, for the historical trajectory you describe is one I have great interest in exploring further. The reasons for this interest are hinted at by my blog handle, “Nestorian.” Nestorianism represents the oldest form of Christianity in existence, being unaltered in its core profession of faith since the Council of Constantinople of 381. It is also, in my considered view, the historically and doctrinally purest form of extant Christianity.<br><br>The Council of Ephesus of 431 instigated the breaking away from Nestorianism of all the forms of Christianity of the Roman Empire - both Eastern and Western, and inclusive of historically important Christian churches such as the Egyptian Copts, who were fully Romanized at the time. (The Nestorian Church, being centered in the Parthian empire, was never culturally embedded in Roman civilization – an important feature of its history, at least in my view.)<br><br>Coming back to the reason for my interest in your sources, one might say that I subscribe to an altered version of the metaphor you yourself coined in this week’s post. 18th and 19th century Europeans were wrong to begin with in thinking that the details of the King’s banquets, servants, and courtiers that comprise so much of the fabric of Western civilization were ever about the King in question to begin with. That King (and I believe He is real) has rejected a great deal of this fuss all along as incompatible with the true nature of His Kingdom – as “Pharisaical,” to borrow a biblical allusion that even many 21st century readers are no doubt still familiar with. <br><br>It is with that in mind that I am interested in following up in what you have summarized in greater detail.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c79167740545208264 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 6:27 AM</a><br><br>

As a child I was anti-pathetic to the church authority structure when I came across it. A daily religious service was obligatory in schools (c.f. USA), but used an abbreviated form; ‘The Lord’s Prayer’, but not the Nicaea Creed. For a while my primary school switched the service to the actual church building next door (the established church under the Monarch, with representation in the UK Parliament Upper House) and to a service conducted by a ‘deaconess’ (a nice well-meaning woman I came to appreciate later). Our 1944 Education Act had allowed parents to opt their children out of the religious service on grounds of separate faith. Such was my personal antipathy that my parents had to invoke the opt-out and I found myself in the ‘minorities’ classroom with my friend ‘Kipper’ Haddock, who, although I had not noticed it before, was already an ‘opt-out’ Roman Catholic. My younger brother did not have the same problems and rather liked his new experience.<br><br>I did not properly meet the Nicaea Creed until I was 17 and was rather shocked when I did. I took strict ‘truth telling’ rather seriously, as one can do at that age, and found the exegeses provided by the nice priest when I attended the local church, to be a bit like crossing my fingers while repeating a prayer, and the whole business became stymied. <br><br>Last year I read a book recommended as “beautiful” by our recent Archbishop, Rowan Williams (head of the world-wide Anglican Communion): <i>Christian Beginnings: from Nazareth to Nicaea, AD 30-325”</i>. Geza Vermes sums up more than 40 years of his scholarship (he published <i>Jesus the Jew</i> in 1973). Vermes was a Catholic priest but left the church and reasserted his Jewish identity and became the first Professor of Jewish studies at Oxford University. He has provided me with the thought-provoking text book I need, and a study in ‘truth-telling’. <br><br>My enquiry into the conjectural pre-lapsarian past continues, and, ‘needs must’, I have to include my own occasional experiences and insights of the kind that perhaps might have given rise to some Platonic descriptions.<br><br>I tried the religion of ‘Progress’ as a young man, but it fell under the same bus to ‘Truth Telling’ as my foray into the dear old Church of England.<br><br>Thanks again <br>Phil H<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c3477952825932381679 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 6:55 AM</a><br><br>

One of the things that struck me, was the fact that the long established story of "culture" (entomology: to grow) and the idea that the arts played some role in the development (progress) and elevation of human spirit and society - was pretty much gone without a trace from the public consciousness. (Except among certain arts insiders and others who were wondering why average people didn't see any reason to have their tax dollars go toward arts.) I think your diagnosis and your historical analogy is spot on. I'd certainly maintain that people no longer "believe" in progress in any meaningful way (iPhone iterations don't count) yet the entire structure of our collective social world takes it for granted. Like N.'s madman's declaration, your incantation that "there is no brighter future" is just too radically obvious to be borne.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c3240903236590988537 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 7:19 AM</a><br><br>

This is, if literally true (I am not sure of it), at any rate misleading. Many educated Victorian Europeans were Catholic either in the Roman Church or in the Eastern Church. Protestantism had a geographically circumscribed sway in Victorian Europe.<br><br>For the educated Roman Catholic, then as now, the following is the case: (a) You are under an obligation to attend Mass on all Sundays. (b) In Mass, you are under an obligation to recite, without inner reservations, whichever of the two Creeds the celebrant is using on that day. You are required to mean your recital without special hermeneutics, attaching to it the same meaning as previous generations have. It is not, for instant, licit to say that you mean your language metaphorically when you say "rose again on the third day". (c) You are required to take Communion at least once a year. <br><br>Communion itself you are required to understand in the sense of previous generations. As was explained to me by my guiding priest when I was, after some months' instruction, late in 1983 received into the Roman branch of the Catholic Church, this in particular means that, mindful of the doctrines of Transubstantiation and Real Presence, you are willing to point to the consecrated wafer and say, "That is not bread", and to the contents of the consecrated chalice and say "That is not wine." <br><br>I cannot comment on the state of Mass attendance in the USA. Here in Richmond Hill, and also at the Toronto cathedral, the various morning Sunday Masses I see manage, without exception, to fill around 70% or 90% of the pews. It is common to see no empty pews at all. <br><br>There is some temptation to postulate a "left wing" in Roman Catholicism which understands the Creed metaphorically. I have not, however, met persons who openly profess being from such a "left wing". Perhaps, for all I know, there are masochistic people who take the trouble to go to Mass, and yet are with this heavy Sunday-morning inconvenience nevertheless secretly imposing metaphorical interpretations. But then with what motive for masochism? How can we ever even know how many such people there are? <br> <br>"Left wing" is a term from secular journalism, not from Roman Catholic theological debate.<br><br>There will be some temptation for journalists outside Catholicism to represent the Church as containing lots of left-wingers who understand the Creed metaphorically. If we have journalistic spin on Peak Oil, perhaps we also have journalistic spin on the admittedly very troubled Church. <br><br>What one does meet, in the troubled Church, are Roman Catholics who have problems with governance - who object to the encyclical Humanae Vitae, or who object to the Church's instructions on same-sex sexuality -I myself protest, or at any rate query, as far as I think licit in my essay "Total Catholic Woof", at www dot metascientia dot com - or who object (in my mind rightly; I join the vociferous ranks of the Catholic scandalized) to the Roman Church's failure to protect the economically, sexually, or politically weak. <br><br>One does also have problems with a disastrous turning away from the Mass obligation in Europe, and with a decline in seminary vocations perhaps everywhere, and with a decline in vocations at many (not at all) monasteries. <br><br>In general, we must be careful not to take Protestant adjustments in theology as representative of Christianity at large. This is a little difficult in the USA, since in the USA Catholicism, be it Roman or Eastern, echoes less loudly than the Protestant theologies. <br><br><br>Sincerely, <br>hoping everyone is able to <br>get over this piece of<br>unavoidable preaching, <br>and to smile again, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>(in Richmond Hill, near Toronto)<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c3979811917321912737 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 7:36 AM</a><br><br>

Like a cancer, it is with us still. <br><br>Regarding Nietzsche and the death of God: "Nietzsche borrowed Schopenhauer’s concept of Will and gave it a direction, the Will to Power. He also dropped the ideas and regarded the world of appearances, all superficial, i.e., not as appearances of anything transcendental. The Will to Power, as a particular manifestation of Shakti, is feminine, and the denial of transcendence eliminates the masculine element totally from his system." (C. Salvo, from "Gornahoor" website). <br><br>Wouldn't Nietzsche's narrative over privilege the alchemical female? As psychologist, Nietzsche is virtuoso, with all the limitations and weaknesses that implies: that is, a tendency to skate over abysses, hide mountains, etc., and in general, privilege his own point of view, which is definitively biased. <br><br>For example, Nietzsche seems to never have understood the concept of suffering and abnegation as will-to-power itself, but rather conceived of strength and weakness as binary opposites in the same exoteric manner which he mocks in the Christianity of his day. <br><br>He also seems entranced by his own rhetoric. But the most important point is that he rejects all classical ethics and metaphysics, not just Christianity. But this makes sense if all there is is manifestation, the centrifugal female. <br><br><br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c6479614313946091538 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

Popular music today is an off-shoot of the machines that keep us alive. A merciless beat defining the age. In the age just ahead of us, I like to think that music will take on new meaning. Looking deeply into the past is to look deeply into the future. Singing from the soul will be the very thing for the beaten and weary after the hard facts of pollution, climate disasters and currency conflagrations have re-defined our ways of living. I don't look forward to it but I will keep an ear out for the 'new' music that comes from the soul, that looks for the divine and rejoices in the search. In the meantime, I've found myself pushing the other way, embracing silence. Silence is not for the modern mind. Silence is the voice of the creator and I think this is why the human mind has long abandoned it. The creator, or God if you will, had no place in the machine world. That may not be the case for the world that lies ahead.

I suppose it can be argued that the Muslim world is undergoing a similar crisis of faith several hundred years after Europe's. Do you agree? I would hazard to say that the faith in progress explains why Muslim, Hindu, etc., immigrants to the United States integrate so well - they're typically firm believers in progress, and as long as they keep that faith, they fit right in. I also think that there's a faint strain of Southern US culture that rejects the notion of progress - a remnant of the experience of losing the Civil War.<br><br>Due to a recent need to find a new job, I'm moving from Florida to Alberta - just like yeast to sugar, I'm moving towards the energy supply (despite working in a field [environmental engineering] unrelated to oil or energy).

Certainly wanting in inspiration.<br><br>The God of Progress has another aspect than just techno goodies. There is the hope that humanity can slowly progress in wisdom and justice. It is in fact disheartening to think that we can't, and a certain feeling of hopelessness bothers certain sensitive souls such as myself, when contemplating that we might be doomed to a couple steps forward, a step or two back, until the next time a meteor strikes the earth, wiping out enough life that all our sweet memory dies and we're back to square one, thinking that perhaps the human race is 6,000 years old.<br><br>We'd like to live in a universe in which there is some sort of rational hope, a hope of nonfutility. Perhaps the reason we expect this is that on a personal level it is true. (Which is what I think it going on with reincarnation.) So, if people are distressed at the demise of the God of Progress, it isn't really the electric can opener convenience lifestyle that is the deepest problem, but rather a loss of hope that the human race is not an exercise in futility.<br><br>Perhaps the easy technology has given us a false sense of progress in the realm of justice.

We have killed it, you and I. Like Icarus we have flown too close to the sun, and the wax is melting from our wings..."</i><br><br>The philosopher John Gray in his book "Straw Dogs" gives an epitaph to the idea of progess, as does Ronald Wright in "A Short History of Progess," and Christopher Lasch in "The True and Only Heaven." The idea seems to be gaining currency as we survey our mess. There's a good article in Aeon Magazine about how cutting-edge philosophers are now turning their ideas away from ethical concepts toward contemplating human extinction.<br><br>I've often heard the claim that we're living in the post-Enlightenment era, and there is a oft-repeated trope that the Enlightenment died in gas chambers of Auschwitz. How does that square with this idea - isn't the idea of progess an outgrowth of Enlightenment thinking? And is Malthus finally winning the argument against his father (and Condorcet) two hundred years later now that the fossil fuels are running out?<br><br>Is the rise of religious fundamentalism due to the failure of this progess idea for increasing numbers of people? I'll note that fundementalism is most on the rise where progess seems to have passed people by, such as the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, or where progress is rapidly receeding such as the more remote parts of the former Soviet Union and the United States heartland.<br><br>I'd also note that economics has become the secular religion of our age, complete with its own ideas of mathematical certaintly and obscure terminology, with economists as the high priests of progess. I and many others have compared economists to medieval scholastics arguing over finer points of a theology that has long ago been discredited, and excluding any alternative ideas with the same fervor with which the Catholic Church once surpressed the ideas of an old earth and a heliocentric solar system.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c5958624374349575317 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 8:35 AM</a><br><br>

I don't know that anyone's tried, but I'm sure someone could come up with a nice family tree, complete with dead ends, schisms, and all. The big obstacle is that next to nobody consciously acknowledges Progress as an overt religion. <br><br>It's also difficult to understand Progress-as-god in the context of Western monotheism: I don't think Progress has swapped out God; for most people its power is accepted as inevitable, among a pantheon of other gods (self-pleasure and wealth-accumulation are other old standbys). In that sense what we see with modern Christianity is more like the ancient Hebrews lapsing into worship of the local gods of their neighbors. Many modern Christians would do well to study these accounts detailed in the Old Testament.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c3636889114656868433 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 8:46 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you!<br><br>Long ago, in graduate school, I noted that quantum theory could only have come into existence in a post-Nietschean world where God was long-dead. Indeed, that was the meaning at the heart of Einstein's famous quote, "God does not play dice with the universe."<br><br>It isn't the mathematics of it. Quantum theory has classical underpinnings. The Schroedinger Equation, for example, is just the usual equation for harmonic motion, a "wave equation," but with the time variable being treated as an imaginary number. The classicists had done this sort of thing long ago with electromagnetism, in their formulation (still taught) of the "advanced" and "retarded" potential fields, and I believe it's implicit in Maxwell's original quaternion-based formulation of his famous "Maxwell's equations," quaternions being related to complex numbers, which are in turn related to "imaginary" numbers. <br><br>What changed in the early 1900's was the philosophy <i>behind</i> the mathematics. This revolved around the "hidden variable" conjecture. Classical theory posited that quantum processes had internal deterministic structure that was, in principle, knowable: these were "hidden variables" that governed the interactions of subatomic particles. The problem was the Heisenberg Principle, which said generally that you could never observe any of these hidden variables because all of the "stuff" you might use to observe it (like light) was so big and clumsy that by observing any hidden variables, you altered them. By analogy, it would be like trying to practice observational naturalism when every glance from your eyes would vaporize anything you looked at. How could you purport to be describing a bunny rabbit when, by observing it, it ceased to exist? Or became a deer, or a sequoia?<br><br>It was a crisis for physics. The solution eventually adopted was to draw a curtain across the whole subject. Philosophically, since hidden variables could not be observed, <i>then they did not exist in any meaningful way.</i> <br><br>Can you hear the echo, here, of the death of God? Since God cannot be observed, <i>God does not exist in any meaningful way.</i> Since hidden variables cannot be observed, <i>they do not exist in any meaningful way.</i><br><br>As a result, all of the hidden variables were lumped together as unknowable and unmeasurable, and quantum events became non-deterministic, describable only in aggregate as statistical probabilities based upon underlying processes which were treated as completely random. The deterministic "wave function" -- the original Schoedinger wave equation -- became the "probability bracket" of Heisenberg. Quantum theory has never looked back.<br><br>Einstein resisted this philosophical idea. Hence his quote.<br><br>There are many reasons that it is difficult to unite gravity with quantum theory, but one of those is this deep philosophical divide between classical physics, which is something rooted in the European Christian tradition, and quantum physics, which is part of this stumbling new philosophical base you've aptly labeled the Religion of Progress. The idea of simply excising unwanted parts of reality, like gods or hidden variables, is a big part of the idea of Progress.<br><br>It cuts across a wide range of disciplines, too. Look at the radical change in the classical musical tradition around 1900, for instance. It isn't so much a transformation as a total break with tradition, where the "classical wisdom" of Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms was simply fed into the fire, to be replaced by "modernism" which -- I might note -- almost immediately stagnated. Musicians still use the word "contemporary" or "modern" to describe musical styles nearly a century old.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c3149073495326314017 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

I see similarity between your and his work, but where you are concerned with the myth of progress, he dealt with the rise of TV culture and its effects on our ideas of meaning and self. This is another the two largest popular religions of our time. For an introduction to his thought on TV, I recommend his essay E unibus pluram, http://www.thefreelibrary.com/E+unibus+pluram%3A+television+and+U.S.+fiction.-a013952319.<br><br>Here's a rather long quote from his This is Water that is relevant to today's post:<br><br>"Because here's something else that's weird but true: in the day-to day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship -- be it JC or Allah, bet it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles -- is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It's been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness.<br>Worship power, you will end up feeling weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to numb you to your own fear. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful, it's that they're unconscious. They are default settings.<br>They're the kind of worship you just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what you see and how you measure value without ever being fully aware that that's what you're doing.<br>And the so-called real world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the so-called real world of men and money and power hums merrily along in a pool of fear and anger and frustration and craving and worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom all to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the center of all creation."<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c6768752793836134844 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

I was thinking of popular representations of scientists in their religious temples (labs), dressed in religious garb (lab coats) manipulating religious implements (lab equipment)in religious rituals (experiments). The results of those religious rituals, translated from arcane religious symbols (mathematics) by other religious figures (engineers) become objects of religious devotion (cell phones, computers, and all the other material goods of progress). Maybe that's why I became a scientist, as a way to participate in a religious enterprise blessed by society, a way to make life worthwhile for myself and others. I was captivated by Marie Curie's story, enough to become a chemist like her. However, I was at best barely competent at it, so I left the profession when that became obvious enough to me that I could no longer ignore it. <br><br>It was almost 20 years ago that I started to give up on goods, to live a simpler life of LESS. It may not surprise you to hear that one aspect of that has been a religious exploration on my part. I think both of the religious practices I'm engaging with have been a way to anchor my life in a broader pattern, to live with the grief of decline and still enjoy life as deeply as possible.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c8636751522917408395 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 9:41 AM</a><br><br>

I thoroughly admire your courage, you Druids are truly made of oak! <br><br>The Joyful Science precedes Nietzsche’s self-proclaimed and impenetrable masterpiece Thus Spoke Zarathustra where the theme of the death of the Christian God is expanded to the limits of our human moral horizons. In so doing, Nietzsche claims to reveal the catastrophe of modernity: that empirical science has undermined the foundations of human thought, moral or otherwise, through the revelation that the universe is meaningless. This catastrophe he names nihilism and hopes it is only a “transitional pathological condition” of the antithesis of the rational and irrational. Nihilism becomes the titanic antagonist of his thought and in its terrible grip can be found reason enough for the collapse of his living mind. The loss of the Christian God is a welcome holiday in comparison to this abyss. So I look forward to a consideration of this critical aspect of Nietzsche’s thought in future posts. It is the philosophical analog to something on the magnitude of a Venus syndrome ecocide.<br><br>On a hopeful note, Nietzsche cannot claim first right of discovery of this condition, nor is the self-destructive and futile war he wages with nihilism the only possible response. In both Eastern and Western philosophy there are examples of thinkers who saw what Nietzsche saw but were able to keep their mental sphincters tight. But they cannot be understood as religious.<br><br>If your treatment of religion is anything like your treatment of magic I am absolutely looking forward to the ride.

I was wondering whether this week's post would get no response at all, or a big one. Now that that's settled...<br><br>Leo, no argument there. One of the questions that's been central to this blog since the beginning is how to salvage the best achievements of the last three centuries as the material basis for our civilization drops out from under us. <br><br>Joel, the situation is considerably more complex than that, in that 18th century Christianity was already dying of self-inflicted wounds; going back to that would simply reopen them, and land us back again in Nietzsche's predicament. More on the alternatives as we proceed!<br><br>Richard L., if you've got a Lutheran upbringing you're probably better prepared to appreciate Nietzsche's work than most of us! <br><br>News, of course secular humanism is a religion. It's one of the denominations of the religion of progress -- one of the evangelical fundamentalist denominations, to be precise. <br><br>Richard C., nice! Given that Marlowe himself was a member of one of those early and secretive atheist circles I mentioned, and grappled with some of the same challenges that drove Nietzsche to the brink (and over it), there's much to be said for such an analysis. <br><br>Flute, nah, Progress is the Father, Science is the Son, and Growth is the Holy Ghost dispensing far-from-spiritual blessings to the faithful. We'll get to that in a bit. <br><br>Anywhere, your comments are an example of what Blake called "single vision" -- the flattening out of a complex reality into a one-dimensional analysis. All religions, and indeed all human institutions of every kind, end up playing a part in the maintenance of social order, but that's only one part of the whole, and treating it as the whole leads to a distorted and unhelpful understanding. <br><br>Thomas, yes, it's a tangent, but a worthwhile one. Have you read Roger Penrose's <i>The Emperor's New Mind</i>? He does a good job of pointing out the fallacies in current AI research, and especially its blindness to the essential role of meaning and value in intelligence. <br><br>Andrew, thanks for the links!<br><br>Ondra, thanks for the data. That makes perfect sense -- and I'm sorry to say that the situation is likely to get far worse as we proceed. <br><br>Beetleswamp, I can always be contacted privately by sending an email to info (at) aoda (dot) org -- the volunteers who staff that are used to forwarding things to me.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c3713557312318242734 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 2:14 PM</a><br><br>

Good choice of metaphor, btw.<br><br>Ando, thanks for the quote!<br><br>James, good.

More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Jon, why would you expect us to learn? If some unverifiable presupposition is necessary to found a workable society, and having a workable society is better than not having one, the question is simply one of finding a new basis for blind belief that as many people as possible can embrace. Mind you, I don't think the situation can be summed up so easily -- but we'll get to that as we proceed. <br><br>JacGolf, stay tuned. We'll get to that. <br><br>Yourmindfire, fascinating! I hadn't heard of that. <br><br>Twilight, thank you. Fasten your seat belt; it's going to be a bit of a wild ride. <br><br>Wiseman, exactly! I've sometimes tried to talk about that by drawing a distinction between science and scientism -- between, that is, the scientific method, which is one of the great creations of the human mind, and the currently accepted set of opinions and beliefs that are upheld by the institutions our culture assigns to practice the scientific method, which have gradually slipped back into mythology and blind faith.

I don't know that I'd accept the label "postmodernist" for my own stance without blinking -- the great failing of the postmodernist movement, as its chosen name suggests, is its failure to pass from criticism to creation, and be <i>for</i> something rather than simply after and against various things. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Angela, my sympathies. I'm not looking forward to reading it, once the local library gets a copy. <br><br>Phil, fascinating. If I understand correctly, active involvement in the Church of England has plunged in recent decades; your story, to my mind, helps explain why. <br><br>Raven, perhaps you can explain to me what relevance that remark has to the subject of this post. I'm genuinely curious. <br><br>Ryan, glad to hear it. <br><br>Andy, that's a crucial point, and shows the narrowing of the definition of progress that's been such a powerful force in recent cultural history. I'll be addressing the point as we proceed. <br><br>Unknown, exactly. That was Nietzsche's question: given a cosmos without meaning or value, and a human psyche that requires both, how do we respond? <br><br>Villager, true enough, so long as you're only talking about people in those societies that believe in progress. More, much more, on this as we proceed. <br><br>Toomas, er, I think you're greatly overstating the degree to which socially mandatory religious practice in 19th century Europe could be equated with actual faith. For that matter, though I don't have any exposure to Canadian Catholicism, I've encountered a remarkable number of American Catholics whose actual beliefs are indistinguishable from those of their vaguely Protestant neighbors, but who go to mass on Sundays (or Saturday afternoons, which is when the Catholic church up the hill from my house has its services) instead of heading across the street to the Baptists because St. Mary's is where they've always gone. We'll be discussing this more later on. <br><br>Esther, hmm! It would take a good deal more space than I can really spare just now to respond to you in detail. Of course you're correct that Nietzsche has all the usual failings of a virtuoso, but the specific criticism you aim at him -- failing to recognize that suffering and abnegation are forms of the will to power -- won't stand; you might want to reread his discussion of asceticism in <i>The Genealogy of Morals</i>, where he covers that point at some length. More broadly, borrowing a symbolic structure from an outside source (such as the Shiva-Shakti polarity) and applying it to a thinker who's working within a very different symbolism is not always a route to clear understanding; that's the risk a Traditionalist approach always runs, especially in grappling with so radically untraditional a thinker as Nietzsche.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c6763939860009095990 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 3:03 PM</a><br><br>

I'll be arguing that the religion of progress is an intolerant monotheism, but I'll be interested to see your arguments to the contrary. <br><br>Derek, thank you.

Please don't do that in the future; all posts here are moderated, so they'll get put up when I have the chance to review them and post them. <br><br>Ronald, and of course that's a crucial question. Buddhism and African Diaspora religions such as Vodun and Santeria are both rapidly gaining converts in the US, and may well become dominant forces in the religious landscape down the road. We'll be talking about that as we proceed. <br><br>Mister Roboto, a fascinating point. <br><br>Michelle, thank you. It may be a bit more than a week before we get all this wrapped up, by the way...<br><br>D^2, quite the contrary, I expect to see the Christian fundamentalist movement implode over the next few years, for reasons I'll discuss later on. <br><br>Jess, thanks for the soundtrack!<br><br>Jeff, it wouldn't surprise me at all to see it remain a major presence in Africa, say. Still, I'd encourage you to think back two thousand years or so, to all the people who were perfectly sure that the worship of Zeus would endure despite it all.<br><br>Steven, good. Now you know why so many people cling so frantically to the insistence that "they'll think of something..." <br><br>Brian, that's one of the reasons I won't use Chrome.<br><br>Brother K., the rapid urbanization of the Muslim world is creating explosive religious strains -- as well as less metaphysical ones!

It's exactly the conflation of moral with technological progress that gave the myth its power, just as it's the collapse of that faith that's turning the worship of progress into an increasingly demonic cult. I'll be discussing this in detail further on. <br><br>Ian, well, I'm going to have to bring in Nietzsche's sexuality here before long, so wanted to avoid the obvious pun. Still, glad you're enjoying the discussion!<br><br>Escape, good. Very good. We'll be discussing the rise and fall of the soi-disant Enlightenment in some detail as we go. <br><br>Blue Sun, as I see it, it's the conflation between several different senses of progress that helped drive the emergence of the religion of progress, just as it's the unraveling of that conflation that plays a major role in that religion's increasing troubles. As for the monotheism of progress, that's going to take a post of its own, or much of one. <br><br>Rick, exactly! You get today's gold star. <br><br>Raymond, the Church of the Sub-Genius used to insist that one of the signs that their peculiar version of the End Times was imminent would be a Plague of False Jesii -- "Jesii," you understand, being their distinctly Texan plural of "Jesus." There are any number of ersatz Christs lurching about the cultural landscape these days, so I'm by no means sure the Sub-Geniuses were clueless.<br><br>Joseph, I've heard it claimed that mathematical analysis of the decay of radioactive materials suggests that in that case, at least, there are no hidden variables -- that the moment when a given atom pups a beta particle, let's say, can be shown to be a function of pure uncaused chance. I'd be interested to hear your take on this. As for music, oddly enough, we'll be discussing that in some detail, as it bears directly on the core themes of this series of posts. <br><br>Ned, no, I wasn't, and thank you for the reference! This feeds in nicely to a theme I have in mind for an upcoming post, the theme of idolatry and its discontents. <br><br>SMJ, atheism in its modern form is basically inseparable from the cult of progress -- it's the equivalent, among believers in progress, of the commandment "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." As for the religions of the rest of the world, I'll be discussing them to some extent, but my usual caveat applies: I can't claim to speak for anybody but me, out of anything but my own necessarily parochial experience. <br><br>SLClaire, it doesn't surprise me at all. I hear from a fair number of people these days who are being drawn to religious exploration of one kind or another. <br><br>Jon, thank you!

In your early posts, years ago, you spent quite a bit of time on historians who claimed to find a direction to history. Christianity also holds that history has a direction. Replacing the story of a Christian God leading mankind towards the kingdom of heaven with the story of infinite material progress is not such a big leap. <br>Both belief systems lead to destruction of the earth because the "here and now" is never good enough. I think the corruption of the catholic clergy and wealth that flowed into Europe from new world discoveries allowed Europeans to slide comfortably between belief systems. <br>I have recently been persuaded that climate change is coming a lot faster than I had imagined it would. There are no new continents to exploit and the pie is shrinking.

The problem is that one can only reach that well-informed state of understanding of his own species after ingesting a lot of not very user-friendly scientific information and concepts.

Basically, you want to see them spread out in a uniform smear that remains uniform as you add more and more numbers. If they tend to "clump" -- particularly if the spectrum forms a "comb" structure, which is (as the name suggests) a regular series of spikes like the tines of a hair comb -- then your numbers are demonstrably non-random. You can see this clearly in computer-generated pseudo-random numbers, which are typically based on linear algorithms which lead to non-random chains of numbers.<br><br>In certain non-linear systems, the situation changes. The so-called "sensitive dependence on initial conditions" of some non-linear systems can result in situations where you need arbitrarily high precision to predict the outcome: even though the equations themselves are fully deterministic, trying to predict the outcome is a practical impossibility. A simple example is water coming out of spray gun. Say you have microbe in the water. You can predict its path pretty easily until it enters the suction tube. It gets nasty at that point, but with enough computing power, you can follow it up the tube. Then you hit the nozzle, and all bets are off. If you were off by even a nanometer in your estimate of where that microbe was when it hit the high-pressure vortex right at the nozzle, it could come out of the nozzle in a completely different direction than you predict.<br><br>Yet all the equations are completely deterministic. So is the particle direction random, or not? It isn't physics: it's a philosophical question.<br><br>I watched a fellow giving a talk on this subject back in the early 1980's get verbally eviscerated by one of the grand old men of statistical mechanics. The old man didn't actually refute him: he asked things like whether the speaker even had a degree in physics, and from which disreputable institution he had purchased it. Not the usual Tuesday afternoon sleep-fest. It was unpleasant to watch. It seemed clear to me that it was a theological dispute, and a High Heresy had been spoken.<br><br>This was thirty years ago. I don't know where the question stands today, but I would guess in pretty much the same place.<br><br>What nature is being claimed for the hidden variables? If the claimed behaviors are classically linear, then the randomness of radioactive decay <i>probably</i> disconfirms that claim. But if the claimed behaviors are non-linear, I'm not sure that the apparent randomness means anything at all.<br><br>I don't personally have an opinion whether there are any hidden variables in subatomic physics. My point was that the <i>idea</i> of drawing a curtain behind which lie the Dragons of Eris was an idea would have been anathema to Enlightenment physicists. It would have been an idea more acceptable, I think, to the Medieval mind, but there it would not have been "randomness," but "mystery" claimed -- an inscrutable teleological determinism, the Mind of God.<br><br>Did that answer your question?<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c5655536918543696795 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 6:00 PM</a><br><br>

Good enough--I can't say a return to 18th-century Christianity sounded particularly lovely to me.<br><br>Interesting to see you mention you expect the Christian fundamentalist movement to implode soon. I wonder if this will relate to your discussion of it as a form of deviance in Not the Future We Ordered? (Which was a fascinating claim, I might add. And I might further add that the entire book was fantastic, and I heartily recommend it to everyone here--it covers a lot of helpful ground you haven't covered here on the blog.) Anyway, if Christian fundamentalism is a form of deviance set against the religion of progress, then the failure of progress, it would seem to me, could strip Christian fundamentalism of its energy as it no longer has something to deviate against. And if it's been founded merely as against something, then it has no basis for existence once that something it's against ceases to be a dominant paradigm within society.<br><br>Or maybe you're going somewhere else! Idle and fun speculation for a Thursday evening.<br><br>Fascinating to read the comments. I'm not only thankful to you for this blog, JMG, but to the many ridiculously smart commenters who add so much to the discussion.

The great good news of Buddhism is that the Buddha <i>doesn't</i> come back to this world. Of course people will believe in something, but will they keep clinging to the myth of progress? My guess is no. <br><br>Yupped, excellent! Yes, faith in progress is a collective form of what psychologists call "provisional living" -- the sort of thinking that puts off having a life until after something else happens -- and is subject to the usual drawbacks of that habit. <br><br>Raven, okay, that makes a little more sense. Still, you're jumping to conclusions so hard I'm surprised you don't leave boot marks on them when you land. <br><br>Georgi, to my mind your first two claims are stunningly simplistic, and your last one is completely unproven. You're entitled to your opinions, of course. <br><br>Approliving, what you've said here is a fine example of how the myth of progress redefines all other cultures and all other eras to fill roles in its own mythic drama. <br><br>Helix, that would be a pretty fair one-two punch!<br><br>Joseph, not quite, but it's very useful as perspective. I'll see if I can scare up the specific reference.<br><br>Doctor W., good! I suspect the relationship seemed happy at first, but Mammon has become a brutally abusive spouse over time. <br><br>Derek, not a problem -- I also remember mimeographs, and for that matter hektographs. <br><br>Joel, nah, it's a simpler thing. Popular religious movements in the US, when they hit the big time, normally stay there for 30 to 40 years and then implode. American Christianity in particular has about a 70-year pendulum cycle between liberal and conservative forms -- from the Civil War to 1900, for example, liberal churches and the social gospel were in the ascendant; from 1900 to the Depression, the first version of fundamentalism was big; from the Depression to the 1970s, the liberal churches were the influential ones again, and then fundamentalism was resurgent. I expect to see the fundamentalist churches dragged down by scandals and a general disgust at the way they've allowed themselves to be used as a stalking horse for politics, and 30-40 years in which liberal churches return to their relative predominance, before they collapse in their turn. <br><br>The same cycle also affects other religious movements; there's every reason, for example, to think that the Neopagan scene and the New Age movement are both facing steep declines in the near future, while other religious movements are preparing to occupy leading roles in alternative culture.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c1183438862112333118 title="comment permalink">3/28/13, 7:59 PM</a><br><br>

And it was very good, and the people grew fat and populous.

And it was very good, and the city-dwellers grew fat and more populous and very pleased with themselves.

And it was very good, for the excess population could be sent off to cause trouble and die far away, and if they returned, they would bring with them much spoil and plunder. And so the armed cities became kingdoms and empires and thrived and grew fat and still more populous and wealthy and feared by all. But by the evening of the Fourth Day, the the wars proved exhausting to the land and the people, and the Ghost of Malthus rose to chide Man, and there was wailing and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>On the morning of the Fifth Day, Man invented Technology, and Science, and Progress. And it was very, very good, for this drove away the Ghost of Malthus and created an abundance of food, and much complexity, and the Oscar Awards.

The Ghost of Malthus sat quietly by, watching: there was no longer any need to chide, nor much point. Some saw the signs and wailed and gnashed their teeth.

In Nietschze's time belief in god was fading but the culture, norms, and institutions were all still thoroughly rooted. Progress was also well on the way as Christianity declined. Indeed, progress was already moving in on god's turf before before he died.<br><br> Today, however, the death of progress is going to bring down culture, norms, and institutions together (roughly in step with our declining fossil fuels) and there is no budding replacement to take up the mantel.<br><br> There was a relatively smooth transition last time, but unless I miss my guess, this time we are going to left mythless. Peak oil is going to pull the rug out from under our high standard of living and our cultural narrative at the same time. I'm sure that there are historical parallels, like the Maya, where the gods failed them at the same time the crops did.<br><br> I don't know much about the ancient Mayans but Orlov tells me that a lot of middle aged men suicided, drank themselves to death, or just gave up when the Soviet Union imploded. Other folks had a rough go of it, but middle aged men had built their identities around their careers in the soviet system. When the meaning went out of those careers they floundered badly. I think the US will have a worse go of it because our identities are also entwined with the consumer products that we won't have and the loss of breadwinner status (in a communist system middle aged men weren't bringing home the bacon).

Then how do you account for the world that you find yourself in? And by the way, I'm up on Russel's "first cause" argument. I understand his reasoning, but it rings hollow with me. And I'm also pretty certain that my own wiring is insufficient to understand what accounts for all this. I call it "God", but it's beyond my comprehension.<br><br>Regaring many of the comments I've seen about science in these posts -- in my view, many of these comments reflect a popular but misguided view. No true scientist believes that science is or ever can be all-inclusive. Science deals in phenomena that can be observed by any normal person with appopriate equipment and training, and in developing theories -- general principles -- which can explain disparate observations as particular cases.<br><br>The domain of science is limited in a number of ways:<br><br>1) There are limits to our ability to observe. Heisenberg's uncertaintly principle is a famous example. But note that this doesn't mean that we sweep everything behind this veil under the carpet as suggested by some posters. It just means that we can't see behind the veil directly, and so the kind of observations that are crucial to science are not available to us. At some point a new theory could come along that lifts the veil, but at the moment, it looks impenetrable.<br><br>2. Logic fails us beyond a certain point. Oddly enough, this fact was proven -- logically! -- by Kurt Godel in 1931. Needless to say, his findings stunned and humbled the math/science community. Given that science proceeds by drawing logical inferences from observed phenomena, it must also be impacted by these limitations of logical deduction. We might not know where the limitations lie, but we know they're there.<br><br>3) The more complex the system, the more difficult it is to observe it and reason about it. Systems such as a planet orbiting about a star are simple enough to reason about, at least as far as gross motions are concerned. We can calculate the orbits. Add another star or two and the situation rapidly gets out of hand. This too has been mathematically proven. Once we get to the level of, say, atmospheric dynamics, we have to restrict ourselves to closely proscribed aspects of the system in order to say much of anything definite. For the system as a whole, we're basicly into modelling -- an open-ended endeavor. And social dynamics... even making relevant observations proves challenging. There are certainly things that are true of such systems, but they don't readily lend themselves to the scientific method.<br><br>4) We are never confident that a given scientific theory is the last word on the subject. The theories underpinning classical physics are a prime example.

I can see the Church going back to its monastic roots pretty easily; monasteries were self-sufficient communities and centers of learning and preservation of culture. Monastic communities still exist in the US. I know of a working Benedictine monastery in Missouri (http://www.conceptionabbey.org/ora-et-labora) and I think the future of the Catholic Church, if not the rest of Christianity, lies in places like these. It could be that Pope Francis is taking the first steps in this direction.<br><br>Atheism I think will share the same fate as secular humanism and Scientism and the worship of High Technology. In a society where the energetic basis for high tech and high-powered science does not exist any more, while the need to adapt to and explain our future circumstances will be of very great concern, I think people will be more interested in supernatural explanations - and willing to believe in a transcendant Force or Deity - rather than set their trust in what will be viewed as the basis for the troubles which humanity is forced to adapt to and suffer from. Perhaps some groups will exhibit Luddite tendencies, and become Iconoclasts with regards to the religion of Technological Progress.

I often chuckle to myself when I see the side of a church plastered with something along the lines of "Thou shalt repent blah, blah, blah" and then it gives a bible reference. It isn't that great a leap to the legal system - "Thou shalt repent" and a legal precedent (or legislative) reference...<br><br>Sometimes, I also think that the push towards the cult of individualism and personality is an off shoot of the whole religion of progress?<br><br>Dunno, but it makes me wonder.<br><br>I went out last night (by train) to see the film "Promised Land" which is about fracking and small town USA.

Memes (or the lie we live by) are ways we account for things we already have done but for other reasons. In other words, they are the explanation for the inexplicable. We do things, and then we make up stories to explain them. Or to paraphrase: Christianity doesn’t oppress, torture and kill people. People oppress, torture and kill people and then invoke a self-righteous, indignant god for justification. (Please note that this is not unique to Christianity. Christianity just happens to be the tool of our day and culture. When gone, another will take its place.)<br><br>A subtle distinction, maybe, but I still assert that group behavior is instinctual. The memes, religions and complex philosophies are just paperwork.<br><br>By the way, if someone wants to site the many good things done in the name of Christ, the same logic applies.

What they do not tell you is WHY they good and bad. There is no value base behind all those tricky academic wordplays other than assumption this kind of progressive model should lead to greater material prosperity for all, if given enough time.<br><br>In the United States, the organized movement for women's emancipation and equality of the sexes goes back to the early Nineteenth Century, where it arose among women agitating for an end to slavery.<br><br> Nineteenth century feminists wrote very clearly about why equality of women and men is a good idea. They had to be clear because advancing their cause depended on persuading men to change the laws. Working state by state between the 1840s and 1920, women won the rights to address public audiences, get an education, control their property, get custody of their children after divorce, serve on juries, and finally to vote.<br><br>The United States was founded on the idea that all people are created equal and have a God-given right to decide for themselves where their happiness lies. We think that applies to our daughters as well as our sons.<br><br>As for your belief that patriarchal marriages are the most enduring, Jewish marriages are known for stability and I believe that is because they are based on a model of partnership rather than domination. This is a generalization of course. It's normal for Jewish women to choose their own husbands, earn money, manage the family finances, get an education, and their husbands had better not be drunkards or raise a hand to them. <br><br>My mother's line emigrated from the Ukraine around 1905 and so far has had four generations of stable egalitarian marriages in America.

Essentially he is saying that the myths and foundations of modern industrial society are a corruption of Christianity, and he gives a very detailed and interesting analysis of the subtleties of that corruption, far beyond the simple phrase "progress is the new god". He writes from the viewpoint of a theologian and scholar, which makes that book quite different from his "pamphlets" of the 70s (which you probably have read, as it seems they made quite an impact back then).<br><br>Also, I'm looking forward to further posts. :)<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c5598020828893496811 title="comment permalink">3/29/13, 9:08 AM</a><br><br>

There is a choice for society, whether to promote the good of all, or whether to allow the greed of some to have no boundaries. It is a matter of vision, too. I have a vision, not in which it is impossible to be wealthy, but in which people in general hold to a desire to see humanity and specifically their own community do as well as possible, as a whole. This could involve someone with extra money building a public park rather than owning a yacht. It would involve most types of businesses being nonprofit and cooperatively owned rather than enriching one or a few families. <br>I've been thinking about this most of my life. I used to wonder when I was a kid, why is it that if a house can last so many years, does not everyone own a nice house free and clear? Maybe I'm wrong, but I think if we could build toward things that last just a little longer than the current lifetime of use and keep adding, that we could have beautiful communities everywhere.<br><br>It seems to me that if there is even a slight possible edge in energy and production possible, that we must learn not to squander it as we have done but to build on it. I am not talking about the recent squandering of fossil fuels, but rather the deeper structures of society that preceded it.<br><br>And there are the problems with religion, which ought to help us achieve the above but usually gets hijacked. Some think atheism can do better. (I do not.) <br>People believe what their emotional preferences tell them to believe, and they erect the logical edifices to support it afterwards. I think Georgi's post is a fair example of that (not to pick on him particularly, but he has a nice outline there). But an equally good example is Christianity, whose many groups use the same texts and come up with rather different moral interpretations and emphases.<br>The problem with religion is that people seem to want something from it, but it is something which can't be easily given, and thus cheap substitutes, tedious theologies and silly salvation plans are promoted to soothe our existential fears, being, as we are, lost in the dark without a compass, without a north star, not knowing who we are, what we are, or where we are.<br><br>No wonder people worshiped the sun.<br><br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c7323492587026082769 title="comment permalink">3/29/13, 9:23 AM</a><br><br>

That is "faith" and "hope." I was a long-time believer, in the sense of faith, in progress. From civil-rights era liberalism in the 60s to dabbling in Marxism, to a more vague, broad belief that I was part of a movement to bring about environmental sanity and a more egalitarian, inclusive modes of living, I believed that that progress was manifested in history and quite inevitable.<br><br>Peak oil and the more global environmental issues emerging in the 90s did much to erode that faith.<br><br>But I still harbor certain aspects of belief, in the form of a limited faith that my actions can make a difference in a small scope, and a hope, or belief that making a difference in some small way would be a good thing.<br><br>I have faith that if I continue adding organic matter to my gardens, and fallow and cover crop other areas, that it will lead to an improved condition in my land. Sounds like progress to me.<br><br>I have a somewhat lower faith, but much hope, that if I can do a good job of demonstrating and teaching what I know about land care and productivity, others will do somewhat like I do. That might not sound like much, but it does represent a certain form of progress, from the scale of my farmstead, out toward the bigger community.<br><br>I have not much faith, but do it anyway out of hope, that by working in my local community and helping to build institutions of resiliency such as our Farmers Market, things can also be a little bit better in the future. Well, at least a bit better than they will be otherwise, and actually, maybe qualitatively better than the psychotic, destructive system we live in now.<br><br>I also notice that some here have taken the idea of the decline of the religion of progress to grasp for a resurgence of "old ways." Remember, the "old ways" were just the previous religion, either explicit or not, that failed in the face of progress, and probably for a reason. And the era of the religion of progress will no doubt be viewed as an "old way" some day. I wonder if, rather than cursing us as profligate wasters, some people in the future will look back at the ancients that dared to challenge the gods with some degree of admiration, in much the way that we can look back at a Caesar and overlook the little stuff like murders and slavery and admire the empire they built and the civilizing of sundry tribes.<br><br>(Sure I'll catch it for that. I am NOT saying empires and subjugating others is a good thing.)<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c8441567830936645245 title="comment permalink">3/29/13, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

It drives a stake through the heart of locality, which was something else that (I believe) Einstein didn't want to give up. But as a counter-example, Feinman's QCD (Quantum Chromo Dynamics) -- more popularly known as "quark theory" -- is a <i>kind</i> of hidden-variable theory and certainly still stands. However, it retains quantum theory's reliance upon randomness (rather than determinism) underlying the quark behavior. It isn't clear to me how non-locality of random behavior is any less bizarre than non-locality of deterministic non-linear behavior.<br><br>All that aside, my point here is historical: 1920. 1920. 1920. The cusp between the Old World of physics, and the New World of physics. My <i>point</i> was and is that (IMO) quantum theory would never have gained traction in the scientific community at all before God was good and murdered. The medievals would have imputed the unknowability of quantum processes to divine mystery, and the classicists would have imputed its unknowability to mental laziness. None of them would have accepted "randomness" as in any way sensible.<br><br>I'm also going to go WAY out on a limb and say that IF I were to have an opinion on the matter, I'd be inclined to say that quantum mechanics is a philosophical and scientific dead end. A fundamental mistake, not computationally, but as a mental construct for trying to understand the universe.<br><br>I certainly feel that is true of what happened to music around the same time. And art. And philosophy. It was all a monstrous Mistake, and we can loosely call that whole extended Mistake the "death of God," though that language no longer resonates in our post-Mistake world.<br><br>Western Civilization turned a blind corner and ran into a wall. The Myth of Progress tells us that there are no blind turnings, and no walls, and keeps us pounding our head against the bricks, trying to break through.<br><br>As a result, we still have "contemporary" classical music in styles that are indistinguishable from something written a century ago. We have High Art that has made no aesthetic sense for a century. Philosophy dissolved into semantics. Politics dissolved into Realpolitik and propaganda. And physics -- well, it had stalled out by 1980, when I entered graduate school, as I discovered. One of probably two dozen excellent reasons I got out of the field. Read Lee Smolin's book, The Trouble with Physics. He blames it all on string theory, others blame it on government money, but I think the problem goes back to quantum theory itself, which ties back into this Grand Mistake, the murder of God.<br><br>Smolin lived the bullet I dodged. I think we could have a delightful discussion over beers.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c3407399566238000358 title="comment permalink">3/29/13, 9:55 AM</a><br><br>

The Religion of Regress? The basic idea of the RoP, that humans can use reason to make positive, incremental changes to society, rather than be bound by taboos and traditions, is surely one of the most radical and successful ideas ever tried. We're part of an experiment, to see if such an ideology can be sustained, and where it will take us. The beauty of the RoP is that it is very flexible; the RoP of 1850 or 1950 had somewhat different beliefs than it does today, or than it will in 2050. I'm sure by then some of the ideas being talked about here will be incorporated into the RoP. The core idea is rational pragmatism, not dogmatism.

Am glad you're touching on it, am sure it'll give me plenty to look up, as always.<br><br>Just last weekend I tried --yet again for the umpteenth time-- to get some fairly conservative Christians in the circles I frequent to question, just a bit, some of their hardwired ideas. <br><br>This time, their concept on what constitute blessings curses and mandates as imparted by the Bible, and whether most are simply curses mistaken for blessings.<br>(Mind you, we've been gathering for quite a long time so am no longer automatically labeled a tool-of-he-who-must-not-be-named, rather a simple lost soul needing lots and lots of prayer, likely kept simple by he-who-must-not-be-named. Plus my other ramblings on the hubris of High Finance, Tech-as-Savior and a slightly better understanding of the implications of entropy in finite systems --thanks to you and others-- has given me some cred of impartiality.)<br><br>I started by having them reflect on and accepting how all organisms no matter their genus, given enough space and food, will multiply until there's no food andor until the space inhabited is so crowded and polluted it becomes their demise, unless another empty space and source of food is found. Various examples were provided, which had them thinking up their own, until they were satisfied.<br><br>Once they agreed such was the case, I got them on to considering that perhaps such was the case with humans too --given we are also His creation and encoded with same mandate to multiply, and also to dominate the rest of creation.<br>(The hardest part on this one was getting them to see humanity as just another cog in the whole of creation, not above it as most are hardwired to think of themselves)<br><br>Eventually they saw how most all reflexively revert to "is-our-duty; is-our-mandate; God-told-us-to"-type of mindsets when made to consider the logical conclusions that it is to our collective disadvantage and eventual demise to seek continual growth and continual monetizing of the commons. That perhaps most past civilizations came undone --not because of some curse or breach of trust with God but-- because they simply outgrew their ecological/resource niche.<br><br>It was very hard to get to that part, but we did. At which point the conversation automatically veered to something else, though just as it veered away I saw a glimmer of the realization of the feckless mythos our whole cultural paradigm is built on forming in their minds.<br><br>Unfortunately, all of this has to be approached from the viewpoint of a Creator and His-Eternal-Antagonist which I really refused for very long but I concluded it is the best way to get them to consider and analyze the in-built shortcomings of our mythos. And maybe, just maybe, use some critical thinking in the process? Though am really apprehensive of being the cause that'd sever their comfort zone, I don't want to be the cause of such dissonance. People can get hurt having to deal with such cognitive warping.<br><br>The parts I'll attempt to get them to consider next are:<br>(1) That a new paradigm based on mandates of symbiosis, equality, and respect by humanity for the rest of nature has to be created in order to break our species' Boom-Bust cycle that previous cultures went through and thus stop the pain, violence and loss of civility and knowledge that's happened with each successive collapse.<br>(2) That perhaps the pagan cultures that preceded Judeo-Christianity might have functioned on much more equitable terms with the rest of nature --which most other secular thought is aware of but believers seem to have no concept of, nor of the concept that victors are the ones who write history.<br><br>So am glad you're dabbling into this as am sure it'll be an education.

Being firmly rooted in the sub-genius category, I am going to check out that Church.<br><br>@Georgi - If our host permits and considers the debate relevant to a wider audience, I'd be glad to discuss with you (provided you're good sports).<br><br>Your original comment caught my attention, since it is not the first time I heard those arguments. In particular, the first two of them seem a lot like instantiations or corollaries of the Litany of Gendlin:<br><br>"What is true is already so.<br>Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.<br>Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.<br>And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.<br>Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.<br>People can stand what is true,<br>for they are already enduring it."<br><br>Now, the fact that this idea has already a name should clue you to the fact that its meaningfulness comes from the shared values of the subculture that produced it. I prefer to believe that Mr.Greer dismissed those as "simplistic" due to being an outsider to that culture, and thus missing the point, instead of censorship.<br><br>Also I find it pretty enlightening that this idea was called a "Litany" of all things. If I understand it correctly, its use is as a prayer to draw the strength to face and accept unpalatable but proven realities. But then, you have to concede that there's some degree of religiousness in this practice, not just an objective statement of facts.<br><br>Concerning your 3rd argument. I have to say that it is not only unproven but suspiciously unprovable. To me, it seems like it was by design constructed to use the "Not True Scotsman" defense: so every piece of evidence that rationalism leads to worship of progress will be dismissed as a defective form rationalism. This does not invalidate your argument automatically, but we must recognize that this is a possibility, in order to fix a criteria to falsify it before we try to do any sort of analysis.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c3130048196156528617 title="comment permalink">3/29/13, 2:08 PM</a><br><br>

I am not advocating serfdom for any group of human beings here; only pointing that death of progressive thinking may have surprising consequences.

In their fantasy, they are still PROGRESSING to higher and better state of earthly existence from this purgatory of industrialism. <br><br>True contraction and scaling down shall probably have very different outlook altogether than in any fantasies; it is probably more chaotic, grim and less planned, if real world regions under acute difficulties can offer any guidance.

And then... catastrophe! The hard-earned ones disappear leaving a lot of zeros.<br><br>Except off to the left, beyond where you were looking (because those digits change so rarely), a zero that has been there since timing began has turned to a one. Moments later, on the right, a few ones start reappearing. The count goes on. The true total (which you can't even tell exists unless you know the code) continues to increase.<br><br>The history of biological evolution on earth has numerous extinction events, some of them massive. At times, something like 90% of the species on the planet have disappeared in a geological eye blink. <br><br>Yet, like the digital counter, evolution never stopped, nor was even set backward. (Unlike the labyrinth or digital counter, evolution has no goal and no direction, so technically there is no "backward" for it to go, but we can note that extinct creatures and previous epochs were at no time restored or repeated.)<br><br>What do these examples have in common? The reversal of illusory progress in the course of ongoing real evolution. Your geometric distance from your starting point in the labyrinth; the number of ones in the digital counter; the number and diversity of species -- all suffer collapses or declines. But that's just resetting the registers, as it were, for the next stage of the computation that's still going on.<br><br>Human culture, too, is an evolutionary process; it too has suffered extinction events before and will do so again. But while local patterns repeat, the whole cannot. Some things that have been zeros since humanity climbed down from the trees will be ones henceforth. Maybe those things won't after all be technological or epistomological, maybe they will be narrative instead, but whatever they are, it will make a difference.<br><br>That's the kind of progress I care about.

Consider: With Newton, God sets up the Laws of the Universe and then gets to sit back and relax—sort of like the Seventh Day in the Bible except that it goes on and on as an extended vacation. But with Quantum Mechanics, God gets called back—or should get called back! He has plenty of work to do, including making gazillions of decisions every second (a gazillion is a lot more than a million) and not only making them, but cross-checking each against each to make sure outcomes do not wander too far from probable outcomes. Lots of actuarial tables! Also, he has to look deep into the past and far into the future to make sure he does not accidentally paint himself into a corner. Busy! Only no one calls him back—despite the job opening. Why not? He's already dead. <br><br>Perhaps hidden variables can be resurrected, if we accept non-locality, which we probably have to do anyway. Good. But even if we choose this route and can make it work, we are still stepping out of Western thought, which was the problem with QM in the first place. <br><br>I disagree that Quantum Mechanics is a mistake, though it is a dead end in the sense of a limit. It says: This is as far as you go—Western thought, with all its real successes, stops here, and does not go beyond this point. Like you say, a wall. Some folk realized this immediately: Neils Bohr took up Buddhism and put the yin-yang symbol on his coat of arms. <br><br>Bohr's solution was not accepted by everyone, nor is it clear that it is the best way. However, physicists reacted a lot like the Post-Modernists JMG mentions—rather than looking for a way out, they rejected the implication of limits to Western thought and contented themselves with playing with their shiny (and very powerful) new toy. <br><br>Eventually, and especially since Bell's Theorem was shown not to be merely and artifect of Quantum Theory but confirmed in reality, more thought has gone into what QM actually means. A while back Nick Herbert wrote a book “Quantum Reality” describing eight distinctly different world-views for understanding QM. All are non-Western, all are basically consistent with what is known, and most are mutually incompatible. He does not include African magic, which I wish he had (or had been able) to do since African magic deals easily with things like entanglement (contagion) and locality (their isn't any). <br><br>Lee Smolins!--had to look him up and get more current: Interesting stuff! But I agree: If we ever face up to what reality is we are not going to like it: It is not going to agree with what we think nor with what we want to think. <br><br>--Gaianne<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c7365980450797675993 title="comment permalink">3/29/13, 7:09 PM</a><br><br>

Still, the point I tried to make earlier is that "wrong for you" does not equal "wrong" -- and the notion that this equation ought to be made, ironically, came into the religious history of the world with the religions to which you're applying it. <br><br>James, oh, granted. I occasionally have fun pointing out to atheists just how massive a role faith plays in their belief system. <br><br>Zeno, if you're right that God is an artifact of the sense of meaning, rather than (say) the source of that sense, then your theory that God is an artifact of the sense of meaning is itself an artifact of human thought imposed arbitrarily on a cosmos that doesn't explain itself. A pretty paradox!<br><br>Fidelius, no, I wasn't! I read him back in the 1970s and 1980s, of course -- everybody in appropriate tech did -- but haven't followed up on him since that time. I'll see if I can make space in the reading pile for some of his later work. <br><br>Onething, sun worship has a lot to say for itself. You don't have to wonder whether your god exists, and you can say with absolute certainty that your god is the source of light and life in the world. Can it be a source of transcendent meaning? Ask any practitioner of Shinto who prays to Amaterasu-no-Omikami...<br><br>Hal, good. You've got a definition of faith considerably more useful than most of those that get bandied about these days; we'll talk about that extensively later on. <br><br>Joseph, linear on a log scale is still linear. What would you think of a theory of the year that went "winter, spring, summer, uber-summer, uber-uber-summer, and so on until the world catches fire and burns up"? Whether the seasons in the theory were the same length, or each was half the length of the one before, it's still a linear vision of time. More on this next week!<br><br>Zed, just remember that after thesis, antithesis, and synthesis come parenthesis and paralysis. If you're not familiar with those last two stages, stay tuned for the upcoming discussion of Hegel. <br><br>Simon, you can fairly easily map your new paradigm onto the Biblical concept of covenant, and go from there to argue that our current society's boom-bust cycle parallels that of Old Testament Israel. Speak in their metaphors and you can make a lot of headway. <br><br>Raymond, you may be in for a few surprises if you do.

I already mentioned that they had violent social struggles at that time, from peasant uprisings to guild apprentices' strikes in cities, and it could be added that the serfs were not bound to the land they were working by religious dogma but by social custom enforced by the sword of the feudal lord. Heck, even so much as wearing the wrong type of clothes for your social class would have been severely punished.<br><br>I would argue that all societies are necessarily held up by the threat of violence because they all at times contain people who are desperate, who will convince themselves that the gods don't care or are on their side, who assume that they can always get absolution for their sins later, and so on. On top of that, societies do of course need some legitimacy - but it comes from protecting their members from external enemies and severe economic instability. If people are starving to death while the prince trows lavish parties no amount of religious piety will protect him from a popular uprising, and the leaders of that uprising will probably cite the bible for justification!<br><br>Deborah Bender,<br><br><i>Religion (in a broad sense that includes secular religions like Marxism) has been present as an organizing system in every known culture to date.</i><br><br>Ah, but that broad sense is the crux, isn't it? In a broad sense such as used in the original post above, one could rebut every example of a functional irreligious society by saying that it also has a religion - "progress", "Marxism", "the feeding trough of the welfare state", whatever you want. But that makes the argument perfectly circular. The way to escape from this circularity would be to start with a decent definition of what religion is, and I find it hard to define it in a way that would include the belief in everlasting economic growth, naive as it indubitably is. In that broad sense the word religion would be at best a synonym for "any unfounded belief" and at worst meaningless.<br><br>As for the one generation of secular societies only, first of all JMG seems to think that the relevant time span is longer, unless I have misunderstood the post. Second, no society lasts forever. By that measure, religious societies have a track record of very nearly 100% failure, excluding only those few that still exist today.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c5409315606618792432 title="comment permalink">3/29/13, 7:32 PM</a><br><br>

I am having doubts whether this comment will get past the censors, but I will still state it - there is a direct causal (though not purely unidirectional) relationship between the anthropocentrism of the Abrahamic religions and the damage we have done to the life support systems of the planet. <br><br>Now I know very well the objection I will get to this - religion does not have to be like that. But that is not a good objection because there is absolutely no reason why people should live in harmony with their environment because they believe in some sort of mythology when they can do so based on a good (and constantly improving) ecological understanding of that environment and their place in it. <br><br><i>Concerning your 3rd argument. I have to say that it is not only unproven but suspiciously unprovable. To me, it seems like it was by design constructed to use the "Not True Scotsman" defense: so every piece of evidence that rationalism leads to worship of progress will be dismissed as a defective form rationalism. This does not invalidate your argument automatically, but we must recognize that this is a possibility, in order to fix a criteria to falsify it before we try to do any sort of analysis.</i><br><br>It has nothing to do with the "No True Scotsman" defense. In the simplest possible terms, once you realize that humans are nothing more than Darwinian machines whose behavior is primarily driven by the urge to maximize their inclusive fitness, you can take Hamilton's kin selection paradigm, extend it from the transition from one generation to the next to a grander evolutionary scale, and see that the worst thing you can do to your inclusive fitness in the long term is to contribute to the extinction of the species you belong to with short-sighted suicidal actions aiming at maximizing your inclusive fitness in the short term. Because most of us are quite closely related genetically and there can be no reproductive cost due to altruistic behavior that's greater than the reproductive cost of extinction.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c8862749604651013458 title="comment permalink">3/30/13, 1:20 AM</a><br><br>

Darwin was a scientist and a human being and as such was fallible. Darwinian evolution is a theory not gospel truth. I do not say this to dismiss its validity outright; I do perceive it as a theory with much supporting evidence and often attempt to understand human behaviour and the surrounding world in light of evolutionary theory. However, if you are truly as enamoured of science as you seem to be then you must realise that theories are representations of and approximations to truth rather than indubitable, gospel truth. What makes one theory better than another is that it is a closer approximation to the truth based upon our most empirically valid understanding of the truth. <br><br>When you espouse the “nothing more” line of thought you come across as having shut your mind off to other possibilities which ironically is rather unscientific. Science, in the truest sense of the word, is about a process and a state of mind. That process is the scientific method whereby questions are asked and answers are sought using a variety of tools known to be effective and that state of mind is a constant openness and an awareness of how much it is we do not know and the perpetual vulnerability of even our best and most cherished theories. <br><br>One more point. You seem to think that a scientifically enlightened mindset will set us free and lead humanity towards a better way of life, one that is sustainable, one that is humane, one that is based upon enlightened self-interest. Yet you espouse the dogma that “humans are nothing more than Darwinian machines” which reduces humans to mechanistic automatons. In my view this dogmatically reductionist view of humanity has much to do with some of the worst problems of the past few centuries; the devaluation of human life, the objectification of people, the proliferation of smut, growing superficiality and mindless materialism. It is from such a viewpoint that the murder of innocents can be called “collateral damage” and infanticide “post-birth abortion”.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c305499936234086456 title="comment permalink">3/30/13, 4:25 PM</a><br><br>

I occasionally have fun pointing out to atheists just how massive a role faith plays in their belief system."<br><br>I'm glad that you have fun doing so, but what you say is non-sense, and the smugness you as a religionist display towards non-religionists is hardly different from the smugness you might (rightly) perceive exists amongst many a-religionists or anti-religionists in regard to religionists. <br><br><br>----<br>Personally, I don't "have faith" that there is no God. It's not a matter of "belief" in the slightest! It's the very idea of "belief", in fact, which is at issue! What religionists seem to have a hard time breaking out of is the box that says "belief is a given" in the first place. <br><br>To a person of "belief", any belief (Druid, Christian, Muslim, Hinduism) is better than "no-belief". Why is that? Have you thought sincerely why it is that Americans would elect an ("enemy"!!) Muslim as president sooner than an atheist?? This is surely a situation which calls for some investigation.<br><br>-<br>As an atheist, faith plays NO role in my belief system, because I don't have one. It's so simple that its very simplicity seems to evade religionists who insist that there be something more. <br><br>"Not believing in a God" is not the same as "believing in no-God". I don't know why that is not clear. My life does not revolve around <br>"non-belief" the way my sister's revolves around Christian fundamentalism. I don't give 10% of my income (pre-tax, of course!) to "no-belief" charlatans. There are no "no-belief" schools for me to send my non-existent children to. John Michael has already laid out for me the fact that I can't join the Rotary or the Grange or the Masons or the Lions or whatever, because they are all founded on irrational supernatural "belief", to which I cannot in good conscience subscribe, no matter how worthy I find the institution, nor how needful they are of my material assistance.<br><br><br>--<br>I see religion as sheer <b>protagonism</b>. Humans enjoy being protagonists in either BEING gods (or priests or archdruids: being intermediaries for gods whom they might channel) or they enjoy, as does my sister, abjectly supplicating gods. None of these positions seems rational outside of perhaps Sado-masochism. None of them seem particularly advantageous to me for survival either, although JMG's cynical advice that enterprising folks set up shop as astrologers tells me more than I need to know about possible motivations for claims of access to the supernatural.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c8471516473096493566 title="comment permalink">3/30/13, 10:53 PM</a><br><br>

I look at the situation on a time scale of hundreds of thousands and millions of years, not only at the next few decades, as crucial as they are going to be. <br><br>The number one priority right now should be preserving the hard earned over the last few centuries scientific knowledge, because it is our best evolutionary asset into the future, and if it gets lost this time, it is unlikely it will be regenerated - particle accelerators are quite complicated machines, it took the efforts of many thousands of scientists and several decades to sequence the human genome, etc. <br><br>But I don't see how scientific knowledge can be preserved by the anti-science attitude you seem to be promoting.<br><br>I am not a believer in doing the right things for the wrong reasons - such situations tend to inevitably evolve into doing the wrong things for the wrong reasons. The main reason the ancient Celts did not enter a state of ecological overshoot and did not wreck their environment was not the wisdom of their druids but the simple fact that they were mostly conquered before they could do so and that other people had the dubious honor of accomplishing that task on their territories. <br><br>Science-based ecological literacy seems a much better foundation for sustainability to me than mythology.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c6243347235532328970 title="comment permalink">3/31/13, 1:55 AM</a><br><br>

Economic and technological changes allowed and in some instances encouraged women to move out of the roles which patriarchy had assigned to them. If advanced capitalism falls, that may be reversed whether we like it or not.<br><br>Traditional ways of doing and thinking are not necessarily better or worse than new ways. I belong to a people that has seen some good times and some very bad times. Passover, the holiday we are currently celebrating, is partly to remind us of that. <br><br>My people's written records go back about three thousand years. We have been tribal nomads and nuclear physicists and everything in between. When conditions change, which is often, we try to figure out what from the past is still useful to do and what needs to be remembered but not practiced for awhile. If we dump all of it, we won't know who we are.

You had very good points in your commentary, and it always helps to look your own opinions from position of outsider. So you probably nailed many things there.<br> <br>It is true that I have had this uneasy feeling that our system here in Nordic countries is heading for disaster right now, and vulnerability and harshness of our environment will make that fall much harder than in warmer and more fertile countries. Way we do things right now is not sustainable, and because our environment is not forgiving when it comes to failure, check is going to be bitter.<br><br>My worries are made bigger because I witnessed from time to time firsthand horrible casualties caused by fall of Soviet Union on the Russian side of the border. It is different when you actually see it, all that decay and chaos. When central government and logistics breaks down in taiga region, ordinary people take a heavy hit.<br><br>When it comes to this "accusation" of being systematically anti-liberal, picture is little bit more complicated than that. Progressive liberal thinking just is main narrative driving our Nordic system onwards right now, it is belief system of our elites here. Because of this, I am more acutely aware of it's weaknesses facing chronic contraction and scaling down we have hit here in Europe than I am aware of, let's say, neoconservatives. If it would be some other modern narrative unable to face harsh realities of physical limits to growth facing me in my everyday life, I would be more aware about that system's inherent failures. I believe this aspect of my thinking is lost in translation; I seem to be perceived more rigidly anti-liberal than I am when I try to communicate with English language.<br><br>About traditional family values and traditional ways of doing things: they have worked in the past, they are reality tested solutions. It seems to me that being innovative and fresh thinker is so central for anglo-saxon thinking, that just saying: "Hey, these guys were doing just fine couple of millennias doing things like they did without extensive energy resources, maybe we should learn from them?" is considered being somehow insulting and heretical. I have to say that none has proved my thinking in that aspect to be flawed. I have seen so-called indigenous people, buryats and bargas, and they seem to be astonishingly well-adapted to their environment and astonishingly conservative when it comes to viewing world around them. I do not claim to be any kind specialist of these nations, but just seeing glimpses of their life makes you have deep doubts about ways of you own culture. <br><br>I have lost my faith to state's continuing capacity to be provider for individuals. If there is economic crisis dwarfing any experienced in history of mankind looming upon us, like I believe, then you just have to have solid social networks fixed to place, supplementing official state doctrines. <br><br>Finland is peculiar mix of eastern and western influences when you scratch away solidly western surface, and we have traits from both traditions. Trust level towards government and state is markedly lower than in other Nordic countries, and when you consider future ahead, it is probably good thing it is like that.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c1949495057243582343 title="comment permalink">3/31/13, 4:23 AM</a><br><br>

Why do you think I am writing commentary to this blog? Having useless word fights with people living other side of globe is completely useless and in some cases damaging for your reputation. I am doing this because I am trying to gain wider perspective than my own alone is, and clear my somewhat confused and blurry opinions about what is happening in the world around me. <br><br>I am no environmentalist; I do not come from academic family; I had no great political or ethical opinions when I was growing up. I was more interested of ice hockey, boxing and driving old Mazda wreckage you can barely call a car. So waking up to this ongoing crisis of nature, resource depletion and human society came to me outside all convenient subcultural narratives talking about it. It came through seeing things and thinking what I saw, and from my deep interest in studying history. So I am not telling anyone that my opinion is only truth there is, because my opinion is best described as fragmented and hazy. But I am also very good at smelling hypocrisy and "enlightened elitism" behind comments of other people, and that is something I am not buying, never.<br><br>Environmental movement of West is best described as hermetically sealed upper-class way to feel better person that hilly billy redneck next to you, nothing less or more. This fact is glaringly obvious in movement's utter failure to reach out to people outside their own circles. Movement is incarnated in figure of Marie Antoinette asking why proles of Paris are not eating cake if they are so hungry. <br><br>That is why I challenge this kind of minx opinions very easily, even if I am fully ready to absorb new information humbly and realistically presented. And I have got many new ideas from this blog, from JMG and commenters alike. This Australian dude from other side of planet has also given me many new perspectives, you know :).

And that is the dilemma. It is impossible for the brain to understand how the brain works, for logic to prove logic or for intellect to explain itself. That’s why Euclid started with “Five things that are just true. Trust me. I’m a philosopher.” Of course, when people questioned one of them, entirely new geometries were possible. Possible, but were they real? The first postulate (faith) of science is ultimately not about what is ‘real’ but about what can be measured. That’s the ‘Trust me. I’m a scientist,’ beginnings of science. The first postulate (faith) of religion is that knowledge cannot be obtained by humans without divine revelation. That’s the ‘Trust me. I speak for God,’ beginnings of religion.<br><br>I wrote an essay called ‘The Causality Buffet’ where I explore this idea. And explore is all we can ever do. We can never arrive at a conclusion. So my conclusion (sic) is that the existence of God is impossible, as is the nonexistence of God. <br><br>But that’s not very satisfying, much less helpful. So we invent stories to make ourselves feel better.<br><br>Joseph: “...besides, it isn't linear at all, because the time-axis is logarithmic.” You then go on to list progressively improving stages of human organization, from Scavengers to Science. <br><br>People take it for granted that 1) it is linear and not a messy slurry of two or more types coexisting, and 2) that each one is better than the previous, even though hunter gatherer and horticultural civilizations certainly appear to be happier than their more rigidly organized agricultural brethren. The government system was often matriarchal or bi-cameral with the houses consisting of all males and all females, the females deciding which men will belong to the male house. Is our organization better even if it is more advanced? We apparently are not evolved for patriarchy, yet there it is.

I cannot help, but especially in comparison with the keen insight observable in those other topics, they often appear to me too simplistic and too biased by American conservative perspective, although simplistic thinking seems to be here a common label to be applied on "worhshippers of progress" (on this particular point, I am with e.g. Georgi).<br><br>I have been also surprised to observe in all the discussions in comments also elsewhere in the sphere of peak-oil blogs how profoundly conservative the audience tends to gather there. Which is not a problem on some points, but definitely is on others. And what I can see is usually not critical thinking, but scapegoating of progress, secular values, of enlightenment, of liberals, of welfare state, of atheists, "rotten Europe". I have the same feeling when I read time to time about that utterly evil "alopathic modern medicine". That surprises me after all: so many people enthusiastically awaiting the end of modern medicine, of equality, of those "stinking" liberal values etc.<br><br>Of course it is closely related to the fact that my "spiritual" and "political" background is so different - traditionally anticlerical and atheist country, leftist European academic environment...<br><br>One thing is that we will have to do without much modern infrastructure, and that it is very problematic to take for granted social institutions and beliefs of today. Another thing is rejoice in the sight of coming regress. Well, maybe the thoughts were fostered by fossil fuels, though I do not think it is that easy to explain, but they are not so bad as depicted in the commentaries here.<br><br>And, simply said, the "religion of progress" that is so loudly collectively attacked here in the comments, seems to me to be just a straw man, and that it is not (at least not only) adherents of progress who are simplistics. It appeat to me that what is regularly done here is mere subsitution of pluses for negatives and vice verse. It is just an anti-image, and not critical thinking. But I know, critical thinking belongs to the church of progress and is to be substituted by something better and more real anyway in the future.<br><br>What strikes me is the typically "progressive" way of writing this blog (including the old goog method of historical materialism in explaining social changes etc.) in cotrast with the agressive anti-progressive agenda.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c8533328905903542096 title="comment permalink">3/31/13, 7:28 AM</a><br><br>

That belief is an act of faith; it can't be proved. Do you believe that there is no god? That also can't be proved, and to hold any belief at all on the subject other than a straightforward "I don't know" is an act of faith. I could go on indefinitely. No human being has direct access to truth; all we have are mental models, and the faith that those models have some relation to truth. All forms of knowledge are belief systems, because all start from unprovable presuppositions -- yours as much as anyone else's. <br><br>As for atheist schools or community organizations for those whose belief systems do not include gods, if you want those, you need to get out there and start them. The people who founded religious schools and fraternal orders didn't wait for somebody else to provide them with the instutitions they wanted, you know. <br><br>Georgi, I've spent the last six years insisting that preserving the scientific method is among the top priorities for the future, and yet, since I don't accept your atheism, you insist that I have an anti-science attitude. That would be funny if it wasn't so sad. I'd point out that the founders of the scientific revolution were one and all deeply religious men, and that a great many highly religious people have contributed mightily to the development of science -- shall we talk about Gregor Mendel, for example? More broadly, as I've discussed here many times, the primary challenge in dealing with the end of the industrial age is not technical -- it's about human motivation, and beliefs are central to that. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Cherokee, of course. The working title is <i>After Progress</i>. <br><br>Wall0519, good. You're asking some of the crucial questions. I agree that the value of a belief system depends in large part on its relation to truth, but truth is a slippery fish, and the habit of confusing truth with what can be caught in the very wide meshes of the human mind's various conceptual nets is a constant source of trouble. <br><br>Jon, excellent. Thank you for the clarification. I'd like to suggest that we can do a little more than simply invent stories -- or, rather, that we can do a good deal more with the stories than invent them. More on this later. <br><br>Lei, you've given quite a thrashing to that straw man of yours! Still, if you don't find the discussion here useful, there are plenty of other blogs you can read instead, you know. <br><br>Joseph, ah, I see the confusion. By linear I mean "going in the same direction over time" -- it's not a matter of rate but direction. The recent population spike (recent in historical terms -- since 1700 or so) is a case in point. As far as I know, it's unique in human history, and the chance that it will ever be repeated seems fairly small. How do we conceptualize it, though? As a straight line leading to infinity? As a cycle -- first up, then down? As a "waveform pulse,"<br>just one extreme outlier in the general static? More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Quos Ego, thank you -- and many thanks for the quote!

Also I see now why I have always found it so hard to agree with much of anything in your posts. <br><br>Here's why: I really don't think it matters all that much, over the timescale you mention of millions of years, whether humanity goes extinct or not, and whether everything we have accomplished as a species over the last several million years is irrevocably lost sometime in the very distant future. So what?<br><br>Multiply your time scale by a factor of one thousand, please, and look ahead billions of years into the future, not just millions. <br><br>On that scale, it is as close to certain as anything that nothing whatever of human achievement will have survived. Several more billion years or so and the sun itself will changed so much that recognizably human life will be impossible on earth. Also, there seems to be no realistic way of transplanting enough of our species for biological survival, together with its best achievements, to some other planet around some other sun, where it might survive for billions of years more. Earth's gravity well is almost certainly far too deep, and earth's supply of cheap energy needed for that massive project is running out far too rapidly. <br><br>It is not being a doomer, at least if one is inclined to science and materialism, to acknowledge that one's own lifespan is limited, that someday one's very name will be utterly forgotten and all one's achievements either abandoned or surpassed. <br><br>Neither is it being a doomer to acknowledge the same thing for our species. Then where will all its achievements be? <br><br>Someday Beethoven's last surviving symphony will be played for the very last time ever, whether live or in the form of a recording. Not too much later everyone who heard that last playing will have died. Someday, too, the last surviving dialogue by Plato will have been read for the very last time, whether in the original Greek or in translation. Someday no one will have the faintest idea of algebra, or calculus, or the theory of relativity, simply because there will be no human being left alive anywhere in the universe to have that idea. The final destruction of anything you or I care about is as certain as anything else you might care to mention. You can't overturn the laws of thermodynamics. Human ingenuity reaches only so far, and then is halted without recourse.<br><br>To say all these things is most definitely not a counsel of despair. It does NOT inevitably lead to "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you may die." It may lead, instead, to small, limited acts of compassion, to finite and impermanent creativity, to love and kindness that will matter only in the short run -- simply because it is easier, for some of us, to get up and face the day if we have done these things yesterday, and intend to do them again today.

This is the last thing we need on this overcrowded planet of ours. We are in overshoot, and our numbers will go down. The only question is how this happens. Please note that a declining human population (which is at this point inevitable) is not incompatible with high birth rates. The way to make the two compatible is to have sky-high infant and child mortality rates. This, in my mind (and most people's minds, I would hope) is not a desirable outcome. Much, much better to limit the number of children brought into this world, so that those few children can get adequate resources to grow up and live decent lives. <br><br>This means that we have much to gain by promoting small families, including childless ones. And yes, this means that gays are your friends. So are childless heterosexual couples. So are the people who choose to remain celibate. And please note that many such people are actually fond of children. So, finding ways to get them involved in raising other people's children, in one way or another, is a plus for everyone involved. The kids get some extra resources (including non-material resources), the parents get some weight lifted off their shoulders, and the lesbian aunt and the celibate family friend get the emotional satisfaction of being involved with child rearing. <br><br>The point is that we are moving toward a much poorer future, one that can accommodate only a fraction of the current population. The values and practices that are best suited for this future are not the traditional ones that we abandoned, nor are they the ones that we have now. A return to <b>some</b> of the old traditions (e.g. frugality) would help, keeping <b>some</b> current ones (chiefly small families) would help, but on the whole, going back to the traditional family is just as unhelpful as trying to hold on to our current material excesses.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c1643877762640282191 title="comment permalink">3/31/13, 11:52 AM</a><br><br>

Is the end, that's pretty much everything. Particularly if we're sticklers for accuracy.<br><br>I think faith is a personal commitment to a particular belief. I think religion requires faith in addition to belief.<br><br>Thus, a scientist should not have faith in a theory, since all science is provisional. It might be possible to argue that commitment to the scientific method is faith, but I think the goal of science is to have as few faiths as possible (ideally, none)<br><br>I actively believe there is no God, because I've seen no evidence of one. This is not a faith though, and I would change my mind if there was some new evidence that convinced me (eg. The second coming would be good evidence of a Christian God). Maybe some people have faith in atheism -- whether that is a religion, I don't know but am doubtful.<br><br>Regarding truth, I think humans can never know pure truth. I think we can get incrementally closer to it using the scientific method (eg Aristotle to Galileo to Newton to Einstein). Note that General Relativity is almost certainly not correct and that future discoveries will improve it (should humans have the capacity to conduct the research).<br><br>Having said this, I agree that these are approximate truths for us, and that aliens might experience/explain the world in very different ways. This doesn't mean relativity is wrong, or a "mere belief" -- it is just not the whole picture (and we will likely never know the whole picture)<br><br>To clarify my previous post, I think we should pursue knowledge with truth as the goal. In this sense, if we're seeking truth we should not be distracted be considerations of the utility of different outcomes. Eg. I'd really rather climate change wasn't true, but when looking at the data, this should not influence the interpretation or conclusion. Of course, even in science this sort of bias happens all the time, hence the saying "science proceeds one funeral at a time"<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c1869169266646565675 title="comment permalink">3/31/13, 12:06 PM</a><br><br>

You will forgive me for pushing, but I do think it would be good for you to write a paragraph of explanation. <br><br>In theory, every adult American Catholic passes either through Confirmation classes (if a cradle Catholic) or through some months of RCIA (if a convert). Which doctrinal muddles, then, have you experienced in probing numerous American Catholics?<br><br>(a) It could be that you have asked abstract questions, such as "What is God?" In this case, you are likely to have received pop-theology answers, such as "God is a life force." I would, however, plead in mitigation that dreadful lay-Catholic answers to abstract questions are natural. Deep Catholic philosophers have likewise been reduced to mumbling. According to one strain among those deep philosophers, humans cannot say much at all - being reduced, in large part, to saying merely what God is not. Aquinas is, I guess, not in this sense "apophatic". But even he does not attain anything like the level of clarity that we moderns, trained in the secular rigour of Frege, Anscombe, Geach, and Dummett (indeed of Carnap-Quine-Davidson, or again of Lewis-Plantinga) rightly demand. Aquinas's "God is Pure Being, Pure Actualization" get us little further than apophatics unless and until we somehow further develop contemporary analytical philosophy. <br><br>(b) It could be that you have asked concrete questions: "Do you speak metaphorically when you recite the Nicene Creed?" "Is there any sense in which it is right to invoke some dead people - for instance, St Maximilian Kolbe - in prayer?" "Is there a difference between saying, in solitude, to God that you are sorry and saying it to God through the priest at Confession?" "Is there a difference between praying in an empty field and praying, in an empty church, at the Tabernacle?" <br><br>Since "It is deeds that speak," it might additionally be useful for you to write, briefly, on what behaviours you have observed. Keeping my eyes open this Triduum, I noticed not only some weak deeds at my big, drab, filled-to-bursting "local" (e.g., some tendency to use vapid hymns), but instances of strength, of which I cite the following: (i) the man who prostrated himself before the empty tabernacle on Holy Thursday (not a normal, socially approved, posture); (ii) the lady who stroked the Tabernacle doors in adoration (again, not socially inculcated behaviour - her deed might rightly make some parish priests uncomfortable if they saw it); (iii) the little groups of people who stayed on a whole hour, or more, after the Good Friday 3:00 pm service was over (there is no social pressure to do this, even though there is some mild social pressure to linger for the formal Adoration that follows the Mass on Holy Thursday night). <br><br>Here I am perhaps asking a little too much, since it would be cruel to call on you to enter a church. Tongues might wag, in small-city Cumberland. However, if they did, you could point out firmly that an Archdruid is welcome in church, and may indeed ask, hands folded, for a blessing at the instant of Communion, and that anyone who - erring - feels uneasy can phone the Archbishop for a canonical ruling. <br><br>Juhana (your posting "Catholic Churches of East and West..."): Agreed; there is indeed some temptation in journalism to downplay the extent of faith among Catholics. At some level, the attitude of TV and metropolitan dailies is like the attitude of the Party in pre-1991 Soviet Estonia. The Church was there then, and is now in EU-Canada-USA, felt (rightly) to pose a potentially decisive challenge to the "Party Line". <br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo (near Toronto) <br>www dot metascientia dot com<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c3955978404926752174 title="comment permalink">3/31/13, 12:50 PM</a><br><br>

That's evidence for atheism, not against - because scientists did not become atheists just because they wanted to, evolved out of the intellectual activity of philosophers in the Middle Ages who are almost all monks, and all scientists were religious for a while. But then it became more and more difficult to be religious as we learned more and more about the world around us.

I have a somewhat more specific one, which I'll be proposing and developing here as we proceed. <br><br>wall0159, of course a scientist shouldn't have faith in a theory -- though most do; nothing is so common in science, as I'm sure you know, as the filtering of experimental results to make them fit existing theory. To be a scientist at all, though, requires faith -- in the sense of personal commitment to a belief -- that the practice of science has value, that the forms of knowledge (or, as I'd say instead, the mental models of phenomena) it produces are worth the effort, and ultimately that there's such a thing as truth, to which scientific theories can approximate. All those claims rest on faith. That doesn't mean they're invalid -- quite the contrary. <br><br>Toomas, I'll pass; we're already way off topic, and no, I don't plan on going up to St. Mary's any time soon.

Yet you insist he wasn't a scientist. Why? Oh, of course, because he was a devout Catholic monk; we're right back into the "no true Scotsman" argument. When you claim that the scientific method can't be separated from atheism, you're quite simply wrong -- there have been, and continue to be, countless thousands of competent scientists doing excellent research who also believe in the existence of one or more gods. The fact that this doesn't make sense to you might suggest to you that your biases need a good hard second look. <br><br>James, good. The circularity of arguments about truth is of course a major issue; it's arguably one of those places where what's needed is a postulate rather than a proof. For working purposes, though, I'm fond of Popper's standard of non-disconfirmation: a theory may be tentatively accepted as true so long as every effort to disconfirm it has failed so far.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c237979466109692762 title="comment permalink">3/31/13, 3:13 PM</a><br><br>

Second, and more important, what the existence of religious scientists proves is that people have the capacity to hold mutually incompatible beliefs in their heads in the same time. The religious scientists are simply switching off the scientific mode of reasoning in their brains when they think about religion - it is perfectly possible to follow the scientific method during the day while you're in the lab then completely forget about it when you go to church.

To dismiss it all as wishful thinking on the part of a humanity which has learned of their own death might be too simplistic.

Something able to cause it has to be very "other".<br><br>When people say there is no evidence despite much evidence, I am wondering what sort of evidence they expect. And it is odd that in this time of science, when we have found that there is a huge unseen world of microbes, molecules, cells with millions of atoms all doing organized functions invisible to the eye, an electromagnetic spectrum that takes special instruments to find - why do some people suppose that this is it and we have discovered all there is to discover? Is that not an astonishingly shortsighted conclusion to come to in this particular time in history?<br><br>I can well imagine going to some medieval or Roman intellectual group and trying to explain about the dangers of radiation and having them reply that there is no evidence for such a preposterous notion!<br>How can you demand evidence of spiritual things from with the realm of matter? Oh, maybe I should not have said that, for I do not actually separate them, but only for convenience, because of the limitations of our senses. <br><br>It is like that Mitchelson-Morley experiment, in which they proved that there was no ether because their instruments could not pick it up!<br>There is also the evidence of the mystics, who all speak the same language even when they seem to adhere to a particular religion. Here I would also include the spiritual wisdom of many indigenous and aboriginal cultures. There is a common human spiritual experience. The same themes repeat. The more a person has their own sense of connection to the numinous, the less they care about or depend upon others to tell them what to believe. Where does this confidence come from? Of course, a paranoid schizophrenic is also very confident in his elaborate belief system, but every schizophrenic is crazy in their own way, whereas sane, mystical people understand one another easily.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c4904548916898863327 title="comment permalink">3/31/13, 9:05 PM</a><br><br>

Have you done a study to show that scientists who are religious think differently in church than they do in the lab? Of course not; you're taking it on faith, because the circular logic of your atheist convictions demand that conclusion. Your argument is therefore self-refuting, not to mention arrogant, and you have thus quite efficiently disproved your own case.

No logical system can prove its own first principles, and that applies to sciences as it does to everything else.) <br><br>Matt, thank you! 'Tis an ill wind that blows no minds. <br><br>Robert, good. I've also seen it argued, very convincingly, that the scientific method only applies to things that can be measured in quantitative terms by material instruments. There are plenty of things that can't be so measured, and to criticize science for not being able to deal with them is like criticizing a hammer because it's not a very good saw. Even so, a hammer isn't a very good saw, and recognizing that a hammer shouldn't be used as a saw is a good first step to becoming a competent carpenter. <br><br>Dornier, yes, I've read it.

I think we see eye to eye on the to logical extremes of God's death that Nietzsche saw in Nihilism and Nazism, one being the reduction of meaning to nothing and the other the elevation of man to Godhood as successor. <br><br>For the religion of progress, I think we can see the two strains of reduction ad absurdum already at play and the contradictions are irreconcilable.<br><br>In the one, you have the environmental movement that offers reduction and recycling as an answer to environmental problems. What they are really offering, if their prescriptions are done at scale, is economic depression and the bigger the depression, the more closely followed are their ideas.

Darwinian machines is an<br>oxymoron, as the theory of evolution explicitly applies to living matter and machines are explicitly not-living.

I personally subscribe to the Popper's thesis that science can only study a subset of reality that can be observed repeatedly. So let's please move on.<br><br><i>... there is a direct causal (though not purely unidirectional) relationship between the anthropocentrism of the Abrahamic religions and the damage we have done to the life support systems of the planet.</i><br><br>Not being familiar enough with Judaism or Islam, I am going to talk about Christianism. I have heard the argument that the Bible compels mankind to "grow and multiply" and to "rule over all creatures". I agree that this is not a good foundation for a sustainable society, but this is only part of the story. As a matter of fact, it can be argued that we are in this mess now due to the rejection of traditional Christian values, such as its taboo against debt in all of its forms (specially but not limited to usury being considered a sin) and the idea that material wealth is an obstacle for the spiritual life.<br><br>My take is that societies, like individuals, decide what they want to do by some undisclosed motives and then go on justifying those decisions by twisting whatever ideals they happen to have. This did happen historically to Christianity but it is not part of Christianity itself. The relevance of this last point coming in next paragraph.<br><br><i>A fully-informed atheistic view of human nature and the basic drivers of human behavior actually provides a very good foundation for a society that does not devolve into chaos, does not worship the god of progress and does not self-destroy ecologically</i><br><br>The point I am trying to make is that what happened to Christianity is happening also to Rationality. You seem to believe that people act "badly" (for lack of a better word) out of ignorance. And if they were to learn the truth, they would accept to be "good" because it would be self evident. This contradicts my experience, both in myself and in the people around me. What I see is people doing what they want to, and then using their oversized brains to figure out justifications of their behavior.<br><br>We as a species are extremely good at deception and manipulation, of ourselves or others.

However, as a rule, a focus on the ultimate demise of humanity will lead towards despair and misanthropy. This can easily be empirically verified. For example, a passage much like the one Robert Mathieson wrote out can be shown to people and their mood pre- and post-test can be measured; additionally, their perceptions can be probed to ascertain the influence such ideas have upon their mood and outlook. Correlational and longitudinal studies can also be conducted to ascertain the relation between such a worldview and a person’s attitudes, beliefs, morals and behaviours. <br><br>It can be argued, though, that the test has already been conducted on a larger scale over the past century. As people have adopted beliefs espousing the ultimate meaninglessness of humanity and have come to believe in humanity’s ultimate demise people have become increasingly disconnected from each other to the point where there are people who will cry for the plight of an animal but not even flinch when presented with the needless suffering and deaths of people the world over. Take a look at the growing rate of narcissism for example (this has been empirically validated). To not believe in the human race having a special place in the universe will, as a rule, breed de-humanisation, narcissism, hopelessness, misanthropy and a whole host of other deleterious traits and behaviours. All of the wars, famine and injustice that occurred in a world of plenty (before peak oil) were caused, in large part, by convincing people that humanity is nothing special and that all will come to naught anyhow. Caring about your family and friends does not disprove any of that that; there is nothing inherently decent or altruistic about that. Caring about a stranger and the suffering of people you will never even meet (as well as family and friends) is a better litmus test of decency and you are more likely to find this trait in a person who believes that there is something special about humanity.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c2062787260422172865 title="comment permalink">4/1/13, 1:51 AM</a><br><br>

As I explained, to call something a Darwinian Machine is nonsense as Darwinian theory applies exclusively and specifically to that which is 'non-machine.' To say something is a 'Darwinian Machine' is an example of using a fallacious metaphor to beg a question about what we are. Your conception is removed from reality to the furthest degree possible, and if you attempt to fix the error, you may see where your thinking is circling. One fix is to say that humans are no more than Darwinian animals, as opposed to Darwinian plants, microbes, viruses, insects, etc., which all have expressions of evolutionary processes in their own ways.<br><br>So, humans are no more than Darwinian animals. If we are no more than Darwinian animals, then this nullifies all your concerns about science, because by and large, science is irrelevant to animals. If you truly believe that we are only Darwinian Animals, then why bother about the pretentious stuff like science? If you think science and other artifacts of human culture are important in any sense, but especially in an evolutionary sense of human existence, then you would have to believe humans are more than Darwinian animals.

Also, the laws of nature that deal with these things do indeed seem to be simple when they are carefully analyzed. <br><br>But the percepts that our ordinary senses give us of the material world are not all that men and women have to deal with as a species. Human experience can and does offer us much more than sense perception, at least to some humans. <br><br>However, trying to explain that "much more" is like trying to convince a person born blind that color exists. The person born blind may, if he chooses, take color as a given outside of his possible experience. After all, most of the people with whom he interacts obviously perceive color, and they talk about it as if it is important to them. Moreover, with clever enough instrumentation, that person may be able to verify the existence of color (more precisely, of the spectrum of sunlight created by a prism, which correlates with color as others describe it), even though he himself cannot perceive color directly.<br><br>Now suppose, for the sake of developing this argument, that almost everyone was born blind, but only one in five hundred million people was born sighted. Is there any way that those dozen and a half sighted people could ever convince the other nine billion people that their own personal experience includes such a thing as sight, let alone color? I do not see how there is any way they could convince most people, even with enormous resources of time and money. <br><br>Also, why should the sighted even bother making an attempt to convince the blind super-majority? The nine billion would easily speak of self-delusion, of insanity, of hallucinations, and so forth, as the easiest way out of the dilemma posed by the existence of a dozen-and-a-half sighted people among them. And, of course, such things as self-delusion, insanity and hallucinations really do exist—in spades!<br><br>[continued in the next post]<br><br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c386009067838657425 title="comment permalink">4/1/13, 2:30 AM</a><br><br>

Moreover, they can talk with one another in consistent and meaningful ways about their moments of direct perception, just as the sighted can talk about their experience of color.<br><br>However, the percepts that result from direct perception seem, to those who have experienced it, to lie almost completely beyond the referential domain of any human language. Also they seem to evade the most basic rules of logic, e.g., that A and not-A are mutually exclusive, or that X either exists or does not exist. Direct perception also appears to be non-local, that is, distance in time and space plays no role in limiting its scope. And direct perception probably also violates the conservation of energy-and-mass, since all ordinary transmission of information requires an expenditure of energy, but information resulting from direct perception seems not to require any such expenditure.<br><br>Even for those who have experienced it, direct perception happens rarely, does not (usually) last long, and (usually) cannot be “turned on” at will. Its existence cannot, therefore, be empirically verified by any application of the scientific method. Surely it would be more convenient, both for science and for ordinary life, if everyone just agreed that direct perception does not exist at all, that experiences of it are nothing more than hallucinations, temporary insanity, self-delusion, and so forth. Even the people who have had these moments often gladly explain them away. There are real social penalties for being that weird, and sometimes those penalties are quite harsh.<br><br>However, many of the few who have experienced it, regard their moments of direct perception as the most significant, most transformative events in their whole lives. The experience of direct perception often produces real, measurable changes in people's lives. Very often—not always—those changes are not maladaptive, but highly adaptive.<br><br>Of course, no quantity of anecdotes can ever become data for science, and the possibilities of fraud and self-deception can never be ruled out in any individual anecdote. So there cannot be any way to examine direct perception using the scientific method. <br><br>But for us who have had such experiences, any appeal such as yours to logic or materialism or the scientific method will always fall short of our experienced reality. You end up seeming to us exactly like a blind man in a world of people born blind who tries to persuade the rare sighted person that color does not exist.<br><br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c6144108188468134582 title="comment permalink">4/1/13, 2:31 AM</a><br><br>

In fact, all religions, whether monotheist (Islam, Judism or Christianity) or eastern (Buddhism or Hinduism) were failures at anticipating overshoot and incorporating rules and tabus in their dogma to prevent this. Why? Because these religions where born of a time that famine and disease still kept us within carrying capacity so it is obvious that the spiritual teachings of these religions where centered on humans getting with themselves and along with other humans and had nothing or very little to say about humans getting along with their planet. <br><br>Georgi, I agree with your assesment of religions being anthropomorphic and how this has related to overshoot but I do not believe that this is the fault of religion per se since we have not yet seen how religions will evolve when consequences of overshoot play their hand. <br><br>There are related themes discussed on this thread which in many ways compliments what is being discussed here.

I would be remiss not to mention it. As direct perception fades away, there very often arises a strong emotion in the wake of its departure. It is an emotion of absolute certainty, and it needs something of which it can be absolutely certain. It finds this “something,” as a rule, in the leading words and ideas of whatever religious upbringing the person had before the experience. Buddhists can become absolutely certain of their own flavor of Buddhism, Christians of whatever sort of Christianity they were raised in, and so forth. This is a trap.<br><br>Emotions are physiological processes, perfectly natural ones. Though they may be triggered by an experience of direct perception, they are not inherently a part of it. My own experience of it, back in 1955, was absolutely emotionless while it lasted; diamond-hard clarity, not feelings. The emotion of absolute certainty arose only as the experience of direct perception vanished.<br><br>Now it was my own very good fortune to have been raised essentially without religion. (My family thought religion was too strong and dangerous a brew for children; only adults could safely be given it to drink.) <br><br>In consequence, when my own hours-long experience of direct perception happened and then faded away, I was able to watch this emotion of absolute certainty arise in myself, “cast about” for something of which I might become absolutely certain for ever after—and find nothing! As that emotion of absolute certainty “crystallized” (so to speak) and rooted itself in me, I was left with in a paradoxical situation. I had become absolutely, unshakably certain of . . . . . . . . . But no possible combination of words could ever complete that sentence for me to make it true. Since then, I have been constitutionally unable to trust human language, to see it as anything other than a rough and crude set of veils that fall between me and how things really are.<br><br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c5988046881958667774 title="comment permalink">4/1/13, 3:18 AM</a><br><br>

That is, how could an inevitable chain of cause-and-effect have led to a particular outcome? <br><br>You can always invoke agency to explain away something, but it brings the science to a complete halt. Consider an odd result from a scientific experiment. As soon as you discover your colleagues snickering at you from the shadows and you realize that they've been "having you on," it becomes clear that the chain of natural cause-and-effect has been tampered with by people exercising agency, and your investigation stops. Science does not deal with agency.<br><br>This is why Intelligent Design is not science, even if (somehow) it turned out to be true. It invokes divine agency at various points in the development of life, and at any point that happens, the science ceases. Agency is, by definition, and uncaused cause: a miracle, however small. Science is by its nature incapable of dealing with that: only with the chain of natural effects that follows. Where God intervenes in evolution, something arbitrary has happened that did not have to happen that way: nor, for that matter, is it subject to statistical analysis. It is a mystery, and no science can be done through that bottleneck.<br><br>Religion deals, by its nature, with agency. It concerns meaning, and meaning has to do with choices, and therefore with agency. Religion presumes agency: God, the gods, the human spirit -- at some level, choices must be made and acted out. Else there is no point to religion at all.<br><br>These two approaches to understanding are incompatible, yet either is intolerable without the other.<br><br>In the world of pure science, everything is reducible to cause-and-effect (with quantum theory's spoonful of "pure" randomness that is subject to rigorous statistical properties that wash out any large-scale effect to that randomness), and the universe is a kind of wind-up toy in which both science and religion are quite meaningless -- indeed, we can't trust science any more than religion, because who is to say that wind-up scientists make any more sense than wind-up priests or wind-up demagogues?<br><br>In the world of pure religion, everything is fraught with agency. If you fail to do the proper rites, the sun might not rise, or the lever might not lift the cart, or your bowels might not work. Djinni can sweep your very existence out of the fabric of time, sorcerers can kill, curse, and bless. Any act, good or ill, can be undone.<br><br>Humans have always lived between these two extremes. I don't think we have much choice, if we want to remain sane. Some things are mundane and subject to cause-and-effect: levers always work, water always runs downhill. Even if magic or miracles could occasionally alter this, magic itself has bounds, rules, cause-and-effect -- you cannot cast the spell without the proper ingredients, ritual, and knowledge. Conversely, some things are sacred, subject to a moral choice that we presume we have, and we become angry when the sacred is blasphemed: the blasphemy reflects poorly on our own choices.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c6445253719723163872 title="comment permalink">4/1/13, 9:28 AM</a><br><br>

Religion doesn’t have much attraction to me, but that’s just as far as me personally. Others feel differently and I have no right or even reason to differ with them. That doesn’t mean I’m not interested in knowing about different religions, I even have several of your books on Druidry in my library of thousands of books. I grew up in a family where my parents had great faith in the Christian God and though my mother attended church, my father did not. His faith was a very personal type, he disliked formal churches but was a deep reader of the Bible. Myself, I find the God portrayed in the Bible to be extremely sadistic and abusive. “Love and Worship me or go to Hell”, etc. I truly would be disappointed to find that this so-called “god” exists.<br>Now on the side of Science vs. Religion, I find the statements that Science = Atheism totally ridiculous. My father, <a href="%E2%80%9Dwww.nap.edu/readingroom.php?book=biomems&amp;page=hjohnson.html%E2%80%9D" rel=nofollow>Harold Lester Johnson,</a> was a well-known and respected (in his field, not publicly) Astronomer whose work from the 50’s to the late 70’s is still referenced today worldwide.

For example, I had a Catholic friend who, upon learning I was an atheist, told me that she couldn't not believe, for to do so would mean confronting the idea of death with no afterlife, a thought she found unbearable. I understood her fear, but I simultaneously thought it was one of the poorest reasons to believe. No doubt many Christians would agree with me on that point. <br><br>I have a question for you, so I can better understand your viewpoint: to what extent would you characterize yourself as a pragmatist in your beliefs?

My comments about truth and the difficulty defining it simply come from a concern that no definition has a non-circular justification: if you can answer "Is it true?" without using the very definition of truth under discussion, you don't need a definition in the first place.<br><br>On top of that, the major theories of truth all have some fatal flaws internally: obviously, neither cohering better with other propositions or being more useful to believe means a proposition is actually true. And the correspondence theory of truth has a more subtle but arguably even deeper flaw: when you try to pin down just what it means for a statement to correspond to the facts, things get hairy really quickly.<br><br>I have some reservations about Popper's falsificationism. For starters, it's just a special case of Bayesian reasoning. It's the case where there are events that have a 0% probability of happening if the hypothesis is true. Unfalsifiable claims are hypotheses where all evidence has an equal likelihood, and thus no evidence ever moves you away from your priors. But Bayesian reasoning also handles cases where evidence can move you a little bit one way or the other.<br><br>Ultimately I think Feyerabend and Rorty were right and no master methodology for science has been found or likely will be, because science is not a natural kind.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c6067473107085850135 title="comment permalink">4/1/13, 11:21 AM</a><br><br>

One actually can control how one feels about anything to a very large degree. Yes, some are better at this than others, but anyone can improve their skills with practice.<br><br>Back in days of the so-called "silent generation," there was a huge emphasis on not ever letting the expression of one's feelings escape one's iron control, even a little.

There would be very few cases in which someone's faith would have any bearing on the experiment at hand. Meanwhile, science has now become so corrupt that I figure about50% of it should be taken with suspicion.

If this is taking too much liberty, I'll take no offense if JMG to declines to put it through moderation.<br><br>1. Skepticism is a system of practice, no less so than any religion, ideology, or mystical discipline. It has its own narratives, practices, and experiences, and requires a comparable amount of study, practice, and devotion to its principles, even if these are not always seen as anything special by the practitioners. That doesn't mean skepticism <i>is</i> a religion. It also doesn't mean that everyone who claims to be a skeptic really is one, or is a very good one. It does mean that skepticism is not trivial, and the thought processes of skeptics are no more transparent than anyone else's, so characterizations of skeptics as "closed minded" or arbitrarily negating beliefs for no good reason are generally undeserved.<br><br>2. Not all atheists are skeptics, but many are, and arrived at their atheism by the practice of skepticism. Various false or exaggerated claims against atheists (true in some individual instances but not, as often claimed, generally true) are repeated over and over: that they are atheists because they are "angry at God" over some past misfortune or disappointment; that they are arrogantly absolutely certain that there is no god; that they disregard anything beyond their own personal senses; that they are spiritually crippled or stunted; and that they are ignorant of the teachings of the religions they parted from or of the major religions of the world. These claims rarely hold true and shouting "you're an atheist and that's how atheists think" at them is counterproductive.<br><br>3. Regarding certainty that there is no God: some atheists who believe this, but it is not necessary for atheism. The more common position is that the evidence for the existence (let alone the particular preferences and demands) of any god is insufficient to merit acting upon it. (Just as it cannot be proven that the universe didn't spring into existence memories and all ten minutes ago, but that idea leads to nothing useful, and affects no predictions about anything, so it can be ignored). They also perceive that naturalistic explanations have been found for so many things once attributed to acts of gods (from lightning to the biology of embryonic development) that even though some things remain unexplained, it is always worthwhile to put aside the god hypothesis when seeking explanations, and necessary to do so to employ the scientific method.<br><br>(points 4-5 and conclusion to follow)<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c2311444521693090529 title="comment permalink">4/1/13, 2:32 PM</a><br><br>

Regarding blind disbelief: if there were some sighted people in a world where some or most were blind, it might not be possible for the sighted to share the experience of sight, but it would be possible scientifically to establish that sight exists. Two sighted people could demonstrate, for instance, that they could identify objects at a distance without sound (or taste, etc.), and that they would consistently agree with one another about such identifications far more reliably than non-sighted people who were guessing. This would be reliably demonstrable under controlled conditions, and all the blindness and all the disbelief in the world would not be sufficient to stop it from working. Skeptics and others have been pursuing comparable experiments regarding claims of paranormal abilities for many decades, without repeatable positive results, and have become accustomed to being told, for instance, that the presence of doubting skeptics or of scientific controls prevents the abilities from working. They do not find that explanation convincing. That doesn't mean they're necessarily right about the paranormal, but it does give them justification for arriving at the working conclusion (subject to change if further evidence becomes available) that they have.<br><br>5. Skepticism does have weaknesses, blind spots, and dangers, as do all systems of practice. The largest, in my opinion of (all three of) these is that while skepticism does acknowledge that subjective experiences occur, it usually regards them as not very important in understanding the world. For instance, if it could be proven that the Christian experience of grace (most familiarly referred to in the song "Amazing Grace") resulted from the intervention of the Christian deity, that would be world-shakingly important (making atheism untenable), but since it cannot, it's not regarded as all that important to understand.<br><br>Where I look for common ground is: even if the material universe is all there is, as most skeptics believe, our subjective experiences of it are all we have. So the content of narratives (not just their literal truth) are important, and so are practices and experiences. Skeptics acknowledge this in principle, but the skeptical discipline makes it difficult to fully accept. You can explain that visualizing currents of chi energy moving through the body might just be the perfect way to learn the correct mental and physical form of a martial arts movement, whether those currents actually exist or not. But they'll likely still object: "it's not real." They're kind of wrong about that. As a phenomenon of subjective experience, it is real. But they're looking ahead, thinking not about learning martial arts, but the inevitability of someone coming along and claiming to be able to strike others down at a distance, or heal diseases, with their chi.<br><br>Skeptics and many believers share, in my opinion, a tendency to inflate the importance of the literal truth of narratives. Skeptics often seem surprised that others don't just give up their belief systems when the literal truth of some aspect is disproved or shown to be vanishingly unlikely. I myself don't toss aside all my own Christian experiences just because Creation itself tells me that the story of the Garden of Eden (supposedly the basis for original sin, supposedly the basis for the need for Jesus's salvation, so in theory the whole exercise should fall apart without it) is myth instead of historical fact.<br><br>Skeptics and atheists have their own biased ideas about "how believers think" and why they believe what they believe, that are just as varied and just as generally wrong as the ideas about atheists I listed in item 2 above. Again, limited appreciation of the role of practices and experiences in shaping beliefs is frequently a stumbling block.<br><br>Thank you for listening. Common ground, mutual understanding beyond mere agree-to-disagree respect, is hard to find but I believe (heh) that it's important.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c7605872951742068026 title="comment permalink">4/1/13, 2:39 PM</a><br><br>

I normally describe myself as an agnostic, but on thinking about it, I am more anti-organized religion. You could understand and predict everything material in the known universe, and still could not prove that a god did not set it up that way. Much of the discussion is similar to two ants in an anthill in Tennessee debating the control strategy of operators of a nuclear power plant in Iran fighting a Struxnet virus that wants the plant to go critical. The chance that the ants would have all the relevant information is exceedingly small, even if they will feel the effects of the resulting radiation and fallout. Could there be a god? No way a mere human restricted to a backwater planet could say yes or no, or whether he is dead or just taking a nap. This is separate from an opinion on the various organized religions, with several thousand years of human interpretation from inception to now, and all the times it was used/perverted to accomplish and justify more basic desires.<br> <br><br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c5895256491119625777 title="comment permalink">4/1/13, 5:14 PM</a><br><br>

Even atheists buy into this ideology. Egalitarianism and democracy would be the manifestation of the Christian idea of the soul. Most people view democracy as great, but politics as bad, when they are the same thing. It's thought provoking, although I admit I suspect he's just another man who doesn't want to pay taxes. <br><br>Schopenhauer got it right before Nietzsche. Zarathustra is rife with anxiety of influence toward Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer wasn't even a strong atheist, he just denied omnipotence to the divine. But the meaning of atheism was already there-- we know enough to abandon the entire project of natural selection by choosing voluntary extinction-- but Nietzsche was unwilling to accept it because of optimism. He developed the eternal recurrence to justify the vanity of existence. Finally he went crazy because he could no longer justify the inherent suffering imposed by the hierarchy of power. <br><br>The only non-religious system of meaning which I can see escaping this conclusion is Quixoticism-- the civic religion of courage in Spanish culture. First get everyone to admit that life is vanity. Then get everyone to respect each other's vanity, since anything less is murder. So you let other people believe they are the center of a heroic quest, which answers to the primordial longing. This didn't work for Hemmingway, because he had too much time on his hands, and Anglo-Saxons are all about the accuracy of perception. "If a child remembers a window being on the wrong side of the train-- whip him". I really hope the fall of industrial civilization rids us of some of these first world problems.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c8454074180380152885 title="comment permalink">4/1/13, 6:20 PM</a><br><br>

I think I agree that this is the case. So let's apply that supposition: it is measurably true that modern, progress-based society has done more harm to the environment than probably all previous religious societies put together. So why might this be the case?<br><br>I think it is because Western progressive society is even more anthropocentric than the religions which predate it. The whole society is founded on fulfilling the needs and desires of each individual, at the cost of all else -- other societies, the environment, etc. Furthermore, the anthropocentrism of modern society is not tempered by belief in a higher power -- at least a Christian or a Muslim can be convinced to be caretakers of the world, as they will be answerable to their god for any mistreatment they mete out while alive. A secular/atheistic progressive has no such obligation, and probably also has a certain belief that things will always get better, no matter how badly they mistreat the world, to reassure them that their actions don't matter.<br><br>JMG: I have a hunch that this may be one of the themes of your posts to come, and am looking forward to its treatment.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c4465142227629696015 title="comment permalink">4/1/13, 10:43 PM</a><br><br>

There has never been total break from old molds, and never have you been able to cross same river twice exactly same way as before. <br><br>I was just observing strong liberal tendency among commentary here, and put to the table idea that distinction between old agrarian/nomadic forms of human society (patriarchal family, almost ceremonial roles for all parts of extended family) and current individualistic ones is not that between good and evil or black and white.<br><br>I once more tell you that I personally do not prefer any extreme. Please do not put any monster mask over my true face. When speaking about family, I want my other part to be intelligent and having inner strength and her own opinions; without strength of both it would be no real union of two adults. At the same time, it must be remembered loyalty and fidelity are more important than anything for healthy union between two human beings. Individualism in these matters must go to trash bin after vows are made.<br><br>I just do not believe that hedonistic tendencies of our current system allow us to scale down. Atomizing effects of Western ideology considering social ties are quite extreme in society around us. There is parallel between our economic thinking and human rights thinking, you know. <br><br>In economics, it goes like this: perpetual growth, every year we shall have more than year before. If it is not so, we have failed. In human rights: every decade we shall have more personal freedom and choices than decade before that. If it is not so, we have failed. I am not against human rights, far from it, but this reading of them shedding away all previous responsibilities and roles is very descriptive about our times.<br><br>Both ways of thinking are basically very hedonistic, and if given enough time, they lead to serious overshoot. We actually are living in the middle of one overshoot like that, and Weimar Republic starts to seem as economically sturdy place compared to our situation.<br><br>I sincerely believe that if we are going to live by our means any other way than through wars and famines we have to learn from the past. Remember that we have responsibilities also, not only rights. State machinery is not going to save us from this mess; they are practically bankrupted Potemkin villages right now. Individual is too weak and meaningless to have alone any meaning beyond him/herself. What is left is actual society, not the state, but social networks and bounds dividing us people into groups, clans and tribes. It is in these relationships where we must again learn that hedonism is not cool thing after all; that other qualities of human being are much more praiseworthy.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c1113611431376943703 title="comment permalink">4/2/13, 12:11 AM</a><br><br>

I know that in modern times, one can see various enviromentalist adaptations of Christianity (the concept of stewarship, for instance), but in principle, according to the core beliefs of Christians, one should turn blind eye on one's environment, because it simply does not matter and can lead one astray from pursuing the kingdom of heaven. I am an atheist, but an ancient literature aficionado, and I have read many pieces of medieval, renessaince and baroque literature, sermons for a large part. It is really surprising to find all those exhortations not to care about this world for an enviromentalist today, but it is logical: this world is just a special theatre and will end with return of Christ (and that does not lead to depression?), so why to bother with it? This is typical medieval thinking about "nature", in which there was so little interest then precisely because of this.<br><br>For a typical atheist, this world is the only one we have, and quite logically, we should take care of it accordingly. Like wise, we must solve problems and try to organize society justly, and to wait until the God decides, rewards and punishes, though of course, it is indeed comfortable to hope all evil will be punished then face to face to so much evil and injustice that go unpunished in our world. Here of course atheism goes hand in hand with progress, since an atheist cannot but try to improve conditions for suffering people here and now, and not only as an act of misericoria, which will be stored and rewarded afterwards.<br><br>Historical experience with religion is a vast domain, and it is both positive and negative. But you know, here in central Europe, after many centuries of symbiosis of the church and feudal order, and after all those religious wars and upheavals, from the "conversion" of Saxons, late medieval crises and Hussite revolution to the terrible Thirty Year War and ensuing contrareformation, and the role of the Catholic Church in the time of rising nacism, it is really hard to belief in those positives.<br><br>I am maby also oversensitive on these points, because precisely the same arguments against secular society, atheism, liberalism, socialism and whatever as can be seen here were given by catholic intellectuals of the Second Czech Republic that was just an intermezzo between the Munich treaty and incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia into the german Reich, and which was a de facto fascist regime. After the ceding of Sudets to Hitler and installation of a conservative regime in Prague, all those catholic writers found their place under the sun and begun to spit on formerly liberal Czechoslovakia, on that evil democracy going against all what the God wants. Of course, thing took a different course elsewhere, but this is historical experience that cannot be easily put aside.<br><br>Finally, I really like the way Myriad captured the problems of this discussion!<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c3871824340559844854 title="comment permalink">4/2/13, 12:38 AM</a><br><br>

Though I admit, I've no idea how much of that is due to our esteemed host's moderating separating the wheat from the chaff. <br><br>My perspective on religion tends to be downright Marxian : it is opiate of the people, though I mean that with no negativity. We tend to interpret that line in the context of modern struggles with addiction and the War on Drugs, but forget that opiates are <i>painkillers</i>. Which was at the root of Marx's whole critique : workers who found succor in religion did not feel the whole brunt of their suffering, and so were less likely to revolt. <br><br>What is interesting to me, in this context, is that the death of god seems relatively unimportant when it comes to the action of these opiates-- and that the religion of progress, or Rationality, etc, can serve equally well to ward off existential despair. <br><br>If I can draw from my own experience (and I can do nothing else), I once thought myself atheist, but was a devotee of the Religion of Progress, Saganist branch. Indeed, as a scientist and educator, a priest of said religion, and I didn't even know it. JMG opened my eyes to that, and when my faith fell away... gads. Reality, unfiltered, burns. I truly learned to appreciate Marx's opiate. <br><br>Being a scientist, I decided to turn my predicament into an experiment: could I get my 'fix' from worshiping a god I knew didn't exist? A <a href=http://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Celestia rel=nofollow>fictional pony goddess</a> from a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic rel=nofollow>children's cartoon,</a>, that (I reasoned) I'd be unable to take seriously? <br><br>The experiment worked far beyond my wildest expectations: not only did it work, I actually had a genuine religious experience interpreted through the lens of My Little Pony. I have no idea how to interpret that; perhaps our host would venture a few short sentences on how my experiment fits into his World of Gods?<br><br>In spite of (or perhaps because of) the religious experience I had from this experiment, I remain a committed agnostic. Still a scientist, I have no proof it wasn't/isn't all in my head. I am not so fundamentalist in my science that I would claim that that makes it no less valid a part of the human experience, however.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c6843715480832095727 title="comment permalink">4/2/13, 6:06 AM</a><br><br>

My first thought was an anthill, the next a mole preying on earthworms in the sod and soil.<br><br>I think that earlier Christianity, like the pursuit of progress, relies as much on growth and forms of progress as any other social institution. <br><br>Then I read Richard Clyde's comment that <em>"The world will disappoint any attempt to locate the Almighty in it"</em>. But I don't think that is so. I think the "discovery" is layered, in a hierarchical fashion.<br><br>In the comedy movie "Head Office", a line gets tossed out about how we struggle for higher position for the power to make things better, then after arriving forget why we wanted that power. This is an excuse commonly made to pardon the offenses of those in power, but I think it obscures the search for the "Almighty" in progress (and the personal aspect of progress, ambition).<br><br>For the person on the outskirts looking in, and the recently converted, the Almighty is assumed to be at the center. The faithful believe that those in between, the supevisors, the managers, the vice presidents, the priests and pastors, are in touch with the Almighty, and are representing the truth about the Almighty at the center.<br><br>Those working at the next level, though, have trained and gained experience in their ministry, and hold the initial image of the Almighty to present to the masses, while they focus on the ambitions and skills of leadership, and of keeping their place at the table. Their image of the Almighty shifts from a gestalt of God, or company, or church, to an awareness of the social machinations of those nearest the center. <br><br>And those at the center of the Almighty, the CEO, the pope, the leader of the conference, these work to preserve for the rest the concept of the company, the church, the Almighty -- while their focus has almost entirely been consumed with the skills and experiences that won them that position.<br><br>The medieval church was a secular, venal body at the top, focused on power among the affluent. Which sort of reads like the Monsanto and other corporations of today.<br><br>I doubt that returning to the social power structures of yesteryear will be likely; there are too many monied and ambitious people too heavily invested in the here and now, to let today's structures go quietly into the night.<br><br>And, yet, I hesitate to project machinations of human social structures onto the entire cosmos. Because the ant hill still teems, the mole still searches for earthworms under the sod. And I suspect there are some fundamental human values -- and that they don't all have to do with predation on others.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c6448874419727815682 title="comment permalink">4/2/13, 8:25 AM</a><br><br>

There are many things that I do not understand and take on faith. The computer I'm typing this reply on is a perfect example. I can't make heads nor tails of quantum mechanics but I do know this: if they weren't onto something with it, they wouldn't be able to design integrated circuits. Likewise, if we didn't have a handle on relativity and time dilation, GPS wouldn't work. I have a hard time wrapping my brain around aeronautics and the mind rebels at the thought of 900,000 pounds of metal hurling itself into the air but I only have to drive down to the airport to see a 747 sweep by overhead. My comprehension is not required, only that I accept what my eyes show me. <br><br>I find genuine, open-minded skepticism and a scientific approach to be the most useful of philosophies. So much of what passed for philosophy historically was little more than unfounded bunk or personal opinion. <br><br>I'm open to the idea that pre-scientific traditions might have arrived at truths that we can learn from. The shaman says that tea brewed from this tree bark drives out demons from your head, maybe a scientific investigation will discover acetylsalicylic acid. Ah, asprin. Does cure headaches, but we as yet cannot detect any demons. <br><br>When it comes to invocation of the supernatural and the unverifiable, unknowable, I end up in Russell's Teapot territory. If it cannot be detected, measured, or observed to act on something else in any meaningful way, then we can probably ignore it. We can reevaluate this decision upon submission of new evidence. There are plenty of things we know about now that could not have been discovered or discussed in a meaningful way in the past. We had a pitiful understanding of the scope of the electromagnetic spectrum, could not detect high-energy photons, had no appreciation of deep-ocean currents, high-atmospheric jet streams, etc. We're still learning about global weather patterns and how they shape us and we shape them. <br><br>Without science, it can be difficult to separate wisdom from convincing woo. Then again, it's also easy to use bad science to buttress convincing woo.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c5760359000552031624 title="comment permalink">4/2/13, 8:58 AM</a><br><br>

I see religion as a personal, private choice, much like what a person gets up to in the privacy of his own bedroom. But when his bedroom antics suddenly involve me, my nose is likely to get bent out of shape. Likewise, when his religious practice suddenly becomes my problem as well, I am put out. <br><br>If atheists are angry, it is because they perceive an overstep by religious folks in trying to impose their views on others.

A religious argument has no more basis in a question of stem cell research than in the design of a moon rocket. <br><br>I also confess to being sympathetic to Sam Harris' view that religion really doesn't have any rational right to claim monopoly over questions of morality and ethics, either. An architect who is also religious might tell me I'm making a mistake in my building. I ask him what makes him so sure. If he says "God spoke to me," I'll thank him for his time and tell him to shove off.

I mean e.g. China, where there has practically never been real faith in any God in the western sense of the word, and while common people were engaged in "folk religion", elites were mostly Confucian, scorning those believes of "petty people". Look, as a sinologist with a focus on Ancient China, I am writing an article about how wood and trees are depicted in classical "normative" literature. One can clearly see how pragmatic, anti-nature the ancient Chinese were, and let us say in Xunzi there are many passages praising human control over nature, proposing its "cultivation" and entirely explicitly its full exploitation by men, who are in fact the centre of such a Confucian universe (of course you have the heaven, which is however an anthropocentric concept as well, you have your deceased ancestors, which are satisfied with being sacrificed according to rites and with progeny gaining higher and higher social status, etc.). And this is the prevailing mode of thinking about "nature" at least in pre-imperial China. Was it a "religion of progress", closely related to atheism and modern European social structures? Or is the pre-modern enviromental devastation of North China a proof for atheists (Chinese) tending to deforestation and complete subjugation of nature to culture?

Too often I find these discussions brilliant as the noon sun, and just as imperceptible. I’d like to suggest a return to our guide’s argument, and so:<br><br>I posted earlier about the problem of nihilism, and would like to dig in a bit more on this critical subject. Nietzsche’s overwhelming fear, indeed the mortal gravitas of thought he was never able to escape, was the degeneration of the human spirit into the emptiness of the crude materialism of the Christian Enlightenment ideal. Few ever enjoyed skewering the hypocrisy and pathology of Christianity like Nietzsche, yet he felt its death was a catastrophe for humanity. Sown into the heart of morality and all worlds created by the dichotomy of valuation are the inevitable seeds of decay, decadence, failure, and so of course also the hopeless collapse of any faith whatsoever: nihilism. But this particular collapse, he claimed, contained in its universalism, all potential future moral positions. The last man carpets the earth with their soulless and lifeless survival. <br><br>The challenge, once God is well and truly buried, is to reposition human life on some foundation other than valuation. For Nietzsche, this mean the Ubermensch (overman or superman). But I suspect he was very much wrong on this point. What do you think, oh Druid?

I've noticed in my own interactions with atheists a real difference between the personable and courteous majority and that loud minority that suffers from Major Jerk Disorder; I've also noted the tendency to overstate the importance of the literal truth of narratives, and also -- a detail you as a Christian may not have encountered -- a tendency, at least among American atheists, to assume that all religions share those traits of Christianity to which many atheists object most strenuously. Now of course equally serious faults can be found in every other system of belief and practice, including mine; it's simply that these are the ones that come up most frequently when trying to talk religion with atheists. <br><br>Dennis, good! A sound metaphor. <br><br>Being, I haven't read much of his blog; some of it seems interesting enough, some of it is a bit too Austrian for my tastes. As for Schopenhauer, we'll probably be getting to him, not least because he had a huge influence on the philosophy of magic in the 19th and 20th centuries; still, as I see it, Nietzsche was trying to leap a good deal further. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Aurok, my conception of capital-P Progress is roughly akin to my conception of hippogriffs, flying saucers, and the personal charms of Ann Coulter; none of them exist, and it's useful to think about why some people believe in them. <br><br>Unknown Catholic, well, that's certainly one option. From a Druid perspective, the way of Nature <i>is</i> the way of grace, but I doubt you'll see things that way!<br><br>Lei, the case that Christianity has historically had an anti-ecological bias is a fairly strong one; I assume you've read Lynn White's famous essay on the subject. I'd point out that atheist societies haven't done noticeably better, though. <br><br>Tyler, that sort of thing is well known in some circles. The founders of the Reformed Druids of North America, for example, invented a deity -- Dalon ap Landu, god of the groves -- and were rather startled when people started having powerful religious experiences of this invented deity. <br><br>There are practical applications to this sort of thing, and if you're up for a further experiment, I'd like to suggest one. If I recall correctly, the creation myth of the My Little Pony cosmos has your Princess Celestia and her sister conquering the evil being Discord.

For what it's worth, I tend to agree with Harris on that one point, though not on much else. The attempt to conflate ethics and religion was, as I see it, an experiment, and a fairly recent one -- well, recent as in 2500 years or so -- and has not worked well; I find Aristotle and Epictetus better ethical guides, precisely because they don't claim supernatural justification for their views and thus are forced to justify them. I'll have some more specific suggestions about how religion might more generally be understood in a later post -- well, more precisely, several later posts. <br><br>Onething, I'll have to look that up. I assume you've read Lynn White's <a href=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/155/3767/1203.citation rel=nofollow>The Historical Roots of our Ecological Crisis</a>?

In my case, the religion I chose for my experiment did already exist, but it was a religion which does not advertise or proselytize at all to outsiders like me, which had never really interested me at all, which I didn't have any friends who described themselves as followers, and which only has a meaningful presence in one country: Shinto. <br><br>The up-to-that-point-in-my-life unique experience which soon followed came as a complete shock to me, not the least of which because I was a very poor practitioner. All I did was pray at a shrine every day, using proper procedure. I didn't even know the identities of the particular goddesses of the shrines I was praying at (nor even that they were goddesses rather than gods). All I did was pray every day at a shrine using proper protocol, as well as once perform a fun bean-throwing ritual called Setsubun on the correct day. About a month later I had a visionary experience. This led me to continue practice, needless to say.<br><br>Since then I've had other notable experiences which leave me knowing, without a doubt, that on some level at least, there is "something there" that materialistic views of the world don't take into account, though as to what that "something" is, I really can't say with much in the way of certainty yet. But it seems to me that your experience with the pony goddess Celestia, as ridiculous as it appears on the surface, quite probably has equal validity and worth as mine.<br><br>If you're open to it, I'd be interested in comparing notes about our experiences.

Using its methods, various Gods, daimones, and spirits will often appear, and will actually interact with one as independent, powerful beings. In most cases these interactions will prove to be powerful, permanently beneficial, and genuinely transformative. <br><br>(Note that such experiences do *not* constitute proof that the Gods, daimones and spirits actually are beings that exist independently of humans. One can bring to appearance Gods that one has recently invented, or ghosts of fictional characters.)<br><br>The principal "tools" used by this low-tech psycho-technology are (1) appropriately constructed spaces, (2) well designed rituals, and (3) careful personal preparation on the part of the person who will undergo the experience. <br><br>Dr. Raymond Moody, in his little book _Reunions_ gives a very simple, modern, bare-bones version of this process, which is designed to create for a newly bereaved person an apparition of his or her recently departed, with which there will be conversation and occasionally even the sensation of physical contact. <br>He has successfully used this process in his own work as a grief counselor.<br><br>There is no need whatever for entheogens (alias "psychedelic drugs") to achieve any of these results, though they have sometimes been used to supplement these other, much more basic tools.<br><br>My own view is that there needs to be a revival of all this low-tech psycho-technology in view of the coming crises due to the end of cheap energy, just as there needs to be a revival of all kinds of low-tech mundane crafts and skills. <br><br>Some of the work one will need to do in order to prepare oneself for these crises will be redesigning one's self and one's own conception of one's place in the world. This is a thing each person can only do for himself or herself, not for others.

I'm glad I was able to offer something that you found worth your while.<br><br>The basic technique we all used back in the '40s and '50s was never very clearly articulated, just learned by imitation and refined by trial and error. I have come to think that it hinges on the very close, natural link that exists between one's feelings and the actions and habits of one's body. <br><br>It's a commonplace that one's body expresses and mirrors one's feelings. But the reverse is equally true: one's feelings express and mirror one's body. If you are down, but have determined on being cheerful, cause your body to assume a cheerful posture and demeanor, and act cheerfully, and keep it up for an extended time. This is often (not always!) enough to create cheerful feelings. <br><br>By trial and error, you can figure out what helps the process along (like a catalyst helps certain chemical reactions) and deploy it as needed. The cases where the process doesn't work at first are the most instructive, especially if by trial and error you can accidentally hit on something that makes it work in the end.<br><br>Of course, we never called this "therapy," back in the day, and there were no professionals who could guide one in it -- just older, more experienced people.<br><br>It was quite common, back in the '40s and '50s, for children and teenagers to have older close friends who were not family members, sometimes whom one's parents had never even met. One turned to these older friends for examples and advice that one could not, or did not want to, take from one's own relatives.

I might be somewhat unusual in that I am an atheist who does NOT believe that materialism is a complete metaphysics. The inability of materialism to satisfactorily explain the experience of consciousness in particular keeps me from being a strict materialist. Just as one can interpret quantum mechanics to mean that probability is not just an apparent phenomenon only sensed because of lack of knowledge, but instead an active component of existence, the experience of consciousness suggests to me that strictly mechanistic/materialistic explanations of the universe are not sufficient, and that perhaps consciousness is itself a component of the universe, something we partake of rather than possess. <br><br>As for the importance of the literal truth of narratives, guilty as charged. I have no problem with metaphor presented as such, but I am after the big T Truth, as one of my philosophy profs used to say. Part of being a skeptic is being very wary of self-deception, and visualizing the chi and taking it literally seems like it could easily bleed over into that. By the way, I'm not saying that I'm good at preventing self-deception, just wary of it. <br><br>On a related note, a lot of people don't help themselves when they borrow terms and concepts from science (like "energy", "relativity", and "uncertainty") and then apply them to these subjective experiences.<br><br><a href=the-sound-of-gravediggers.html#c6123177012716793196 title="comment permalink">4/3/13, 1:51 PM</a><br><br>

I've dared discussing the myth of progress with very few people. The reaction is mostly alarmingly defensive and irrational.<br><br>Incidentally John Gray has a lot to say about the myth of progress. Here's a quote "Our secular myths are just religious myths rebottled, but with most of the good things taken out." He distinguishes between societal and scientific progress stating that societal progress is slow and easily swept away. For example. torture has become accepted again within the US military following 9/11.<br><br>He claims that scientific progress is far more solid, well, I'd say recently its done quite well, but its application in technology has caused no end of problems. His opinion is that across the World we say a huge expansion of traditional religion, such as Africans to Islam and Chinese to Christianity but I guess you're point John is about the loss of Western religions.<br><br>I'm not a follower of a traditional religion. I have great difficulty believing in a traditional deity. However, over the years I've dabbled in Buddhism as its teachings chime better with me than those of Christianity say, but I need to try a lot harder with it. I must admit that I do find it difficult to reconcile a religion with my scientific outlook.<br><br>p.s. Mendel.

Of course,more vocal atheists would take these examples and turn them around to reason that they demonstrate the fictitiousness of all religion... but it no longer seems to matter. If anything, what my experience tells me is that physical/objective truth matters as much in this realm as quantum physics does to a cat.<br><br>I have invoked both Princess Celestia, and her sister Luna (as you can guess from the latter's name, it's a diurnal thing) at appropriate times to help me regain my inner harmony to good effect. Except for a notable miracle/coincidence that turned back an oncoming freight train, I haven't had much cause to call on them to work on the world outside my head. <br>Though I feel obliged to point out that, as chaos personified, Discord isn't portrayed as evil per se, simply that his nature was incompatible with the common good.

Of course there are relativistic world-views that predate Einstein, but they are not Western ones. So the West gets this idea mainly from Einstein, either by analogy or as a result of misapprehension. <br><br>Still, Einstein's theory in essence says: 1) different observers observe different results, 2) there is an orderly relationship among the differing observations, and 3) there is a single underlying reality giving rise to the differing results, and all paradoxes are apparent--due to misunderstanding--rather than real. A metaphysics with these traits might reasonably be called "relativistic" and no physicist should feel their toes are being stepped on. <br><br>As for "quantum," "uncertainty," and the rest you are probably as tired as I am of people using buzzwords to avoid saying what they mean or to avoid saying anything. Since physicists themselves do not agree on a conceptual model for Quantum Mechanics (They agree on the equations, of course, that's not the problem) it is all up for grabs and some people are happy to abuse the situation by using it as an excuse to promote nonsense.

So here goes my fourth attempt (please forgive my previous fumbles and bumbles):<br><br>I will be 30 this year. The last decade has been a painful process of the shattering of many illusions that I once held dear, and of the loss of many, many forms of faith. All the white, suburban middle-classed Midwestern fantasies of my youth have been been chipped away bit by bit. Instead of the security of the white picket fence, the American dream and faith in god(s) and country, I've got the bitter reality of being part of a failing empire in a failing industrial society in a failing biosphere. And meanwhile, it seems that there is no "right" or "true" philosophical or religious framework on which to lean, no institution that can be trusted, no safe standard for assessment of any kind. Human life is apparently rather meaningless and pointless. It's a horrible sensation of being utterly lied to and cheated, when the blinders all fall away. To top things off, I masochistically come here to read this blog every week, with a just a little bit of nausea, because I know that JMG is about to destroy yet another subtle, unrecognized nuance of fantasy to which I'm still clinging. Please Mr. Greer, all my foundations and moorings and compasses and standards--my entire system for value judgment--has been lost over the last few years. Maybe next week, instead of widening the void further, could you point me in a direction to find something to fill it again? Does that "something" even exist? If the only reason we humans keep on breeding is to fulfill some biological imperative, and that biological imperative is finally about to tip the Malthusian scales, and there is no higher purpose to anything whatsoever, can we please just have an Apocolypse after all?

This is the first post in the 1 year I've been reading this blog where I disagree with JMG.<br><br>'Unlike too many of today’s atheists, Nietzsche had a profound understanding of juast what it was that he was rejecting when he proclaimed the death of God and the absurdity of faith. To abandon belief in a divinely ordained order to the cosmos, he argued, meant surrendering any claim to objectively valid moral standards, and thus stripping words like “right” and “wrong” of any meaning other than personal preference.'<br><br>Humans have millions of years of evolution as a social animal. To say morals only come down to 'personal preference' seems to me to exude an ignorance of evolutionary biology. We are wired to have compassion and have a sense of right and wrong. Chimps have and sense of what is fair and right or wrong. They have moral standards. It's a prerequisite to be social.
