<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the wry amusements to be had from writing a blog that routinely contradicts the conventional wisdom of our time is the way that defenders of that same conventional wisdom tend to react.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You might think that those who are repeating what most people believe would take advantage of that fact, and present themselves as the voice of the majority, speaking for the collective consensus of our time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the nearly seven years since I started this blog, though, the number of times that’s happened can be counted neatly on the fingers of one foot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead, those who rehash the conventional wisdom of our day inevitably like to portray themselves as innovative thinkers bursting with ideas that nobody has ever thought before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s those whose views most closely ape fashionable clich<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>é</span>s culled from pop culture and the mass media, in fact, who are most likely to try to strike a pose of heroic originality, just as it’s those rare thinkers who stray from today’s popular orthodoxies who most reliably get accused of being rigid, dogmatic and closed-minded. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Quite often, for instance, I field flurries of emails and comments on my blog insisting that I really ought to consider the new and radical idea that technology can overcome the limits to growth. The latest occasion for this curious claim is a new book titled <i>Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think</i> by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler, which is currently benefiting from a well-funded publicity campaign featuring lavish praise from the likes of Richard Branson and Bill Gates. I haven’t read it; doubtless I’ll do so once the public library here in Cumberland gets a copy, if only to find out if the book can possibly be as full of meretricious twaddle as it looks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What interests me, though, is that by and large, the people who have emailed me recently invoking the book as proof that I’m wrong about the future admit that they haven’t read it either. The mere fact that somebody has insisted in print that we’re going to get a shiny high-tech future of limitless abundance seems to be enough to convince them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That the same claim has been breathlessly retailed in print for the better part of three centuries, as of course it has, seems never to enter their minds, and when I point this out, the response is the online equivalent of a you-kicked-my-puppy look and an insistence that I ought to be more open-minded to their supposedly new ideas. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In reality, if course, it’s hard to think of any clich<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"'>é in today’s pop culture</span> more trite and hackneyed than the notion that technology always trumps resource limits. That shopworn Victorian trope very nearly defines the conventional wisdom of our age. The evidence doesn’t support such claims, for reasons I’ve discussed on this blog many times already, and claims about the future that take that notion as gospel have already proven problematic, to use no harsher word. Yet it’s as certain as anything can be that when the hullabaloo over this latest book dies down, and some new book comes out rehashing the same weary clich<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>é</span>, I’ll field yet another round of enthusiastic emails from people who insist that it’s saying something new and exciting that I must never have heard before. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Glance over at the other side of the conventional wisdom and you can see the same process at work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The flurries of emails and comments I get pushing the vision of a bright new future are equalled, and more than equalled, by the flurries I get insisting that I obviously haven’t heard about the exciting new notion that something or other is about to squash industrial civilization like a bug. It’s all the funnier in that these flurries continued apace during the year I spent running the End Of The World Of The Week Club, retelling the story of some failed apocalyptic prediction of the past with every single weekly post. When I point out that the people who make such claims are rehashing the oldest and most consistently mistaken of all historical clich<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-font-family: Tahoma'>é</span>s, in turn, I can count on fielding another flurry of angry rhetoric insisting that I need to be more open-minded about their allegedly innovative ideas.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Amusing as all this is, it’s anything but unexpected. Every human society draws a boundary between<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>those ideas that are acceptable and those that are beyond the pale, and modern industrial civilization is no exception to this rule; it’s simply that modern industrial civilization also likes to preen itself on its supposed openness to novel ideas. The habit of pretending that repeated rehashes of the conventional wisdom are always new and innovative, no matter how many times the same things have been repeated down through the years, and insisting that ideas that challenge the conventional wisdom aren’t new and innovative, even when they are, is as good a way as any to duck the potential conflicts between these two emotionally powerful cultural themes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Appealing as though such habits might be—and they certainly help spare people the hard work of coming up with ideas that are genuinely original—they have at least one serious drawback.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the conventional wisdom is leading straight toward disaster, and only a radically different way of looking at the world offers any hope of escaping a messy fate, a radically different way of looking at the world is exactly what you won’t get, because everybody thinks that the only way to get a radically different way of looking at the world is to keep on regurgitating the conventional wisdom that’s leading toward disaster in the first place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s much as though people trapped in a burning building went around writing FIRE EXIT in bright red letters on every door that led straight back into the flames. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
With these points in mind, I’d like to talk a bit about the latest attempt to rehash the conventional wisdom under the guise of rejecting it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the last six weeks or so, I’ve fielded emails and comments from many sources insisting that peak oil has been disproved conclusively by the recent fracking phenomenon. This is hardly a new theme—in recent months, the same claims have been repeated almost daily at earsplitting volume in the mass media—but there’s a difference of some importance. The people who are sending these claims my way aren’t trying to claim that everything’s fine and the future of perpetual progress promised us by our culture’s most cherished mythology is on its way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No, they’re insisting that because peak oil has been disproved, I and other peak oil writers and bloggers need to get with the program, stop talking about peak oil, and start talking about the imminent threat of climate change instead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a curious claim, all things considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For well over a decade now, predictions based on peak oil have proven far more accurate than predictions based on the conventional wisdom that insists resource limits don’t matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A decade ago, cornucopian theorist Daniel Yergin was loudly proclaiming that the price of oil had reached a permanent plateau at $38 a barrel, smart money was flooding into exciting new ethanol and biodiesel startups, and everyone other than a few peak oil writers out there on the fringes assumed as a matter of course that the market would provide, ahem, limitless supplies of energy from alternative sources if the price of oil ever did rise to the unthinkable level of $60 a barrel. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, those peak oil writers out there on the fringe were garnering almost universal denunciation by predicting a difficult future of triple-digit oil prices, spiraling economic dysfunction, and the failure of alternative energy technologies to provide more than a very modest fraction of the vast energetic largesse our society currently gets from fossil fuels. The conventional wisdom was that this couldn’t possibly happen. A decade on, it’s not exactly hard to see who was right. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As for the claim that the fracking phenomenon has disproved peak oil, it’s worth revisiting two graphs I’ve posted before. The first one tracks oil production in the United States between 1920 and 2012: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/us-oil-prod-plain-edited-2-ce4707-g95.jpg style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=242 src=../../img/us-oil-prod-plain-edited-2-2c525d-g95.jpg width=320></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
See the little bitty uptick over on the right hand side of the graph?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s the vast new outpouring of crude oil made possible by fracking technology. That’s what all the shouting and handwaving are about. I’d encourage my readers to take a long hard look at that very modest upward blip, and then turn to the second graph, which should also be familiar: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/hubbert-curve-4c8b03.jpg style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=184 src=../../img/hubbert-curve-c2348d-320x184-g95.jpg width=320></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is the diagram of peak oil from M. King Hubbert’s original 1956 paper on the subject.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Those of my readers who are paying attention will already have noticed the very large area on the right hand side of the curve, more than two and a half times the size of all cumulative production and proven reserves<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>shown, labeled “future discoveries.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Bakken shale?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s included in there, along with many other oil fields that haven’t even been found yet. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The current fracking phenomenon, in other words, doesn’t disprove peak oil theory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>It was predicted by peak oil theory</i>. As the price of oil rises, petroleum reserves that weren’t economical to produce when the price was lower get brought into production, and efforts to find new petroleum reserves go into overdrive; that’s all part of the theory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Since oil fields found earlier are depleting all the while, in turn, the rush to discover and produce new fields doesn’t boost overall petroleum production more than a little, or for more than a short time; the role of these new additions to productive capacity is simply to stretch out the curve, yielding the long tail of declining production Hubbert showed in his graph, and preventing the end of the age of oil from turning into the sort of sudden apocalyptic collapse imagined by one end of the conventional wisdom. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Pick up any decent book on peak oil, or spend ten minutes of independent research on the internet, and you can learn all of this. Somehow, though, the pundits whose heated denunciations of peak oil theory show up in the mainstream media nearly every day don’t manage to mention any of these points. It’s not the only noticeable gap in their reasoning, either:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve long since lost track of the number of times I’ve seen media stories insist with a straight face that kerogen shales like the Green River formation are the same as oil shales like the Bakken, say, or duck the entire issue of depletion rates of fracked wells, or engage in other bits of evasion and misstatement that make our predicament look a great deal less challenging than it actually is. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Until recently, I’ve assumed that the failure to do basic research implied by these curious lapses was simply a product of the abysmal ignorance displayed by the media, and American society in general, concerning the important issues of our time. Still, I’ve had to rethink that, and a good part of the reason is a chart that was picked out of the mainstream media by one of the ever-vigilant Drumbeat commenters over on <a href=http://www.theoildrum.com/ >The Oil Drum</a>—tip of the archdruid’s hat to Darwinian.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here it is: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/crude-production-v-net-imports-393a01.gif style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=268 src=../../img/crude-production-v-net-imports-25225d.gif width=320></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You can find this graph in various forms in quite a few places in the American media just now. You’ll notice that, at first glance, it appears to be showing domestic production of petroleum here in the US rising up inexorably to equal domestic consumption, and leaving imports far in the dust. Take another look, and you’ll see that the line tracking domestic production uses a different scale, on the right side of the chart, that just happens to make current production look three times bigger than it is. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Perhaps some of my readers can think of an honest reason why the chart was laid out that way. I confess that I can’t. It seems uncomfortably likely, in other words, that peak oil theory has racked up another successful prediction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s one that my regular readers will remember from several previous posts, including <a href=../../2012/06/parting-of-ways.html>this one</a> from last June: the opening up of a chasm between those who are willing to face the reality of our situation and those who flee from that reality into fantasy and self-deception.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That chasm runs straight through the middle of the contemporary environmental movement, very much including the subset of that movement that concerns itself with climate change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It doesn’t run in the obvious place—say, between the techno-environmentalists who insist that everyone on the planet can have a lavish American middle class lifestyle powered by renewable energy, and the deep ecologists who see humanity as a gang of ecocidal apes yelling in triumph as they rush toward planetary dieoff. Both these extremes, and the entire spectrum of opinions between them, embrace the core presupposition that undergirds the conventional wisdom of our age. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What is that presupposition?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Total faith in the invincibility of technological progress. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the common thread that unites the whole spectrum of acceptable viewpoints in today’s industrial society, from the cornucopians who insist that the universe is obligated to give us all the resources we want if we just wave enough money around, through the faux-environmentalists who are out there shilling for the nuclear industry because the other options are a little bit worse, right across the landscape of ideas to the believers in imminent apocalypse and the darkest of dark green ecologists. What differentiates these viewpoints from one another is their assessment of the value of technological progress:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the cornucopians think it’s all good, the techno-environmentalists think most of it’s good, and so on along the line to those extreme neoprimitivists who have convinced themselves that the invention of spoken language was probably a bad idea. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you want to trace the fault line mentioned above, suggest to any of them that technological progress might stop in its tracks and give way to regress, and see how they respond. Mind you, by making that suggestion you’ll put yourself on the far side of a different line, the line between those ideas that are acceptable in industrial society and those that are beyond the pale. It’s acceptable to glorify progress as a mighty steamroller that will inevitably flatten anything in its path; it’s acceptable to argue that the steamroller has to be steered onto a different course, so it doesn’t flatten something of value that’s currently in its path; it’s acceptable to rage and weep over all the things it’s going to flatten as it continues on its unstoppable way; it’s even acceptable to insist that the steamroller is so mighty a juggernaut that no one can stop it from rolling over a cliff and crashing to ruin on the rocks below. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You can say any of these things in polite company.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What you can’t say, not without meeting total incomprehension and violent hostility, is that the steamroller’s fuel gauge is swinging over inexorably toward the letter E, and the jerry cans in back are dead empty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You can’t mention that ominous grinding sounds are coming out from under the hood, that trouble lights are flashing all over the dashboard, and that the steamroller’s forward motion is already visibly slowing down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You can’t even suggest as a possibility that in the not too distant future, the mighty steamroller will be a rusting, abandoned hulk, buried up to its axles in mud, stripped of all usable parts by roaming scavengers, and left to the patient and pitiless wrecking crew of sun and wind and rain. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course some people are saying this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To step back out of the metaphor, they are saying that technological progress, as well as the sciences that helped to make it possible, are subject to the law of diminishing returns; furthermore, that what has been called progress is in large part a mere side effect of a short-term, self-limiting process of stripping the planet’s easily accessible carbon reserves at an extravagant pace, and will stop in its tracks and shift into reverse as those reserves run short; more broadly, that modern industrial society is in no way exempt from the common fate of civilizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ideas such as these have a long and intriguing history in the modern world, and I’ll want to discuss that history here one of these days. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, the point I want to make just now is that until recently, those who embraced the conventional wisdom simply ignored those of us who embraced these deeply unfashionable ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Climate change activists, to return to the point at issue, could simply brush aside the peak oil perspective, and keep on insisting that the only thing that can stop technological progress from destroying the planet is more technological progress—biofuels, solar energy, geoengineering, you name it; plenty of technologies and their supporters vied for the lucrative role of planetary savior, but next to nobody questioned the assumption that some technology or other was going to play the part.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>When peak oil researchers pointed out that predictions of catastrophic climate change assumed continued increases in fossil fuel extraction at rates the planet couldn’t provide, nobody paid the least attention. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The flurry of emails and comments I’ve received of late suggest that we aren’t being ignored any longer, and I think I know why.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s the same reason why peak oil theory keeps on getting denounced on a daily basis in increasingly shrill tones in the mainstream media, even though nobody with access to the mainstream media is arguing in favor of it, and the reason why those denunciations have strayed further and further into what looks remarkably like overt dishonesty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For the last decade and more, again, predictions based on peak oil theory have proven substantially correct, while predictions based on a rejection of peak oil theory have been embarrassingly wrong. For that matter, the "standard run" model from <i>The Limits to Growth</i>, the most savagely denounced of the Seventies-era predictions of industrial civilization’s fate, has proven to be the most accurate projection of future trends to come out of that decade. One more graph: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/limitsofgrowth-b50972-g95.jpg style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=228 src=../../img/limitsofgrowth-777d04-g95.jpg width=320></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times">The further we go into the future traced out by M. King Hubbert and <i>The Limits to Growth</i>, and the wider the gap that opens up between the myth of perpetual progress and the realities of contraction and regress that are taking shape around us right now, the more effort the chorus of believers will likely put into drowning out dissenting voices and proclaiming the infallibility of an already disproved creed. Why this should be so, why the illusion of invincibility is so central to the myth of progress and its believers, is an intricate question, far more complex than a single paragraph or a single post can cover. To explore it, I’m going to have to plunge into one of the handful of subjects I’d originally decided to leave severely alone on this blog: the religious implications of the end of the age of oil. We’ll start that discussion next week. </span></span></div>

Although I have relied on this blog for my understanding of the material underpinnings of a "long decline", I owe my understanding of the spiritual consequences of such a decline to Guénon, who outlined a specific course of action for those who would pursue a spiritual stance against modernity.<br><br><a href=#c4994917241560076506 title="comment permalink">3/21/13, 2:50 AM</a><br><br>

In the context of your discussion the “thesis” is pre-industrial society, the “anti-thesis” is industrial society and the “synthesis” is the society which will develop from the previous two. It will be contain elements of both but be different from both.

(ref: http://www.macucc.org/pages/detail/2410) It's not much, and it's quite late to the party, but it's a conversation, at least, and an encouragement toward such radical notions as carpooling and drinking tap water out of your own re-useable bottle.<br><br><a href=#c5825974111866383813 title="comment permalink">3/21/13, 4:18 AM</a><br><br>

The key difference with technological progress is that it demands profound changes in our behavior.

Faith in a big narrative - in this case "forever upwards and onwards with human innovation" - does help us to organize our lives and thoughts and helps us feel safe. It's very painful when the details start to prove the narrative wrong. You can see that all through history, with various ideologies and systems continuing well past their sell-by date because true believers kept pursuing them in spite of the facts. You can also see it vividly in blog comment threads. It's particularly interesting that comments seem more angry when followers of a doomer type blog have to deal with details that suggest reality is not as bad they thought it should be.

(ha! I couldn’t resist) is Edward Tufte's essay The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint. <br><br>It deals specifically with Microsoft's PowerPoint software, and the way it structurally reduces one’s ability to communicate data, but I think the concept generally extends to communicating any technical information. Despite being a serious essay, it’s also quite amusing. He provides hilarious examples of bad slides, and seriously compares PowerPoint's rate of data transfer to Pravda—the organ of Soviet propaganda. Another eye-opening example contrasts a handwritten data table from 1662 to a modern slideshow.<br><br>I don’t doubt there’s a lot of intentional dishonesty going into the charts we see in the mainstream media (and will continue to see). I think, however, the issue extends beyond mere manipulation, and ties into the whole issue of education and the ability to think that you’ve discussed in previous posts. <br><br>Tufte’s essay introduces the sort of structural "dumbing down" imposed by the medium itself, which most of us are quite simply unaware of. I think it provides a sort of first inoculation. It did for me. The scientists and engineers in the audience will especially enjoy this one, at least those who aren’t too proud of their PP presentations.<br><br><br><a href=#c4873476782691018517 title="comment permalink">3/21/13, 6:39 AM</a><br><br>

That is a mass not easily steered, even if most of them see themselves being carried along by the crowd toward a looming cliff. Have another Big Mac and enjoy the spectacle.<br><br>Second, ecological examples based on the "logistics equation," show that resource overshoot nearly always results in a hard crash. The famous "hare and lynx" study is but one example. This is simply what happens in dynamic systems that are in overshoot.<br><br>Third, from an emotional point of view, the notion of a hard crash can move people to action who would be more inclined to go with the flow otherwise -- sort of the opposite of "boiling frog syndrome."<br><br>So this is why I tend to be a bit of a doomer -- to get people off their butts and to get them to <i>care</i> about what is happening, and to get them to do whatever personal actions they can do to mitigate it.<br><br>Yea, the gauges on the steamroller are beeping and flashing. But we're nearer the edge than we think, and there's enough fuel to get us over the edge. But I find the notion that the steamroller will stutter and stall no better than the other notions you decry.<br><br>The key is to sabotage the steamroller! Pour sugar in the tank! Take wire cutters to the fuel lines! Stuff a banana in the exhaust! Pour mud in the air intake!<br><br>This is not for the faint-of-heart. Sabotaging the steamroller means, in the original words of Thoreau, voluntary poverty. It means living simply, that others might simply live.

The simple logic of resource depletion is overwhelming. It defies credulity to assume otherwise. As with climate change, resource depletion is one of those subjects Mother Nature handles on her own. She doesn't care what anyone else believes, what political party or religion you might belong to. When Hulbert's Peak is reached the downhill slide begins. With regard to renewable energy, our personal experience is that it helps in this "long descent," but it is no substitute for cheap concentrated energy. Refer to "Reneweable Energy Cannot Sustain a Consumer Society" by Ted Trainer. It is difficult listening to or reading other's positions especially if there is adamant opposition. In such situations one is always accused of being bull-headed or closed-minded, but I have yet to hear an argument in opposition to the peak oil theorists that makes any sense at all. <br><br>In a similar vein, last year I read Bjorn Lomborg's article in the July 2012 Foreign Affairs "Environmental Alarmism, Then and Now": a critique of The Limits to Growth. At the time I wondered about his intellectual honesty. I will be interested in your thoughts about religion. Since escaping teen age I have always thought the religious concept of a creator, especially an active one, as an illusion - probably created at that time in the world's evolution in order to explain our existence and the heavens out there, but now it is inconsistent with reality.

I’m worried that the industrial extraction machine does in fact have plenty left in the tank to push us into a catastrophic situation. In his recent Rolling Stone piece, Bill McKibben makes the case that we can put another 565 gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by midcentury and still have some reasonable hope of staying below a 2 degree Celsius global temperature rise, the generally agreed upon number in the scientific community that keeps the planet, as James Hansen puts it, from long-term disaster. Bill goes on to highlight another number, 2,795 gigatons, that “describes the amount of carbon already contained in the proven coal and oil and gas reserves of the fossil-fuel companies, and the countries (think Venezuela or Kuwait) that act like fossil-fuel companies. In short, it's the fossil fuel we're currently planning to burn. And the key point is that this new number – 2,795 – is higher than 565. Five times higher”.<br><br>What I’d like to see are some estimates as to what percentage of the 2,795 gigatons of proven reserves can realistically be expected to be extracted and burned, taking into account JMG’s critical point that technological progress will at some point shift into reverse. I have an unfortunate hunch that the number is greater than 565.<br><br><a href=#c341474574062556458 title="comment permalink">3/21/13, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

We're less adaptable than blue-green algae, and so the climate change we're inflicting can't be as extreme as the oxygen catastrophe was, but the idea that our nature isn't consistent with the ecosystem as we found it doesn't have to include any comment on the nature of technology. Photosynthesis would have been very difficult to adapt to even if it had never "progressed", and it may be that the same holds for technology.<br><br>Secondly, I think the idea of technological progress is almost like the idea of evolutionary progress. There are times when niches close, and precious things which had depended on them are lost; there are times when niches open, and an amazing variety blooms to fill them. Technologies depend on one another in a qualitatively and quantitatively different way than species depend on one another, but I see more similarity than difference in the patterns of interdependence and adaptation. People who insist on seeing progress can find a lot of "advances" in medieval technology and tertiary biology, which followed from the elimination of Romans and dinosaurs, respectively; people who don't can see some tragic losses and some new developments.<br><br><a href=#c7693074313412639182 title="comment permalink">3/21/13, 9:36 AM</a><br><br>

I have found your insights on this issue to be invaluable. However this belief in progress should not necessarily prevent society from accepting the reality of peak oil. After all large parts of our society did start to get the idea of peak oil back in the 1970’s, during the oil crisis. I am sure that many people back then thought that we would continue to have endless progress because our cleverness and technology would help us to find other sources of energy to replace oil. But that does not take away the fact, that many of the responses that western societies made at the time did reduce oil consumption by some 10 to 15%. A belief in progress did not stop society dealing with the oil crisis in the 1970’s. If such a response were made now it would not prevent the decline of civilisation, but it would certainly help to soften the blow.<br><br>But if society was able to start to accept the idea of peak oil back in the 1970’s, why is it not able to do this now. I think that what you say about our deep cultural belief in progress has a lot to do with it. However there are other factors involved. The oil crisis of the 1970’s was caused by political events in the Middle East which brought about a sudden reduction in the amount of oil available to western societies and a huge increase in oil price and recession. This was a shortage that could not be ignored. <br><br>However while production has flattened out since 2005, there had not yet been a decline in oil production. This makes it easier to maintain the illusion that production will soon increase. The other problem is that the peak oil crisis has been obscured by the huge financial crisis of 2008. All those critics of capitalism have been able to blame our present problems on the bankers and the out of control financial system. And these critics are right, as the financial system bears a lot of responsibility for our present economic plight. But this makes it easy to ignore the role that the tripling of oil prices had in precipitating the financial crisis of 2008. With a price rise like that we would have eventually ended up in a crisis no matter what kind of economic system we had. Yet everyone is so focussed on the immediate financial crisis, that the deeper problem of peak oil is ignored<br><br><a href=#c342200539579054440 title="comment permalink">3/21/13, 9:51 AM</a><br><br>

As energy costs rise, the incentives to “improve efficiency” are more pressing. Where I work, we have closed eleven of sixteen offices, cutting the umbilical cord for the sales people and letting them work in a “virtual environment.” This has resulted in about 40% of the non-sales jobs disappearing, with only IT and marketing sectors escaping the axe.<br><br>How have these “great savings” been accomplished? By going digital of course! The project has greatly increased efficiency, with the productivity of each remaining worker enhanced the number of customers each sales person sees has gone up. The number of “support” staff needed has declined dramatically.<br><br>Unfortunately, the energy footprint of each contract sold as increased, as computers, mobile internet connections, the related infrastructure, the back-end servers - all require ever-increasing amounts of energy to operate, with costs offset by lower payroll costs and less facilities in local communities.<br><br>The results are an arresting of the decline that our industry has seen since the start of the great recession. Note: we stopped the decline, we did not return to the level of growth of the first eight years of this century. It is catabolic collapse playing out in my work environment month after month. The trimmed fat is what is keeping us alive as an industry. <br><br>We see the same dynamics playing out with our customers, triumphed as “market forces at work” when the number of employers in a given field continues its relentless slide down from the peak.<br><br>We increase our energy footprint per dollar of profit while former cubical workers learn first-hand how an empire collapses.

First actual victims of plateau oil production are already here: small-scale agriculturalists, peasants of Central Asia and Indian subcontinent are already facing starvation and famine because rising prices of "Green Revolution" products. Situation can be similar in other areas too, but as I have no experience about them, I do not speak about them. We can assume that if person is starving, he is ready to buy ANY alternative product offered to him by classical market theory. As there is no viable alternatives popping up with rising demand, it must be case that inside prize range available for these populations there just in no alternative for fossil fuel based products. Price of oil barrel is no abstraction for these persons, as it is for inhabitants of more abundant countries. Yet.<br><br>By wide margin, most successful project I have encountered to produce more energy-intensive end products from raw materials with lesser energy value is apartheid-era Sasol plants in SA, using Fischer-Tropsch process. These plants were impressive even after apartheid-era, when I got some rudimentary knowledge about them. <br><br>They show that ruthless regime can produce fuels to satisfy industrial infrastructure even under siege conditions and with very small amounts of crude oil available. But we also must notice that this production does not add to wealth of nation, as it is actually using up existing wealth in form of tax subsidizes. Economic contraction cannot be avoided with alternative methods, even if falling back to horse chariots can be.<br><br>I believe that deep inability of well-educated persons to accept reality of limited oil reserves has a lot to do with future that this situation implies at. If religion of progress fails to deliver, vacuum shall not last long in historical perspective. These new (or old, revitalized) faiths probably do not share same perspective towards nature of man or his/her place in the world as our current doctrine. Fear of different value systems looming ahead is probably greatest barrier preventing some rudimentary mathematics doing a home run with our current elites.<br><br><a href=#c8825005700459270883 title="comment permalink">3/21/13, 10:59 AM</a><br><br>

A good part as you note is the attractiveness of deceiving ourselves into believing the fairy tale that we are smart enough to solve whatever problems come up. But the empirical facts of 21st century life show a world radically changed by the human mind and the technology it has created. You seem to assume that this will go away as the energy binge of the last century passes. But we are not going to forget the principles of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and many branches of engineering. And a human society after the energy binge that remembers the principles upon which their technology was built is going to adapt existing technology and build new technology so that looking back at the post-peak transition it will look not at all like technological progress came to a stop. I have taken this to be part of what you meant by 'ecotechnic', but here you much more blatantly reject the key role that technology is playing and will play in making the outcome of our current crisis so unpredictable. I think you don't realize how dramatically different the world must always be before and after a species develops a good approximation of the laws for how the universe works. For humans this happened roughly between 1680 (Newton) and 1938 (understanding basic quantum mechanics and the nucleus). One kind of expects us to make a mess of organizing our society in the wake of a change of this magnitude. Science and technology have made vast stored energy available so energy abundance has coincided with technological advance. You seem to be wisely opposing those who assume that technology can always make energy abundant. But I expect that looking back from 2100 we will observe that the downside of the energy peak saw more technological innovation rather than less. That is how it has always been...change and necessity create new things...in evolution, societies, and technology. And after the advent of modern science this is even more true than before. Technology will not make the energy crisis go away. But it is impossible to comprehend the road ahead without carefully considering the new technologies that humans will develop in response. The notion that technological development will stop is a failure of the imagination. Why would it stop? Just because much current technology runs on oil says very little about what can be built without oil. As long as there are humans, they will innovate. It is this unpredictability of technological development that makes our path through resource depletion so difficult to chart.<br><br><a href=#c1576521069693178819 title="comment permalink">3/21/13, 1:31 PM</a><br><br>

The first is to try to come up with a sufficiently complete analysis of why it happens that you can model it from within. The second is to observe the way the process works in its natural environment, and model it from without. The former works extremely well in simple systems but fails to deal with complex ones, for the reason you've suggested. The latter -- the basic approach of ecology -- is the best tool for really complex systems, and that's what I'm doing here. We know how civilizations fall, on a wide range of geographical and technological scales; there have been plenty of previous examples. All that's necessary is to scale up the model sufficiently, and adapt as needed to fit the distinctive features of the present case. <br><br>Raven, the parallel is even closer than I think you realize.

As an engineering academic I've been struggling to find a sense of identity and purpose in the face of our predicament. What is an engineer, especially a research engineer, but a champion of technological progress? Technological progress is our whole reason for being. Our efforts to keep the steamroller moving forward are perhaps not wise...<br><br>Like you've said so many times, the stories we tell define us. A threat to our story is a threat to ourselves and provokes the same kind of reaction. It's enough to push people to want to make dodgy graphs, and worse.<br><br>ChemEng: it seems to me you're proposing exactly what our beloved host has just finished explaining - doing the same thing while being convinced you're doing something different. I'm not convinced that we can develop such technologies, or even that we should. See <a href=http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~pel/environment/ rel=nofollow>Kenneth Boulding's utterly dismal theorem</a>.<br><br>Technology requires resources (modern technology requires a lot), which we're running short of and hence we're probably near the limit of what we can and should do (see above). What we're short of much more than technology is knowledge (more properly the domain of science than engineering). Knowledge requires a lot of resources to obtain, but much less to maintain (and others have commented on this). What we lack even more than knowledge though, is wisdom - which our host is doing his level best to address.<br><br>Yupped: yes, very painful. I can really relate to what you're saying.<br><br>Bytesmiths: whether or not you're right on the hard crash is all a question of timescales. A crash taking 100 years will look like a hard crash on the timescale of civilisations, not so much on the scale of human lifetimes. Mitigating against your hard crash scenario is that, at least in the west, there's an awful lot of fat to be metaphorically cut before we're unable to meet people's basic needs.<br><br>Jeremy Leggett had a pretty realistic take on the balance between peak oil and global warming (to paraphrase): if we burn all the remaining oil and gas we may just be ok, if we burn all the coal reserves we're toast.<br><br>Sir, like many of your other readers have posted, I'm also really looking forward to your dissections of the religious implications of peak oil.<br>By the way, what's the source for your last graph? It's a beauty - I've seen the data before, but not so well presented.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Graeme<br><br><a href=#c2693258953625143999 title="comment permalink">3/21/13, 5:05 PM</a><br><br>

We've landed in one of those ghastly situations where the thing that most needs to be grasped is also the thing that nobody is willing to hear. <br><br>Zach, I'll be doing a bit more than that. It's necessary, it seems to me, to talk about where the religion of progress came from, why it replaced Christianity as the established religion of the western world, and what role religions might play in the coming deindustrial age. <br><br>Richard, I don't expect us to stay below 2 degrees C. As I mentioned to an earlier commenter, I expect the collapse of the remaining polar ice caps, the flooding of the world's coastal lowlands, and climatic and biotic chaos driven by anthropogenic global warming to be among the defining facts of the 21st century. My point is that the exhaustion of fossil fuels and the collapse of systems dependent on cheap, abundant, highly concentrated energy are also among the defining facts of the 21st century. <br><br>Steve, excellent. Excellent!

The reason they do this is simple: if people were to act rationally in the face of petroleum/fossil fuels depletion, they'd act so as to conserve that resource like they did in the late 70s. Oil company incomes would decrease, their profit margins would shrink, and their earnings growth would go negative, resulting in angry shareholders and falling stock prices.

The abandonment of clear thought and the rejection of even a shallow understanding of philosophy has resulted in a considerable number of would-be scientists making up the rules of research as they go along, imagining that if they can construct a narrative that might explain the phenomena they are exploring, they have therefore proved that narrative. Reading that on "The New Atlantis" was a tad unsettling, but nothing too surprising. Basing almost all current medical research on poorly understood epidemiological statistical constructs also seems like it is yielding diminishing returns.

It would be one thing if the quality of such food was maintained while the price went up, but instead, the price increases while quality and portion size decrease. It's a simple observation and yet one that I am making more and more frequently.

There was quite a bit of discussion about that a few years ago -- Kjell Aleklett published a paper analysing the IPCC models and showing how those models assumed production rates of fossil fuels that can't be justified on the basis of reserve data. You shouldn't have any trouble finding it -- try searching the archives on The Oil Drum. <br><br>Justin, interesting to hear that you've been thinking along those lines. So have I, with results that will be in circulation in AODA shortly. <br><br>Ganv, yes, I figured I'd hear those objections. It's easy to claim that our current scientific knowledge can't be lost, and that innovation will continue, but history disproves both claims. There have been periods thousands of years in length, many of them, in which cultures experienced no technological innovation at all; there have also been countless examples of precious knowledge being lost forever -- and you might want to look at the extremely fragile nature of the storage media we use nowadays before assuming so blithely that current scientific theories and practices will survive a deindustrial future. <br><br>Mind you, I want to see the scientific method survive, along with useful sciences and technologies -- but that's only going to happen if people stop assuming that this is guaranteed, and get to work making it happen. <br><br>Unknown Cecilia, I'll be discussing that mindset. I'll also be discussing how bizarre a perversion it is of the historical teachings of the religion people making that claim think they follow. (Hint for Christian readers: I don't recall "blessed are the greedy squanderers of irreplaceable resources" figuring anywhere in the Beatitudes...) <br><br>Carl, nah, the consumption figures use the scale on the left hand side of the chart, while the figures on the right are purely for production. <br><br>Phil, see my comments earlier about climate change. <br><br>S P, for some people it'll be bankruptcy. For others it'll be the day when they realize they can no longer afford the gas to commute to work. For others -- well, catabolic collapse has many faces; and then there will be some people who never do get it, who go to their deaths convinced that a shiny new world of perpetual progress is right around the corner. <br><br>William, excellent. You're asking the questions that most people who put their trust in "green energy" refuse to ask. Look up the answers; what you find won't reassure you. <br><br>Lee, very much so -- though it depends to some extent on the religion!<br><br><a href=#c7813841132501028782 title="comment permalink">3/21/13, 10:48 PM</a><br><br>

Anyone want to give it a try? <br><br>Avery, yes, I noticed the cold pricklies. If Traditionalism is what works for you, by all means; my sources of inspiration lie elsewhere, in territory Guenon and other Traditionalists tended to dismiss out of hand. <br><br>Dowsergirl, don't get depressed! Remember that the Subaru dealer is lying to get you to buy something you don't need -- that's the nature of business in the US these days, after all -- and you can ignore him. As for the snow, be grateful; the more of it that falls late in the season, the less trouble you're likely to have when fire season comes around. <br><br>GuRan, as an engineer, you've got skills that will be crucially necessary to the deindustrial transition ahead. If I may misquote Ernest Thompson Seton a bit, there are two ways of doing something: throw lots of energy at it, or know what you're doing. You might, with this in mind, begin picking up the skills that will allow you to know what you're doing (and thus use much less energy) to do things that will need to be done in the deindustrial world. <br><br>Phil, exactly! You get tonight's second gold star. It may not surprise you that Nietzsche will be playing a role in next week's post...<br><br>Passingthrough, Jason Godesky used to post lengthy diatribes here assailing my views, until I banned him, so I've had some exposure to the neoprimitivist way of thinking! Please don't confuse invincibility with moral goodness; I'm quite aware that most neoprimitivists think of civilization as evil incarnate, but a great many of them seem to think that all they can do, to return to my metaphor, is to wait around until the steamroller rolls off a cliff. (Godesky's theories explicitly made this argument, for example.) Mind you, if they've started to grasp just how fragile industrial society is, and noticed that it's already on its way down the curve of the Long Descent, that's a good thing. <br><br>As for the crack about spoken language, I wish I was making that up. I've long since lost the URL of the website that made that claim, so you'll have to take my word for it, but I did see that claim being made. <br><br>Sekenre, thank you! A forecast, please note, which is based on wildly inflated reserve data...<br><br>Orwellian, yes, I spotted that!

I would like to make a comment on the cultural mythology that you bring up.<br>How does the world look to the early founders of our culture? Civilized folк is always pressured for food or new areas to put under the plоw - there is the drive for permanent progress. Everywhere they go, they find resources to fuel the progress - it seems like it is the world's purpose to support us in our conquest. Now add to this the fact that our early cultural predecessors had no idea where the world ends, or how old it is, it might have just as well been an endless flat field that came into existence together with civilization - try and explain limits to growth to these people.<br>Every time reality deals a shaking blow to our cultures fundamental beliefs it has managed to recover. God did not put us in the center of the universe, well it put us in the center of creation. He did not make us the center of creation, but 200 years after Darwin, the majority of people still believe humanity is somehow special, not a subject to the laws of ecology like the other species. <br>When reality denies that the world and god always support our mission this I think will be the blow that breaks our cultural juggernaut. When humanity swallows this bitter pill and the culture finally collapses there may be some hope that we will learn to live as one with the planet once more. <br>Most people however are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it and its cultural foundations.<br><br><a href=#c1789780892163036560 title="comment permalink">3/22/13, 1:21 AM</a><br><br>

However, Kjell Aleklett may have got it wrong, of course or we may get catastrophic climate change, anyway. The 2 degree limit (which the IPCC think would likely be breached) wasn't a limit that science imposed, it may have been informed by the science at the time (though some disagree with even that) but the scientific assessment of the risks of 2 degrees has moved on, with closer to 1 degree now looking just as bad. However, even 2 degrees is beginning to look baked into the cake. As Richard Green pointed out, there is only a certain amount of more carbon equivalent that we can shove into the atmosphere to get to 2 degrees and it looks likely that it will get shoved there within the next decade or so. How much fossil fuels are left after that will be irrelevant, so far as the 2 degree "limit" is concerned.<br><br>Climate science is starting to recognise that extreme events are become more extreme and more frequent, with only 0.8 degrees of warming, so catastrophic climate change doesn't seem to be too much of a leap. And if the Arctic sea ice continues it's trend, catastrophe may come much sooner than even the catastrophists had predicted.<br><br>Please don't be so dismissive of the problem.<br><br><a href=#c6014436377108331208 title="comment permalink">3/22/13, 1:40 AM</a><br><br>

I can't see how information lost by pre-literate societies is relevant at all. So that leaves just a few examples (Rome, Mayan civilization, maybe one or two others).

And a much smaller fraction had their everyday lives directly dependent on technology that was later lost. And there simply is no historical precedent for modern science. There has never before been a civilization that understood the basic physics, biology, ecology, and geology of their resource base. So we have very little historical precedent to rely on in estimating what effect technology will have during and after this crisis.<br><br>Thanks again for your very stimulating commentary. There are very few places with such clear critiques of the assumptions that are all around us.<br><br><a href=#c5729231886895991182 title="comment permalink">3/22/13, 7:21 AM</a><br><br>

MIT Technology Review with a grumpy looking <a href=http://blog.speculist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/buzzonMITreview.jpg rel=nofollow>Buzz Aldrin</a> that read "You promised me Mars colonies. Instead, I got Facebook." with a subtext "We've stopped solving big problems. Meet the technologists who refuse to give up." vs the <a href=http://www.davison.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/NEWpopular-mechanics.jpg rel=nofollow>supersonic jet</a> on the cover of Popular Science proclaiming "You will live on Mars, if you want to" and the return of supersonic jet travel by 2030.<br><br> As you know the USA had just shut down the space program and the Concord has been out of business for decades. I happen to work at the store that sells those magazines and for the whole month I watched Buzz look on disapprovingly as the technologists from MIT promoted the big technological solutions we could have if only we are brave enough to dream them. While Popular Mechanic's supersonic jet mocked him with all the scientific fantasies of a teenage boy offered up as a forgone conclusion by their scienticians. The magazines never fought. I believe that Mr. Aldrin's good character kept him from tisking at the neighbouring pipe dreams and it was probably beneath the jet's dignity to check for poor track records and broken promises.<br><br> The weird thing was that no one noticed the cognitive dissonance radiating out from the magazine rack. No one said anything about the space shuttle's last hurrah or the last 40 years of progress that had failed to resurrect the Concord. It was totally invisible. The problem, I think, is that, as you said in The Twilight of Meaning, the myths you really believe in, of course, are the ones you don’t notice that you believe. Or, to put a slightly different spin on it, you can't choose something that's not on the menu.<br><br> So, if the problem is running out of oil and the solution is continuous progress (of course, that's the only choice on the menu) then the explanation that comes out is meretricious twaddle. Anything that might result in not continuous progress isn't an option. It can't be an option because you don't believe in it. Not progress is unreal and therefore doesn't exist (Kiri-Kin-Tha's first law of metaphysics). Because the myth is central to our world view and we don't know that we believe in it in the first place we are literally unable to think thoughts that contradict it. It is unthinkable. I believe that is why the five stages of grief exist. They are a process to form the neural circuits and intellectual constructs necessary to be able to think about a previously unavailable idea.<br><br><a href=#c4400464227579387882 title="comment permalink">3/22/13, 9:11 PM</a><br><br>

I was thinking about the inherent myths and faiths we invent for ourselves without realizing it. Faith in technology, the mythology of progress. <br><br> I was wondering about something I like to call the "Illusion of Control". Our reality, is a mental model of causation in which we can only see correlations. <br><br>In the age of Keynesian economics it is commonly assumed we can grow and stimulate the economy through monetary policy, like someone would turn the dials on a light switch or press a gas pedal. In reality, we do not have any direct influence on the economy. the flipping of a light switch itself is a simple wish that the complex system that makes it function is working at the moment. This is not the same sort of control we are used to dealing with by throwing a rock/spear or jumping off a ledge. On long time scales, these things are truly nebulous and direct influence is something extremely difficult to objectively discern. <br><br> With mental imagery we create climate change and peak oil as symbols that are tangible and to scale in order to understand them. However, this model of reality in our minds, subjects us to an illusion that we could take a hand and grab the carbon dioxide out of the environment, this symbol in our minds is able to manipulated, when in reality it is fixed. <br><br>Why do we look to "humanity" as a concerted force to be controlled in order to solve our greatest problems, rather than our greatest problems embodied as simply another force of nature? Shouldn't we be looking, as individuals, at how to survive the human storms of resource depletion, economic collapse and political uncertainty? Is it our outdated evolutionary hardware that leads to the personification of complex processes and systems, in a way that eludes true understanding?<br><br><a href=#c1543773961110942234 title="comment permalink">3/22/13, 11:06 PM</a><br><br>

A lot of early USA agriculture was effectively ‘slash &amp; burn’ – even George Washington et al. Use up the easy fertility and move westward – necessity invented the ‘restless spirit’ and the ‘frontier of innovation’? And motivated the hustling and the bottom line? In the book On the Great Plains, we read that the 1000 year accumulation of soil nutrients was quickly spent:<br>Quote: “They applied manure as it was available, rotated legumes when it was convenient. But they had no strategy for the very long term. By the 1930s, Rooks County fields had been planted, cultivated, and harvested sixty times without rest. Soil nitrogen was about half what it had been at sod-breaking and crop yields declined steadily. And now no western frontier remained. From the vantage of 1930s, crop agriculture in Kansas does not appear very sustainable. All the arable land in Rooks County - and in the nation for that matter – had been identified and plowed. Soil nitrogen and organic carbon drifted steadily downward, and with them yields and profits. Faced with this dilemma, farmers implemented a dramatic innovation in soil nutrient management. Rather than adopt one or more of the ancient strategies, farmers (and the industrial nation behind them) created a new option. They appropriated abundant cheap fossil-fuel energy to import enormous amounts of synthetically manufactured nitrogen onto their fields. …” page 219, ‘On the Great Plains: Agriculture and Environment’, Cunfer 2005; preview in googlebooks<br>best<br>Phil H<br><br><br><a href=#c5150828222998680914 title="comment permalink">3/23/13, 3:27 AM</a><br><br>

I don't find it strange, as I can follow the path which lead to it. It happened by degrees, as agribusiness took over. It followed the same trajectory as other institutions by the corrupting influence of money and greed. Advertising, TV, and the slow swap of lousy ingredients for prior natural ones.<br><br>The food is markedly better in some European countries.

For example, we bought a pig from an elderly couple who are farming for pleasure in their retirement, and went to their house to cut it up under their direction. When we got hungry and went upstairs for lunch, the wife made her husband a hamburger from their own grass fed beef - and inserted a piece of fake American "cheese food" between two slices of Wonderbread.<br><br>Something that has been interesting me is the increase in weight, even including my own daughters. There are very few young people who are as naturally thin as my generation was. I raised my kids eating like I did, no soft drinks, healthy home cooked food, and yet they were not as lean as teenagers. I think that the situation now is that the nutrition is worse and worse due to soil depletion to be sure, but there are so many other insidious processes that it takes real research to uncover them. For example, the book Wheat Belly attributes weight gain to the fact that older forms of wheat are no longer grown and newer forms that have been developed for reasons to suit agribusiness, are more difficult to digest, lower in protein and lead to weight gain. So a slice of whole wheat bread might not be the same as the one my mother made me eat - alone in the entire school! - of Wonderbread eaters.<br><br><a href=#c1711395591772294018 title="comment permalink">3/23/13, 11:46 AM</a><br><br>

There's an economic history of 17th Cent. VA on the internet that discusses this. <br><br>From the beginning of tobacco culture around 1620, the farmers noted that on freshly cleared land, tobacco quality declined noticeably after 3 years . They tried all the available techniques -- crop rotation, a fallow period, using land for pasturage to fertilize it with manure, spreading "marls". These only delayed the decline. Plantations were large because they planned on clearing forest. <br><br>One guess is that Peak Tobacco was around 1750 due to soil depletion and market conditions. Two wars (French&amp;Indian, Revolution) interfered with export. By the 1780s there were newspaper editorials suggesting that growing tobacco had been a big mistake. By 1800, the big plantations on the lower James River had been abandoned or converted to other uses. The economy of VA hit bottom around 1820-30 and there was a huge exodus, described in a book by the historian David Hackett Fischer. But it wasn't because of a restless spirit. They didn't want to leave.<br><br>The way George Washington fits in is that when he inherited Mount Vernon, the soil was already depleted. He tried growing tobacco for a couple of years and wisely gave up. He didn't choose "slash and burn" -- it was the only way to grow tobacco.<br><br>To a casual amateur like me, the first question is "What were they thinking? They had 200 years to consider the problem." Our host may have some insights on this.<br><br><a href=#c158498598312332097 title="comment permalink">3/23/13, 3:06 PM</a><br><br>

The soils Down Under are older than pretty much most of the rest of the world. Being old they are seriously depleted in trace minerals (particularly phosphate). Some of the oldest rocks on the surface of the planet are to be found in Western Australia. I live on the side of a relatively recent volcanic massif (hopefully it is not still active – wouldn’t that be a surprise for me one day!) so it is not too bad here, although the soils generally lack organic matter as the native eucalypt forests are a bit of a disaster. However, those mineral deficiencies in the rest of the continent result in the slow growth of plants which evolved in richer areas (ie. pretty much most of the Western diet consumed here) which means that the food products derived from those plants are mineral deficient and no one really seems to notice. It is little wonder that farmers here love applying NPK to their crops, but they forget that plants actually require a whole lot of additional minerals as well. <br><br>The plant products grown at the farm here feel different and taste differently to the stuff supplied in supermarkets. Some friends have even complained to me that the food tastes too strongly here (which I took to be a compliment). The whole situation scares me silly.<br><br>I don’t doubt that you are correct about your suspicions in relation to wheat. Australia used to have a huge diversity of locally developed wheat varieties but they have been slowly lost as agribusiness takes over. I often get wheat and barley growing here as a weed and have been letting it go to seed so that it becomes more acclimatised to the area and thus better adapted. It is a slow process though and much has been lost.<br><br>PS: I bake my own bread using an old variety of wheat as the flour base and most people that eat it, love it and it disappears very quickly. A few months back at one of my mates houses they were telling me (excitedly) how long their bread lasts and stays soft. I was going, “guys, that’s just not right”. The bread baked here lasts for only about 1 day and then it is chook food as it is no longer fresh as it is stale.<br><br>Cheese here is pretty good, but it travels such a long way. You can even legally buy raw milk cheese here now after a long and protracted legal battle.<br><br>Dunno, but food is not food.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1934358865480424252 title="comment permalink">3/24/13, 1:20 AM</a><br><br>

The contact in the renewable energy world has been off grid for over two decades (and is a real inspiration to me) and he was saying that you can even DC weld using a large enough battery (with a bit of skill).

From persons living around mentioned areas I have understood that rising prices are squeezing peasants and their kin badly - very badly. At the same time, I am aware that at least inside region of Assam there is some very deep troubles going on. As a passer-by, I still should not jump to conclusions; thank you for reminding me that.<br><br>When it comes to wider picture, it is good to remember that current economic model of global markets is build around perpetual growth model. Energy inputs, which actually produce real wealth, don't have to drop dramatically for this kind of economic system to crash and burn. Flat energy production line or modest drop in it is all it takes for all these investment machinations waiting interest surplus rolling in to malfunction. In general, I have deep conviction that most people in affluent classes or societies have no idea how hard this inability to produce major profits to be shared by investors is squeezing the most defenseless links in the chain, those subcontractor manufacturers around the globe. For many of them, investment to actual infrastructure of working places has hibernated many years ago. This ongoing socioeconomic earthquake is already cannibalizing lowest levels of production line, throwing people there to relative misery. And beginning of that earthquake can be traced back to tightness and subsequent price of crude oil during "good old days" at -08. <br><br>And about this religion conversation. All those who are welcoming forthcoming dark ages and have high hopes about somekind consciousness shift... I just can't believe it works that way. For what I have seen, crumbling of material hopes and insecurity of future makes great masses of people - masses who actually decide what shall be accepted norms of the future - turn into more conservative, more traditional, less "progressive" forms of their ancestral faiths. No room for nice, academically constructed hippie beliefs there. Those American poor agricultural (probably white) laborers whom many here call with racist term "hilly billy" are no exception here; people of all colours and creeds are doing the same thing simultaneously around our beloved globe, turning into more fundamentalist forms of their respective faiths. It must be that "hatespeech of the left"-thing going on, that you don't give same opportunity to those heroes of manual labor with white skin in southern parts of United States. Why they should be open-minded or progressive with their beliefs? What is in that deal for them? Rigidly structured religion, which draws harsh lines between what is accepted and what is not is probably best community to shield poor people from hungry predators in our world of continuing economic downfall. Gun and Bible, it sounds like winning strategy in my ears. One ingredient offers internal cohesion, other part shields community from hostile outsiders.

I can read or listen news with three foreign languages; strong progressive attitude coloring actual news ( I call this phenomenon "liberal trash" with my friends) is so common, that Fox News are actually very refreshing exception in this propaganda mill. It is even more true here in Europe, where all kind of boringly blind liberals are conjuring their superstitious handwaving tricks to lead dear old EU from one abysmal failure to the next. I don't AGREE with this ideological wrapping coming with Fox, but I don't agree with liberal leanings of other media outlets either; how is Fox worse than rest of those propaganda machineries? It sounds to me that all these Fox-haters buy all this liberal brainwashing coming with more "respected" media outlets, but disagree with pseudoconservative brainwashing coming with Fox. So Fox must be BAD. Maybe it should be even banned..? Or at least regulated..? My deepest belief is that we all are just cavemen and -women, protecting our territories and beliefs with modern equivalents of stone axes. We, as species, have not evolved at all from those days, and we never will. We just have better technology. There is no sounder proof for this argument than behaviour and attitude of so called "liberals". They cannot follow what they preach.

Just think of the popular photos of Einstein, surely the high priest of science if not a god per the insight of an earlier comment. Marie Curie would serve nicely as high priestess. Even better that Einstein and Curie worked with the most arcane subjects of all (quantum and gravitational theory for Einstein, radioactivity for Curie), subjects far beyond the ability of us mere mortals to grasp. Popular culture also has scientists living monkish lives: stereotypical loners who don't get along with people and instead spend their time manipulating abstract mathematical symbols that later get turned into objects of religious adoration (tvs, cell phones, computers, rockets ...). So far they have been pretty successful at satisfying the religious needs of their societies (ever more fun toys have been cranked out for the ever-expanding collections of the people). But suppose further manipulation of abstract symbols produces fun toys at an ever-slower rate due to peak oil?

There's about 1.75 M B/D of corn ethanol and soy and other biodiesel. Corn ethanol is not a net energy gain, but the input is primarily natural gas as fertilizer feedstock. The remaining 1.75 - 2.25 M B/D is from "natural gas liquids".<br><br>So, the math works, though the presentation in the graph appears deliberately deceptive. The bio-fuels, especially the ethanol, is a way of converting Natural Gas to liquid fuel, and Natural Gas liquids are not useful as vehicle fuel.

The logic used is an example of the fallacy of arguments by analogy. I’ll try to explain my point. If we take four numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Now if we add the 1st number to itself we get the second number 1+1=2, so if we were to accept an argument by analogy each number added to itself is the next number in the sequence so 2+2=3, and 3+3=4. This is obviously wrong, just like basing decisions on previous experience don't mean that the conclusion is correct. Like != Same, or like is not equal to the same. <br>• <br>Thomas Malthus would have been right if it wasn’t for the industrial revolution, oil revolution and green revolution. He may still be right if you accept he didn’t have all the data. We have been given a grace of 250 (approx) years because of technology.

Still, there is a point in that this time. You guys are talking a lot about binary thinking; it should be remembered that this problem lurks in EVERY direction. You should not build boogeyman image around your political enemies. Most people watching Fox News are probably quite decent, ordinary folks. Just like most persons with especially rosy leftist-liberal worldview are nice people just trying to do right thing. Neither side is evil, they just look same thing from different perspective. I have been in regions healing from recent civil war, and what strikes me there is stealthy nature of escalation: things escalate out of hands step by step, everything seems like it is business as usual, until it is not. Please, you mighty Americans, don't escalate things. You are big and strong country, your population shares widely many basic values, build on it. Stop your own hatespeech, before you start nagging about to it to other side of conflict.<br><br>@Bill Pulliam: When I was studying English, term "hillybilly" was told to be degoratory and insulting. It seems that our teachers were a bit out of touch, like they usually are :).<br><br>@Liquid Paradigm: Christianity in North America is very different from its European forms. That's probably because you have so many reformists there, historical roots are not that strong, traditions are only some 500 yrs old; that is very short time for a cultural tradition. Many Manichean and old Zoroastrian doctrinal traits passed to current Abrahamic traditions have been rolling on some 2500 yrs now; it makes it quite hard for some TV preacher to flatten all mystical elements to some money fraud scheme over here in Old World. Still, it is not me who is doing binary thinking here, but you. You are reflecting your own inner daemons to external person with different opinions. I stated very clearly that I don't share pseudoconservative worldview of some TV gospels over there; I just expressed my compassion and understanding for poor white folks choosing their own way to deal with current crisis of Western culture. <br><br>In Western countries, leftist-liberal thinking and moral code works very well among educated, wealthy people. It is upper-class ideology, and it works well within that group, at least for now. To poor working class persons, picture is very different. For them philosophically fragile and complex value base of liberalism offers different outcome. Broken single-parent families, chaos of gender roles, boy-men who never grow to be decent responsible adults, predatory attitude towards sexual relationships, very common and casual drug abuse and total emptiness where your inner values should be. Belonging to Southern Baptist Convent is probably VERY good deal for these people, offering them real community and real values instead of this genocidal destruction left behind by Western leftist-liberal values.

And that IS a problem. Not...delivering...actual news when you are basically, you know, a news corporation.<br><br>Their political leanings instead are no problem per se. EVERY news corporation has political leanings, and you probably don't bash those that have same leanings as you do, eh..?<br><br>Here in Europe, we are ruled by liberal hegemony right now. There are right-wing liberals (equal to your mainstream Democrats perhaps) and left-wing liberals, but we have no conservatives in positions of power. What we have is growing nationalist and "far-right" opposition, especially popular among frustrated, under 40-year old working class males. Situation is same in basically all European countries. This situation has led to massive propaganda campaign by European news corporations, marketing rosy future of borderless, multicultural and happy EU to ignorant plebs. <br><br>At the same time, this political system of Europe build after WW2 and updated after fall of CCCP is practically falling apart. Economy is in free fall, and I truly mean free fall, and violence is popping up here and there. Everyone knows about Greece and Spain and to lesser extent about Italy, but did you know for example that immigrant youngsters are building barricades and throwing petrol bombs in Sweden? Rinkeby in Stockholm has seen some interesting action lately. It is like some street scene from Northern Ireland during Troubles.<br><br>This bad situation gone worse under propaganda coverage denying it all has made me little bit allergic to attacks against "conservative" and "nationalist" channels. Here in Europe we have seen SO MUCH liberal hatespeech and hatemongering against what is basically working class response against decaying and dysfunctional bureaucracy of EU that I just cannot listen what I suspect to be hatemongering against "conservatives/nationalists" without responding. <br><br>But thanks for you guys about some informative tips, now I know little bit more about your country, again :).<br><br><a href=#c6428131229317574294 title="comment permalink">3/25/13, 3:38 AM</a><br><br>

However there is a well known phenomenon known as the demographic-economic paradox which is the inverse correlation found between wealth and fertility. Increased wealth may also temporarily suppress death rates, by reducing childhood deaths mostly due to better hygiene. This effect wears off after a while, because people seem to be able to live only so long. Thus wealth leads suppresses population.<br><br>Populations naturally exhibit exponential growth patterns and are stabilized by natural feedback mechanisms. The negative correlation between wealth and fertility is one of them. A real problem in any dynamic system is that sudden changes induce large overshoots in seeking a new stable state, which can result in catastrophe if large enough. So perhaps one real problem throughout human history has been these wild over corrections to sudden changes, which are likely to be more severe in highly centralized systems.<br><br>This supports decentralization, cautious adaptations, and of course, conserving non-renewable resources.<br><br><a href=#c8020869856713526028 title="comment permalink">3/25/13, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

Just because it does not personally offend you does not mean that it is not equally propaganda (a VERY common mistake to make, in all political realms). I think perhaps it is you who are showing personal political bias in which news outlets you chose to criticize for political bias. Which leads to...<br><br>Sgage and I (if you read what we actually said) were not criticizing Fox for a particular point of view, we were criticizing it for being a willful purveyor of misinformation and out-and-out lies. I call it Faux News because the French word "faux" has become widely adopted in English as a euphemism for "imitation" or "simulated." We didn't emphasize the political direction these lies were coming from. Again, I think you are showing your own political biases, more than ours.<br><br>Personally I choose NPR because its information is factual, researched in more depth, covers a wider variety of topics, and is presented with less shouting and hysteria. I find the pervasive mainstream-center-left political slant of most of the coverage and talk shows to vary between amusing and annoying, but they get the actual facts right and they also let conservative voices on call-ins and in interviews speak their piece, uncensored and at length. But they still rarely step outside of the broader mythology of progress and techno-utopia that everyone else is invested in as well. <br><br>Anyway, the relative merits and approaches of the different mainstream news feeds is only marginally on topic here, since they all pretty much fall into the pattern that is the overall theme this week.<br><br><a href=#c7893483418047658876 title="comment permalink">3/25/13, 9:52 AM</a><br><br>

When it comes to trusting any ideological framework offered by current political options, I do not trust any of them. I do not exist on that landscape anymore, I have dropped out of it completely.

I get the impression that some people are making oblique comments that suggest they think I am somehow South-bashing. If so, this is coming from you not me. I am Southern born, bred, and raised. I've lived in the south for 38 of my 51 years; close to half of that in small towns and rural areas. My ancestors have been here since the 1600s and owned so many slaves that most of the people in this country who share my last name are black, not white. Robert E. Lee is my cousin (5th, 6 times removed, and the fact that I know that should tell you about the sort of bloodlines I come from). Southerners come in all shapes, sizes, and ideologies, and anyone is welcome here (yes, ANYONE; there are Hallal restaurants in Nashville); probably more so that in much of California or Europe. My modern Southern extended family even goes beyond Martin Luther King's dream, in that the daughters of slaves and the sons of slave owners didn't just join hands, they got married and raised kids together. Oh yeah, and my siblings and I were classmates in grade school with MLK's children. <br><br>'nuf said.<br><br><a href=#c4607438311449037597 title="comment permalink">3/26/13, 7:06 AM</a><br><br>

Fox could say (and did say) that Germany's solar power program is more successful than the program in the US because (drum roll) Germany gets more sunlight than the US. The Internet responded to this twaddle, but most of the Fox-watchers aren't on the Internet. They now think that the only way to make solar power work in the US is to move the US further north, which is obviously impossible.<br><br>More germane to this discussion, Fox has stated, implied, and insinuated that environmentalism is the cause of rising gasoline prices in the US. I can't imagine how a responsible news organization would begin to make that case: Fox doesn't bother to make the case, they just state it, usually in the form of a leading question, like, "Are you aware that environmental protections are the main cause of rising gasoline prices in the US?" It's a "leading" or "trick" question, because answering "Yes" signals agreement with this "truth," while answering "No" signals only ignorance of this "truth."<br><br>If you answer, "Environmentalism has nothing to do with rising gasoline prices in the US," you've stepped out onto a narrow bridge. Nothing, you say? What about this chart? What about this study? Don't you work for the EPA? So you're being PAID to support environmentalism. A-HA. A meaningful wink, a bland expression, a slightly drawn-out vowel-sound, and the interviewee's credibility has been destroyed. I watched this happen a number of years ago, and it made an impression.<br><br>Another common tactic is based on the fact that Fox News is actually in two pieces: the News portion, and the Opinion portion, which is categorized (legally) as "entertainment" and has no duty to be factual. So during the Entertainment portion, one of the popular talking heads can say, "I heard the other day that Obama is a baby-eating zombie from the Moon. What do you think of that?" They all chuckle and shake their heads. Two hours later, during the News section, they soberly report, "Some people have said that Obama is a baby-eating zombie from the Moon."<br><br>It's nothing new. Mark Twain used to complain about US newspapers all the time, back in the 1800's: "If you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed. If you read the newspaper, you're mis-informed." Now it's television.<br><br>That said, Fox appears to be one of the worst of the lot. My wife has given up on US news altogether, and goes to international sources if she wants to know what's going on here in the US.<br><br><a href=#c8067407570814725178 title="comment permalink">3/26/13, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

Like I said last week, I just spent a couple months in the middle of Denial - there wasn't a person I spoke to that was open to the possibility that these "facts and figures" by MSM were hype and smoke... I even tried getting my sister to watch an old James Burke video, on the 1968 NYC blackout and how it showed our society is dangerously resting on too much unknown circuitry (!! and how much NOW?) and her comment was, "I guess I'll just kiss my *** goodbye" - but from her tone, it's obvious she didn't think it would come up. And she had just gone through Hurricane Sandy! With the power out for 4-5 days (but nothing worse), she still hasn't changed her lifestyle, still no emergency generator or food stocks - she "managed" and just expects to do so again... it's that kind of denial that is impossible to penetrate. So I say nothing, continue learning how to garden, brew, raise small animals and gain self-sufficiency... and hope there comes an opening at some point.<br><br><a href=#c1270749150649406318 title="comment permalink">3/27/13, 6:47 AM</a><br><br>

When I read your original post, the one that started all this, my immediate reaction was, Good. An opinion that comes from another country, and not only that, from someone whose native language is not English. At least, I thought, your opinion would be something fresh, rather than the usual liberal denouncements of FOX as inaccurate and therefore dangerous because so many of "them" gobble up every word FOX broadcasts. <br><br>Your original post was not only fresh and new, it made a great deal of sense, in spite of some minor language issues. I got your meaning right away and had no problem digesting it. The follow-up posts you offered that clarified and amplified your points were excellent as well. <br><br>The most important idea I take away from my reading of The Archdruid Report, in light of the bleak times that will face our descendants (and perhaps us as well), is that every single assumption underlying the way of life we in the developed world take for granted will sooner or later be called into question. If that idea is indeed fundamental, then surely it is a good thing to rethink the meaning and the importance of FOX News and its many followers. Such rethinking is exactly what you did here this week. My thanks to you for expressing your thought-provoking ideas.<br><br><a href=#c2247054191035424693 title="comment permalink">3/27/13, 10:53 AM</a><br><br>

Often we have great discussions and often we but heads. We were butting heads one day over something, money printing I think. I was saying we were going to do something and he was saying that that something never works. True I said, but that doesn't mean we won't do it. He chuckled and then maintained his position.<br><br> It occured to me to say "we've made a lot of mistakes in the past and I don't see any reason to believe that we will stop making mistakes in the future." That did the trick. It occured to me today after rereading your post that our techno-progress culture believes it is done making mistakes. A central tenant of our mythology is that all mistakes are in the past and we have learned better for the future.<br><br> Again I see no reason to believe that we are done making mistakes.

So you see worldview based upon scientific materialism as inherently tolerant and other belief systems as inherently intolerant? Is that stereotype and prejudice that you project into world around you, or real truth? Yout assumption is VERY curious based on history of 20th century, where ideologies based solely on scientific materialism caused so immense bloodshed that it has never before been witnessed in human history. Do yoy really believe that deeply religious persons automatically start to hate "quirky personalities and behaviour" described by you..? I thought that religiosity has more to do with inner peace and integrity, and with having some value base anchored deeply into your worldview than being a hater.

And that is what I am seeing in this discussion. There are legitimate gripes about the accuracy of FOX's content but the big disconnect that I see is a fictitious divide over manufactured binary thinking. There are deep and fundamental differences between liberals and conservatives, the left and the right, the fascists and the commies, etc./whatever. Those differences, however, are rarely what we discuss. A sincere attempt to communicate between the parties might result in some very positive and workable understandings and compromises.<br><br> What is normally argued instead is an incredibly feeble, manufactured straw man. Purposefully engineered into binaries that hit upon warm fuzzies and cold pricklies for political advantage. (there are some here who try harder than others to be genuine and sincere, pointing them out or criticizing those who don't would be counter productive) There in lies a delicate game; there are advantages to be had from sincere attempts at understanding and there are different advantages to be had from obstinately refusing to understand.
