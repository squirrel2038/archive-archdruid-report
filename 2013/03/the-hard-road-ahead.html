The latest round of political theater in Washington DC over the automatic budget cuts enacted in the 2011 debt ceiling compromise—the so-called “sequester”—couldn’t have been better timed, at least as far as this blog is concerned. It’s hard to imagine better evidence, after all, that the American political process has finally lost its last fingernail grip on reality.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s start with the basics. Despite all the bellowing on the part of politicians, pressure groups, and the media, the cuts in question total only 2.3% of the US federal budget.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They thus amount to a relatively modest fraction of the huge increases in federal spending that have taken place over the last decade or so. (I sincerely doubt that those of my readers who were in the US in 2003 noticed any striking lack of federal dollars being spent then.) In the same way, those who protested the “tax increases” at the beginning of this year by and large failed to mentioned that the increases in question were simply the expiration of some—by no means all—of the big tax cuts enacted a little over a decade ago in the second Bush administration.<br>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At a time when the United States is spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year it doesn’t happen to have, and making up the difference by spinning the printing presses at ever-increasing speeds,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>a strong case can be made that rolling back spending increases and giving up tax breaks are measures that deserve serious consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Any such notion, though, is anathema to most Americans these days, at least to the extent that it might affect them. Straight across the convoluted landscape of contemporary American political opinion, to be sure, you can count on an enthusiastic hearing if you propose that budget cuts ought to be limited to whatever government payouts don’t happen to benefit your audience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Make even the most timid suggestion that your audience might demand a little bit less for itself, though, and your chances of being tarred, feathered, and ridden out of town on a rail are by no means small. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The only consensus to be found about budget cuts in today’s America, in other words, is the belief that someone else ought to take the hit. As politicians in Washington DC try to sort out which of the many groups clamoring for handouts get how many federal dollars, that consensus isn’t exactly providing them useful guidance. I’ve wondered more than once if the whole sequestration business is a charade, crafted by the leadership of both parties and tacitly accepted by the rank and file in Congress, that permits them to impose roughly equivalent budget cuts on as many federal programs as they think they can get away with, while giving each party enough plausible deniability that they can still manage to keep blaming everything on the other side. If so, it’s an ingenious strategem; the real challenge will come when Congress runs out of gimmicks of this kind and has to admit to the crowd of needy, greedy pressure groups crowding close around the feeding trough that the gravy train has come to an end. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That latter detail is the one piece of news you won’t hear anywhere in the current uproar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s also the one piece of news that has to be understood in order to make sense of the American politics in the present and the near future. When the economics of empire start running in reverse, as they do in the latter years of every empire, familiar habits of extravagance that emerged during the glory days of the empire turn into massive liabilities, and one of the most crucial tasks of every empire in decline is finding some way to cut its expenses down to size. There are always plenty of people who insist that this isn’t necessary, and plenty more who are fine with cutting all expenditures but those that put cash in their own pocket; the inertia such people generate is a potent force, but eventually it gives way, either to the demands of national survival, or to the even more unanswerable realities of political, economic, and military collapse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Between the point when a nation moves into the penumbra of crisis, and the point when that crisis becomes an immediate threat to national survival, there’s normally an interval when pretense trumps pragmatism and everyone in the political sphere goes around insisting that everything’s all right, even though everything clearly is <i>not</i> all right. In each of the previous cycles of anacyclosis in American history, such an interval stands out: the years leading up to the Revolutionary War, when leaders in the American colonies insisted that they were loyal subjects of good King George and the little disagreements they had with London could certainly be worked out; the bitter decade of the 1850s, when one legislative compromise after another tried to bandage over the widening gulf between slave states and free states, and succeeded only in making America’s bloodiest war inevitable; the opening years of the Great Depression, when the American economy crashed and burned as politicians and pundits insisted that everything would fix itself shortly. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We’re in America’s fourth such interval.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like the ones that preceded it, it’s a time when the only issues that really matter are the ones that nobody in the nation’s public life is willing to talk about, and when increasingly desperate attempts to postpone the inevitable crisis a little longer have taken over the place of any less futile pursuit. How long the interval will last is a good question. The first such interval ran from the end of the Seven Years War in 1763 to the first shots at Lexington in 1775; the second, from the Compromise of 1850 to the bombardment of Fort Sumter in 1861; the third, the shortest to date, from the stock market crash of 1929 to the onset of the New Deal in 1933.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How long this fourth interval will last is anyone’s guess at present; my sense, for what it’s worth, is that historians in the future will probably consider the crash of 2008 as its beginning, and I would be surprised to see it last out the present decade before crisis hits. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
During the interval before the explosion, if history is any guide, the one thing nobody will be able to get out of the federal government is constructive action on any of the widening spiral of problems and predicaments facing the nation. That’s the cost of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>trying to evade a looming crisis:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the effort that’s required to keep postponing the inevitable, and the increasing difficulty of patching together a coalition between ever more divergent and fractious power centers, puts any attempt to deal with anything else out of reach. The decade before the Civil War is as good an example as any; from 1850 until the final explosion, on any topic you care to name, there was a Northern agenda and a Southern agenda, and any attempt to get anything done in Washington DC ran headlong into ever more tautly polarized sectional rivalry. Replace the geographical labels with today’s political parties, and the scenery’s all too familiar.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If there’s going to be a meaningful response to the massive political, economic, and social impacts of the end of America’s age of empire, in other words, it’s not going to come from the federal government. It probably isn’t going to come from state governments, either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’s a chance that a state here and there may be able to buck the trend and do something helpful, but most US state governments are as beholden to pressure groups as the federal government, and are desperately short of discretionary funds as a result.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That leaves local governments, local community groups, families and individuals as the most likely sources of constructive change—if, that is, enough people are willing to make “acting locally” something more than a comforting slogan. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is where the dysfunctional but highly popular form of protest politics critiqued in <a href=../../2012/12/consuming-democracy.html>an earlier post in this sequence</a> becomes a major obstacle to meaningful change, rather than a vehicle for achieving it. As that critique showed, protest is an effective political tool when it’s backed up by an independent grassroots organization, one that can effectively threaten elected officials—even those of the party its members normally support—with removal from office if said elected officials don’t pay attention to the protest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When that threat isn’t there, protest is toothless, and can be ignored. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That distinction remains relevant, since very few of the groups gearing up to protest these days have taken the time and invested the resources to build the kind of grassroots support that gives a protest teeth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet there’s another way that protest politics can become hopelessly dysfunctional, and that’s when what the protesters demand is something that neither the officials they hope to influence, nor anyone else in the world, can possibly give them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If current attitudes are anything to judge by, we’re going to see a lot of that in the years immediately ahead. The vast majority of Americans are committed to the belief that the lavish wealth they enjoyed in the last half dozen decades is normal, that they ought to be able to continue to enjoy that wealth and all the perks and privileges it made possible, and that if the future looming up ahead of them doesn’t happen to contain those things, somebody’s to blame.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Try to tell them that they grew up during a period of absurd imperial extravagance, and that this and everything connected with it is going to go away forever in the near future, and you can count on getting a response somewhere on the spectrum that links blank incomprehension and blind rage. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The incomprehension and the rage will doubtless drive any number of large and vocal protest movements in the years immediately ahead, and it’s probably not safe to assume that those movements will limit themselves to the sort of ineffectual posturing that featured so largely in the Occupy protests a couple of years back. It’s all too easy, in fact, to imagine the steps by which armed insurgents, roadside bombs, military checkpoints, and martial law could become ordinary features of daily life here in America, and the easy insistence that everything that’s wrong with the country must be the fault of some currently fashionable scapegoat or other is to my mind one of the most important forces pushing in that direction.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Right now, the US government is one of those fashionable scapegoats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The <a href=../../2009/01/pornography-of-political-fear.html>pornography of political fear</a> that plays so large a role in American public discourse these days feeds into this habit. Those people who spent the eight years of the second Bush administration eagerly reading and circulating those meretricious claims that Bush was about to impose martial law and military tyranny on the US, and their exact equivalents on the other end of the political spectrum who are making equally dishonest claims about Obama right now, are helping to feed the crisis of legitimacy I’ve discussed in several posts here. The habit that Carl Jung described as “projecting the shadow”—insisting, that is, that all your own least pleasant traits actually belong to whoever you hate most—has a great deal to do with the spread of that mood. I’ve wondered more than once if there might be more to it than that, though. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s hard to think of anything that would give more delight America’s rivals on the world stage, or play out more to their advantage, than a popular insurgency against the US government on American soil. Even if it was crushed, as it likely would be, such a rising would shred what’s left of the American economy, cripple the ability of the US to intervene outside its borders, and yield a world-class propaganda coup to any nation tired of the US government’s repeated posturing over issues of human rights. Funding antigovernment propaganda here in the United States without getting caught would be easy enough to do, and plenty of hostile governments might find it a gamble worth taking. I find myself suspecting at times that this might be what’s behind the remarkable way that American public life has become saturated with propaganda insisting that the current US system of government is evil incarnate, and that any replacement whatsoever would necessarily be an improvement. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course that latter is a common opinion in revolutionary eras; equally common, of course, is the discovery that as bad as the status quo might happen to be, its replacement can be much, much worse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those who witnessed the French and Russian revolutions, to name only two examples, got to find that out the hard way. It would be helpful, to use no stronger word, to avoid a repeat of that same unpleasant object lesson in the postimperial United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As long as Americans keep on trying to convince themselves that the limits to growth don’t matter, the profits of empire never came their way, and the reckless extravagance that American popular culture considers basic to an ordinary lifestyle is no more than their due, steering clear of some such outcome is going to be a very tricky proposition indeed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It would be helpful, in other words, if more Americans were to come to terms with the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>fact that deciding what kind of future they want, and then insisting at the top of their lungs that they ought to have it, is not a useful response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead, it’s going to be necessary to start by thinking, hard, about the kind of futures a postimperial, postpetroleum America might be able to afford, and then trying to make the best possible choice among the available options. Making such a choice, in turn, will be made much easier once we have some practical experience of the way the various options work out in the real world—and this brings us back again to the question of local action. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nobody knows what political, economic, and cultural forms will be best suited to thrive in the wake of America’s failed empire, or to deal with the broader consequences as the industrial world stumbles down the long, ragged slope toward the deindustrial world of the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Plenty of people think they know; there’s no shortage of abstract ideologies proclaiming the one true path to a supposedly better future; but betting the future on an untested theory or, worse, on a theory that’s failed every time it was put to the test, is not exactly a useful habit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s needed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>instead, as the United States stumbles toward its fourth great existential crisis, is the broadest possible selection of options that have been shown to work. This is where local communities and community groups can play a critical role, for it’s precisely on the local scale that options can be tested, problems identified and fixed, and possibilities explored most easily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Furthermore, since the whole country isn’t committed to any one response, options tested in different places can be compared with one another, and the gaudy rhetoric of triumphalism that so often fills so much space online and off—how many projects, dear reader, have you seen hailed as the one and only definitive answer to the crisis of our time, without the least bit of evidence to show that it actually works?—can be set aside in favor of straightforward demonstrations that a given option can do what it’s supposed to do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In <a href=../../2012/12/enacting-democracy.html>an earlier post</a> in this sequence, for example, I discussed some of the possibilities that might come out of a revival of traditional democratic process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The simplest and most effective way to launch such a revival would be by way of existing community groups, which very often retain the remnants of democratic process in their organizational structure, or in newly founded groups using democratic principles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These groups would then become training grounds from which people who had learned the necessary skills could proceed to such other venues as local government, the organization of new political parties, or what have you, and put those skills to good use. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same principle applies to almost any other aspect of our collective predicament you care to name. Whether the issue that needs a meaningful response is the impending shortage of energy and other resources, the increasingly unstable climate, the disintegration of an economy in which accounting fraud is nearly the only growth industry left, and so on down the list, the scale of the problem is clear but the details are murky, and the best way to deal with it remains shrouded in blackest night. For that matter, there’s no way to be sure that the response that works best in one place will be equally well suited to conditions elsewhere. Tackle the issues locally, trying out various options and seeing how well they work, and the chances of hitting on something useful go up sharply. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It will doubtless be objected that we don’t have time for any such program of trial and error. Quite the contrary, we no longer have time for anything else. Spinning grand theoretical programs, waiting for the improbable circumstances that might possibly lead to their being adopted on a national or global scale, and hoping that they work as advertised if they ever do get put to the test, is a luxury best suited to those eras when crisis is still comfortably far off in the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We don’t live in such an era, in case you haven’t noticed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<span style="font-size: small">Over the decades ahead, the people of the United States and the rest of the industrial world are going to have to deal with the unraveling of an already declining American global empire, the end of a global economic order dominated by the dollar and thus by America’s version of the imperial wealth pump, the accelerating depletion of a long list of nonrenewable resources, and the shattering impact of rapid climate change, just for starters. If history is any guide, the impact of those already inevitable crises will likely be compounded by wars, revolutions, economic crises, and all the other discontinuities that tend to crop up when one global order gives way to another.  It’s going to be a very rough road—quite probably at least as rough as the road the world had to travel between 1914 and 1954, when the end of Britain’s global empire brought the long peace of 19th century Europe to a messy end and unleashed a tidal wave of radical change and human blood</span>. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style="font-size: small"> <span style="font-family: Times">Equally, the hard road ahead will likely be comparable in its scope and impacts to the harrowing times brought by America’s first three rounds of anacyclosis. To live through the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, or the Great Depression was not an easy thing; those of my readers who are curious about what might be ahead could probably do worse than to read a good history of one or more of those, or one of the many firsthand accounts penned by those who experienced them and lived to tell about it. The records of such times do not give any noticeable support to the claim that we can have whatever kind of future we want. The kinds of hope they do hold out is a point I plan on discussing next week. </span></span></div>

<div class="avtb a_acec5f" id=c4345565331764435424></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/18384203614010320491 rel=nofollow>Joel Caris</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Hi JMG,<br><br>One of my pet peeves in my occasional visits to liberal political blogs is the commonality of seeing people who loudly proclaim the need to address climate change also proclaiming the need to get economic growth going again via their own preferred approach, which usually boils down to the sort of Keynesian, spend-and-grow policies espoused by Paul Krugman. They will, on one hand, speak of the need to lower consumption and then, a moment later, go on a rant about how Republican obstructionism is killing our ability to engage in a massive, government-backed stimulus program to kick start the economy.<br><br>Setting aside the myriad reasons that won't work in these early days of contraction, this complete inability to see the broader picture drives me nuts. If we're truly going to address climate change and live more sustainably, that's going to have to begin with scaling back our lives, and to a pretty dramatic degree. Sure, some think that we just need a massive renewable build out and all will be just fine--again, setting aside the reasons we can't easily, and won't, do that--but many even recognize the need for us to scale back and live more simply even as they're beating the economic growth drum. It's like they silo off the various issues and refuse to see the connections. Of course, I think it is indeed a refusal to see the connections, because that would then threaten their own comfort and desires.<br><br>Meanwhile, there's also massive amounts of scapegoating of Republicans, of religious people, of rural people, so on and so forth. And it comes just as eagerly from the conservative side. Then I'll see liberal groups--sometimes offshoots from the Occupy movement--who seem to get it a bit more, maybe talking about gardening and local food and reduced energy usage, transitioning from fossil fuels, and who distrust both political parties. But then they'll start talking of Tesla devices, vertical farms, Bucky Fuller at his most optimistic, and the coming consciousness shift that's going to provide us a shiny new world devoid of all these pesky problems.<br><br>Meanwhile, very rarely do I see people just fessing up to the personal need of scaling back <em>their own</em> life. That's one of the reasons I try to be so blatant and truthful on my blog about what I'm doing and not doing, what I've been successful at and the ways in which I've failed, because I keep coming back to the core idea that this is all about changing <em>our own lives</em> rather than waiting on someone else to take care of things. This is about getting down to the hard work at hand.<br><br>Anyway, I'm rambling on. My point is that I'm glad you continue to harp on this point, because I think it's one of the most important and most overlooked points of our time.<br><br>I've been meaning to pick up a good account of the Great Depression and this post is further motivation to do that--as well as a couple accounts of the other anacyclosis periods. (I'll do my own research, but if you have any particularly good suggestions, I'm all ears.) I'm also really looking forward to next week's discussion of hope. I remember writing a comment here maybe a year or so ago about icicles coming out of a garden hose on a cold morning, and how the knowledge that no matter how hard the future got, that sort of beauty would always be an available and abundant part of the world was a major source of hope for me. When you get right down to it, overabundance isn't much of a hope. It seems to lead more to distraction and degradation. Challenging as the future will be, the world will still be full of beauty, biophilia will always be available to us, the opportunity to help others will abound, and those are real and honest hopes.<br><br><a href=#c4345565331764435424 title="comment permalink">3/6/13, 10:34 PM</a><br><br>

Massive amounts of energy and money are needed to keeping the whole thing running in a way which is acceptable to everyone, and in which everyone can be acculturated enough so that they feel part of an organic whole.<br> If it can no longer function, then the first person, state, or group to exit wins. This is game theory at work and I expect serious secessionist movements to arise. They will of course be met by a heavy handed federal response.<br><br>2) The United States has always been an ethnically diverse place, but this has exploded since the 80s, with large scale immigration from around the world. We maintain birthright citizenship, so once somebody is born here there is no "sending them back" to where their people came from. As such, the prospect of even sending back illegal immigrants from Mexico is basically nil.<br>This has begun to demoralize many native Americans, mostly white and blacks but also Asians and Hispanics who were more early comers. And we seem committed to endless immigration and population growth!

V. Glinchikova. Her late husband, when he was a young man, had been a banker in St. Petersburg in the days of the last Tsar. By chance, they happened to be in San Francisco (on his bank business) when the Russian Revolution of 1917 broke out in all its violence; and they were prudent enough not to return to Russia just then. Of course, they followed all the developing Russian state of affairs by all available means, including short-wave radio. It soon became obvious that they would die if they ever returned to Russia, so they stayed in California. <br><br>One evening she and I were talking about some American political issue or other, and I remarked that my parents hated and had feared FDR, and were certain that he would have become a dictator if he had not died in office. With some heat she told me that she and her husband had seen at first hand what led to the 1917 Revolution in Russia, and kept up with its aftermath there. They had also lived through the years of the Depression here and through all four terms of FDR's presidency. It was their carefully considered opinion that only FDR's high-handed measures and his careful spending of all his political capital had prevented a similar, even bloodier Revolution here. Had FDR not done what he did, she said, the United States would have descended into an all-around civil war by around 1940, and the end result of that bloodbath would have been someone as ruthless and determined as Stalin in power here.<br><br>I have been thinking ever since about what she said. If she was right, there you have the reason why the crisis of 1929-1933 was the only one of the three so far that lasted a mere 4 years, and also the only one that did not end with an open civil war throughout the land. (The 1776 Revolutionary War, of course, was the first civil war on the English-speaking part of North American landmass. Since it ended with the expulsion of the losing side from the new United States, it didn't have the same long-range political consequences that played out over the following hundred years.)<br><br>Whether our current crisis will find its own equivalent of FDR is an open question. What may not be an open question is how events will play out over the next ten years.<br><br><a href=#c6765512289310085836 title="comment permalink">3/6/13, 11:13 PM</a><br><br>

I'd never heard of sequestration before this week and now your blog is about the third place the term has popped up (must be a new economic fad). Interestingly, the word also has a geological / energy definition (carbon sequestration) which I actually had heard of before. Yes, burying the dead indeed! Ere ‘e says he’s not dead yet!<br><br>I had a thought today about why the Dow Jones is going through the roof. Just speculating, but I believe it may be due to the printing of money. As more money is printed over a longer term, the value of the dollar doesn't remain static, but it actually devalues. The increase in the stock market is actually - I believe - an indicator of this devaluation. Investors may have more dollars, but they are worth less so you need more dollars to buy the same stuff that you previously were buying. It may not have occurred to those investors, but the paper wealth is suffering an unusual and perhaps unexpected form of inflation (you heard it here first!).<br><br>Interestingly too, I have come across anecdotal reports that house prices in the US and fuel prices have increased and this is also an indicator of a devaluing dollar. Historically, printing money has mostly always ended in hyper inflation.<br><br>People have trouble thinking in terms of an entire system. Poke or tweak one bit of a stressed system and you will get unexpected and unintended outcomes elsewhere.<br><br>Rising stock markets and house prices are certainly not cause for celebration - or the articles I see here saying a US recovery is underway.<br><br>Interesting times.<br><br>By the way, many thanks to whoever posted a link to the Automatic Earth article of the mass rollout of renewables. Strangely enough this article mirrors my own experience with renewables. The difference with small scale off grid renewables is that you have a battery with which to manage the peaks and troughs in demand and supply. On a national and international scale it must be a nightmare to manage.<br><br>Regards.<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c2032746555520064954 title="comment permalink">3/7/13, 3:03 AM</a><br><br>

On the one hand I know many people who are personally experiencing real limits to their current prosperity and future expectations, and who are loosing faith in the rising-tide-lifts-all-boats consensus of the last few decades; and on the other many people are doing very well with paper wealth in the age of liquidity. And in the middle there are still plenty of people who haven't yet noticed much of anything. This is just my gut feel, but it seems a reasonable supposition that more and more people in the middle will be getting hit with a tough reality while a decreasing but tight-knit bunch of high-rollers look to be more and more out for themselves. This is shifting our center of gravity and doesn't augur well for future cohesion. I really hope the leadership class wakes up, and soon.

There is an odd seeming paradox for the USA, even after the global financial disruption triggered by an apparently domestic crisis in the USA – the sub-prime mortgage lending crisis.<br><br>(Just as a footnote; here in Britain our part of the 2007/8 financial disruption has been successfully pinned politically on the previous incumbent government. Such is the parochial nature of vision and understanding in the remaining 64M core of a previous global empire.)<br> <br>One point could be that though the mechanisms involved revolve mainly round the central position of the USA, they are evident also generally within the trading network of advanced industrial economies.<br><br>The ‘paradox’ seems to be that USA, even after 5 years, remains, apparently ‘successfully’, very much out of balance in both trade and financial flows:<br><br>Quote:<i> [T]he biggest [international] borrower of all, [is still] the United States, [yet the US] is viewed mainly as a safe haven by lenders.</i><br><br>Quote:<i> [T]here is another, domestic dimension to the pileup of international obligations. Domestic debt rises too and could reach unsustainable levels that could lead to domestic financial crises.</i><br><br>I think I am gradually getting my head round this still continuing phase in industrial civilisation. It still seems worth a try to anchor thought in reality as best we can. The next phase after ‘this one’ could follow very rapidly, (‘breakpoints’), but I do not see much change yet in current trends: they are still trending. The landscape round us keeps changing for sure; but it has for a while now as you have pointed out, and we have kind of got used to these trends, however much they ought to offend our notions of ‘progress’. <br><br>Much of this is summed up usefully in the recent academic work of Michael Kumhof and colleagues; see quotes. (The IMF Research Department is not to be confused with IMF political leadership – Kumhof as a scientist and citizen feels it would be irresponsible to neglect study of issues such as, for example Peak Oil, as well as the relationship between inequality and debt, both international and domestic.)<br>My quotes above are from a paper by Kumhof &amp; Ranciere titled; “unequal = indebted”; http://ineteconomics.org/sites/inet.civicactions.net/files/kumhof-micheal-berlin-paper-unequal%20indebted.pdf <br><br>He and his team have published a series, including an important review of the nature of money, which I am slowly taking on board. Just a quote from what is for me an extraordinary preamble discussion of the history of money. Discussion goes back a bit, since, well, at least the debt-forgiveness introduced by Solon in 599 BC:<br><br>Quote: <i>“The earliest known example of such debt crises in Greek history are the 599 BC reforms of Solon, which were a response to a severe debt crisis of small farmers, brought on by the charging of interest on coinage by a wealthy oligarchy.”</i><br><br>Now isn’t that nice?

I'm not as willing to write off the mechanics of protest, however. Certainly the organized, bureaucratized institutions of "dissent" -- with their direct mail campaigns touting tax-dectible status are as useless as you say. And Occupy was never going to knock over Wall Street - partly because it declined to be an institution. And that is significant, because talking to people who take part in things like that, I don't see the selfish naivete that you ascribe. To the extent that there's a claim on material things, it is about distribution and justice rather than about claims to some particular level of prosperity. (And that is a protest worth having, I think, whatever size of the pie being carved up.) To go into detail would take a post as long as yours, but I think local organizations could benefit from hearing some of the shouts that are being crafted in angry protests. <br><br>Most people who protest the Keystone pipeline don't understand what it might mean for their internet connections -- but many do actually, and if there is going to be a public conversation about that it is as likely to emerge from such gatherings as anywhere else -- if only because so much of it is unmediated by media and "expert" opinion and occurs among people themselves and their networks.<br><br><a href=#c8591131750473991448 title="comment permalink">3/7/13, 6:00 AM</a><br><br>

The way in which use of oil undergirds our way of life is probably not that apparent. Since I found my way to the peak oil blogs a few months ago, I am asking myself, what was I thinking? What was my own awareness? I know I had heard things, I know that the phrase peak oil was not absolutely new to me. But unless you stumble across something that lays it out pretty clearly, it just gets thrown in the messy, overflowing closet of the brain in this age of information overload.<br><br>For example, I do recall that I had heard many years ago that people in the US use 25% of the worlds resources. But it did not occur to me that we had the thing called a wealth pump going. That the third world countries were being taken advantage of in a way that was directly related to our getting more than our share. For one thing, telephones, electricity and airplanes were all invented in this country. So it might seem natural that we self developed these things and other countries did not. <br><br>In the end, I think a major impediment is simply that our way of life seems normal, so the idea that economic growth equals more use of fossil fuels, even for those concerned about climate change, might not quite click without some help. <br><br>Then, too, while I take JMG's prescription to change our lives individually and locally seriously, there is nonetheless a sense of futility in being a drop in the bucket - speaking not so much of those with the awareness level spoken of in Joel's post, but people in general, I think that there is unfortunately a big impasse created when the major media don't admit to something's very existence. Even when people hear of things floating around in the infosphere, it might not really get concrete for them when it just doesn't appear to be a real concern as they go about their day and turn on the TV. <br><br>Speaking of incomprehension/rage, I really believe that if people were spoken to honestly, they would weather great changes fairly calmly. <br><br>As for the relation to climate change, I don't know what percentage of people are on board with that. I am not convinced, and I can't help but wonder if the mainstream media talk about climate change is a back door way of getting people motivated to cut back on our lifestyle. I think it is much more motivating for people to believe that they must make this sacrifice to save the planet, than simply because we are a profligate empire and acted like a fool who inherited money, the party is over and it ain't comin back.<br><br><a href=#c5303609388544499059 title="comment permalink">3/7/13, 7:10 AM</a><br><br>

If they had to settle for the amounts of energy that a typical Central European uses, Americans wouldn't have a Central European quality of life, but something vastly inferior to it, simply because they don't have the kind of infrastructure that Central Europe does. <br><br>I'm not American, but I currently live in one of the large-ish American cities with a less than stellar public transportation system, and so I've had a chance to experience this first hand. It so happens that I don't own a car, something exceedingly rare in this area. When I was moving here, I knew that the city was built for cars and not for people, and so I tried very hard to find an apartment that would allow me to get around without a car. Result? I found an apartment that allows me to walk to work in about 15 minutes and to the grocery store in about 50 minutes. I don't have much of a life beyond that: few things are accessible without a car. The apartment that I have is much bigger than anything I needed or wanted (and the wastefulness of heating that place does not escape me), but I couldn't find anything smaller within walking distance of work, and public transportation is rather unreliable. The point being... I spend a rather small amount of energy compared to the people around me, an extravagant amount compared to people in many other countries (think: large, poorly insulated apartment), and yet get a rather inferior quality of life for it. <br><br>As it so happens, I'm leaving in a few months. Moving overseas. What I'm saying is, I can see (sort of) why Americans feel entitled to such high amounts of energy: without it, they're basically [unpublishable word].<br><br><a href=#c8346558240834015580 title="comment permalink">3/7/13, 7:20 AM</a><br><br>

In the 1930s and the 1860s the crisis was addressed by the absence of one of the quarreling parties from the national stage, and I have a hard time seeing the current impasse breached in a bipartisan manner. <br><br>Speaking of first-hand accounts living through the major crises of our national history, I found one that points up how long our national obsession with urban elites moving "back to the land" has been with us. Ten Acres Enough, published in 1864, is a first-person account of a Philadelphia businessman selling out to buy a small market farm in New Jersey, where he and his family rode out the Panic of 1857 and the Civil War in relative peace in humble, market farm style. It went through at least six printings in the first two years, according to the publishing notes in my copy. <br><br>I don't see myself becoming a small farmer, and I know that many people use an unattainable fantasy of buying a farm as an excuse to avoid doing anything useful in their own lives. Still, it was interesting to me to see that not all first-hand accounts of these eras of crises were downers. This one talks about a family with modest means and modest aims, working hard and living simply and getting by with relative stability in tumultuous times. <br><br>p.s. My copy of NTFWO just arrived, but I doubt I'll have time to read it for a couple of months.

In the simplest of all situations, money ultimately comes from taxes on citizens and corporations. Local taxes should pay for local needs such as schools and police, state taxes should pay for state needs, federal taxes for federal needs. Our federal taxes should pay for the army, not the local cop. When the feds start subsidizing the states, control is ceded to the guy holding the purse-strings. <br><br>There are some cases where a public subsidy could make sense, where no private company or coalition of companies could be counted on to meet the need with their own financing. Sometimes the subsidy would fund something wholly owned by the goverment (schools, hospitals), other times would grant a monopoly to a business (utilities.) <br><br>Business cases are easy to make when things aren't subsidized. If the public doesn't want it, they won't pay for it. The accounting gets fuzzy on subsidies. Highways are seen as a boon, improving the economy for everyone. Government dollars spent on highways and infrastructure will be made back many times over with increased tax revenue on all the businesses spurred by the projects, right? Sure, we can make the numbers say that. <br><br>Chuck Marone has the numbers over at www.strongtowns.org, pointing out how the suburban build-out isn't sustainable even with a non-dire view of the future. It's not economically viable even if conditions remain exactly as they are. But centralized budgeting creates so many disincentives to reasonable development. Because cities are begging for money from state and fed, what they build has to mesh with centrally-planned goals. While standardization and systematization is a good thing, central planning can look really dumb when you come down from 35,000 feet and get in the weeds.<br><br><a href=#c4695361188301943908 title="comment permalink">3/7/13, 9:06 AM</a><br><br>

Those who witnessed the French and Russian revolutions, to name only two examples, got to find that out the hard way."<br><br>I was wondering if you might expand on this-- on the dangers of revolutionary projects, and how to counter them-- either in the comments or in a future post. As someone who's spent a great deal of time on the radical Left, this frightens me. I see incipient Stalinism everywhere radical ideologies operate, including regular purges, constant internal policing and the constant shifting of the rules of acceptable behavior, and the universal denial that any of this is occurring. After being purged from a particular radical group I was part of some years ago, I spent (and continue to spend) a great deal of my time studying the history of the twentieth century socialist revolutions, especially the Russian, with an eye to the question, "What leads to Stalinism?" I think that there is something about the combination of a Manichaean concept of social life; a Millenarian historical outlook; and a Messianic belief in the rightness of one's views not only for oneself and one's community, but for everybody in the world. Combine these "3 Ms" with a rejection of any restraint on power (either through rejection of democracy, as in authoritarian socialist groups, or embracing pseudoconsensus, as in anarchist groups) and a will to violence, and you have a recipe for the next Terror. <br><br>Anyway, I'm afraid that we're likely to see this sort of thing, at least on the small scale, in the various iterations of Occupy and so forth that turn up over the next few decades. Actually, it's a fear born out of seeing the culture of Stalinism infiltrate and take over every activist group I've ever been a part of. I think, maybe, I'm posting this in the hope that you have some kind of incantation to keep the wolves at bay, or maybe some kind of secret formula from the democracies of yore. Anything? <br><br>Also, it occurs to me that many of the things I post here are rather negative in tone.

How could the government not have money if it can print it (yes, in reality it's electronic, of course). Where else does money come from? The U.S. is a sovereign issuer of currency - it can have as many or few dollars as it wishes. Whether it should or not is a different argument.<br><br>Obligatory disclaimer: I don't necessarily agree with this opinion, but I should point out that the left in the U.S. believes that stimulus and dealing with climate change are not necessarily contradictory. In a perfect world, we would be spending it on what we really need - a more sustainable post-carbon economy and energy-efficiency measures for a post-peak world. Things like public transit, solar and wind power, insulation retrofitting and the like are investments we should be making now before they become harder as the peak oil slope begins to curve downward. <br><br>In reality, of course, it's a giveaway to entrenched interests, but I think many on the left holdout hope for something better. In fact, recent studies have shown that in an economic downturn, people care <i>less</i>, not more, about environmental issues. And the cancelled rail project from coast to coast, not to mention the smog enveloping Athens from cutting down all the trees for heat, belie the notion that austerity is necessarily good for the environment.<br><br>In periods such as the one we're in, centralized authority falls apart and individuals are left to their own devices. But as Nicole Foss has pointed out, centralized authorities are unlikely to simply sit back and let localization take its course with the requisite loss of power that entails. For example, several states are relaxing marijuana laws. I don't partake myself, but it seems like it's a natural booster for local economies from several different directions (potential tax revenue, reduced incarceration, increased economic activity, etc.) Yet the Federal government has always cracked down at the behest of the police/incarceration complex. And recent laws make it a felony to even take a photo of what goes on in feelot operations while raw milk and free-range pig producers are raided with SWAT teams. We can expect more of this as time goes on.<br><br><a href=#c619149419874202381 title="comment permalink">3/7/13, 10:05 AM</a><br><br>

Not that I want to drag the city vs country thing into the debate but, er, well, yes, I guess that’s exactly what I want to do …<br>You made it perfectly clear that community situations (and thus blueprints for community resilience experiments) will be different in respect of place. My question in essence is, can words such as “community” or “resilience” have the same meaning in a city of 10 million and say, an old mill-town of 10,000 inhabitants? One reason I ask is a recent report stating that 60 of the 80 million new souls on the planet each year will live in cities. Another is that, in the biggish metropolis where I live, neighborhood vegetable gardens have popped up in every district over the last few years. I don’t doubt they provide some ‘community’ experience for the handful of people who participate but they’re all postage-stamp size and none of them could feed even one family. It seems this situation could be the source of some of the messier aspects of the future “messiness” you refer to. What’s your take?<br>PS – I have read the “Urban-Ag” headliner on the resilience dot org web-site and noticed that, in his conclusion, the author recognized that, to achieve its “potential greatness,” the movement still needed to be “leveraged into something bigger.” But how do you leverage a postage-stamp?<br><br><br><a href=#c5881671996924974753 title="comment permalink">3/7/13, 10:54 AM</a><br><br>

That might be more of an American thing. I'm an anarchist and most anarchists I know are quite critical of consensus. We work by majority vote. There's no will to violence that I'm aware of either. Some anarchists are pacifists. I agree with you about many of the problems with such groups though. We've very consciously avoided the Stalinisation bit (and we've been around a couple of decades) but have plenty of other problems. I guess what I'm saying is that not all radical groups are potentially creators of the next Terror. Revolutionary changes don't need to be violent or chaotic. There's a role for radical ideas in any healthy political system I think.

There's no real hard, sharp line that says printing dollar #1-Quadrillion-578 is any worse than printing dollar #1-Quadrillion-577 which has already been printed.<br><br>There is of course a limit there somewhere. The past strength of the dollar was (in part) based on the assumption that the US wouldn't abuse the financial system the way it has. You can't print money forever. But there's no sharp dividing line that says dollar #578 is abuse while dollar #577 was not.<br><br>Climate abuse basically works the same way. There are all sorts of regenerative and feedback systems in nature, so it's virtually impossible to specify that dumping gallon #578 of ethidium bromide into your local stream is all that much worse than dumping gallon #577.<br><br>JMG is big on the power of limits and speaks and writes of them often. I remember your discourse about how our skeletons limit us from falling into a gelatinous puddle, and our chairs limit us from falling on the floor, and so on. But those are sharp, easily defined numerical limits. <br><br>Maybe JMG could discourse sometime about the differences between "hard" and "soft" limits, the kind of limits that you only see clearly after you've crossed over to the other side already. How do you anticipate them, how do you communicate them to others, what guides your strategies. <br><br>A discussion of "soft" limits could, of course, include the limitations of the scientific and numerical / mechanical model of the world itself -- in cases like printing dollars or disposing of waste, the philosophy or model that we can quantify the world exactly and numerically is apparently flawed, an illusion that deludes us into thinking we're in control of something we're not. While the mechanist philosophy has its uses of course, it seems to me that in many situations principle, fuzzy quality, conscience and belief is at least as important (if not moreso) than exactitude. <br><br>Apropos: a recent <a href=http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/14820-why-johnny-cant-read-or-win-wars rel=nofollow>article</a> about the proliferation of quantitative test scores in schools: <br><br>&gt; As Yankelovich noted, "The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This is O.K. as far as it goes. The second step is to disregard that which can't be measured or give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is artificial and misleading. The third step is to presume that what can't be measured easily isn't very important. This is blindness. The fourth step is to say that what can't easily be measured doesn't really exist. This is suicide."<br><br>JMG, as a specialist in the unpopular subject of limits, I would love to hear you discourse on the differences between hard and soft limits.<br><br><a href=#c3891824693024955372 title="comment permalink">3/7/13, 11:13 AM</a><br><br>

I've suspected for a long time now that the back to the land thing has very deep roots in the American psyche; it might be worth someday researching and writing a book on the subject. <br><br>Reaper, it's precisely control that's at issue, and the opportunities for graft that come by way of control. That's the reason so many functions reserved to the states and the people under the constitution have been illegally taken over by the federal government: easier to milk the system that way. <br><br>Steve, I'll consider that for a future post. <br><br>Escape, granted, but you understood instantly what I was talking about. I didn't want to insert a three-paragraph discussion of the dangers of inflating the currency to pay government debts when that wasn't the theme of the post. <br><br>Jess, the last two administrations have been pretty obviously preparing to fight a color revolution, probably Chinese-funded, on US soil. They'd be idiots not to -- we've done it often enough to other countries that payback is an obvious risk, and as I mentioned in the post, such a thing would be a massive coup for all America's rivals. This is simply one more step in that direction. <br><br>J Gav, we simply don't know what size of community will do best in the next stage of decline. Obviously I'm guessing that a small city in the middle of a rural zone full of small farms is the best bet, but the people who think that big cities will do well might be smarter or luckier than I am. Certainly different strategies are appropriate for different sizes of communities -- the postage stamp sized gardens, for example, are good as training grounds, from which people with a basic grasp of gardening methods can graduate to the truck farms that will spring up amid the dying suburbs.

I did mention that being a system, it is inherently large and complex. Manipulations in one variable will have many unintended and unexpected outcomes in other variables which may or may not be related. <br><br>Perhaps a good analogy of the US economy at present is the French invasion of Russia in 1812. Seriously overextended and facing food, men and supply shortages the retreating French armies were hammered and their allies left them. Prior to this time, Napoleon was considered to be an undefeated military genius who had access to a massive army, allies and resources. Defeat probably seemed unthinkable to the French when they set out on the invasion.<br><br>Which brings me to the next point. A number of commenters have indicated that in relation to printing money: <br><br>Quote: "The U.S. is a sovereign issuer of currency - it can have as many or few dollars as it wishes. Whether it should or not is a different argument."<br><br>Quote: "There's no real hard, sharp line that says printing dollar #1-Quadrillion-578 is any worse than printing dollar #1-Quadrillion-577 which has already been printed."<br><br>Those arguments are both correct and incorrect at the same time as they affect the very long supply lines that the US currently enjoys for its imperial wealth pump (which is why I mentioned Napoleon).<br><br>The reason being is that money is only worth what someone else will exchange it for, hopefully for an item of real value (or even another currency). The above two quotes represent a US centric point of view in relation to the printing of money.<br><br>However, outside of the US an alternative view is taken in that individuals and countries are being asked to accept these tokens in exchange for items of real value (such as Oil). <br><br>These individuals and countries are collectively not stupid and they know that the US is currently printing money faster than it generates real wealth. There will come a point in time when the value of exchange between US currency and real world assets is not as favourable as it presently is. This is a serious risk, which I get the impression has very little air time in the US media.<br><br>Which gets me back to Napoleon. Someone else mentioned the potential for war. Imagine for a moment that a country imports 50% of their daily energy supplies - particularly that used in transport - and also much in the way of manufactured goods, and then ask how can this same country wage a war to obtain additional resources? It starts looking like a logistical nightmare to me and also one that is doomed to fail.<br><br>Napoleon found out the limits of his army the hard way, why can we not learn from the past? I have no wish to find out what the limits of US economic chicanery will be, but sooner or later we will.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c574251560566093729 title="comment permalink">3/7/13, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

Make even the most timid suggestion that your audience might demand a little bit less for itself, though, and your chances of being tarred, feathered, and ridden out of town on a rail are by no means small.</i><br><br>The problem I have with this construction is that it at least implicitly posits an equivalency between all government expenditures. Declaring that everyone simply wants to protect their own "handouts" is a description of the mechanics of the process, sure, but nothing more. What is at root here is that not all expenditures are created equal in the eyes of citizens and where in the pecking order we place them is a function of a variety of things, most basically our core moral beliefs.<br><br>Is there anyone among us who's going to argue that spending $1.1 trillion to develop and operate the F-35 fighter plane is "just like" spending $1.1 trillion on health care? Don't both have radically different outcomes despite having the same face value? It's the nature and quality of these differences in outcomes that make it at least inaccurate to describe the groups representing these expenditures as equally guilty of wanting handouts the government can no longer afford. <br><br>The fact is the government *can* afford some things. It may or may not be in the measure to which all parties want. Because of the decline in growth described well enough in all the blog posts here, what can be afforded is decreasing. Choices will have to be made. So what is actually at issue in society is how what is left of that shrinking pie is going to be distributed. And since it's there to be distributed (let's remember that much of it is in fact just spending tax dollars that everyone already paid into the system, in which case they are certainly entitled to it) it's going to, well, be distributed. <br><br>Intimating that "everyone" should take a cut in some equal measure just won't fly for the sort of reason illustrated by my example above. Society is already far too unequal for that to have any chance of working. People will quite reasonably say that if there is to be a come down, it must be done fairly. (It can't be that, for example, there are cuts to social security on one hand, but taxes for the already wealthy also go down.)<br><br>I guess the ultimate point I'm making here is that it's virtually impossible to have this discussion without referring to specifics. Such as when you say "pressure groups" and describe them as "needy and greedy," who are we talking about? The ones lobbying for more food assistance for school lunches or the ones lobbying for the maintenance of subsidies for banks? Abstracting it actually obscures more than it reveals by, IMO, unfairly throwing everyone into the same pot.<br><br><a href=#c8722305483007733829 title="comment permalink">3/8/13, 8:14 AM</a><br><br>

I am a college student who lives off around 600$ (part time Waiter) a month to pay for my apartment, food and utilities. I see many folks on the street or whom even work with me struggling and frustrated with life who would blame it on a lack of material wealth. Fortunately, due to my upbringing, I learned to value true knowledge much more than wealth. I learned how to learn, and over time taught myself how to stay in good physical health, which has led to good mental health, which has led to a more focused and rewarding existence. These "other folks" I speak of, are stubbornly holding onto the idea, that wealth and status are what is needed to be happy, where as happiness itself is a just a balance of neurotransmitters. Many folks with the right knowledge and health could and presently do live a rewarding fulfilling life, with a minimum wage job or some other economic function. <br><br> I would advise you and your readers to remember that wealth is not interchangeable with health nor happiness. Health is the core and pinnacle of a rewarding and enjoyable life, and in my opinion the first stepping stone to it. Much of the real and imagined "wealth" is going to disappear in the next decade. However, that should not discourage anyone in the slightest, because it is the choices we make with the knowledge we earn that make up the happiness, that many will need to "redefine" in the coming years. This crisis will be a crisis due to unfulfilled expectations, except for the true regional disasters that happen as a result of these "unrealistic expectations."<br><br>Truth is a dish many hunger for, however few ever develop a palette for its bitter taste.<br><br>For those who have a palette for such bitter taste, you might start your highly skeptical journey to better health, by sorting through information with a hefty serving of critical thinking. I arrived in the "ancestral" foods and "paleo" diet lifestyle, and these terms I use very loosely, because reality is always more complex than it appears. Don't let me bias you, but part of the critical thinking process is looking at information you disagree with, which is all to rare to do, as the "google search bar" has led to a psuedo-scientific era of extreme conformation bias.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><a href=#c5516384873457624551 title="comment permalink">3/8/13, 10:25 AM</a><br><br>

The country that I live in has a lot of experience of "empire" being a successor state to the British Empire. <br><br>"Empire" for this place was an expensive proposition having embroiled us in two world wars from day one of each, costing us hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded. <br><br>American forces did spare western Europe from being over-run by the Red Army. Aside from that, from my own perch, I have trouble over-estimating America's power. <br><br>IMO America is influential to a degree but mostly via "soft power". I don't think that the nomenklatura in Russia or China take orders from Americans. They have their own base of political support, their own military and economic resources. <br><br>Hillary goes here and there, Obama gives speeches, a jihadi here and a jihadi there gets greased. And so what? Nobody listens to Americans. American diplomats have been bending the ears of Israelis and Palestinians for decades. To what end? Israelis and Palestinians hate each other's guts and get depressed unless they're planning to kill one another. They can't wait to get to the next assassination. You got rid of Khadaffy. Big deal. Hosni is gone. Congrats. Is Morsi better? <br><br>Plus consider that the US has been defacto defeated in Afghanistan by illiterate farmers wielding rudimentary weapons. And left the Iraqi hall of mirrors with its tail between its legs unable to discern friend from foe. Vietnam was a disaster, Korea was a draw. <br><br>Some "empire". This is no "empire". <br><br>If the US was an empire worthy of the name the first thing it would have done is to conquer the country to the north given that it's militarily weak, disunited and sparsely populated. And bursting with resources. But the US didn't. Americans buy the resources, Americans don't steal them. Resource royalties don't go to American state capitols or Washington, the money goes to Canadian coffers. <br><br>From this vantage point America looks like a relative newcomer in the world. A world whose shape was determined by far older powers and civilizations. <br><br>Having said all this, there's no doubt that the US can no longer afford it's military (as ineffectual as it is) with it's dozen or so carrier battle groups and dozens of submarines cruising majestically hither and yon. Americans no longer have the economic or financial base to afford it having offshored manufacturing capacity to Chinese adversaries, effectively putting it under the control of the Chinese people's Liberation Army. Dumb move that was. <br><br>But it's no use crying over spilt milk. The millions of good paying American jobs with the income taxes they provided government treasuries are no more. They are in China. The dollar an hour Chinese laborer thanks you profusely. <br><br>So the jobs are gone and not coming back. The question is where do you go from here. <br><br>History rarely provides second chances. The USA will contract. Will it be an orderly settlement of debts? Will it be a calamitous bankruptcy? Will the crisis of 2008look like foreplay in comparison? <br><br>It looks like the powers in Washington are bound and determined to sustain the unsustainable with pedal to the metal money printing. This has been tried before with disastrous consequences. Never mind the examples of hyperinflation, look at what excess money printing accomplished since the 1990s: one asset bubble and bust after another, each more ruinous than the last.<br><br>Want some advice?

On the way home we stopped at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Our primary reason for stopping there was to look at the USS Cairo, a steam-powered ironclad gunboat that was sunk near Vicksburg during the Civil War. While we were in Vicksburg, we also stopped at the Old Depot Museum, and that's where this story becomes relevant to your post. Somehow I hadn't heard about the siege of Vicksburg during the civil war. The museum exhibit and video remedied that. All I can say is that no sane person would want to have a repeat of that experience or any of the others that occur during civil strife. Unfortunately, sanity may be in shorter supply than we would like, as your post points out.<br><br>It's not quite time to get seeds going in the open garden in St. Louis because we can still get lows in the single digits practically the entire month, but I have flats of onion and cabbage seedlings growing under glass and will soon be starting many more seedlings in flats to await planting in spring. In that vein, I just got a copy of Steve Solomon's new book The Intelligent Gardener: Growing Nutrient-Dense Food. I'll post a review at Green Wizards when I get more into it. I mention it in case other gardeners might want to check it out.<br><br><a href=#c3176901161935826260 title="comment permalink">3/8/13, 5:02 PM</a><br><br>

I find myself usually in full agreement with your posts from a "back to the Land" aspect while totally disagreeing with a large part of your political conclusions.<br><br>A couple of things though. The US government does not print money. The Federal Reserve prints the money and then gives it to the US government at a price. To date as near as I can figure the FED is not taking full payment of the money it is owed. I figure this is because they can't and they know they can't, if they did everything would fall apart. They are taking as much as they can while also letting the few other investors in the game take what they are owed in full and letting the rest ride.<br><br>I honestly cannot tell you how long that charade can last. With the FED not taking everything it is theoretically owed as long as they are willing to take only what they can safely get it could go on a long time.<br><br>Also I noticed someone way up commenting on the ecological fallacy of rural states getting more federal dollars than urban ones. I believe they used Miss. and NJ as examples. That comment is confusing production wealth with income wealth and forgetting that the current government does not tax them equally. It also manipulates the data by allowing the middle man export states to keep more money at the state level with promises of matching funds. Much like the rope-a-dope the FedGov does with education spending.<br><br>Point in fact rural states produce far more tangible wealth than the middleman urban areas and therefore real value.<br><br><br><a href=#c4069256582791927714 title="comment permalink">3/8/13, 5:34 PM</a><br><br>

I would argue that they are not involved and as such any value judgement as to allocation is meaningless.<br><br>In addition, say for example your job relied on that $1.1tn spent on the F35 fighter. Wouldn't you be more concerned about retaining your job than providing health care services to someone you don't know, somewhere else? I suspect that for your statement to be true then people would have to be more altruistic than they actually are.<br><br>Also, framing a spending argument as a choice between military or health, forgets that other items are important to other people. What about tax concessions for the wealthy? What about spending on transport infrastructure? What about subsidies for energy? What about spending on foreign aid? It just goes on and on. The list of people lining up at the feed trough is long indeed.<br><br>Quote: "And since it's there to be distributed (let's remember that much of it is in fact just spending tax dollars that everyone already paid into the system, in which case they are certainly entitled to it) it's going to, well, be distributed."<br><br>This is incorrect. Paying taxes is no guarantee of a present entitlement to benefits from the expenditure of those taxes. Your taxes go towards paying for social security. Those people on social security may not paying any taxes, do you think that they are entitled to those funds?<br><br>Quote: "So what is actually at issue in society is how what is left of that shrinking pie is going to be distributed."<br><br>The problem isn't that the pie is shrinking, it is that the pie is being enlarged through accounting chicanery. The pie itself is still quite large.<br><br>Overall your comment suggests to me that you are passively expecting that the distributors of those tax dollars are going to act in a moral and ethical manner. There is no indication that this accords with reality.<br><br>Dunno, but would you be happy with access to only 20% of the stuff that you currently enjoy if that sacrifice benefited others?

Thank you. <br><br>Kathy, it's a complicated issue, and one that may need a post to itself down the road a bit. The language of moral absolutism has become so pervasive in today's American politics -- see AtticaBlue's piece right below yours for a stellar example -- that very few people notice that this sort of talk only appeals to those who already agree with the viewpoint being addressed. Thus the incessant preaching to the choir that pervades every corner of the US political landscape these days. In your place, I don't know that I'd quit on the spot, but it might be good to see if you can leverage this break into something that will get you into another job with a group that isn't so deeply into scapegoating. <br><br>AtticaBlue, in other words, you're trying to use a language of moral absolutes to claim that the federal expenditures you support deserve funding, while those you don't support don't. That's certainly your right -- but I think you'll find, if you get out a bit more, that there are plenty of Americans who think that defense is a better use of federal funds than health care, and they have as much right to have their voices heard as you do. <br><br>I don't claim that all federal expenditures are morally equal, for what it's worth, though the places where I'd draw lines would likely upset you just as much as they'd upset my readers on the far right. The point I was trying to make, though, was that from the perspective of Congress, they <i>are</i> equal: each one is a demand for funds, backed by some constituency, with a certain amount of political clout. Whether or not it's right that they be treated that way, that's how they're being treated.<br><br><a href=#c2652375671686980611 title="comment permalink">3/8/13, 10:28 PM</a><br><br>

Modern medicine is all about dosing one or a few molecules with shockingly little regard for the interactions between them and how evolution has produced workable solutions that work for the organisms that synthesize these compounds. It has even more disregard for the traditions built up through thousands of years by humans over the span of most of human history as to what organisms, in what doses, produce what effects for what human conditions.<br><br>I suspect that there is a spectrum of truth here: some of these herbalist traditions have significant amounts of truth to them that have been undiscovered by modern science, some are simply incorrect, and some are in between.<br><br>I do know that we need to solve this problem as soon as possible - organisms are easier to grow than pharmaceuticals that usually turn out to be creatively engineered petrochemicals, when oil is in short supply.

(Religions continued to write some of the lessons into their rule-books for a long while afterwards, to try to factor-in monetary stability when large scale social-theft, even more than the more personal kind, was recognised as having a pretty universal downside.

That was very kind of you to say so.<br><br>What twigged the analogy was that some of your essays and the comments to those essays are butting up against a certain sense of entitlement. However the entitlement is dependent on very long supply lines and these are always a structural weakness.<br><br>Long supply lines are also in the forefront of my mind because, being cut off from services here that most may take for granted, nature has rammed this lesson into me this summer. <br><br><a href=http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/adelaide-and-melbourne-to-get-even-hotter/23966 rel=nofollow>Adelaide and Melbourne to get even hotter</a><br><br>Oh my, what's going on? We are way past a 2 degrees Celsius increase in average temperatures here and records have most certainly been broken. Six of the Ten hottest years since records began (about 1870) have been in the past decade.<br><br>Anyway, the long supply line here is water and because of the upcoming heat wave, I had to make the decision to put 2,000L (528 gallons) of water across the several hundred fruit trees. They won't grow much, but hopefully it should keep them alive. In the past few days, I've also been mulching heavily and adding mushroom compost so the mulch doesn’t starve the trees of nitrogen when they can least afford to be further stressed. Yesterday, I even had a bit of heat exhaustion from doing this work over a few days, "cooking your head" as I call it! I’m feeling better now though.<br><br>Anyway, it got me thinking about Napoleon's supply lines as he set out to defeat the Russians. Did you know that of the 615,000 French troops that headed out on that ill-fated expidition, only 110,000 returned and of those only 27,000 were still considered fit?

I should have written that the rest of the world knows the United States doesn't care about these issues. In a sane world, Barack Obamas recent speech at the United Nations during which he assured his government would continue to support human rights and democracy, would have received the derisive laughter it deserved. As it was, I'm sure there there was plenty of quiet sniggering later at dinner, if not during the speech. <br><br>Mind you, it's a tendency not openly acknowledged in diplomatic circles except perhaps by those officials from countries such as those led by Evo Morales and the late Hugo Chavez, who despite their imperfect record, have done their very best to protect their people from your well described Imperial Wealth Pump - which is exactly why they attract displays of contempt in Western Media and Punditry of the kind this week aimed at the late President Chavez. It's a case study of Chomsky's "Danger of setting a good example".<br><br>Naturally as the Wealth Pump weakens and the limits imposed by resources and climate tighten, we can expect more of this posturing about 'human rights' and R2P etc, while behind the scenes, the training and funding of the most extreme groups to be found will continue at an ever more rapid pace, in the targeted nations - whether they set a "Good Example" or not - in all those regions with some mineral wealth to be stolen, or who form part of the strategy to do so. <br><br>A prime recent example was Libya and the latest example is Syria, where Arabian Gulf State and US funded groups of what can only sincerely be described as Terrorists have fomented a brutal civil war, with the Civilians caught in the indiscriminate crossfire. The next target is of course Iran. The rest of the 'developed' world has by and large 'recognised' the puppet Syrians in Washington as the 'legitimate' government, mirroring Clinton's rhetoric, and it doesn't take much to realise that the reason for this is a jockeying for position in the queue for the Wealth Pump handouts to US 'Allies'. <br><br>This is the point at which the non-acknowledgement of the aforementioned phenomenon suddenly becomes clear, since those in the queue for Imperial Handouts use such "Noble" rhetoric to justify US supporting Foreign Policy stances amongst their own increasingly skeptical and restive populations. <br><br>I appreciate my going into detail about the Realpolitik here is slightly off the main topic, but I hope it will help some readers to understand the world in which we are living in and the world to be expected in the very near future. Although the policies I have just described have been going on in some form since the first human Empire rose to power, it should be observed that the behaviour that characterises these policies in our modern era is becoming increasingly more frequent and desperate in the post-peak world we live in.<br><br><a href=#c3591869836477907412 title="comment permalink">3/9/13, 4:54 AM</a><br><br>

This makes it difficult or impossible for Tokyo, for example, to try to steal a factory from Osaka by offering a sweetheart tax deal. This kind of dealing is rampant in the US, with state and local governments tripping over each other in a fight to lavish bigger subsidies than the other guy. Any businessman with an ounce of common sense nowadays knows he can extort the local government out of a few million bucks every once in a while just by threatening to move his business down the road a few miles. If there is one over-riding positive feature of central governments (including the UN or its analogs), it is that they have the ability to short circuit this problem, essentially forcing sub-jurisdictions to cooperate in a prisoners' dilemma rather than repeatedly defecting.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c6798662414412796030 title="comment permalink">3/9/13, 5:20 AM</a><br><br>

I grew up in the Deep South, in a place the media are now pleased to characterize as "red". I moved away after high school, went to college and then lived and worked in big cities in two different states. In middle age, I returned home to help care for an aged parent, got a job teaching school, and stayed. Most of the people in this area are are likely the opposite of your co-workers in your social justice non-profit. For example, the small Baptist church I attended faithfully with my family as a child, as well as the county itself, is full of lockstep Republicans, which is to say that they dismiss anyone who expresses anything other than steadfast resistance to abortion rights, gay rights, total access to guns, etc. I have some experience of the opposite opinion as well, having lived in cities and having made friends with people who think of themselves as "progressive" and who think that most of the problems of our time can be properly laid at at the feet of George W. Bush. I have managed to live peacefully, however, because I have always had a certain skepticism about anyone, left or right, who claims that his or her ideology provides a direct line to universal truth. I try to avoid "political" arguments and instead try to keep things concrete. Thus, I have found that some of the more extreme right-wing types still can occasionally have insights and information that can be useful for anyone. And of course the same can be said of annoying leftist liberals as well. In short, I make it my business to be, if not a friend, at least a good neighbor. I want to be able to count on the people I live near, and I want them to know that I am someone they can count on too. <br><br>But, as to your specific situation, I would suggest that you look into teaching school as a way to get away from the problem you describe. Becoming a schoolteacher is not an ideal solution, of course. Far from it. I agree with opinions that have recently been expressed here by JMG and others that our education system is seriously, maybe hopelessly, flawed. Even so, as a public education teacher I have found a niche in which I can connect in some worthwhile way with kids who have no choice but to inherit whatever world we leave for them. So, I pay lip service to the system and all its foolishness, subverting it when it seems sensible, and thinking of my "real" job as doing whatever I can to help make meaningful the transition from child to adult for those human beings whose lives are entrusted to me for a few hours each day. <br><br>Everyone's life is different, and this suggestion for you may be impractical for any number of reasons, but I offer it, nevertheless, as a serious alternative to what you are currently doing. In any event, I offer you my best wishes and the knowledge that one person out here understands your dilemma.<br><br><a href=#c4628858498642035875 title="comment permalink">3/9/13, 9:56 AM</a><br><br>

I recently finished a very readable book “Deep Simplicity” by John Gribbbin that I thoroughly enjoyed. Gribbin got into explaining how mathematics now clearly understands that even though simply equations can be used to deterministically explain things they cannot be used to predict results. Sometimes this is due to sensitivity to initial conditions but in other cases it is the nature of the math to produce results that come under the heading of chaos. <br><br>Further he got into discussing the problems with modeling and the reality that our reductionist science view based on simplified models can be problematic. I suspect that math is still taught in school as producing rigid absolute results when this is only true within tight limits. It is all much more complex and unpredictable than society wants to believe. <br><br>Tom A <br><br><br><a href=#c454864013813398320 title="comment permalink">3/9/13, 11:59 AM</a><br><br>

I mean whatever group you hail from, you have core beliefs common to that group. The competition between those groups, and by extension their core moral beliefs, is what defines conflict. So I was certainly not saying that there is only a single set of beliefs. There are indeed many.<br><br>@Cherokee Organics<br><br>Well, people do elect other people to represent their interests. The degree to which that happens is of course debatable, but evidently those representatives must be representing *someone's* interests--unless we're arguing that they're representing some interest that literally isn't of this earth. <br><br>As regards the military vs. health spending argument, I don't think we disagree. My examples were just that. You can substitute anything you like such as the ones you mentioned. The dynamic of conflict and competition, and of there as a result necessarily being "winners and losers," still remains.<br><br>On the issue of taxes/spending I make no statements about guarantees. I only say that whatever money there is will be distributed. Naturally, there will be competition for that money.<br><br>I have to disagree with you on the pie comment. In fact, both a shrinking pie and accounting chicanery are happening at the same time--there's certainly no natural law that says it can only be one or the other. (The central point of this blog is that the pie is shrinking because of resource limits.)<br><br>@JMG<br><br>Again, let me clarify that I'm not referring to just *my* moral compass. I'm saying everyone has their own compass and these are in conflict. I was only taking the additional liberty of guessing that the typical (note I say typical, not "only") visitor to this blog--who likely thinks the ecological ideas discussed here are good ones, that we should live with a lot less stuff, that empire is a bad thing and so on--is almost certainly not the same person who thinks massive military expenditures are a good idea and so would not bother to pretend that they think the claims on resources made by the various sides are equal. <br><br>And while I take your point about how Congress sees it, do you think they really see these groups as equal? For example, is the National Chamber of Commerce no more or less equal than the Worker Rights Consortium in the eyes of Congress? Or isn't it true that the actual rules/operation of trade mandated by government reflect a power or influence differential--which is to say, an inequality--very much in favor of the former organization? So the groups and their claims *don't* actually get treated or seen equally by Congress.<br><br><a href=#c1385328866842516809 title="comment permalink">3/9/13, 12:02 PM</a><br><br>

Having the government work as an employer of last resort of sorts. A kind of next step after the New Deal.

The degree to which that happens is of course debatable, but evidently those representatives must be representing *someone's* interests--unless we're arguing that they're representing some interest that literally isn't of this earth."<br><br>I'd argue that companies and large trusts have more rights than individuals. If a company kills a person through negligence, does that company go to jail - or get wound up? Can an individual pay a fine to get out of similar legal predicament?<br><br>As they can also marshal larger resources too, they also have their interests represented better within the political system. It is debatable whether such lobbying should even be tax deductible. I would argue that there is insufficient nexus to their incomes for it to be tax deductible, but this is an unpopular view.<br><br>Many large trusts in the US have charity tax exempt status where they may have initially been setup by very wealthy people to avoid paying death duties. Have you noticed how often their children are employed by these entities? Is this equitable? Those trusts can then pursue their own agendas without reference to the greater good of society.

Although not flawless --- the study of echinacea had to be scrapped when they found out retroactively that the "echinacea" they had studied was actually a shipment of turkey rhubarb root --- they do offer some definite information.<br><br>I also recommend the writings of herbalists Michael Moore and Stephen Harrod Buhner, both of whom have/had a background in biochemistry (and Buhner in medicine as well) and discuss the specific chemical mechanisms of many herbs as well as how those mechanisms affect various human health issues. For example, Moore in one of his books gives a detailed explanation of how a tincture of a specific herb which is considered to be a liver tonic affected the lipids in his bloodstream when he took a dose after consuming a meal rich in "bad" cholesterol and other fats; he took samples of his own blood at intervals and examined it to find what results the herb was having, and wrote it all up for the reader to follow.<br><br>Buhner also writes evocatively about the biochemistry of plants in a range of ways outside of herbalism, including how plants communicate with one another by way of chemical secretions. One of his examples is of how a healthy tree attacked by gypsy moths will secrete a chemical that triggers other healthy trees in the forest to produce chemicals in their bark which discourage the moth infestation from spreading. The breakdown of this process is what encourages gypsy moths to infest damaged or otherwise unhealthy trees and forests.<br><br><a href=#c2095317392782061119 title="comment permalink">3/10/13, 10:07 PM</a><br><br>

I'm nowhere near educated enough about all the factors to have a properly informed opinion on that, just suspicions. But if we just look at the performance vs. cost of operation:<br><br>http://www.frequencycast.co.uk/howmanywatts.html<br><br>On this site, a typical desktop PC has an average draw of 90W, an LCD monitor 75W, and at 8 hours of use per day an annual cost of £52.31. The iphone 3G has a 2W draw and an estimated yearly cost of £1.90.

This is the idea that technological advances can/will supply a solution to energy supply deficiencies.<br>The basis for this view has developed through my conversations with others about what can be done about “oil depletion”, etc. Time and again, I have heard “technology will come up with the answers needed”. This is coupled to the insanity that an answer will be forthcoming just because of the deep need for it (necessity is the mother of invention, don’t cha know). It is clear to me that this perception is centered on a conceptual error. Simply, that technical advance, almost, always follows greater availability and utilization of energy. This idea needs to be reinforced by obvious examples that everyone is familiar with.<br>1. The movement and utilization of oil, in vast quantities, is accomplished through very deep energy usage for the construction and operation of pipelines, refineries, super tankers and so on.<br>2. All alternative energy sources that utilize high levels of technology require significant initial energy input to be brought into operation such as dams, atomic reactors, solar cell factories and their processes, wind turbines etc. The energy input comes first and in many cases is greater than the ultimate total of energy obtained. But the most important point is to note the sequence. <br>3. The most classical demonstration of the issue is in the profoundly mistaken effort to gain control of an atomic energy source through hydrogen “fusion”. Here the potential energy return is enormous, but most of it needs to be fed back into the process, in order to have it operate at all (magnetic confinement of the reaction “plasma” requires unseemly levels of electrical power). I suspect that this is the biggest “boondoggle” of our times and that a valid and detailed energy utilization accounting of this effort will show that this is the case. Again, however, energy in, first.<br>These understandings have to become a major part of public discourse in as many ways as can be pursued, before real conservation and movement away from concentrated energy usage can be brought into being. <br><br>All the Best, Ben Simon<br><br><a href=#c3938706239954748120 title="comment permalink">3/11/13, 11:56 AM</a><br><br>

Lerwill</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Rarely do I disagree with your posts, JMG, but this time I must take issue with the first few paragraphs this week. You point out that the 2.3% sequester and the roll-back of some tax breaks are but a small fraction of the increases in public spending over the last decade or so. You then go on to point out how the empires wealth pump behaves differently when an Empire is collapsing.<br><br>I would argue that the wealth pump is already running in reverse. Those tax cuts, particularly the 2% payroll tax reduction, helped hide this unpleasant reality from the majority of people. While the intent of the tax cuts was to get “people spending” the reality was it didn’t even cover the price inflation in necessities. Hence the stimulus programs had such a weak impact on overall economic activity – but a huge impact on the perception of business as usual. The impact of these expiring tax cuts is therefore magnified by the delayed impact of a decade of decline.<br><br>Federal stimulus dollars, not tax receipts, are paying to repair and maintain our roadways, to pay many public sector employees, to keep a lot of people that used to be paid from local taxes still in a job. Federal guarantees backstop the for-profit education industry that waves the illusion of a good paying job in the future, to pay off the non-dischargeable student loans. I believe the 2.3% cuts, applied to those programs that don’t have the strongest defenders at the trough, will also be greatly magnified. <br> <br>The ground has fallen away under our modern industrial society. Government borrowing and tax cuts allowed people to hang on to the very rickety economic glider going over that energy cliff. The decade of stimulus behind us means those losing their grip today have a longer way to fall than those who let go and adjusted a decade ago. <br><br>Of course, it’s going to hurt even more the longer we hold on…<br><br><br><a href=#c1001377399741493315 title="comment permalink">3/11/13, 8:31 PM</a><br><br>

Grain harvests in UK were well down and poor quality.

You can say that again!
