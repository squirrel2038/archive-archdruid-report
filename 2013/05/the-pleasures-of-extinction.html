One of the wry pleasures that’s repeatedly come my way since the beginning of this blog seven years ago is that of watching a good many of my predictions come true in short order. Now it’s true that I’ve also made a certain number of failed predictions over that time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Back in 2007 and 2008, for instance, I insisted that the US government wouldn’t be dumb enough to try to cover its ballooning budget deficits by spinning the printing presses; some idiocies, I thought, were too extreme even for the inmates of the current American political class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As th Fed proceeds merrily through yet another round of quantitative easing, that assumption has proved to be rather too naive. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even so, my batting average so far has been pretty respectable. In the early days of this blog, for example, Daniel Yergin was insisting at the top of his lungs that the price of oil would settle down shortly to a long-term plateau of $38 a barrel, while fans of a dozen different alternative technologies were claiming just as stridently that if the price of oil ever got to the unthinkable level of $60 a barrel, the technology they favored would be profitable enough to sweep all before it. There were very few of us back then who predicted that oil would go quite a bit past $60 a barrel and stay there, and even fewer who pointed out that abundant cheap fossil fuel energy made alternatives look much more viable than they were. These days, with oil wobbling around $100 a barrel and most of the alternatives still wholly dependent on government subsidies, that turned out to be tolerably prescient. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the last few weeks, another of my predictions has turned out spot on the money. A little less than six months ago, as New Age bookstores around the world were quietly emptying entire bookshelves dedicated to December 21, 2012 and putting 50%-off stickers on the contents, I noted
<a href=../../2012/12/the-beginning-of-world.html>in a blog post here</a> that it wouldn’t be long before people who were looking for an excuse to put off doing anything about the crisis of industrial society would have a replacement for 2012. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Well, it’s here. The latest apocalyptic fad is near-term human extinction, or NTE for short: the claim that humanity, along with most other life on Earth, will inevitably be extinct by 2030 at the latest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s probably necessary to say up front that humanity will certainly go extinct eventually—no species lasts forever—and there’s always the chance that it could happen in short order; a stray asteroid with enough mass, or a few rearranged codons in some virus nobody’s heard about yet, could do the job quite readily. Still, there’s a great difference between claiming that human extinction is possible and insisting that it’s certainly going to happen in the next seventeen years, especially when the arguments used to defend that claim amount to nothing more than an insistence that worst-case scenarios are the only possible outcome. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a tolerably long history to such claims. When I was growing up in the 1970s, there were people on the far end of the environmental movement who insisted that humanity would certainly be extinct before the year 2000, and the same prediction has been repeated with different dates and justifications ever since. Those of my readers who remember the Solar Temple mass suicides of 1994 and 1995 may recall that the collective suicide note left behind by the members of that ill-fated order made exactly that claim:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Earth would be uninhabitable by the year 2000, Solar Temple founder Luc Jouret insisted, and so the initiates of the Solar Temple were getting out while the getting was good. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the early days of the peak oil movement, similarly, the same insistence on imminent extinction popped up tolerably often. I was convinced at the time, and remain convinced today, that this was largely a product of an odd and very American habit I’ve termed "apocalypse machismo."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One consequence of America’s pervasive anti-intellectualism, with its frankly weird equation of manhood with chest-thumping brainlessness, is that many male American intellectuals end up burdened by doubts about their own masculinity, and some of them respond by trying to talk as tough as possible; intellectual women in this male-dominated culture find they often have to copy that same habit, sometimes to even greater extremes, in order to get taken seriously at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This has been a major factor all through America’s recent history; the neoconservative movement, packed as it was with academic intellectuals whose obsession with proving their own virility on a global stage drove them into one foreign policy fiasco after another, makes as good a poster child as any. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the same way, we had a lot of apocalypse machismo in the early peak oil movement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the first few years of this blog, for that matter, I could count on fielding (and deleting) a comment every month or two from somebody who wanted to talk about the new scenario for imminent human extinction he’d just worked up. The Deepwater Horizon blowout and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown fielded a bumper crop of the same thing; those of my readers who doubt this are invited to go digging back through the archives of any unmoderated peak oil forum, where they’ll find, in the days and weeks immediately following each of these disasters, colorful if implausible scenarios predicting the imminent demise of all life on earth presented as sober fact. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
No doubt there’s at least some of that at work in the sudden surge of interest in near-term human extinction, but I question whether it’s the main driving force this time around. There are at least two other factors that are likely to be involved, and one of them unfolds directly from the points made in the last few posts in the current sequence. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The shape of time sketched out by Augustine of Hippo in the pages of <i>The City of God</i>, and adopted thereafter by most of the western world until the rise of the later mythology of perpetual progress, allows a range of variations. Even within the mainstream of western Christianity, the options extend over a much broader landscape than most of my readers may realize, and the versions of the Augustinian mythos found outside the Christian mainstream are even more diverse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In his useful 1998 book <i>Millennium Rage</i>, sociologist Philip Lamy argued that most beliefs about the future in today’s America are "fractured apocalypses," in which the events foretold in the Book of Revelation are pulled out of context and rearranged in response to contemporary social trends. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
His insight can be applied a good deal more generally: the whole Augustinian story has been subjected to similar treatment. Eden, the Fall, the vale of tears, the righteous remnant, the redeeming revelation, the rising struggle between good and evil, the final catastrophe and the return to paradise thereafter—you’ll find these, or most of these, in a great many current belief systems, but the order and relative importance of each element may vary, and it’s far from uncommon for one or two of the classic themes of the story to be stretched nearly out of recognition, or deleted entirely.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One detail that often comes in for serious reworking in modern social movements is the final step, the one in which the elect are welcomed back into paradise while everyone else is herded into the lake of fire to be punished for all eternity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The habit of morphological thinking discussed earlier in this sequence of posts is of crucial importance here: take a close look at the development over time of social movements that embrace the Augustinian narrative, and the historical shifts in that last part of the story have a fascinating message to communicate. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The wave of Christian fundamentalism that’s currently breaking and flowing back out to sea makes a good case in point. Back in the days of the Jesus People and the Good News Bible, when that wave first began building, its rhetoric was triumphant: the whole nation was turning to Christ, the rest of the world would surely follow, and the imminent Second Coming would see everyone but a few stubborn sinners rushing forward joyfully to embrace God’s infinite love. Fast forward a couple of decades, and the proportion between the saved and the damned shifted significantly closer to the sort of thing you’d hear in an old-fashioned hellfire-and-brimstone sermon, but the saved were still utterly convinced of their own salvation:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>those were the days when "In Case Of Rapture, This Car Will Be Unoccupied" bumper stickers sprouted on the rear ends of cars all over America. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You won’t see too many of those bumper stickers these days. Just as the optimistic faith that a new generation could win the world for Christ gave way gradually to the far more pessimistic vision of a world mired in wickedness from which the elect would shortly be teleported to safety—beamed up by St. Scotty, as the joke had it, to the bridge of the USS Enterchrist—so the serene confidence on the part of believers that they would be numbered among the elect has been replaced, in these latter days of the movement, by an increasingly pervasive sense of sin and unworthiness. Too many dates for the Rapture have come and gone, too many once-respected preachers have been caught with their pants around their ankles in one sense or another, and the well-founded suspicion that the Republican party is using the evangelical churches every bit as cynically and shamelessly as the Democratic party is using the environmental movement has got to weigh on a lot of once-hopeful minds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Christian theology places hard limits on just how far the exclusion from future blessedness can extend, as there has to be "a great multitude, which no man could number" (Revelations 7:9) of the saved gathered around the throne of God when the boom comes down. Outside Christianity, the same process routinely goes much further. A good example is the New Age movement, which emerged out of a variety of older fringe spiritualities right around the same time that the current round of Christian fundamentalism got going in America. The early days of the New Age movement were pervaded by the same optimistic sense that a new and more enlightened epoch was about to dawn, and everyone—even, or especially, those who made fun of the movement’s pretensions—would soon fall in line. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the movement matured and the New Age stubbornly refused to arrive, in turn, the same mood shift that affected fundamentalism had a comparable impact; New Age teachers began to talk more about the ascension of enlightened individuals into higher planes of being, the activities of evil powers who were maintaining the illusion of a world of limits, and the imminence of a world-cleansing cataclysm that would finally get around to ushering in the New Age. By the time the hoopla began building over 2012, finally, the prophecies trotted out in advance of that much-ballyhooed nonevent ranged all over the map; there were still optimists of the old school, who insisted that a great shift in consciousness would make everyone get around to agreeing with them; there were many more who expected mass death to leave the world purified for the usual minority of the elect; and there were no small number who were retailing scenarios in which the entire human race would be exterminated.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is a familiar rhythm in the history of American popular spirituality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At regular intervals, some movement that’s existed out on the fringes for decades suddenly gets a mass following, turns into a pop culture phenomenon, and has thirty to forty years of popularity before it returns to the fringes. Some traditions repeat the process; Christian fundamentalism has had two periods of pop stardom—once between the Roaring Nineties and the Great Depression, and then again from the late 1970s to the present—and a strong case could be made that the New Age movement is a rehash of the vogue for occultism that was so huge a part of American pop culture between 1890 and 1929. Other movements fill the void when the ones just named head for the fringes; from the 1930s to the 1970s, liberal Christian churches were a dominant force in American religion, and there’s some reason to think that the pendulum is headed the same way again as fundamentalism sunsets out a second time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If human beings were rational actors, as economists like to imagine, they wouldn’t respond to the disconfirmation of their beliefs by postulating world-wrecking catastrophes. Here as elsewhere, though, the fond fantasies of economists stand up poorly as models for predicting events in the real world. If you haven’t had the experience of devoting decades of your life to a failed belief system, dear reader, try to put yourself into such a person’s shoes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It would take a degree of equanimity rare even among saints to look back on such an experience without harvesting a bumper crop of resentment, grief and guilt—and if fantasies of apocalyptic destruction play any role at all in your belief system, one way to deal with those difficult emotions in their first and rawest forms is to pour them into a belief in some cataclysm big enough to punish the world and everyone in it for their failure to live up to your hopes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The environmental movement is not a religion, but its course in America in recent decades followed the pattern I’ve just outlined. Like fundamentalism and the New Age movement, it came in from the fringe in the 1970s with the same sense of imminent triumph that guided the other movements I’ve named. Its transformation from a charismatic movement of outsiders to a set of bureaucratic institutions closely intertwined with the existing order of society followed the same trajectory as fundamentalist churches, and its sense of triumphant expectancy faded out at roughly the same pace, replaced by the same struggle against evil that brought fundamentalist Christians into their devil’s pact with the GOP and inspired New Age believers to embrace conspiracy theories and the paranoid fantasies of David Icke. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At this point, roughly in parallel with fundamentalism and the New Age, the environmental movement is having to come face to face with the total failure of its hopes. Back in the heady days of its early successes, the vision that guided it saw environmental protection as the next step forward in the same trajectory of social progress that included the civil rights movement and second wave feminism; it was in this spirit, for example, that environmental lawyers proposed that trees be given legal standing. The hope all along was that industrial civilization could achieve a permanent peace with the world of nature and continue up the infinite road of progress without leaving a scorched and looted planet in its wake. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That hope is dead. If there was ever a chance to achieve it, it went whistling down the wind decades ago, and at this point the jaws of resource depletion and environmental degradation are tightening around the collective throat of the world’s industrial societies, in exactly the fashion predicted in detail forty years ago in the pages of <i>The Limits to Growth</i>. Even if the green technologies promoted by an increasingly frantic minority of environmentalists could support something like today’s rates of energy use, which they can’t, we can no longer afford the sort of massive buildout of those technologies that would be necessary to supplant even a significant part of our current fossil fuel consumption. If what’s left of the environmental movement managed to overcome its own internal dysfunctions and the formidable opposition of its foes, and became a mass movement again, the most it could accomplish at this point would be the protection of some of the most vulnerable ecosystems as industrial society stumbles down the first bitter steps of the long descent into the deindustrial future.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s still a goal worth achieving, but it’s not the goal to which the environmental mainstream committed itself when it embraced a role among the socially acceptable institutions of American public life, with the perks and salaries that this status involves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>This explains, I suggest, the way that certain mainstream environmentalists have turned to proselytizing for nuclear power and other frankly ecocidal technologies, under the curious delusion that "possibly a little better than the worst" somehow amounts to "good."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The desperation in such rhetoric is palpable, and signals the end of the road—an end that, in this case as in the others I’ve cited, involves a good many fantasies of total destruction. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, there’s another factor here, and it unfolds from one of the least creditable aspects of the way that the environmental movement has evolved over time. It has become increasingly clear that the perks, the salaries, and the comfortable middle class lifestyles embraced so enthusiastically by so many people in the movement are themselves part of the problem. I was intrigued to read earlier this month a <a href=http://kevinanderson.info/blog/hypocrites-in-the-air-should-climate-change-academics-lead-by-example/ >thoughtful essay by leading British climate scientist Kevin Anderson</a> arguing, in terms that will sound very familiar to regular readers of <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, that the failure of climate change activism to make any headway in changing people’s behavior may have more than a little to do with the fact that the people who are urging such changes aren’t making them themselves.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I have no reason to think that Anderson reads my blog or, for that matter, knows me from Hu Gadarn’s off ox, but then you don’t need to wear an archdruid’s funny hat to notice that people these days are acutely sensitive to signs of hypocrisy, or to grasp that even the most vital changes aren’t going to happen if even the people who are most aware of their importance aren’t willing to start making them in their own lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For reasons <a href=../../2012/05/night-thoughts-in-hagsgate.html>a post last year</a> discussed at some length, those who have built their lives on the fantasy that it’s possible to have their planet and eat it too are not going to find such reflections welcome, or even bearable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times">Fantasies of imminent human extinction are one comforting if futile response to this ugly predicament. If you want a justification for living as though there’s no tomorrow, insisting that in fact, there’s no tomorrow is certainly one option. If I’m right, the pleasures of believing in near-term human extinction are likely to appeal to a very large and well-heeled audience in the years immediately ahead, and those of my readers interested in cashing in on the next 2012-style bonanza should probably take note. </span></span></div>

Years back I used to work in a transport company. The guys worked in the yard were by and large exceptionally polite and pleasant to deal with.

NTE. (It's rather cavalier to turn a phrase so existential into an acronym!) I really appreciate the perspective.<br><br>I'm an environmentalist. By that I mean someone who's internalized that humans are animals wholly dependent and limited by natural systems. As a result I've gone the path of small-scale organic farmer; resiliency and community building being my chosen preoccupations. <br><br>It's taken me a while to get to that place though and it doesn't take much to be drawn into a frenzy about something like near-term extinction. The work of daily life and the slow, non-digital pace of real world accomplishment cannot compete with the instant flash, bang and excitement of all the ideas flowing from the internet into my brain. <br><br>Thank-you for the timely whiplash.<br><br>I'd like to bring up your point about the hypocrisy of those who challenge the status-quo. By many people's measure I've chosen a life that's closer to living within Nature's limits than some. I still have a car, still eat chocolate, still participate in the global economy. Each year I do better, each year I'm able to create more behavior that is healthy and more exciting than the deleterious ones associated with the consumer economy. Eating locally and in-season is the only option for me, not because of some ideological stance but because local, in-season food is just SO MUCH better than the alternative provided by the industrial economy. When I ask myself, "what more can I do? What is right?" The answer is invariably - "Quit and create something better." Meaning: quit your job, quit money, quit 'consuming,' quit industrial economy. "...And create," meaning: create community events, create music, create food with integrity, create debt strike, create a new possible way of being for those around you. <br><br>My internal answer seems impossible to live up to and I feel this is the same problem that everyone living INSIDE industrial civilization comes to. "It's too hard." "I can't. I have X responsibility." Industrial civilization is killing our future off and yet we cannot walk away, like addicts in full knowledge of their addiction, still helpless.<br><br>I have compassion for the hypocrites because I'm one too. Degrees of difference in our choices do matter in a tangible way for the planet - biking is better than driving for instance. But we will never "arrive" at "perfection." We are like fish in water, we swim in our culture, our context and even when we realize it's all around us, all an illusion we cannot extricate ourselves from it. We become Cassandras, lamenting and being derided for moral imperfection. <br><br>All I am left with is my daily choices: Can I drive? Can I walk? Do I need this purchase? Do I WANT it and damn the consequence? Sometimes I choose well, sometimes I fail but I also choose to have compassion for myself. Tying your personal choices to the broader choices of society as a whole is an awful burden, maybe a trap. <br><br>I'm not sure what my point is but I know there's something important for me to explore here. Thanks for the space to share.<br><br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c3417966886621328704 title="comment permalink">5/16/13, 12:05 AM</a><br><br>

Living in this globalized world while trying not to connect with it and drink in some of its cancerous elixir. My wife, being a Russian, is constantly telling me about the writings of Vadim Zeland. She managed to find one in English for me and in it he made some interesting points, and an analogy to this globalized world, with the constant barrage of media, advertising, news, etc being a machine, a machine that has evolved into an artificial intelligence and now is continuing deeper into this downward spiral. He likens it to the Matrix. <br><br>One way to get out is through community. Whether that community be a spiritual community, or what-not is your choice.

Many sudden shocks will happen but overall we will see as we have seen throughout history. One civilization will feed off the others remains just as a honey fungus feeds off the decaying colossus of an old oak tree. If other readers need any clue that this is more likely than a quick die off scenario, one only need realize our food production is less than 1% of our energy usage. We have a lot of purse factories, container ships and other nonsensical widget energy expenditures to cut before we die off in some ridiculous zombie filled tragedy. Look to history rather than fantasy for examples of catabolic collapse.<br> <br> While my logical understanding of likely future outcomes seems solid, my value based interpretation has been skinned and gutted by your recent posting. How does a catabolic collpase play out with how I myself interact with this world? I used to take to the indulgence of waiting for a grand schism which would leave the world silent with mouths open in awe at the events unfolding on tvs and radios around the world. After this event, the world would have a paradigm shift in which "moral progress" could be made to a more community based environmentally friendly future under which ecosystems could begin to heal. This is falling for the anti-progress view of a hopeful apocalypse, followed by the gradual return to Eden. This is ironically, a story of anti-progress followed by "moral progress" I realize is a fantastical mental hallucination. I know you are going to get at the reasons we humans devise grand narratives with which to ascribe time, history and our lives, which should be a lovely series of post!<br> A while back you talked about how the view of suffering in Christianity in Medieval Europe seemed to keep violence much lower than it would have been. This got me thinking with an infectious idea, one that I couldn't shake. Once I worked through some of the mental valleys and jungles, I realized. We are forsaken to always see the world through gods, stories of our ancestors and abstract association whether through the eyes of science, progress, Christianity or Islam. If you should choose a value based philosophy, civil religion or purpose of life? Why not choose, the only value based system which is actually sustainable? The only way we humans can keep from destroying nature and our own livelihoods in the process is by holding sacred our own lifeblood. Nature in the form of the; pines, oaks, the black bears, the trout, the birds, the insects, all of it. I have a feeling you will go more into this, but there is a very different mechanism involved in holding something sacred, rather than economically regulating it? I think that is why you worship nature because it is the only way to keep the lifeless deserts consuming all that is human? I mean, Ozymandias King of King's worshiped power and all it got him was a broken statue in the middle of a desert, depending on your view of time.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c5290610003020327187 title="comment permalink">5/16/13, 1:47 AM</a><br><br>

It is certainly true that industrial civilization has converted kazillions of tons of carbon from inert storage in coal and oil to Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere. However, plants are actively using it to create other carbon (cellulose and sugars) and also that highly reactive elemental byproduct that we call 'oxygen.' <br>Now that we have burned a little more than half of that carbon reserve, and are all being forced to use less and less of it with each passing decade, I get some hope from the idea that the plants will be able to catch up with the oversupply of CO2 and bring everything back to a new homeostatic balance. We might eventually end up with higher oxygen levels in our atmosphere, as well as an environment more friendly to plants! :-)<br><br>Of course, this may uncover the _real_ conspiracy; What if the Plants are the actual driving force behind the development of civilization? What if Plants coaxed the development of chimps into oil drillers, using us to recover and burn the vast carbon resources buried in the last couple of meteor strikes? And when we have pulled up the last drop of oil and burned the last lump of coal, what further use will the Plants have for us? Grim questions indeed!

Back in 2007 and 2008, for instance, I insisted that the US government wouldn’t be dumb enough to try to cover its ballooning budget deficits by spinning the printing presses; some idiocies, I thought, were too extreme even for the inmates of the current American political class.

No, ever since it has become possible to rip off more wealth than even your wasteful grandchildren can spend in just a few short years, then be immune to the law as a member of the very powerful, the game has changed.<br><br>That’s the blindness ordinary folk are subject to: Because the group is important to them, they think it and its survival is important to the powerful. Even a 65 year old Asperger syndrome enjoyer (not sufferer, I enjoy the different point of view) like me can see how mistaken that is.<br><br>I’m old enough to remember when it took a CEO or senior executive of even a major corporation 20+ years to accumulate rather modest wealth for his retirement. Naturally, the long term health of the business was very important to that senior management.<br><br>Now, not so much.<br><br>No, the powerful are astonishingly careless about group or location welfare, believing (sometimes wrongly) that they can always just move on. There is actually social research on this.<br><br>And from an evolutionary sense this is exactly the correct behavior. The evolutionarily right thing to do is almost always to grab wealth and power (if you have the chance) and only care about the short term.<br><br>The reason why this is built into humans is brutal - the much, much higher reproductive success of the wealthy and powerful. And built in it is, people’s behavior often completely changes if they have a chance of wealth and power and almost always does once they even start to acquire it.<br><br>I’ve been up close and personal to that process several times, hell, nearly did it myself once, would have, but for the differences God has blessed me with.<br><br>In short, the people at the top, be it in government, Wall Street or whatever will, when pushed, choose short term fixes irrespective of what medium or long term damage is done for the simple and entirely logical reason that they personally expect to benefit enormously from keeping the system propped up for even another year or three. Then, of course, if things really come apart, they intend to move to that nice little hacienda in Uruguay (a really nice little country by the way) with the couple of hundred million dollars they “acquired” and live happily ever after.<br><br>In other words they’ll spin those printing presses.<br><br>By the way, this process is particularly noticeable when viewed from countries like Australia where it has not yet progressed as far as in the USA.

But I have hope that as America does change, counterproductive narratives will slowly be abandoned. As the economy tightens, people will seek bad habits to get rid of and good habits to adopt, as part of our will to survive.

He was espousing the view that the primary responsibility of CO2 emissions cuts fell on developing countries such as China &amp; India rather than the affluent countries of Western Europe and of course, the US itself.<br><br>I loudly disagreed and proceeded to explain that while I thought that developing countries do have a responsibility to cut emissions, countries like the US whose citizens emit huge amounts of greenhouse gases per capita along with so called 'developed countries' where the government isn't struggling to feed 200 million or so people and has a huge share of the world's wealth, do not have less responsibility because of some raw effect of numbers. That these countries refuse to take the initiative in such actions while trying to arm-wrench poorer countries into cutting down their economic growth for 'emissions offsetting' is a huge injustice, and reflects that they have no intentions of using their huge amounts of perceived wealth and resource to enact any change at all. <br><br>The argument went on (and people started leaving the dining table I was on) and I wanted to know why people in rich western societies somehow find it easier to blame middle-class urbanites in cities like Mumbai or Shanghai(who consume less than a thirtieth of what they do) than to question why they need their SUVs. <br><br>This to me reeks of a shameless double standard where western society manages to externalise the costs and consequences of its ridiculous levels of consumption onto weaker people - something that won't last long however.<br><br>I suspect that citizens in such countries will have to wake up very soon and face the hard realities of the results of their lifestyle.<br><br>Regards,<br>YJV<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c7298701732789234790 title="comment permalink">5/16/13, 6:02 AM</a><br><br>

I listened to a report on NPR that summed it all up: shale and fracking are enabling America to move towards energy independence, so all is well. Boom! No mention of troubling details such as cost, impact on the economy or whether tight oil might just be the stuff at the bottom of the barrel. There wasn’t even the usual NPR nod to the environmental implications of fracking or tar sands. The message was that it’s just better that we’re squeezing a bit more out of the ground, all is well, no need for any changes, move along, etc.<br><br>I must confess to having a couple of initial reactions, both of which were emotional and unrealistic. One was “what if they are right”? I know they are not, logically, but the fearful reaction of not wanting to look silly was clearly bubbling away somewhere in my subconscious. Probably picked this up at kindergarten or something. Then that gave way to frustration, of the “why can’t those fools see that we’re getting to the end of an era here and plan responsibly” variety. Planning for de-growth is obviously never going to happen. At least I didn’t get to the “screw us all, I hope the apocalypse comes and wipes us all off the map” stage! So that’s good.<br><br>After I had settled down a bit I got back to my usual equilibrium – an acceptance of the slow, messy, bumpy road down. It will be the way it will be, not the way my emotions would like it to be – excessively cornucopian, or disastrous or even logical/controlled/engineered. As individuals we have little control over the big-picture shape of how this all plays out. The only thing we can actually do about the big-picture shape is to tell stories about it, recasting it to be this or that, bargaining with it, tilting at it. Which is why there’s so much of that going on I suppose. So, back to small-picture reality. Time to turn the compost pile. <br><br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c562867906961776794 title="comment permalink">5/16/13, 6:22 AM</a><br><br>

The Id is referred to as "the monster from the subconscious" and "the secret devil that lives inside". His final revelation is, "My evil self is at the door and I have no power to stop it!" Meanwhile the protagonist (a Captain Kirk prototype) admonishes "We're all monsters in our subconscious; that's why we have laws and religion."<br><br>I can't make this stuff up.

I have to admit, despite having been in the long-term decline/ slow collapse camp for some time, it was freaking me out last week. I appreciate your philosophical and psychological arguments about why this stance has a seductive (and counter-productive) appeal at this stage in the game. I wonder if you could do me (and perhaps other readers) a favor, however, and give us a brief overview of why you think this outcome is unlikely based on the climate science, i.e. in terms of degrees the average temp is likely to rise/how long ago in the earth's history we have sustained such temperatures. I did some web-searching on this topic to try to disconfirm some of the NTE scare-mongering, but I came up with such a confusing, contradictory collection of numbers, I didn't know what to think. I believe you addressed this in an entry a couple years ago, but I couldn't seem to locate it in the archives. If you could at any rate let me know what entry that was, that'd be great, and if you had any new thoughts, for instance about why this temporary up-swing in the overall decline curve of petroleum provided by fracking/tar sands etc. combined with positive climate feedback loops ISN'T afterall going to bump us into a temperature range that can't sustain human life--well, that'd be more than great.

As tempting as it is to see historical pendulums swinging, we could be in a situation more akin to 4th Century Rome, where the educated and erudite can longer find a reason to reproduce themselves while extremists zealously seek to outbreed them. As soon as middle class liberals awaken from their Obamanosis and realize that the people who run the world economy are working overtime to eliminate their occupations, things could change very, very quickly. You could see an unplanned "New Awakening" as atheists die off and the former middle class huddles in very, very conservative denominations as a measure of self-preservation. John, you know better than anyone that Pre-Christian Rome was the apotheosis of cosmopolitanism with science and philosophy and yes, Atheism, seen as the badges of sophistication and refinement among the smart set. And they all refined themselves into extinction. Mainstream culture is stupider than I've ever seen it (go look at a 70s issue of Newsweek or Playboy to see how desperately far we've fallen), the middle class is being sent to the slaughterhouse and the ultra-religious are having lots and lots of children while the people who sneer at them are having none. The world will not end, but a world anyone might want to live in certainly could, sooner than we dream possible.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c8538474999974395239 title="comment permalink">5/16/13, 7:41 AM</a><br><br>

The ending teaser from last week implied you'd be discussing how one philosophy's catastrophe can be somebody else's ecstatic Rapture, and I don't really get that from the column today. Certainly a worthwhile column today, but in our pluralistic and diverse country, where everybody seems to be going crazy in a hundred different ways, the point about one mans meat vs. another's philosophical poison seems like it would be a fascinating discussion.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c4847752816555068053 title="comment permalink">5/16/13, 7:48 AM</a><br><br>

Curiously, this never stopped anyone from purchasing insurance policies.) Anyway, I just wanted to say that I wonder if some of this "apocalyptic thinking" is just human nature. I remember reading a book in college called "Man's search for Meaning". In that book Victor Frankl recounted his experiences in a Nazi concentration camp. He noticed that those who survived that brutal experience tended to have some belief, however irrational, that gave their lives meaning. It had nothing to do with reason; just some conviction they held that somehow they would pull through this horrible time and the future would be brighter. Maybe it was a loved one they hoped to see again and this made them determined to survive. The ones who gave up hope were the ones who died. This quality of vascillating between hope and despair seems to be unique to our species, the only species, as far as I know, that knows that it will die someday and has to come to terms with that one way or another.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c458735456909073837 title="comment permalink">5/16/13, 7:56 AM</a><br><br>

I too notice the mention of near-term extinction popping up in the peak oil blogosphere a lot more during the last several months. This concerns me, along with other absolute predictions (that usually note a specific year that something is certain to happen by) so many others have made in the environmental / peak oil camps. There are so many variables in the world, that I think it's best to stick with general processes that are likely in the future, without getting one's focus stuck on the exact when, what, where. If people framed their predictions more in terms of probabilities, I might be more willing to consider their viewpoint. <br><br>There are a whole list of environmentalists who have made absolute predictions (with no admittance of their uncertainty) which turned out to be wrong (such as Paul Ehrlich and predictions he made in his book The Population Bomb in 1968) even though their general assessment and grasp of the situation -- be it overpopulation, climate change, etc. -- is much more informed than the general population. I find it actually helps the climate change/peak oil/overpopulation/etc deniers who can use the failed prediction as a case in point of why the entire climate change and environmental movement is out of whack.<br><br>I am just starting to see critiques of NTE popping up, such as: http://www.culturechange.org/cms/content/view/880/1/<br>Nicole Foss mentioned in the comments section there that she is planning on writing her own long critique of NTE once she gets back from her overseas tour.<br><br>I notice that Guy McPherson will be coming to this year's Age of Limits Conference. It will be interesting to see you two debate your ideas in-person. While I'm open to hearing views different than my own, which can spark good debate and discussion, I hope Guy's voice remains just one of many viewpoints there, and doesn't change the overall focus of Age of Limits. If the NTE belief becomes popular in certain peak oil circles, I worry that it will distract focus on the important work that needs to be done to benefit people who will be alive centuries into the future. If one believes in NTE, what's the point in concerning oneself with the hard work that needs to be done?<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c6468331608987696603 title="comment permalink">5/16/13, 8:11 AM</a><br><br>

There seems to be something about learning our lessons the hard way that is almost hard-wired into the human psyche. But, at least collectively, mere survival is not the same as healthy flourishing, which is still somewhere off in the distant future, and we still have a rough and rocky road to travel.

That’s how nature and evolution are: Very messy and they follow no rules. I can imagine some scenarios, such as scattered tribes from the upper Andes managing to hang on, thanks to a horticultural lifestyle. Then; one, two or three hundred years later; venturing down to the plains, costs and rivers and gradually spreading out, north and south, and eventually finding their way into Siberia and Eurasia, maybe encountering other humans on the Steppes. I hope that goes well. Someday there may be an ‘Out of South America’ theory. Evolution selects those who survive, for whatever reason.

After a couple of years it occurred to me that for the funding organization to be successful (to take in more money), more people would need to be working within the various companies that offered the checkoff. That meant the companies themselves would have to be more successful and/or more companies would need to start offering the checkoff. Since those companies did nothing positive, and mostly did quite a bit negative, for the environment, the ironic reality was that the more money the funding organization took in, the worse the environment got.

As for "hypocrisy," that's a harsh term for the simple reality of being human, and having to deal -- as all human beings must -- with the hard realities of existence in a flawed and troubled society. <br><br>Snoqualman, no argument there. The transformation of the environmental movement into a collection of fundraising bureaucracies closely tied to the status quo was the opposite of a good thing. <br><br>Leo, exactly. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see sea levels jump higher than predicted, but even if they go up 10-15 meters, how's that going to exterminate the population of, say, Switzerland? We're facing a harsh future; no need to exaggerate it. <br><br>Robert, excellent! You get today's gold star for asking the hard questions. For what it's worth, I worship nature because I believe it's worthy of reverence, not because of any potential cultural side effects that worship might have, but I'll be talking toward the end of this sequence -- when I get into the difficult topic of my own religious beliefs -- about why reverence for nature is certainly one of the better options we've got just now. <br><br>Irishwildeye, that must have been a delightful bike trip! I'm sorry to say that I know a lot of people who are into the same kind of green tokenism as your relation. <br><br>Shands, the Arctic has been ice free for most of Earth's history; it was ice free when our hominid ancestors were first trotting around the eastern African savannahs, for example. There have also been any number of methane releases in Earth's history -- you might check out the paleoclimatology of the end of the last ice age, when very large methane releases were part of the very rapid temperature increases of that time; our ancestors survived that, too. Despair may be easy, but it's not useful...<br><br>Øyvind, any exponential trend taken far enough results in absurdity. You might want to look into the law of diminishing returns and the concept of homeostasis, and apply them to the simplistic model you've proposed here. <br><br>Phil H., for what it's worth, my take is that Britain is going to be in a world of hurt as the industrial age spirals down, and the serene British assurance that nothing can go wrong -- which I've encountered vicariously -- is going to make matters a whale of a lot worse than they would otherwise be. <br><br>Raven, thank you! It may be off topic for this post, but it's on topic for this blog, and it would not surprise me if warriors mounted on bicycles were in fact a major feature of the dark ages ahead of us. <br><br>Richard, good for you. I wish the protesters well, but I've already discussed the futility of existing methods of protest in today's political climate -- the only thing that would make that protest work is if the protesters were willing to vote against the next Democratic candidate for president if Obama keeps selling out, and of course they'll do no such thing, so their protest is empty wind.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c6971292743027966739></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/08600694060231615298 rel=nofollow>Joseph Nemeth</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>@JMG: regarding use of the word "hypocrisy," I'd like to remind you of your own excellent post from 2007, on seral succession:<br><br>http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2007/09/civilization-and-succession.html<br><br>People who today explore "sustainable living" and walk the talk, are themselves a hardy pioneer species -- let's call them dandelions -- that currently grow on the fringes of the burned-over region overrun by industrial thistles.<br><br>Dandelions are not the prototype of the future. As the thistles die back, they'll be replaced, not by dandeliions, but by a scavenger culture -- let's call it bindweed -- that grows upon the dying stalks of the thistles. Bindweed will continue to keep dandelions on the fringe.<br><br>After the bindweed dies back, dandelions may have a brief role to play in preparing the ground. But after that (assuming climate and stray asteroids accommodate us), as K-selection begins to predominate, we'll see a human culture rise that is intensely interdependent in complex ways, meaning that it will regulate by some means every use of water and energy, all trade, when and whom individuals marry, when and what to plant, when and how to take a dump. Tradition will rule. Attempts to innovate will be viewed with suspicion; if sufficiently disruptive, they will provoke a lethal immune response: e.g. accusations of "witchcraft" or "technology" that will put the innovators to death and scare the bejesus out of everyone else.<br><br>We’ve seen these kinds of cultures. Tibet. Thailand. Rural China. Small-town Kansas.<br><br>Dandelions — the isolated tinkerers in “sustainable living” — will be forced back to the fringe. <br><br>I'm a thistle. I've thrived in the industrial world, where I'd have had little luck elsewhere. I can't see squat without glasses: outside the brief period from, say, 1400 to the near future, I'd have been a blind man, with all that implies. I'm an indifferent gardener. I'm an aggressive innovator, and have always been: it's partly why I call myself Pagan, and a Druid. <br><br>As a <i>human</i> thistle, I have some small capacity to see outside my own circle of prejudice. It's obvious to that wider vision that thistles are dying out, may even be going extinct. I might have the temerity to write a little about the subject, perhaps even praise the dandelion or the bindweed or the mighty oak yet to come. Were I an activist, I might push for legislation that would help prepare ground for something other than thistles. <br><br>Yet I am myself a thistle: not a dandelion, nor a bindweed, nor a mighty oak. <br><br>Hypocrisy is to pretend otherwise.<br><br>The word “hypocrite” has become bread and butter of the politics of dismissal. An environmental attorney working out of an air-conditioned high-rise office is a “hypocrite,” so his efforts can be dismissed. You yourself are a “hypocrite” for using the Internet, so your views can be dismissed. It’s a form of effortless <i>ad hominem</i> that plays well among modern democratic masses, and in the media.<br><br>But I don’t think it’s the reason for anything. It’s a rationalization, like any other logical fallacy.<br><br>The <i>reason</i> the environmental movement has failed is because it’s been promoted as all broccoli and no dessert. Classifying and separating our garbage, using inferior lighting, flushing our toilet less frequently, stinting on showers, giving up meat, giving up sugar, giving up television, giving up, giving up, giving up. It has never inspired the masses, and understandably. If sound ecology, it is terribly unsound psychology. <br><br>Contrast that to Augustine’s accomplishment. What did he place in front of the masses? A long descent into night? A handbook of better ways to compost your own excrement? How to make armor and defend your family against the Hun? <br><br>No: he placed the shining image of the City of God.<br><br>It worked pretty well.<br><br>People need a story to carry them through the long descent. Even we thistles need a story.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c6971292743027966739 title="comment permalink">5/16/13, 3:20 PM</a><br><br>

Wormtongue, now that's another matter! <br><br>Robo, thank you. <br><br>Stephen, I did say that that was a prediction I'd made quite a while ago, and I've long since noted the mistake involved. <br><br>Avery, I hope you're right! My guess is that a great many people in America will cling to their counterproductive narratives like grim death, until the deathgrip becomes mutual. I wouldn't be surprised to see "extinction parties" in which middle-aged yuppies reminisce about the good times and then tie plastic bags over their heads. <br><br>Divelly, I remember it well! That's why I keep on saying that running off to a lifeboat ecovillage (that's what they call "Drop City" these days) is not a viable response to the crisis of our age. We face the harder challenge of extracting ourselves mentally and spiritually from a dying culture, adapting in place, and learning to live with the real community around us. <br><br>YJV, good. I discussed the use of climate rhetoric as a tool for maintaining US hegemony in <a href=../../2012/04/seascape-with-methane-plumes.html rel=nofollow>a post last year</a>.

Read them in close succession, and it becomes pretty obvious that both sides are smoking their shorts. <br><br>Greg, my point exactly. Nor is it necessary to summon an "id monster" to demonstrate that; watch supposedly rational human beings convince themselves of something they want to believe, and your faith in the triumph of human reason probably won't survive the experience. <br><br>Bro.

I'll be going on with the previous discussion in next week's post -- or at least that's the current plan. <br><br>Kuanyin, I'll consider a post on that. Several other peak oil authors with more background in the relevant sciences are also preparing posts, though, and theirs might be worth your while; my interest, as a historian of ideas, is primarily in how the same old apocalyptic tropes get recycled in new packaging. <br><br>Rita, it's pretty much the same here in America; the only difference between our caste system and yours is that we like to pretend that ours doesn't exist. <br><br>Maria, I bet the asteroid finds its way into NTE rhetoric any day now. Do you remember how the 2012 people used to lump together every imaginable cause of cataclysm, even those that were mutually contradictory, to bolster the fantasy that something or other would happen last December? <br><br>Cathy, glad to hear you're able to do t'ai chi again! As for the retirement study, it occurs to me that sooner or later the scientific professions are going to discover the hard way that they've thrown away the last of their former prestige by shilling once too often for political or corporate interests. <br><br>Steve, I was delighted to see Anderson's piece, for obvious reasons; it'll be interesting to see what kind of long-term response he gets. <br><br>Vera, I expect NTE to become an industry as big and lucrative as the 2012 business was; it's hard to think of an ideology that does a better job of justifying inaction while claiming to be deeply concerned. <br><br>Christopher, in 1960 nearly everyone assumed that the few surviving fundamentalist churches were relics soon to be extinct. Linear extrapolation is perhaps the least accurate way of predicting the future. That is to say, I stand by my prediction. <br><br>Thomas, as I mentioned to Bret, this was a bit of an unplanned divagation. The current plan is to return to the core discussion next week. <br><br>Goldmund, some form of belief is necessary for human life, but the belief in an apocalyptic finale certainly isn't -- there have been plenty of cultures and ages that got by perfectly well without that particular fantasy. <br><br>Doc, thanks for the link -- keep writing!<br><br>Beneath, exactly!

I suppose we should be grateful that the apocalypse lobby isn't busy insisting that Earth is about to be devoured by a gigantic space walrus with photon flippers. <br><br>Harry, it was mostly an accident -- I've been getting pelted with questions about my opinion about the whole NTE hoopla, and decided to write about it. <br><br>Daughter, that's good to hear. It'll be interesting to see how things shape up as the NTE fad really gets going. <br><br>Lunab777, "x is a problem" does not mean "x will exterminate all of humanity." For most of this planet's long history, it's been a lot warmer than it is now, and the relatively slow pace of climate change means that there's time for biological adaptation through natural selection -- not to mention what could be done by cultural adaptation.

A lot of people, including a lot of scientists, look at the same science and manage not to end up believing in imminent human extinction; I suggest that the science is an excuse for the belief, not the cause of it. <br><br>Jon, exactly. I get skeptical any time somebody dusts off one of the old tropes from the myth of apocalypse and applies it to current affairs, precisely because there's normally a lot of cutting and stretching of current affairs to make the thing fit. <br><br>Vinoshon, true enough.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c5896826168726271630 title="comment permalink">5/16/13, 4:35 PM</a><br><br>

It would be nice if the current NTE fad was simply a sign that a lot of people have hit the stage of depression, and will soon move on to the fifth stage of peak oil -- getting off your backside and doing something. <br><br>Jon, er, it was a metaphor, you know. <br><br>SLClaire, having been through something like the same experience, I agree -- the most important argument against despair is that it's so useless. <br><br>Tristan, you can see a picture of me in my work clothes <a href=http://hermetic.com/greer/ rel=nofollow>here</a>/ <br><br>Andrea, then go take a shower. The science isn't the essence of the argument; the science is window dressing for a preexisting narrative -- the same narrative we saw built up around 2012, Y2K, etc., etc. Rather than debating yet another round of cherrypicked factoids, I suggest it's time to address the narrative itself. <br><br>Orc, the narratives in the Bible can be interpreted in many different ways. It's only because the Augustinian interpretation has become so hardwired into our culture, and is taught to each generation as the truth, that most people can't read the Bible without automatically imposing an Augustinian interpretation on it. <br><br>Glenn, exactly. How many more claims of imminent apocalypse do we have to hear before we grasp that it's all basically twaddle? <br><br>Raven, my money's on the giant space walrus with photon flippers, who will devour the earth in 2008. <br><br>Adrian, there's no way any of us alive today can have clean hands. That's simply one of the cards we've all been dealt; the question that follows is what we choose to do about it.

As the title suggests, Lee has written a sociologically informed history, of the radical underground environmental movement, EARTH FIRST! founded by Dave Foreman and small group of like-minded friends in 1980. <br><br>Lee's work really excels at examining the trigger events that turned Foreman towards apocalyptic thinking. Lee, in part, bases her interpretation of EARTH FIRST!'s history on Michael Barkun's explanation for the development of millenarian ideologies found in his "Disaster and the Millennium". For Barkun the individual's "true society" or meaningful community must be directly threatened by severe changes or disruptions {"a disaster"}. <br><br>I think the advantage of an analysis of millenarianism such as Barkun's is that we clearly live in an era of disasters -- big and small. We are all being primed for the Apocalypse one way or the other. These are times that certainly try humanity's frail rationality.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c6105564703938203672 title="comment permalink">5/16/13, 6:32 PM</a><br><br>

Unlike various other apocalyptic fantasies, I'm a little worried that this one could be less benign, due to its proximity to more reasoned viewpoints as to where we are all headed. For instance, having this kind of thing enter the discussion at Age of Limits could be a distraction, in that serious thoughts and ideas get tainted with this brush, making it easier for people who might otherwise lend an ear to dismiss the whole kit and kaboodle. "Are you an Extincter or a Descenter? Ah, what's the difference, you're all a bunch of end of the world doomers." Whatever, I guess.<br><br>I find this NTE scenario to be repulsive. I mean come on, man up. (And I don't mean to imply that the opposite of manliness is feminine or gay, but simply the abdication of those qualities that make a man a man. Okay, I'm opening up a can of worms--hopefully my meaning will be clear and no one will be offended by my culturally based generality.) No doubt the person who came up with this nonsense believes contemplating the ethics and morals of suicide in the face of their self-concocted extinction scenario is quite macho. In fact, it's the height of hysterical egotism, on both an individual and species scale. Besides that, if you knew the world was going to end next week, would you dream up a handy acronym and become the Chicken Little of the internet, or would you go out to the yard and help your wife plant some kale in the warm spring sun?

That if we don't shut down industrial society within <i>two years</i> we needn't bother, because the game is over?<br><br>Surely you understand that shutting down industrial society within the next two years is impossible?<br><br>Our so-called leadership in Washington has a majority (or a substantial minority) of people who still don't even believe in global warming. A substantial fraction of those don't care, anyway, because they believe that Jesus will return to fix everything, and will even praise them for their "faithfulness" (which they've somehow confused with "pig-headed obstinacy.") They'll continue to deny that sea-levels are rising even as they drown.<br><br>Outside Washington, most US Americans aren't even <i>aware</i> of peak oil or global warming.<br><br>So who is going to pull the switch and turn out the lights? Not Government. Not The People.<br><br>The comment about "acts of resistance" sound a little like small groups of committed ecoterrorists?<br><br>But that will have the <i>opposite</i> effect. Our industrial society is built around war, and attacking the system will only kick the industries of war into high gear to protect themselves: it will be like throwing gasoline on a fire, or injecting pure adrenaline into a strung-out junkie. It would guarantee <i>years</i> of extra life to industrial society.<br><br>So realistically, NTE is saying it's already way too late. They're just saying it a way that promotes as much anxiety as possible. <br><br>So JMG -- this strikes me as an interesting twist on the old apocalypse meme.<br><br>Most of them have salvation and judgement bound up in the same moment: you can repent right up to the moment the Rapture occurs; you can stock your Zombie shelter up to the moment they start roaming the streets; you can buy up reflective aluminum suits up to the second the Giant Space Walrus swipes at us with a photon flipper. When the date comes and nothing happens, they have to recalculate in the face of a crushing embarrassment.<br><br>This one has a forty-five year "nag margin" built into it.<br><br>Current prediction is for 2015. We'll miss that one, and nothing will happen, but that's just what they predicted. Next, they'll sharpen their pencils, and decide that, well, maybe there's a chance for <i>some</i> people to survive if we destroy industrial civilization by, say, 2018. We'll miss that one, too. Thank God we're entering a region of galactic dark matter at that point, which will lower (or raise) the neutrino emissions of the sun, and buy us a little more time. Maybe 2022. Etc.<br><br>It's an apocalypse <i>franchise</i>. Like the Harry Potter series.<br><br>Dang.

It's the sudden spread of the extinction fad into the wider culture that has me watching with a frown. As for Druidry, no, I wasn't raised in a Druid family; I grew up in a nonreligious family, and found my way to Druidry after a fairly long pilgrimage through the odd corners of American alternative spirituality. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Lucas, thank you for the tip! It's been way too long since I read Barkun -- I'll have to fix that as time permits. <br><br>Joseph, oh, granted. I'm sure it's counted in exponential powers of googolplexes. <br><br>M, nicely phrased! Still, it probably can't be helped. The NTE thing, as I commented in the post, is simply the latest rehash of the overnight apocalypse fantasy that the peak oil scene has replayed more times than a bad sitcom. The deeper we get into decline, the more often and the more passionately that fantasy is going to be rehashed, because the alternative is admitting that the game is over and we're heading into the one future most people fear more than extinction. Yes, that's spelled "decline," and it's more frightening because it's not all over in a bang and a flash. You have to live with it, and so do your grandchildren's grandchildren's grandchildren. <br><br>Joseph, endless recalculation of dates is a feature of a lot of apocalypse franchises. It'll be interesting to see how many cycles this one goes through before the believers get bored and head for some more alluring doomsday prophecy. <br><br>Bill, exactly. Human beings are right up there with rats and cockroaches in our ability to adapt to different environments, a classic generalist species well adapted to sudden change and disruption. Given the geographic spread and the diversity of environments currently inhabited by Homo sap., too, we're an exterminator's nightmare. I expect global population to bottom out in two centuries or so at well under half a billion people, but that's an ample breeding population for long term survival, to say nothing of the impact of all that Darwinian selection.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c1789276408874619401 title="comment permalink">5/16/13, 10:09 PM</a><br><br>

Beware the triffids...<br><br>Hi Stu,<br><br>Thanks. It really does work and is amazingly easy to cultivate. All it requires is to have a single chunk of root and it will take from that. <br><br>During the past summer I had several well established trial patches of comfrey and they all did well (both edible in small quantities and medicinal too).<br><br>If the summer is wet and humid (unlike the past one here), you can cut them back to the ground as mulch and they'll feed the soil and earthworms without causing undue fungal problems on the trunks of the fruit trees. On dry years leave them in place to shade the soil. You just have to adapt to the conditions as they occur.<br><br>I have a young grapefruit tree which has comfrey as a companion and it is surprisingly producing heaps of fruit without showing any signs of heat stress and loss of foliage like some other citrus. It was on the recent YouTube update.<br><br>It is the very deep and thick root systems of the comfrey plant which give other plants the advantage as they draw both water and nutrients back to the top soil and the leaves rot easily and feed the topsoil. Go hard! I'm taking more cuttings over the next few days as I was about 100 short.<br><br>Hi Cathy,<br><br>Glad to hear that you are feeling better / stronger. I'm finding more volunteer plants as the diversity increases here. I came across a self-seeded flat leaf parsley today in an unexpected place and the vegetables are heading into the orchard (rocket, mustard and nasturtiums are some of those paving the way). The local council made the job of collecting the volunteer comfrey easier because for some strange reason, they ran a grader blade through the middle of an established comfrey patch and turned a few tens of plants into hundreds of cuttings. Well done, council taxes at work. At least it is better than their blackberry spraying which leaves dry canes (another name for kindling)!

Disappointed to see that here. From what I understand the earth is shifting to a "new state" and whether that state will continue to support higher life forms, needless to say industrial societies, seems doubtful. <br><br>It also seems logical to assume that liberating 400 billion tons of CO-2 into the atmosphere in 150 years, with approx. 50% of that carbon burned in the last 20, may have extreme consequences. <br><br>The United Nations Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases states: "Beyond 1 degree C may elicit rapid, unpredictable and non-linear responses that could lead to extensive ecosystem damages." Sobering! <br><br>The sweep of changes occurring in earth systems is proceeding at such a rapid clip that there will be little time for speciation or adaptation for most non-generalist species.

AT 450 ppm CO-2, most plankton, the basis of the food web as well as the source for 1/2 the earth oxygen will be extinct.

He's done a remarkable thing and is very giving of his time, for free. <br><br>Of course, that he seems to be a good guy doesn't validate his conclusion about human extinction.

It's all the more ironic that one of the core themes the book addresses is being hashed out in the comments right now. <br><br>Marcello, some of us currently live in a capitalist system. Very large sections of the planet don't face that hindrance, and it's not exactly hard to see situations in which either populist or elite dictatorships could emerge here and elsewhere, focused on such issues as getting food produced and distributed. Of course you're right that there's every reason to expect sudden disruptions, but there's also every reason to expect drastic measures to be taken in response. <br><br>Phil H, yes, in the meantime, BAU. Agreed that ocean acidification is a real issue in the short to middle term -- for that matter, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see deep water anoxia as a major issue soon, if only because that's one of the standard ways the planet sucks excess carbon out of the atmosphere. As I've been saying all along, we're in for a rough ride. <br><br>Michael, equating what I'm doing with the behavior of "climate denial groups" could equally well be labeled a hyperbolic ad hominem attack, you know. The point that I'm making and you're missing is that the apocalypse myth hardwired into our culture can and does draw raw material from a dizzying array of sources, including the sciences, to fill slots in a preexisting narrative. In the runup to Y2K, the raw material came from worst-case scenarios taken from computer science; in the runup to 2012, it came from worst-case scenarios peddled by the New Age; in this case, it comes from worst-case scenarios proposed by some climate scientists. The narrative remains the same, and deserves to be discussed and critiqued on its own grounds.<br><br>Cherokee, thank you. <br><br>Mkroberts, you're missing my point, which is that the facts and factoids used to fill out the standard apocalyptic narrative are no more relevant to the narrative itself than the facts and factoids used to fill out any given speculative bubble are relevant to the trajectory of the bubble. Unless something derails it, the next few years will most likely see NTE turn into a full-blown millenarian frenzy, and become one of the standard excuses used by middle class people across the industrial world for not doing anything about the environment -- after all, if we're all going to die, why bother?

I think that some of the NTE handwaving represents a desperate attempt to Wake Up the Masses -- but another chunk of it amounts to an inability to imagine life at any "lower" level of technology or centralisation as livable, or to imagine it at all. The only alternative is mass suicide; which reminds me of J Diamond's haunting anecdote about the Norse colony in Greenland, so determined not to "go native" and adopt the foodstuffs and lifeways of the locals that they perished. Suicide by pig (or in this case cow) headedness.<br><br>Some of us will curl up and die rather than live under harsher conditions, give up our cars, learn to walk and row and cycle for transport, eat bugs, grow our own potatoes, chop wood, carry water; and others will do whatever they have to do to stay alive. To tell the truth I'm not entirely sure which I'll be, if indeed the hard choices come w/in my lifetime. But I do think the flexible pragmatists will live to pass on their skills to their kids; so I would expect a much-reduced human population of tough, resourceful, opportunistic gatherer/hunter/gardeners who are really good at exploiting the leftover junk of civilisation for toolage, shelter, etc: H Sap Bricoleur :-) This is, I guess, a completely unacceptable future for many people who imagined their descendants in fancy colour-coded polyester jumpers being beamed about by Scotty and his ilk.<br><br>OTOH, to me it's a reassuring future compared to the logical end-state of industrial capitalism: 100 percent Enclosure, 100 percent surveillance, 100 percent monetisation of every possible interaction between people, 100 percent dispossession and deskilling of the general population, 100 percent consumption of all biotic productivity by humans, 100 percent power in the hands of owners/controllers of the money supply, etc. We seem to be at about 75-80 percent on some of these trends right now and frankly, H Sap Bricoleur seems to me a more cheerful future (even in smaller numbers) than H Sap Corporatus Maximus.<br><br>I don't really fancy either scenario; for me, the idyllic life was probably an epoch that's already gone by -- like the bucolic backwaters of rural southern England in the 1920s-30s perhaps, or the prosperous 1950's on the remote coast of BC, or perhaps that more distant happy age on the shores of the Black Sea where (per Ascherson in a delightful book) not much of historical interest happened for about 400 years (nice!). But if I had any g-g-grandkids in prospect, I would prefer to see them free-range, roaming, improvising, practising permaculture and foraging and bricolage in small Dunbar-sized bands; not RFID chipped, marinated in mandatory advertising and junkfood from birth, and sentenced to 20 years' servitude in a million-hog CAFO for the crime of having saved and planted some seeds that someone at Syngenta claimed copyright on.<br><br>Both extrapolations are kind of scary and maybe a bit silly, but frankly, extrapolating BAU seems even scarier to me than extrapolating descent. I just wish that the gd freight train would slow down some instead of this reckless acceleration (Liberals won recent BC election which means official support for the "Gateway" tar sands pipeline, a disaster on so many levels, don't get me started...) -- I'd like to leave a more functional biosphere to those free-range descendants of ours.

Even if my beliefs and images of the future are considerably different from theirs. I sincerely thank you for your determination to maintain the politeness of conversation, it's been a pleasant opportunity over the years to learn how to really consider the reasons why hose shapes in the stars might not be a gigantic space walrus who just might not have photon flippers, might be other things worth really considering in ways possibly more constructive than "what to do to protect yourself from a blow from a photon flipper"; but even how to discuss such possibilities with firm believers in photon flippers in kind ways.

I got over three million hits. More generally, though, I'm judging by comparing the NTE blogosphere buzz with the equivalent phenomena in previous apocalyptic fads: a qualitative and subjective judgment, I freely admit, but it's worked before. <br><br>Unknown, many of the things you've cited have happened before, repeatedly, in Earth's history. Along with those positive feedback loops, you might consider looking into some of the extreme negative-feedback loops that are currently showing signs of cutting in -- for example, the collapse of the thermohaline circulation leading to worldwide deepwater anoxia, leading to the removal of carbon from the biosphere over a geological time frame. <br><br>Jean-Vivien, I've addressed those claims -- which have been being made since before I was born, by the way -- in a number of previous posts. The very short version is that those robots can only exist and function given cheap abundant energy and the other conditions of industrial society, which are going away. <br><br>BlueTemplar, for the last half century or more we've heard a constant barrage of proclamations from various leftward groups that now's the time to get out and fight, to borrow your words, as often as not using doomsday claims as motivation.

For what it's worth, my best guess is that business as usual has precisely no hope of continuing for more than a few more decades; the model sketched out in <i>The Limits to Growth</i> remains the most accurate prediction we've got so far, and given that we're already in the early stages of the Long Descent, the dreams of technological triumphalism are way past their pull date. <br><br>Michael, I quite understand that you disagree with my assessment. I disagree with yours. You're insisting that we have to take this version of the same old apocalypse narrative seriously because it draws its raw material from sources you find respectable; I'm saying that it's still the same old narrative, and will fail to predict the future accurately no matter what claims are used to back it. <br><br>Robert, thank you.

He seems to base a lot of this on the extremely rapid warming we will experience the coming 100 years, which could be rather fatal for a lot of species.<br><br>The wildcard in all of this is the amount of methane that will be released in the coming years. Those can be a game changer if any of the data on the amount of methane stored are really true. I dont know and havent really read any science about the rate of release we might expect in different scenarios.<br><br>But I can understand Guy a bit as well, as you can find snippets like this on e.g. ocean acidification, here a quote from wikipedia:<br><br>" The current acidification is on a path to reach levels higher than any seen in the last 65 million years, and the rate of increase is about ten times the rate that preceded the Paleocene–Eocene mass extinction."<br><br>Its clear that a lot of things in the ecosystems today are happening at rates 10 times previous mass extinctions. Does that necessary lead to NTE? Its a hard call, as the science linking past experiences to the likelyhood of it happening now seems to miss. At least some firm conclusions are missing - but that might also be because geologists and climate scientists cant really use NTE possibility in their language or the majority of people would view them as nuts and not get anywhere.<br><br>But I do think that a number of scientists look at the rate of change as alarming. Just CO2 concentrations in the air is rising at 10 times the rate that the earth came out of the past ice age.<br><br>James Hansen also say that there is a many decades of delay in the system with regards to how the climate reacts to higher CO2, which is perfectly understandable as the additative heat absorbed by the earth will grow even at stable CO2 levels. So in that sense, the past 30 years of incredible growth in CO2 emissions is something we have barely tasted the consequences of.<br><br>Its clear that the earth is trying to find a new equilibrium with the massive deep sea heat increase the past 30 years too. And no doubt this heat will have a major ecosystem impact on the bottom of the food chain. Again the problem is the rate of change which is exceptional in Earths history.<br><br>So don't discount Guy's NTE as being just another round of doomer predictions - but rather try to figure out what the science says with regards to the responses on the big rate of change. I seriously think he is worried about this. And to be frank, climate change NTE is far more believing than asteroids, bible or Mayan calendar ragnarok. That said, I am sure Guy is overestimating the time scale on this - but NTE in 300 years time is still NTE.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c3314805016761670120 title="comment permalink">5/18/13, 2:17 AM</a><br><br>

That just makes no sense. If your car's accelerator (gas pedal) is stuck and the steering broken, then you are going to go off that cliff, unless you run out of fuel well before hand. That is, the facts actually do make a difference to whether the narrative reflects reality.<br><br>Whilst I do agree with him that the future is unknown (which I think is what he's saying) that also applies to his predictions (though I think that's why he prefaced this essay with a prediction of his that turned out more or less right) in general.<br><br>I also agree with JMG that the worst predictions of scientists have been used to construct the narrative. However, positive feedbacks would definitely result in the narrative being correct, even if the time-line was wrong. I've read a number of people, who are not prone to wild fantasy, who think the human extinction is on the cards for either this century or next. Looking at the damage we're doing to the environment, in so many ways (the vast majority of the planet's eco-systems show signs of human-induced stress), I don't think it's possible to gain too much insight from past civilisational collapses. Without this environmental damage, I'd be right on board with JMG's long decline. With the environmental damage, I think there is ample reason to suspect that the problem could pile up much more quickly than JMG imagines.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c4447563647591454558 title="comment permalink">5/18/13, 4:31 AM</a><br><br>

Augustine's thesis is that the Temporal City must not be taken as of ultimate importance, since our homeland is elsewhere. I inaccurately paraphrased the thesis by comparing the Temporal City to a time-wasting Spielberg film. <br><br>On pondering Spielberg at breakfast this morning, I realized that I had been promoting a theologically dubious "contemptus mundi". <br><br>Unqualified contempt for the secular world cannot be a position of the best Catholic theologians, even though some in the Church have promoted it, forgetting the Gospel of John ("God so loved the world...").<br><br>What I would now suggest as a sound guide, indeed as a sound gloss on John, is some work of Julian of Norwich. This mediaeval anchorite had a vision in which the secular world was a thing the size of hazel nut, held in the palm of the Father. In her vision, Julian says, "But it is so small and weak; is it not simply going to perish?" She thereupon hears a voice telling her that the hazel-nut thingie is loved, and therefore will be conserved. <br><br>I would privately speculate that this being-conserved is compatible with the social-breakdown miseries that we narrowly escaped in October of 1962, and again with the miseries plausibly depicted in the JMG new-dark-ages fiction "Star's Reach", and yet is incompatible with NTE. I would also urge that this being-conserved helps make meaningful our own efforts at constructive civic action in the secular realm, for instance when we act civically in JMG's Green Wizardry framework. <br><br>Although I have not seriously read St Augustine for years, I cannot believe that he would have forgotten John or would dissent from Julian. It is basically like this, that we have to acknowledge the importance and worth of the visible, secular world (Augustine's <br>"Temporal City"), and our duty of constructive civic action in that world, even while admitting that our actual homeland (sometimes the Latinists write "Patria") is the Eternal City. <br><br>A trained theologian, which I am not, would here add something about the Incarnation and the need to see the Temporal City as somehow not negated, but rather eventually taken up into and fulfilled in, the Eternal City. The best theologians would no doubt say that this is a "mysterium fidei" and that attempts to spell it out as a Tim LaHaye Rapture risk vulgarizing it. <br><br>One part of theology probably consists in demonstrating, with logic and with evidence marshalled from Hebrew and Greek philology, Middle-Eastern archaeology, comparative religion, and general anthropology, biology, and physics, that on these-and-these points we cannot in the current state of scholarship and science say more. <br><br><br><br>(signed) <br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>near Toronto, Canada<br>www dot metascientia dot com<br><br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c6426365531547571255 title="comment permalink">5/18/13, 11:27 AM</a><br><br>

And as dire and absolutely serious as the possible effects on the functions of those material and energy loops must be, bringing extinction into the discussion just strikes me as silly.<br><br>There, I said it. Silly. I mean Monty Python silly.<br><br>What is serious, and makes the whole discussion stupid, is that there is a LOT of territory between where we are and extinction. Territory occupied by all manner of mass starvation, war, lawlessness, despair, human exploitation, and self-abuse. I'm not knowing enough to predict any of those, either, but it just seems there are a lot more realistic things to worry about, and the probability of any of them have got to be a lot higher than the probability that no reproducing Homo sapiens will be left alive in a few years.<br><br>The 1918 Great Influenza was the greatest human disaster to strike in recent times. It was enough to cause widespread panic and temporary loss of civil rights in the US. It killed about 3% of the world's population.<br><br>The Romans practiced "decimation" on their own soldiers for discipline. Apparently the threat of killing a tenth was enough to keep them mostly in line.<br><br>Again I don't know a lot, but it doesn't take much for me to add up that trying to feed 7 billion on a continually decreasing agricultural product and with the many effects of climate change is going to cause losses higher than either of those. Over a manageable time period it is hoped, but can anyone imagine what it would be like to lose half if the loss occurred over a short period? How about three quarters? 99%? That would still leave millions of humans on Earth, a number that existed for most of human history.<br><br>It would probably be described as a living Hell for anyone that lived through it, but it would be far from extinction. Sounds like enough of a threat to my simple mind. <br><br><br>Yes, the NTE crowd seems to have identified a lot of really serious problems that could have dire effects on whole human populations over a fairly short period. But what purpose does arm-waving and shouting about extinction serve?<br><br>It occurs to me that the message that the NTE people ought to be putting across given their beliefs ought to be, "You are probably going to die within the next few decades." Again, I don't have enough info to assess that claim, but it really is all they can honestly say, given their conclusions. How is that different from "We're all going to die!" Well, it seems to me that the latter puts it into the realm of fantasy, into the abstract, into the out-of-the-way box of we can't do anything about it.

I considered it unlikely that I would get nuked in the 60s (MAD is a valid concept), didn't buy into the Y2K excitement, nor the 2012 hoopla. That said, about 1971, while a geology major in college, I read a research piece on the increase in atmospheric CO2 to that time, and possible implications. It took me just a few days to think it through, that it would probably result in humanity pretty quickly reversing the environmental conditions that permitted our evolution.<br><br>JMG mentioned homeostasis; that is exactly the mechanism I projected out. The deposition of the coal and petroleum/natural gas was due to planetary conditions that favored carbon removal from the biospere and atmosphere; if humans put the bulk of that carbon back into the atmsophere, it will cause a return of the conditions that favored their original deposition. Those conditions are not favorable for humans.<br><br>Emmanuel Goldstein-<br>You are quite correct; photosynthetic organisms have changed the environment on a plantary scale. The Earth's early atmosphere was high in methane and ammonia; photosynthetic plants removed the ammonia and replaced the CO2 with biomass and oxygen. This permitted the rise of oxygen-using animals.<br><br>Phil Harris-<br>"Climate Change as a subject is not such a big deal here in Britain." As it turns out, one of the possible early climatic disruptions may be thermohaline circulation. If the Gulf Stream diminishes, changes course, or stops flowing, Britain is in a WORLD of hurt.<br><br>Vera, beneaththesurface-<br>I will aknowledge tha Guy McPherson seems to be very pessimistic, or should I say, way to early in his time lines. As a scientist I am uncomfortable with his certainty and short timeframe, but I appreciate that he is inspiring conversation.<br><br>Mean Mr Mustard-<br>Your comment on the partial failure of the rapeseed crop touches on one of McPherson's arguments: relatively small perturbations of atmospheric (in this case, the jet stream) or oceanic circulation can have immediate dire effects on food production in an overpopulated world.<br><br>JMG-<br>"Human beings are right up there with rats and cockroaches in our ability to adapt to different environments, a classic generalist species well adapted to sudden change and disruption. Given the geographic spread and the diversity of environments currently inhabited by Homo sap., too, we're an exterminator's nightmare. I expect global population to bottom out in two centuries or so at well under half a billion people, but that's an ample breeding population for long term survival, to say nothing of the impact of all that Darwinian selection." That is all true, but as I understand him, one of McPherson's arguments is that most of the other species that humans depend on for their survival are not such adaptable generalists.<br><br>For what it's worth, a slow decline and a Green Wizard future seems like the virtuous triumphing after a purifying ordeal...a utopian Golden Age if you will.

This is what always strikes me about millenarian groups—their hopes are not so much directed toward the future life of bliss itself, as they are to a day when they will have an opportunity to say "I told you so". Ostensibly the ideology is about being good, but it's really about being right.<br><br>This is not a feature that, say, Austro-aboriginal Dreamtime "ideology" can afford to exemplify. The Dreaming can assume that it is unchallenged, and thus the whole balance of its significance is swung into making life as it is lived now—in this particular place and time—possible, enjoyable, and meaningful. Generally speaking, it seems unwise to anchor your identity on a tangible prediction, and make your self-worth rise and fall on whether or not you have been right.<br><br>That's how I am taking this week's post at any rate, since I just wrote a long post for my own blog on the Western commitment to the Uniformity of Truth and the Adequacy of Language, since it seems that this is the only context in which religious worldviews anchored so completely in "I told you so" make all that much sense. <br><br>http://thesacrificinganimal.blogspot.com<br><br>This is the essay.<br><br>Adam Names a Sparrow<br><br>In which my sister's friends grow tired of labels, India is partitioned, Aristotle conquers the world, a madman relieves the siege of Fort Stanwix, John Dee is cuckolded in pursuit of Adamic language, a sparrow is named, and I try to explain why I have some culpable sympathy for postmodernism <br><br>Props to you, JMG for continually emphasising—(as Beowulf might have it)—the great abyss between words and deeds.

If you always do what you've always done...<br><br>Mkroberts, er, you may want to reread my post. I started out by agreeing that humanity will go extinct someday, and could possibly do so soon. It's when people start insisting that it will <i>inevitably</i> go extinct by 2030 that science has been replaced by an overfamiliar myth, because that statement cannot be justified by any current scientific knowledge. <br><br>Panskeptic, human beings can eat a remarkable range of things; there are several countries in the world in which rat is a major protein source, and insects are very nourishing as well. If you want to say that modern industrial civilization won't survive a significant environmental change, I'm not arguing -- in fact, I've been saying that all along. By the way, you might want to take a closer look at research into the deposition of fossil carbon; the deepwater anoxic event we're well on the way to causing in the oceans generally is a major carbon sink (anoxic events triggered by greenhouse effects are where most of today's oil reserves come from) and it's not inimical to vertebrate life on land, as any brontosaur could tell you. <br><br>DeAnander, hmm! You may be right. As for CheatNeutral, very funny!<br><br>Heraclitus, thank you. A solid essay, btw. <br><br>Lidia, you've done an extraordinary job of standing what I've said on its head. Is extinction possible? Of course, and I said so in my post. The point with which I take issue, as I said in very clear terms, is whether it's <i>inevitable</i>. The knowledge we presently have cannot justify that claim, and those who are making it are thus clearly following the lead of something other than objective scientific knowledge. I've suggested that the "something other" is a mythic narrative hardwired into our culture, which has popped up at regular intervals for a couple of thousand years and used every imaginable set of claims as raw material. If you want to argue with that claim, by all means, but evading the claim and trying to insist I've said something I haven't is not exactly a convincing form of argument, you know. <br><br>Diane, exactly. Say "we might go extinct" and you may be able to motivate constructive action. Say "we will inevitably go extinct" and you guarantee that nothing good will come out of it. <br><br>Lidia, since the facts on the ground do not justify the claim of inevitable extinction, the question of where that narrative comes from is obviously worth raising. As for third options, er, have you forgotten all those people out there who insist that we can fix it all with geoengineering, or what have you? It's the same old "progress or catastrophe" narrative, to which I'm trying to present an alternative -- and it's par for the course that those who, like you, are rehashing a familiar trope would accuse me of "intransigence" for not meekly falling into line behind the same old myth in its latest dress. <br><br>PhysicsDoc, good heavens -- you of all people should know that a difference in scale is not necessarily a difference in kind, especially when you haven't shown that the process under discussion (e.g., the fall of a civilization) are influenced by the variable whose change in scale you've noted. To say "X is happening at the same time as Y, and X is unprecedented" proves nothing about Y.

Your statement that “claim[s] amount to nothing more than an insistence that worst-case scenarios are the only possible outcome” is tendentious and tautological, saying that, seeing as bad news only tends to promulgate bad news, we must reject bad news out of hand as being suspect of being bad news.<br><br>"[T]he facts on the ground do not justify the claim of inevitable extinction," Here we must definitively part ways, as I see ample indications that human life will be hard-pressed to survive the ecological and climactic shifts in our future.

However, this latter statement then talked about asteroid strikes and the like. What Guy McPherson and Dr Malcolm Light are talking about is that extinction is all but assured in "short order" due to human induced climate change. Whilst I agree that exact timing of that extinction unknowable (even though Malcolm Light appears to get it down to decimal places, that is just an average across the globe and hemispheres), it seems as though you were dismissing the notion simply because of the ending being seen as fairly close (within 2-4 decades). If I'm still alive in 15 years, I'd be surprised to see extinction looming within a couple of years (I'm in the southern hemisphere, so would be able to observe the northern hemisphere extinction, assuming there was some way of seeing what was going on then). But, given the contents of the narrative, not the ending only, this won't be a December 21st, 2012 type of prediction. It would be fairly obvious well before extinction that we're in that kind of situation.<br><br>So I don't think NTE can be simply lumped together with those failed apocalyptic prophecies; it is, I think, of a very different kind of prediction - one that we would be able to see unfolding well before the supposed date of extinction.<br><br>It's easy to dismiss it, I suppose, but what I'd prefer to see is a science based (or, at least, rationally based) argument that shows the science behind the prediction is wrong.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c6958855332558835211 title="comment permalink">5/19/13, 1:42 AM</a><br><br>

You are talking about how it works as cultural narrative, but this isn't a culturally-derived theory, is it? It's based on the realization by climate scientists that the original climate science and models were too optimistic, as judged by actual measurements of actual weather. And by the way, "the earth has been warm before" is a pretty poor rebuttal - actually right out of the standard anti-science handbook. It looks a heck of a lot more like your narrative is the one being threatened by the evidence, cultural insights and peak oil wisdom notwithstanding.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c5949065242388835471 title="comment permalink">5/19/13, 7:36 AM</a><br><br>

I actually followed many of the hyperlinks to try to find out if they said what he said they said. Based on my reading, it's an awful lot of mental acrobatics to draw the conclusions he does from the sources he cites. Besides which, many of the links in his piece simply refer to other blogs, most of which don't show their work on how they got from A to B. It's one thing to say "The IEA predicts we'll burn enough carbon to reach 450 ppm CO2e by 2030." It's an entirely different animal to jump from there to "That means we're back at the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum by 2030, in which <b>WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!!</b>" (emphasis in original, of course)<br><br>The most fascinating thing about this whole phenomenon is when the defenders of the faith come here and accuse JMG and the rest of us who are rightfully skeptical, of exactly the sort of mental gymnastics needed to reach the conclusions in Guy M's piece. I read through the source material, and it's just not as definitively saying what they think it is. Are we in for an uncomfortable future? That's highly likely. Are many people going to die younger than they would have 20 years ago? Probably. But beyond that, the narrative of apocalypse is obviously coloring the reading of a lot of true believers on this one.<br><br>There's a lot of hyperbole about nuclear power plants in that narrative as well. Yes, of course it's not a good thing if they melt down, but it's also not some apocalyptic event, either. Specifically look at Chernobyl, where there are all kinds of mammals and other vertebrates living in a highly contaminated landscape. I'm not saying we should take nuclear power lightly or build more of it (I'd prefer if we began shutting down the plants 20 years ago or more), but even that is not a trump card in the game of human extinction. For all of our faults, we are still among the most widely adaptable species on the planet, and if there's one thing likely to cause our extinction in the near term, it's probably our willingness to believe that our extinction is inevitably imminent and a good excuse for us not to change our behavior.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c8734261610767653821 title="comment permalink">5/19/13, 9:34 AM</a><br><br>

You are right about the comment about scale and form. A classic example is simple exponential growth (a kind of form). In this case the population depends exponentially on time which means that the rate of population change is proportional to the population. If you scale the population then the rate of change of population also scales by the same amount. Things scale if the same form applies or scaling things does not change the form. I have not analyzed the human population as a function of time but it appears to me that there has been a change of form that has occurred relatively recently (last 200-300 years say). Either the exponential constant has significantly changed or we have gone from a near linear function to an exponential function. Something like that. Basically the form has changed. This means we are in dangerous territory if we try too model the future by the past. Another thing to notice is that the earth is not an infinite reservoir and that the population has scaled significantly and the earth has not. You know all this so I apologize for sounding like I am assuming you do not. My gut tells me you may be closer to right prediction but that is not science just my preference or intuition.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c7117663448478925035 title="comment permalink">5/19/13, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>

Given the current state of climate science, it's reasonable to say that human extinction is possible, but the knowledge we currently have does not justify the claim that it's inevitable. That is, we can't yet predict with 100% accuracy that 100% of all human beings will be dead by 2030, or any other date in the next century or so you care to choose. We don't know what the climate will do; all we have are models subject to error, and trying to claim absolute certainty on the basis of an uncertain model is not justified. <br><br>This is what I've been saying all along, and the fact that an intelligent and literate person like you can't or won't hear that is among the things that have convinced me that something profoundly nonrational is shaping the rise of belief in near-term extinction. <br><br>GuRan, thank you for getting it. For what it's worth, I expect climate change to be a good deal more traumatic than the current mainstream models predict -- one more data point that's gotten lost in the yelling. <br><br>Mkroberts, the hypothesis McPherson and Light have proposed is worth consideration on its own merits. The uncritical acceptance of that hypothesis by a sizable and growing number of people who are treating it not as a hypothesis to be tested, but as a truth to be proclaimed, is another matter -- and it's the latter that interests me. As far as I know, most climate scientists do not agree with McPherson and Light; it'll be interesting to see the critical reviews of their work by those who have the background necessary to assess it. In the meantime, there's what looks like a world-class apocalyptic frenzy shaping up around that as yet untested hypothesis. <br><br>TIAA, nicely summarized. Yes, I've met the close equivalent. <br><br>David, I didn't dismiss the extinction scenario as unlikely; I pointed out that it's unfounded at this point to claim that it's inevitable. One of the most fascinating things about this whole debate is the extent to which people seem to be unable to hear what critics of the NTE hypothesis are saying. As I mentioned to Lidia, it's one of the things that convinces me that what's happening has very little to do with science. <br><br>JP, thanks for the link!<br><br>Steve, that was certainly my impression. <br><br>PhysicsDoc, thank you for a cogent response! Of course the differences of scale will have an impact on those aspects of our predicament that are scale-dependent; compare the collapse of Neolithic regional civilizations to continental empires with advanced metallurgical technology and complex market economies, and you also see plenty of scale-dependent factors. The interesting thing is that the process of collapse appears to be scale-invariant across this very broad continuum; my hypothesis is that important aspects of that same process will also appear in the collapse process of industrial civilization.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c700590301420717900 title="comment permalink">5/19/13, 11:31 AM</a><br><br>

Prior to reading up on Mr. Savory's work, I was put ill at ease by the obvious need in Guy to dismiss out of hand another leading scientist. It is clear that Guy has prescribed to his own extremist position and pigeon holed himself into an apparent fatalistic dead end. NTE which I initially took to mean we are putting ourselves near extinction, but which I now get means total human extinction is near, is another indicator that Guy is sinking under his own fatalistic stance. He needs to be helped out if this trap and I admire John for offering him a way to get the help. <br><br>Locking ourselves off from the world and it's humanity, though I get the pressures that would drive a person away, is not truly what will contribute to helping mitigate the crash landing. Fighting to the end in the melee of incertatude which most of us are left behind to do, is the hardest work. I think Guy should change his stance and use science to help us live rather than condem us to uncertain death. <br><br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c7321462748935846172 title="comment permalink">5/19/13, 12:44 PM</a><br><br>

Despite the assumptions being made just now by a lot of my critics, this post isn't aimed at McPherson -- it's aimed at the remarkably large number of people who've taken NTE as gospel truth, rather than as an unproven scientific hypothesis, and are pretty clearly using it as a replacement for the late lamented 2012 hysteria. <br><br>Renaissance, understood -- it's a real limitation to have to look oneself in the face each morning. <br><br>Leo, that's an interesting way of splitting the difference!

Still, we'll see. <br><br>Orren, the ironic thing is that I didn't know that McPherson was promoting the NTE thing when I wrote this post. I don't read a lot of blogs, other than a few peak oil and ecology news aggregator sites; I was responding to a flurry of comments and emails I'd received on the order of "well, we're all going to be extinct anyway, so why bother making preparations?" As for Age of Limits, one of the things I appreciate about the event is that it's got a wide range of different viewpoints among its presenters -- Dmitry's a fast-crash partisan, for example, and iirc Albert Bates thinks that with enough biochar we can fix things and not crash at all, though I haven't read his recent work and will have to ask him.

Are the proponents of NTE not embattled climate scientists who are ignored at every turn because what they have to say is unpleasant?<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c153215579514276805 title="comment permalink">5/20/13, 2:51 AM</a><br><br>

A tree or a mammal, not so much…"<br><br>Trees and mammals don't have to evolve to survive climate change. They simply get up and walk to a new spot that is more conducive to their special requirements. <br><br>Now before you start dismissing that point, I'll tell you a little story about the Australian bush. Many tens of thousands of years ago before the presence of man, the forest here in this mountain range would have been dominated by the Blackwood tree (acacia melanoxylon). A really drought, heat, cold hardy and long lived over storey nitrogen fixing tree. In slightly wetter areas the dominant tree was Myrtle Beech (nothofagus cunninghamii) and it too is another beautiful tree. It is interesting to note just how drought hardy our rainforest trees actually are.<br><br>What the two trees don't have in common with the now dominant eucalypts is that they don't hybridise readily and they don't recover well from fire (although the Blackwood is more resistant and adaptable than the beech). <br><br>With man, came fire.<br><br>The trees however had other survival plans and simply moved upwards to higher elevations with cooler, moister climates where it was hard to burn them out.<br><br>We tend to think of forests as being fixed in place as boundaries are a manmade concept. However, they are happily moving randomly in all directions - some of which may provide suitable sites.<br><br>Much further north of my location in a warmer climate at elevation there are remnant patches of Antarctic Beech. What about the fascinating story of the woollemi pine?<br><br>The animals adapt too by moving around or changing their diets.<br><br>I spend a fair amount of time in nature and it always amazes me how plants spread from one area to another. Even the wallaby took up eating my citrus trees this year after many years of abstinence.<br><br>You may find that it is actually people that are the ones that fail or are afraid to adapt!<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c3902966903867510704 title="comment permalink">5/20/13, 3:03 AM</a><br><br>

Beyond that, a seriously disordered carbon-cycle developing over millennia would have serious results for all biological evolution. The later result would curtail any thoughts of post-industrial civilisation – ‘post’ that is the coming, indeed present failure of industry as we know it based on fossil fuel. <br><br>Several factors are in play.<br><br>We are approaching rapid extra ‘feedback’ factors in the North Polar Region (e.g. a smaller area of ‘white’ means more sun’s heat absorbed) when, already, temperatures have increased very rapidly this last century from a low point in 1900.<br><br> CO2 levels are still rising rapidly and are already higher than they have been since 2.5 to 6My years ago. (Methane levels have risen 2.5-fold from 'normal' background levels seen before industry kicked in. Methane has contributed about 20% of total ‘man-made’ forcing over that same recent time span).<br><br>Carbon ‘out gassing’ is part of the normal carbon cycle, as is the converse - carbon uptake by vegetation, but there has been net sequestration (more uptake) of ‘carbon in the air’ over the last 2 million years – mostly by carbon ‘dropping out’ of the cycle via the ocean. (Carbon ‘in the air’ has oscillated between ‘normal’ limits during the last million years – lower in glacial times, higher in inter-glacials but the overall picture has been ‘down’.)<br><br>Industrial civilisation at an increasing rate has ‘out gassed’ a lot of stored ancient carbon over a century and half. But not all of it is in the air. Quote: <i>“ Nature 2012 … Although approximately one-half of total CO2 emissions is at present taken up by combined land and ocean carbon reservoirs, models predict a decline in future carbon uptake by these reservoirs, resulting in a positive carbon–climate feedback. This continuing ‘service’ by ‘nature’ for industrial civilisation is looking very unpredictable.</i> <br><br><br>Here we get to another uncertainty. We expect a finite amount of fossil fuel will be drawn from the ground and burned. (Recent estimates by the Energy Watch Group indicate a major curtailment of ‘energy’ available for industry in the next decades.)<br><br>There are good arguments in favour of very soon slowing down carbon burning and leaving a little bit for the future. One extra argument is that such a ‘saving’ could help safeguard the present ocean carbon reservoir.

The oceans have become more acid in the layers where most of phytoplankton ‘vegetation’ and ‘grazers’ live. There is a question over whether the biota will collapse. At the moment they seem to continue to provide the service. <br><br>If the ocean biota collapse it is likely to be essentially irreversible on time scales that matter to us. The immediate results sound pretty devastating. It could also mean we will have overstepped the mark, and serious carbon cycle disorder is on its way a millennia or so hence. (Something like this appears to have happened back 55 million years ago at the PETM because of a series of ‘natural’ sudden ‘carbon out gassings’.)<br><br>This is more reason to slow down our carbon burn and save a bit for a ‘moderated’ decline in industrial civilisation? The danger of immediate effects from‘ocean-collapse’ is within present lifetimes of persons and businesses and more important in my view than, for example slowly rising sea-level.

Unfortunately, after digesting valid information into their world view, environmental doomsters got it all wrong. They start to sell Hollywood catastrophe movie version about problems ahead. It is hard to make accurate statistics about environmental disaster we are living through. Unknown variables are many, there is no way to make exact predictions. Environmental doomsters take easy path. They assume darkest possible statistics are accurate. Then they make darkest possible conclusions based to already distorted data. By doing this, they alienate themselves from so called "average people", whom they ridicule mercilessly without seeing their own errors... Overtly politicized science is no science at all.<br><br>This must have something to do with more general "doomsday zeitgeist" of Western culture; people in other parts of the world do not share this apocalyptic worldview, even when they are well-informed. Everybody who does not close his/her eyes knows by now hard days are ahead, but this "end of the mankind" attitude is absent in most parts of the world. <br><br>West is facing multiple crisis at the same time. Subconscious reflections of fears which cannot be said aloud gets expression through what can be said aloud (environmental fears) in politically correct world of Western bourgeois.<br><br>JMG's model of slowly eroding quality of life combined to haphazard, but mounting problems with ecosystems is probably closest to accurate prediction we will get. It sounds plausible exactly because you cannot make blockbuster movie out of it.<br><br>No space aliens. No sudden near extinction. No heroic struggle against hostile powers. Just everyday poverty. Everyday cruelty, that is not exciting or mysterious as movie villains always are. <br><br>Demographic decline can be silent one, like it was in former Soviet Union right after dissolution, without ANY outwardly dramatic events.<br><br>Hunger, real hunger has come back to Europe also after being absent so long current generation does not know what to do with it. <br><br>What we need instead movie aesthetics is old-school conservatism (not religious nutcases) with fiscal, environmental and social caution. Leaders who treat societies as organisms, not machines, and acknowledge mounting environmental and energy limitations. Unfortunately this kind of leaders of movements are nowhere to be seen. That other path is...well, little bit more bloody.<br><br>All those revolutionary wannabes with university degree but no weapon familiarity at all should remember that there are those OTHER revolutionaries too, who do not share same presumptions as you do. Without common ground to treat and without boringly cautious conservatives keeping balance there is high probability two extremes, who acknowledge same problems but offer totally different package of solutions shall meet in near future - on streets of Europe.<br><br>Know problems in Greece? Place that is prototype for European future? There is some footage of those OTHER revolutionaries of Greece... Nothing, NOTHING is as pro-status quo as being vaguely leftist, feminist, minority-rights, no-borders "rebel" in current West. Unfortunately cosy position of quota rebels makes people forget that violence actually IS an option that has been used with frightening frequency during human history. That we really should try to find out some plausible solutions, before SHTF-event happens and extremes become only options left. <br><br>Third video link leads to charming music video by band of European neopagan and Greek Member of Parliament Giorgos Germenis...<br><br>I wonder if he would like to sit down and drink cup of tea with, let's say, liberal leftist with university degree from women's studies and share some opinions..?<br><br>Could be interesting conversation to watch.<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQStwKFeUxM<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmKETVPf36o<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc1-BfZ7Jnc<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c8447379151440510353 title="comment permalink">5/20/13, 8:19 AM</a><br><br>

I have no objection to the hypothesis of NTE, as a hypothesis; it deserves to be assessed by qualified specialists on whatever its merits may turn out to be. It's the enthusiastic acceptance of that hypothesis as though it were irrefutably proven, the insistence on certainty in a situation where the science can't be made to justify more than cautious guesses, and the cherrypicking of studies to support the NTE claim -- out of the tens of thousands of climate predictions coming out of reputable labs, only a few back the NTE hypothesis, you know -- that has me thinking that what's going on has nothing to do with science and everything to do with the contemporary obsession with apocalyptic fantasies. <br><br>Cherokee, I've occasionally wished I had the acreage to plant Woollemi pine, dawn redwood, and ginkgo trees to make a dinosaur garden. <br><br>Phil H., it's quite possible that we may see some massive oceanic changes -- we'd have to get up to 1100 ppm or so of CO2 to get an oceanic anoxic event, but there are plenty of messes this side of that. Still, yelling "sinners in the hands of an angry Gaia" hasn't worked for decades now, and changing the details of the fire and brimstone isn't going to change that. <br><br>Lunab777, the fact that pursuing your own enjoyment is the only thing you can think of to do is precisely the issue I was trying to raise; for those of us who believe in a future, there are other things on the to-do list.

I'm sorry to say I suspect you're right -- it's stunning to me how the current European political class is busy making all the same mistakes their equivalents made in the 1920s and 1930s, and thus guaranteeing the rise of a new European fascism. I'll be doing a post on that down the road a bit. <br><br>Adrian, true, and you'll notice that none of the NTE people are willing to talk about the known negative feedback processes, or the evidence from paleoclimatology that kicks holes in their claims.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c8264838487722918983 title="comment permalink">5/20/13, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

I found it to be unreadable.<br><br>As he says of himself, his <i>friends</i> call him Dr. Doomsday, and the essays I forced myself to plow through were unfocused and unrelieved Jeremiads.<br><br>His first chapter, on Reason, is a typical screed on the contemporary version of the Mythology of Progress, man's rise from Unthinking Slime to Religion to Reason. In the process, he uses this as a platform to air his personal grudges against the academic community, religions and religious people, politicians, the military, bankers, and fools.

This has absolutely nothing to do with science, but will attract him an immediate and very loyal "support group" and audience.<br><br>I also see a man who was groomed into and sheltered by the academic community until he turned his back on it in his forties, and is now severely shell-shocked by the messy, dirty, unmanageable complexity of the "bazaar of the bizarre" that is our modern world.

Long time reader, first time commenter here. After reading a bit of Joseph Campbell, Charles Eisenstein, Jim Kunstler, The Dark Mountain Project, and yourself, I've been feeling a pull toward creating, or at least sharing stories that are appropriate for the predicament of peak oil and the expectations of the likely future, as opposed to the future of fantasy. I'd like to help write and tell what I call the mythology of resilience.<br><br>Now, I've taken your words to heart and have set about getting my own house in order by tending a garden, feeding the soil, building a scrap greenhouse, insulating and caulking the house, etc. in line with the green wizardry posts here. I'm also trained as a chemist and am saving for glassware to begin distilling essential oils and preparing various traditional herbal remedies.<br><br>I say all that not to boast, because I've got a long way to go toward living in accord with the way of nature. I say all that because I feel it's time to push some of the lessons I've learned out into wider circles, and despise the hypocrisy you've cited frequently in the environmental movement and elsewhere. To some extent, I do push out my personal stories. I trade veggies for snow plowing and borrowed tools. I shared my greenhouse project with a local high school that's looking to put in a school garden and greenhouse. However, the mythology of resilience is an itch in the back of my mind I haven't scratched. I'm not looking to just relate my first-hand experiences in the dirt, but to tell stories and myths that reach down into the subconscious. To borrow Campbell's phrasing, I want to tell stories in the language of dreams. I've found Kunstler's vision set forth in his <i>World Made by Hand</i> novels close to what I'm looking for, and while they're great reads, they're a little more focused on the practical and less on the spiritual for what I want to accomplish. I've yet to read <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i>, which I imagine will contain plenty of nourishment for inspiration. From a couple posts back, it sounds as though Hesiod may be a good place to look, too. I wonder what else you might recommend, fiction or non-fiction, contemporary or ancient, and anything in between, that is situated in a shape of time defined by decline, but is hopeful with regard to the enduring human spirit in the face of diminished expectations.<br><br>I may be a bit off topic and long-winded, so I won't take any offense if you keep this off the comment page. However, I do respect your breadth and depth of knowledge of mythology and literature, and would appreciate a response in whatever form you like. Thanks for your good work.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c7646058635756534578 title="comment permalink">5/20/13, 9:33 AM</a><br><br>

Just shove realizing beauty and trying to show it to the rest of the world so they might also believe or feel uplifted.<br>And spending more time with my daughter and moving to a more suitable location (the other 2 things I thought to mention I wanted to improve since realizing NTE is likely), well I don't want to be a pleasure glutton so I'll just ignore my child and we can fry here on the plains as the temperatures and drought keep increasing. I would not want to do anything enjoyable like moving away from a place where heat stroke is a likely possibility and the locals are now joking about how the river needs mowing.<br><br>Joking aside, you have created a false dichotomy here. You are saying that those who believe extinction is sooner rather than later will only be motivated by selfish, pleasure-seeking goals because there is no future. This just isn't true, or it doesn't have to be. In fact it can actually make people behave in more noble, less-selfish ways.<br>What was that Native American saying where someone says we should always live as if the bird of death is sitting on our shoulder. It's like that. I'm not saying my consciousness is always in that mode, but I wish it were. And the initial realization of NTE does cause a lot of uncomfortable emotions (yes selfish ones, and ones that immobilize). Not everyone looks a difficult reality in the face and gives up or goes on a pleasure-binge. The fact that you believe they do might say something about yourself - perhaps it is only what YOU would do if you believed in NTE.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c5481610059000030816 title="comment permalink">5/20/13, 12:33 PM</a><br><br>

If and when something projecting such a trend stands up to a peer review process, then it will be worth paying closer attention.

Some small groups completely wiped out. Doesn't mean every individual died, survivors may have been adsorbed into neighboring groups. We do know that entire villages were abandoned,with food stores left behind. The major difference I see between high death rates in a horticultural/hunting society such as the Eastern Native Americans and our own is that in these less complex groups every adult would have knowledge of most of the essentials of the culture. So you can lose a lot of people without losing the entire culture. We are in the opposite position. No single person in this culture has complete knowledge even of our own specialty. So the loss of a large percentage of the population would leave the survivors really bereft of knowledge.

Lerwill</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>lunab777, I rarely respond to other readers’ comments, but for once I will address the title of the post. I thought it very apropos. Ever looked after a dying family member? I did, my grandmother back in the 80s, when we looked after our families at home instead of putting them into care. Her mind and body deteriorated and she eventually slipped away one morning. We waited for long, long seconds for another breath to be drawn, but none came; my mother folded the sheet over her mother’s face and left the room. <br><br>For years I felt guilty for feeling relieved that she had passed. The family had struggled to give her hospice-level support while taking care of everything else, and it had taken its toll. I’ve also spoken with friends who were in the final stages of life, and some of those have communicated a certain pleasure when you accept that you can put down the burdens and accept the inevitable. We will all face it one day. There is pleasure in knowing the burdens, the pains, the fears and the hopes will soon no longer be a bother. There is pleasure in laying your head down from a rest and if you’ve been fighting the insane system of planetary destruction for a while, that is a tempting respite.<br><br>While people’s response to the data has the hallmarks of a “fundamentalist” approach –fundamentalist in that the literal interpretation of the data according to a specific dogmatic interpretation –I don’t think Guy is a willing John Darby. He does not seem to be savoring the news he’s delivering in a perverse “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry Planet” sort of way.<br><br>I’m looking forward to discussing the future with these two speakers at Age of Limits, who both have walked away current society and embraced the change we often criticize others for not making. I suspect they will have far more in common than many of their readers seem to think. <br><br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c4366129655631090910 title="comment permalink">5/20/13, 5:02 PM</a><br><br>

As far as I am concerned, a narrative is a story told by a story-teller, and JM being a story-teller (hammerer), everything is going to look like a story (nail) with an interested Creator. I don’t believe that I process things that way.<br><br>@Cherokee Organics, I’m much more of a visual thinker, so when I see young trees all around me snapped in half at the trunk (something I have never seen in all my born days), when I see that during a sunny May week with thousands of dandelions and other wildflower and a giant blooming crabapple and lilacs in my half-acre yard, yet I have seen exactly two bees and maybe 3-5 small outdoor flies and that’s it, when I read that bird populations are down due to lack of insect fodder, when I pick up a rock and find no insect life underneath… These instances are not just a matter of these species having moved house. It must be ten years since I have seen a clothes moth or a Daddy Longlegs. My old VT farmhouse has no spiders to speak of. No spiders because, well, there’s apparently nothing for spiders to eat here any longer. We do have ants by the bucketload, so maybe they’ll inherit the place for a time. Ants and knotweed.<br><br>Some species might move and thrive (cough-knotweed), but most won’t because few of them are as generalist as humans or even trees. The changes you mention having taken place over “tens of thousands of years” <b>simply cannot occur within a few decades</b> or even a century, although that’s what many people seems to be imagining. I simply find their “Narrative” less plausible than that of Prof. McPherson et al., and based on pleasurable wishful thinking to a far greater extent.<br><br>@lunab777, good comment. N.B., I’m not a “half-crazed frightened person”. I’ve generally reached a form of equanimity about the whole thing. I’m building my raised beds, and shifting my shopping from the grocery store to the CSAs and farmers markets. I’ve joined the Garden Club and some rural agriculture activist groups. The only thing that has changed in my life from before-NTE to after-NTE-awareness (8-9 months ago) is that I feel less desperate to be doing all-out “prepping” by buying a lot of tools and raw materials. (I’m rather mystified by JM’s catty remark -projection, lunab777?- that there is money to be made out of NTE; rather, the opposite.) I feel more forgiving toward fellow humans, rather than in a race to outwit them and be the Survivor on the Island.<br><br>@TracyG, I appreciated your valuable comment: “the attitudes I need to cultivate and the tasks I need to work on each day toward those aims, remain essentially the same regardless of the details”. I feel this way also. <br><br>@DeAnander: “"The ship is sinking and we're all gonna drown, so who cares if I'm picking your pocket [or worse]?" All I can say is that those who are pickpockets are out there pickpocketing both in good times and in bad, just as those who tend to share (studies show the poor are more generous than the rich) will tend to share. There are always going to be sociopathic people who are just “wired differently”. They don’t need NTE as an excuse: if they’re going to die also, their “winning” in the short term would be pointless anyway.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c662115326174266048 title="comment permalink">5/20/13, 7:16 PM</a><br><br>

You have basically equated people who believe in NTE to all sorts of either mislead and/or nutjobs…”<br><br>@Adrian Skilling: most of the NTE commenters seem to want to keep right on doing what they had been doing, whether that is pursuing permaculture or environmental activism or writing and meditating or what-have-you. Everyone’s a “part of the problem”, and a certain part of the conversation is occupied with “how much”. I won’t weigh in on whether that is a fruitless conversation to have or not, because I see the merits of both sides.<br><br>@Deborah Bender, in fact I don’t think that anyone at NBL thinks in terms of 100% extinction of life in the near-term, <br><br>@lunab777: ”I don't want to be a pleasure glutton so I'll just ignore my child and we can fry here on the plains as the temperatures and drought keep increasing. I would not want to do anything enjoyable like moving away from a place where heat stroke is a likely possibility and the locals are now joking about how the river needs mowing.” LOL! Thanks for the saying about the bird of death. Yes, it does behoove us to live more in the present than in either the Past or the Future. When I’m able to snap out of the mode of thinking about what I need to do to get through the day, I envy the rest of Earth’s creatures who merely live in the moment, and don’t have “projects”, and whose lives don’t have to have “meaning”. I think humans are defective in this way, a condition I have called “protagonism”. <br><br>The issue of “meaning” becomes very sticky and very personal, let me tell you, even among the NBL crowd. No one wants to be told their life has been meaningless, or worse, actively destructive. So really, the force of appealing narrative is going to lie -always- with the “hopium” crowd, whatever the historical context and whatever hope is on offer.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c6804333603432150120 title="comment permalink">5/20/13, 7:18 PM</a><br><br>

Iceland did it. <br><br>Western Europe has instead decided to succumb into violence and madness in the near future. Not tomorrow. Not necessarily next year. But in the near future, yes. And it is A DECISION, not unavoidable destiny.<br><br>And about class base of fascist movements. JMG is absolutely right, Joseph. Fascism is not upper-class movement. That opinion is part of rewriting the history by Marxist historians after WW2. They kind of had no opposition to speak of back then, you know. Historical fascist movements have roots firmly in lower middle-classes: in peasants, police officers, craftsmen, patriotic working classes and like. Historical fascism also is NOT synonymous with National Socialism. Unfortunately fascism is used as blanco term of shaming nowadays, so to most people it does not mean actually anything concrete. It is like political Darth Vader character coming to stage, making hissing sounds, being vaguely "evil". Fascism is not a good thing, but to understand it, it must be valued by true events of history... Just like socialism and liberalism, which are equally destructive ideologies. <br><br>Energy, environmental and social predicaments facing us need to be faced together as communities. Isolated survivalists shall not be winners of future; tolerance towards deviants is going to fall rapidly during hard times. Having organic food farm means nothing, if local paramilitary thugs can take it away from you any day they wish, or tax you to death. That is what happened in Middle Ages, you know.<br><br>And paramilitaries popping up is natural effect of governmental breakdown; tribal or gang formation is natural way of men. Belonging by blood... Look ANY vortex of chaos ripping apart state apparatus and you see this happening. Yugoslavia, Rwanda, criminal gangs of former Soviet bloc, Northern Ireland, Colombia... List just goes on and on. Are not large parts of USA inner cities already ruled over by vast and sophisticated ethnic gangs, many of them led from inside your prison system? You are treading that path already.<br><br>People need to be cautious and do things that are proven by tradition and time to be workable solutions. This is no time for utopian, grandiose dreams of big change. Those days are behind us now. <br><br>Localizing national and production horizons and decreasing dependence on long supply lines of global trade. Having nothing to do with overseas military expeditions. Setting up protective customs and reverting back to near autarchy with almost mercantilist economical policy. Letting standard of living and consumption drop, but in controlled way. Turning inwards as community.<br><br>Those are recipes for success in the future. They are ways to lessen the impact of resource depletion for your nation, your community. Many so-called "less developed countries" are already trying to use these policies to parry worst effects of ongoing crisis, and they are actually making pretty decent job in it. Unfortunately IMF and global bankster oligarchy are doing everything in their power to counter this localizing trend.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c4773688517366842477 title="comment permalink">5/20/13, 11:14 PM</a><br><br>

It doesn't seem totally implausible to me that we could still manage 8 or 9 billion with the best permaculture techniques that have been developed (in parallel to industrial agriculture) over the last few decades, drawing on knowledge acquired over countless centuries worldwide. I suspect there is still quite a bit more to be discovered in this field as well, once the incentives line up convincingly in favor of sustainable agriculture instead of industrial agriculture dependent on fossil fuels. But it seems that there do exist permaculture techniques that are capable of producing the sort of yields we will need to keep 8-9 billion people alive at subsistence level. I suspect we will fail to do this simply because we are bad at distributing resources, but that it is at least a theoretical possibility.<br><br>I guess my question is: do you know of any good estimates of Earth's human carrying capacity, and why do you consider those estimates reliable?

Please correct me if I am wrong.<br><br>Bird populations suffer from a lack of housing more than anything else. The older trees here provide hollows for the larger predator/carnivorous birds to live in. The smaller birds require dense thickets of shrubs so that they are safe from everything that would otherwise eat them. Have you thought about either planting some of this housing and/or putting up some appropriate bird housing? I've planted some dense thickets and this year, the small bird life has been incredible. They are really valuable as they bounce through the vegetable patches all day eating any bug unfortunate enough to get in their way.<br><br>Insects and reptiles also need housing and it is in short supply. Mounded rocks and maybe some old logs will provide some housing? I have easily 100m of rock walls with deep soil behind them and it is chock full of life. Every crevice gets used, even the scorpions serve some sort of function.<br><br>These creatures need a constant source of water during a dry summer too.

My immediate question about Light's hypothesis is why, given that there have been plenty of drastic temperature spikes that have suddenly heated the Arctic, is there no sign of anything like his postulated catastrophe anywhere in the geological record?</i><br><br>That's a great question, JMG; it's right up there with, "why propose a novel atmospheric transport model with no details or citations supporting it for arctic methane?" Instead of typical diffusion and mixing in the boundary layer (which would show up in surface concentrations), he proposes the biblical-sounding "stratospheric methane global warming veil." Never mind that it requires an arctic cyclone vortex (which is typical in winter) in the summer season when the methane releases have been observed, or that the "veil" doesn't seem to appear in satellite images of methane concentrations, or that the citations he does use don't seem to say what he cites from them, or that the supporting evidence looks very thin and cherry-picked. <br><br>What fascinates me is that he's gone to all this trouble to dress up the return of the fire/sun god and the final destruction of the planet in such a highly technical set of clothes. Really, what it looks like is a story of the resurrection of Re from the watery abyss, when he then sends Hathor to destroy mankind for usurping the powers of the gods.

I've just moved this past fall, not far from the center of a small town, with the luxury of a lot that backs up against a river (knotweed). There should be a lot of shelter for birds there, as there are forested swaths on both banks, for the most part.<br><br>I'm working with a local tree farmer who specializes in edible plantings to create a small “food forest” which would have the usual apples and stone fruit as well as also mulberries and elderberries and so forth for birds to eat, We already have a giant crabapple, which leaves plenty of fruit on the ground. We will be filling in a lot of what is now open lawn with a variety of beneficial plants, but I will make sure to include extra bushes per your insights, There are plenty of brush and log piles in the riparian zone (along with knotweed) Did I mention there was knotweed? It's coming up from under my barn foundation. Tree guy says to keep it around (it is impossible to get rid of anyway, apparently) because the dead hollow canes are good bee shelters.<br><br>The water you mention should be taken care of by the river. Vermont is not too dry of a zone, yet.<br><br>There are a few rock borders on the property but I will keep in mind to expand upon them as critter shelters. I have heard some spring peepers in the distance. Thanks for that info about the ants. We are bringing in lots of compost for the raised beds, fruit trees and other planting areas. The part that seems ant-ridden is where a water line had to be dug up: the topsoil/subsoil layers were disturbed. Digging in the “regular” yard dirt I do come across earthworms, although sometimes they don’t move. Is that because of cooler weather, because they are playing dead, or because I killed them with my trowel?<br><br>I think I explained that I am not “giving in to despair”. I’m following the same stop-gap permacultur-ish plan that I’ve been working towards for a few years. I have to care for my elderly mom on O2, so the off-grid home is still in the future.

Note that I didn't call you or any other ADR commenter a “defender” of any kind of “faith”. That’s your terminology, and I find it an interesting one. I don’t have “faith” in NTE, I merely think it is extremely likely. N.B., I don’t have any kind of “faith”… which has already earned me scorn here among the majority theists, so it’s pretty funny to be accused of a faith I don’t have: not in religion, nor in politics, nor in technology/science, although I trained as a scientist. I’m a “show me” person, rather than a “tell me” person and I distrust narratives as being accurate representations of reality, although they may on occasion be useful tools, often in terms of self-delusion or the intentional deluding of others, sadly. I don’t pretend to be omniscient, and am quite aware that scientific agendas can be set. However, if anything, all of the climate-change reports seem to show themselves, on an ongoing basis, as having been too conservative.<br><br>I didn’t set out to “complain about JMG’s title”, I happened by as I do each week. and seconded lunab777’s observation that JMG is, of course, going to get testy responses when he chooses to poke others with sticks. I really don’t care how he titles his posts and I was not offended by the title, rather, perplexed, since I don’t see his straw man (the gleeful end-of-the-worlder seeking to “cash in”) among the NBL group of posters and commenters.<br><br>Choosing to cherry-pick a single comment from a single commenter as somehow being representative of the NBL readership is unfair. B9K9 is one of the many commenters at JHK’s blog. If you’ve ever tried to slog through those comments then you know what happens when comment threads are not censored. JMG censors his comment threads; Guy McPherson does not. JHK does not, although he should, because racists, “wackadoos” and general mayhem-mongers have made the threads on his blog impossible to follow. A few have chosen to cavort at NBL, some under different names than those they use at Clusterlove Nation. B9K9 ain’t the worst; he actually writes kind of okay, trying to emulate JHK’s devil-may-care grade-B gonzo style.<br><br>Rather than focus on comment trolls, perhaps you might go back and look at some of the posts from BadlandsAK, or KathyC or any of a number of people who are exploring what it means to be human in the face of mortality. There are many loving and poignant passages. <b>When you know the world to be on hospice</b>. certain things come into focus for many people, if the Earth is a beloved one. KathyC rightly points out that it’s helpful to overcome the massive import of “extinction” by frequently reminding us that dying is dying, and that we are all going to die no matter what. What’s remains important is what you do with the time you have left. <br><br>As to being socially isolated because of “knowing the truth”, this is only a matter of degree, as boatloads of commenters at the ADR as well as Club Orlov and other “doomer” blogs (doom apparently being in the eye of the beholder) have expressed their inability to share with their spouses, family and friends their concerns about the stability of the financial system, the future of industrial society, the possibility of feeding 8 billion people with ever-dwindling resources of every kind. Knowing these unpopular truths makes one socially isolated by default, because “society” = BAU. You WILL get the stink-eye if you question “growth” in this country (the US).<br><br>Mike Ruppert recently made a mini-post at NBL, thanking Guy for “a place to cry”. A place to cry has value. We are facing enormous losses, NTE or no NTE, and some people would like a way to process that without being judged “crazy”. If the ADR is -instead- the place to stiffen your upper lip, roll up your sleeves and engage in 19th-century-style mental hygiene, that has value, too. I follow both blogs.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c9078016389195140461 title="comment permalink">5/21/13, 7:53 PM</a><br><br>

I started my working career as seventeen year old steel worker, and treated that path quite long time. I KNOW that both ends of political spectrum are hustlers in disguise; unwillingness to cut losses makes them both delusional. That fact is the main reason for rise of populism in Europe; people are angry and frustrated because old solutions don't work. Of course, average people are neither ready to scale down, so... Who is to blame?<br><br>My resentful feelings towards Left are born from the fact that they betrayed my own group, working class males, big time. Leftists stabbed us to the back. Our populist leader Timo Soini actually caused quite a political storm here in Finland just a couple days ago by saying this fact, obvious to any blue-collar man under fifty, aloud in the Parliament. Nothing is as deep emotion as scorn towards former brother... Ask Cain, if you don't believe :). <br><br>You probably get glimpse to my attitude after talking with any American worker, obviously voting value conservatives of GOP. From what I have read, American working man experienced roughly same kind betrayal earlier on, when "leftist" wing of Democrats put dagger between working man's shoulder blades.<br><br>And yes, probably majority of people are not going to scale down willingly. That is probably reason behind all this extinction hype. It is easier to fantasize about your own painless death than face future where you have to give up ideas and things dear to you. For materialist progressives, it is the pain of losing gadgets of current living standard; for spiritual progressives it is pain of losing lifestyle described as only worth to live by feminist/progressive ideology. <br><br>Instead of facing grim reality they both fantasize about imminent destruction, because story they live in is coming to end. We cannot perceive reality but through world explanation stories we tell ourselves as communities and individuals. So, for progressives, destruction of world explanation story of theirs equals end of the world.<br><br>This phenomenon is actually psychologically very common among war zone children. After losing their whole families and foundations of their existence to horrible realities of rape camps, mass executions and raging diseases many orphaned children in former Yugoslavia believed imminent end of the world is coming, or reverted towards "wolf child"-mental state. It was quite a work field for UN forces and private operators alike. Truth was, world worth to live on inside heads of these children had died or fragmented and needed to be rebooted; actual world just went on with business as usual.<br><br>...And for readers living in former Byzantine/Ottoman territory, I was not taking sides with above comment. Most important fact is that there is now peace on Balkans... At least some kind of peace. <br><br>Chris, with paramilitarism I meant warlordism, which is way older phenomenon than industrial world. I have understood that in different spheres of anglo-saxon language area, "paramilitary" means different things. I meant local strong men forming "protective associations" protecting (?) and taxing population under their control. Medieval knights did this. China during its brief republican era had them. In Northern Ireland, INLA/PIRA fall to category on republican side and UFF/UVF on loyalist side. During Balkan War, many former Yugoslavian states formed this kind of organizations... But I talk about them no more. Afghan warlords and baron Ungern-Stenberg from history fall into this category too. Not-so-official troops living off land, high gasoline prices do not bother them...<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c4899413607032439040 title="comment permalink">5/22/13, 3:28 AM</a><br><br>

[The teacher] gave us an example of a man being given the exact time of his death. It seems it is quite possible the man died at that moment not because he was destined to, but because he *expected* to. Either he gave up taking precautions because he had no hope, or he might have even done things that would lead to his death, without realizing it, convinced that it was inevitable and the sooner it was over the better."<br><br>"--- So the prophet was a kind of murderer?"<br><br>"--- Yes. We have to be very careful what we say when people ask us to prophesy. Sometimes a whole community has been destroyed by a prophecy of doom. No doubt the prophet had good reasons for sensing its possibility, and he was right to warn them of it, but he should also have pointed out that it might very well be possible to avert by, say, a change of their way of life. Because they believed it was inevitable they gave up trying. Fear, despair and self-indulgence, the predators of the mind, moved in, and the community collapsed as the prophet foretold."<br><br>I think that the last sentence is the most important thing in this passage.<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c7077181247148321284 title="comment permalink">5/22/13, 7:27 AM</a><br><br>

It's something different to "know the world to be on hospice." That looks an awful lot like a statement of faith.<br><br>As an aside, I'm curious if you have anything to say about the objections I raised to either Guy M's habit of citing non-peer-reviewed blog posts as a foundational pillar of his hypothesis and his certainty, or to Malcolm Light's reliance on cherry-picked preliminary (and later corrected) data as the basis for his projections.<br><br>p.s.

But it bothered me a great deal. This is dismissing humans as weak, ineffectual and incapable of intelligent survival. Humans in war torn third world countries with disease, little food or clean water have survived. These survivors were already impoverished with scant resources. How? The instinct of self preservation, that's how. We were built to survive. There is an old quote, " A hanging in the morning concentrates the mind wonderfully!"

It also reminded me strongly of something I read just the other day in a sympathetic and well-informed book by an elderly academic on his own experience of lived polytheism in both traditional Chinese culture and certain Native American cultures:<br><br>"In all these instances, the action [with spirits in shamanic cultures] is never for oneself. ..... Modern Western individualism is not the primary mode of existence in other cultures [= other than Modern Western ones]. To carry out activities for oneself, especially to do so with the aid of spirits, is the only evil perceived in the cultures being discussed. In the cultures that I am familiar with, it is understood that any such evil falls back on the individual and their family, ultimately leading to death. In some other traditions of which I am aware, those understood so to act are considered an extremely dangerous threat to the community and are likely to be killed. These are egalitarian societies in which prestige comes from giving possessions away rather than accumulating them. Hence, anyone perceived as being far better off that others in the community is liable to be suspected of evil sorcery, sometimes called, in these communities, "witchcraft."<br><br>This is from Jordan Paper's _The Deities Are Many: A Polytheistic Theology_. <br><br>Paper's book, I might add, is one of the only two books in English that I (also an elderly academic) can fully recommend on the experience and logic of a lived and living polytheism. [The other is JMG's _A World Full of Gods: An Inquiry into Polytheism_. Curiously, both books were published in the same year, 2005.

That's what I know; none of that requires what you call faith. All it requires is stepping away from the (very-American) way of thinking based on Hollywood narratives where the hero pulls it off against all odds.<br><br>My mom is on hospice: she was supposed to die w/in six months, that means, but I knew she would last longer, and she has. She may last a couple of years. Dying is not a precise science. I don't believe the implication is that, because neither doctors nor I can give you her future DOD, she isn't going to die in the near term.<br><br>Do I need a scientific study to tell me she is dying? Or can I just know it from her gray skin, skeletal frame, fading vision, her gasping for air, and so forth? Should I encourage her to follow this and that treatment, make appointments with specialists, and "fight" her terminal lung illness? Why, when that would only be cruel?<br><br>Just as I don't understand why it's so important for any one human to continue (hah! like the Star Trek episode!! "the man must continue") I equally don't see why it's essential that the human species continue. In fact, given what we have perpetrated it would be illogical ;-) to see our continuance as a positive thing for the planet overall. But then the planet has its own destiny, so worrying about the health of the planet after we are gone is as meaningless, ultimately, as worrying about the fate of the human species. Most people find what happens to their family, their ethnic group, their country, their species, even after they are dead, to be extremely important. I've never in my life felt that this was paramount, nor do I now. Maybe that's what made it easy for me to be open to the possibility of NTE: I don't feel I have a dog in this race.<br><br>Since you seem interested in references, I would point you to this post, with numerous "official" links: http://guymcpherson.com/2013/01/climate-change-summary-and-update/<br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c8764978343127933270 title="comment permalink">5/22/13, 7:43 PM</a><br><br>

They are right that “Within a single lifetime Ireland has changed from a predominantly rural to an urban society”.<br><br>But some of the things mentioned are not gone, I done them in my youth, I made hay in my youth, cut it with a scythe, lumped it (made small lumps in wet weather), cocked it and tied the hay cocks down with hay ropes.

Your vital point as to why climate change activism is failing reminds me of my inner conflict. Although I am determined to minimize my footprint, I am almost unbearably tempted to continue in my habit of revisiting natural beauty spots that I love. Unfortunately, my favourite is the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern New Mexico. There is no bus service to the park entrance and bus service to the nearest town is severely limited. To compound the problem of access, there is no car rental agency in this nearest town or other nearby towns. I would have to continue as I have before and rent a car from Albuquerque and drive down by myself. The drive is extremely scenic – all of the Southwest is scenic to me – and I enjoy the quiet of my own company and the views out the window. <br><br>I know I cannot do this anymore but I WANT so much to do it and am constantly tempted. I’ve tried various mind tricks - I’m justified because of my love for the area, I deserve to have this pleasure and on and on.<br>Why do I mention this? Well, now I can better understand why so many talk green but live out of their habits and their comfort zone. Some love Nature but just don’t connect the dots not realizing the impact of what they do. I’ve published that our ecocidal behaviour flows out of us primarily because we do not love the Earth. But I was misguided or perhaps foolish. The word is perhaps behaviour. Just now, my wife is telling me that you talk about this in yesterday’s blog which I have not read. So, it is back to the drawing board and perhaps a re-write. <br><br><br><br><a href=the-pleasures-of-extinction.html#c7479021288803476264 title="comment permalink">5/29/13, 1:37 AM</a><br><br>
