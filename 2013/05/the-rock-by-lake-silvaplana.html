One of the most important and least popular lessons taught by the history of ideas is that every attempt to answer the big questions—where did we come from, why are we here, where are we going, and so forth—gets whatever support it has from two distinct sources. The first of these is the factual evidence, if any, that backs it; the second is the emotional appeal, if any, that it offers to those who embrace it. Habits of thinking hardwired into contemporary culture treat the first of those as though it’s the only thing that matters, and react to any mention of the second with the same sort of embarrassed silence that might greet a resounding fart at a formal garden party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since human beings aren’t passionless bubbles of intellect, though, the second source of support is fairly often the more important and the more revealing of the two. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The flurry of apocalyptic predictions that surrounded December 21, 2012 makes as good an example as any. The factual evidence supporting the idea that anything unusual would happen on that date was—well, to call it dubious is by no means a minor understatement:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the entire furore was based on misinterpretations of the Mayan calendar that wouldn’t have survived fifteen minutes of unbiased research, but which were accepted as gospel and padded out by industrious true believers into a magpie’s nest of arbitrary speculations, misquoted or invented prophecies, and scientific hypotheses yanked out of context and hammered into shape to support the preexisting 2012 narrative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those of my readers who tried, as I did, to question that narrative will recall the reaction from believers: talk about the facts and you could expect an endlessly shifting assortment of justifications for belief; talk about the narrative, its parallels in previous apocalyptic fads, and the tangled emotional drives that all too clearly lay behind it, and you could expect a furious insistence that bringing up such matters is irrelevant and unfair. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Questioning the modern faith in progress, on those rare occasions when such questioning happens at all, is a good way to observe a similar species of handwaving in its native habitat. As mentioned in last week’s post, the concept of progress has no content of its own, no single measurement by which it stands and falls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Thus no matter how many things are pretty clearly regressing—and these days, the list of things that are regressing is getting quite long—believers can always find something or other that appears to be progressing, and use that to defend the narrative. When that fails in turn, as it generally does, there’s always something else, even if that turns out to be no more than the pious hope that the regress will turn out to be a temporary hurdle over which, as the myth of progress demands, humanity will sooner or later leap. Move the discussion to the narrative of progress, its parallels among other triumphalist narratives, and the emotional drives that lie behind it, though, and you’ll get the same sort of angry denunciation that came from believers in the 2012 narrative. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s going to be necessary to risk that reaction, and a variety of other unhelpful responses, in order to glimpse a shape of time better suited to the realities of our present situation than the dead straight Joachimist line of progress or the Augustinian U-shape of apocalypse that runs from Eden to the fallen world to the cataclysmic arrival of the New Jerusalem, however renamed. The route past those overly familiar alternatives requires attention to the emotional dimensions of the shapes we give to the inkblot patterns of time, and in particular, to a distinctive emotional payoff that the narratives of progress and apocalypse share in common. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Therapists call it provisional living: the belief that life will become what it’s supposed to be once <i>x</i> happens. What
<i>x</i> might be varies as wildly from case to case as the diversity of human psyches will permit. Among individuals, it might be losing twenty pounds, being promoted to that supervisor’s position you’ve always wanted, getting a divorce, or what have you, but it always has two distinctive features.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first is that
<i>x</i> serves as an anchor for a flurry of unrealistic fantasies about the future that will supposedly arrive once <i>x</i> happens; the second is that <i>x</i> never happens, and is more or less chosen—subconsciously or otherwise—with that outcome in mind. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s precisely the fact that <i>x</i> never happens that makes provisional living so tempting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of us are aware on one level or another that the choices we prefer to make do not reflect the values and beliefs we claim to hold, and are not going to bring us the lives we think we ought to have.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Confront that reality head on, and the message that the statue of Apollo said to Rainier Maria Rilke—"you must change your life"—becomes hard to ignore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The avoidance of that reality is therefore the cornerstone on which most dysfunctional lives are built. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Provisional living is among the most popular ways to engineer that avoidance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The pounds you can’t lose, the promotion you won’t get, the divorce papers you never quite get around to filing, or some other <i>x</i> factor becomes the villain you can blame for the failure of your choices to reflect your ideals and bring you the life you think you should have. Meanwhile the dreams that pile up on the other side of the change that never happens can get as gaudy as you like, since they never have to face the cold gray morning light of reality. Not all those dreams are happy ones; people are almost as likely to put fantasies about suffering and death on the far side of <i>x</i> as they are to stock the same imaginary space with wealth, power, and plenty of hot sex. It all depends on the personal factor.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Progress and apocalypse, in turn, offer the same payoff on a collective level. The imagined world of the future, whether it’s the product of business as usual or of the cataclysmic repudiation of business as usual, becomes a dumping ground for every kind of fantasy, and those fantasies never have to stand up to the test of reality because the <i>x</i> event that’s supposed to make them real never quite gets around to happening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This allows believers in progress and apocalypse, like other practitioners of provisional living, to put a wholly imaginary world at the center of their emotional lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This makes it relatively easy for them to ignore the depressingly ordinary world in which they actually live and, more to the point, the role of their own choices in making that world exactly what it is. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The imaginary future worlds conjured up by the mythologies of progress and apocalypse, in turn, are pallid reflections of an older and more robust conception, the belief in a heaven of immortal bliss to which the souls of true believers ascend after death. That conception is so thoroughly hardwired into Western culture that it can take quite a bit of research to grasp how much chopping and stretching had to be done to older ideas of postmortem existence in order to make them fit a heaven-centered narrative. It’s indicative that when the concept of reincarnation came back into circulation in alternative circles in the Western world in the 19th century, it was at first denounced in incandescent terms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What made it "disgusting" and "repulsive," to note only two of the heated labels applied to reincarnation in that long-forgotten debate, was precisely the suggestion that human souls after death would cycle right back to the same world they had just left and live with the consequences of their own choices.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s at this point that we return to Nietzsche, for one of the central themes of his philosophy was an edgy analysis of the creation of imaginary "real worlds" by the human mind as a way of devaluing the world we actually inhabit. That was an even bigger issue in his time than it is in ours, with approved versions of 19th century Christian piety claiming that the proper response to every injustice was to wait patiently for payback in heaven, and a philosophical milieu in the universities in which airily abstract speculations about the Absolute had all but replaced meaningful attention to the realities of human existence. The phrase "provisional living" hadn’t been invented yet, but the practice was central to the social morality of the Victorian era, and it formed one of the central targets of Nietzsche’s grand project for a revaluation of all values that would take life itself as its touchstone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That project had for its core theme the affirmation of existence as it actually is—in Nietzsche’s own phrase, a yes-saying to life that would counter more than two thousand years of naysaying morality, philosophy and spirituality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As he developed his critique of the conventional wisdom of his time, his insistence on saying yes to life as it is became increasingly forceful. That journey reached its final destination in August of 1881 on a walk around Lake Silvaplana in the Alps, at a roughly pyramidal mass of stone that still stands beside the lake:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>"six thousand feet beyond man and time," as Nietzsche wrote excitedly on a scrap of paper at the time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If, as Nietzsche thought, the only ideas that matter are those conceived while walking, it may be useful to spend a few moments strolling along the path that led up to his formula of affirmation, not least because its early course seems to have escaped the notice of contemporary scholarship on Nietzsche.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A classical philologist by training, he applied a specialist’s familiarity with ancient Greek thought to the more immediate problems of philosophy and Western culture that concerned him in his major works. Most of his core conceptions can thus be traced back at least in part to one particular school of Greek and Roman philosophers, the one such school that affirmed life as it is with as much verve as Nietzsche himself: the old Stoics. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mention the word "Stoic" to most people these days and you might, if you’re lucky, get some sort of vague sense of gritted teeth and unwillingness to crumple under the impact of pain. Off past that dim misunderstanding lies one of the most challenging adventures in human thought, a sustained effort to sort out human life on the basis of what we actually know about the world. The Stoic school of philosophy was founded around 300 BCE by Zeno of Citium, and became one of the major systems of classical thought, retaining a lively presence across the Mediterranean world until the long night of the Dark Ages closed in. Its core insight was that human beings can control only two things—their own choice of actions and their own assessments of the things they experience—and that sanity consists of recognizing this fact and refusing to make any emotional investment in those things that aren’t subject to the individual will. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In any situation, said the Stoics, the job assigned to human beings is to recognize the good and act accordingly. Nothing else matters, and the point of Stoic spiritual practice is to get to the point where, in fact, nothing else matters. The radical affirmation of the world as it is was one standard element of the Stoic training: from the Stoic perspective, the world is what it is, and though the Stoic may freely choose to fling himself into a struggle to change some part of it for the better, and unhesitatingly lay down his life in that struggle, no power in heaven or earth can make him whine about it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Stoics took that formula of radical acceptance to an extreme that few later thinkers have ever been willing to contemplate. Most philosophers in the classical world accepted the theory that the motions of the planets and stars shaped events on Earth, and speculated that after an immense length of time, the heavens will repeat the same patterns of movement and bring about a corresponding repetition below. Stoic philosophers embraced that theory, and built up a worldview in which the whole universe moved<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>through endlessly repeated cycles from one
<i>ekpyrosis</i>—"Big Bang" would not be an inaccurate translation of this bit of technical Greek—to the next, with every single event duplicated down to the last detail in each repetition. It’s one thing to accept the present moment, and another to accept the whole of your life; it’s quite another to imagine that same life repeated endlessly through infinite time, and accept that as a whole, without wishing a single thing to be different. That’s the state to which the most extreme Stoics aspired. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That was the vision that came crashing into Nietzsche’s mind as he stood beside the rock by Lake Silvaplana.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Suppose, he said, we engage in a thought experiment. Scientists tell us that there is a fixed quantity of matter and energy in the cosmos, and no sign that the universe has a beginning or an end. (This was all accepted scientific opinion in the late 19th century; the Big Bang theory was still far in the future.) Given a finite amount of matter and energy and a fixed set of natural laws working over infinite time, every event any of us experiences here and now must have happened an infinite number of times before, and will happen an infinite number of times again, in an eternal recurrence that admits of no variation. As you consider your life, past, present and to come, can you face the prospect of infinite repetitions of that same life? Can you joyously affirm that prospect—can you <i>will</i> it? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s hard to imagine a more all-out assault on provisional living, or a more forceful challenge to live up to one’s ideals. As he passed through his few remaining years of sanity, though, Nietzsche seems to have convinced himself that his thought experiment was in fact a reality, that every moment of his life had in fact happened countless times before and would be repeated countless times again. I sometimes wonder if that’s what finally pushed him over the edge into madness. Like most thinkers whose work makes a fetish of ruthlessness, Nietzsche was obsessively kind and gentle in his personal life. As he stood there on the Piazza Carlo Alberti, hearing the thump of the teamster’s stick and the terrified cries of the horse, growing more agitated by the moment, it’s all too easy to imagine the voice whispering in his mind:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>can you joyously affirm
<i>this</i>, over and over again, from eternity to eternity? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A moment later he was sprinting across the piazza, flinging himself between the drover and the horse. It was a classically Stoic thing to do, and I suspect that if he’d known that what was left of his sanity wouldn’t survive the moment, he’d have done it anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span><i>Fiat justicia, ruat caelum</i>, said the old Stoics:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>let justice be done, though it brings the sky crashing down. That it was his own mental sky that came crashing down was, as the Stoics also liked to say, a matter of indifference. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It was Nietzsche’s great misfortune, and a central flaw of his philosophy, that he never quite managed to grasp that the opposite of a bad thing can also be a bad thing. To challenge oneself with the vision of eternal recurrence as a thought experiment is one thing, and I recommend it to my readers as a useful exercise. If that vision were in fact the literal truth, could you give the rest of your life a shape and a purpose that would give sufficient meaning and value to everything you have already been and done and suffered, so that when you add it all up, you can joyously affirm the whole pattern—and what would the rest of your life need to become in order for you to do so? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To pass beyond that, though, and to try to inhabit a cosmos in which everything is fixed by fate, in which everything revolves through the same series of events endlessly from eternity to eternity, and in which the only freedom open to the will is to affirm that sequence joyously or vainly reject it, is to court Nietzsche’s fate for no good reason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Insisting on a cosmos in which everything is fated to remain exactly as it has always been is as useless, in practical terms, as insisting that one fine day in the not too distant future, the march of progress or the arrival of apocalypse will transform the cosmos into whatever you think it ought to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>

We’ll discuss that vision in the next post in this sequence.</span></div>

In terms of per capita energy and purchasing power, we are already in the regression phase.

Age of Limits was interesting -- as usual, the conversations around the campfires were the best part. <br><br>Mister R, at least you had the courage to go through with it and learn the lesson!

As for the rate of progress, you've just proved my claim that believers in progress can always find something to justify their belief. I find Jonathan Huebner's argument that innovation peaked in 1873 far more believable than the often-heated denunciations his paper has fielded -- for every field in which there's been significant advances in the last ten years, it's easy to name several that have been spinning their wheels, and many broader measurements commonly used to track progress as a whole have been in reverse for a good long while now.

An expectation of 'progress'- in the sense of some sort of personal benefit- can be a great motivator to action. A positive, even unrealistic, bias to this belief may occasionally benefit one's family/kin/species greatly, even if in fact it does not usually work out well personally.<br> What strengthen's the herd often kills the individual. To the extent that a bias toward positive expectations of 'progress' inspires individuals to make choices that usually suck but occasionally pay off big for their genes, the progressivist pattern may have evolutionary roots. (Anti-group-selectionists please stifle protest, or view this as a purely social-evolutionary argument). <br> JMG, your 'gaudy dreams of provisional living' may partly be the outcome of this bias among progressivists who lack the- courage?- to actually cast the die of our bias.<br> Sorry for the somewhat tangential comment. I'll leave it to you how this might relate to other patterns of time, or to blow it up entirely.

Or so I thought. <br><br>I think Bertrand Russell also had a bit of a point when he said that whilst he had a soft spot for stoicism, at the end of the day it was a rather lonely and brittle tradition, without the social rituals that other faiths had at the time. But who knows what stoic sources he read and didn't read at the time he wrote his history of western philosophy.<br><br>But the stoic parallels to Buddhism are still fascinating, and they show that the Western tradition has as much of value as anything in the East, not to mention actually being culturally accessible.

The changes I feel need to be of spiritual nature as well as practical (job etc). Im growing some of my own food and practicing 'self-sufficiency' skills, making things rather than buying them, which is a start. I've just read The Year of The Flood, by Margaret Atwood. This got me thinking about the 'spiritual' nature of facing the future (not necessarily religious more reflective, just call it spiritual for want of a better word). What I'm trying to ask, in so many words, is whether you could give some pointers to resources in developing an Earth-Future-centric spiritual side?

I may be mistaken; I'm not a big fan of philosophy. I find more enlightenment in religion and myth. For example, the OT book of Ecclesiastes is, in my view, as comprehensive and entertaining a treatise on Existentialism as one could find. Coincidentally, Ecclesiastes also contains a major Biblical endorsement of the biological kinship of all living creatures - humans included: "For who shall say that man has preeminence over the beast of the field. They are of one breath, etc..." Creationists have a hard time with this book.<br><br>Ecclesiastes was composed when things were going poorly for what was left of the civilization created by the Children of Isis-Ra-El. Apparently, existential thought flourishes among the intelligentsia during tough times.<br><br>A case in point: The Great Depression proved a fertile breeding ground for Twelve-Stepism - a quasi-religious self-help movement devised by upper class drunks. The movement is steeped in existential principles: "one day at a time, live and let live, live life to good purpose, accept the things I cannot change, let go of your old ideas, etc...". It also acknowledges the role of instinct in human behavior: "our troubles may be seen as the result of misdirected instinct". This is actually pretty good stuff. The book 'Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, by Bill Wilson is extremely well written, amazingly insightful and blessedly brief.<br><br><a href=#c881505657106348176 title="comment permalink">5/30/13, 6:05 AM</a><br><br>

I've read through the book, and personally, I think it's brilliant. Wrong perhaps, or maybe right, but still brilliant.<br><br>Witt's universe is infinite (in three dimensions) and completely deterministic. He addresses quite nicely most of the obvious issues this raises.<br><br>For instance, there is "Olber's Paradox" or "Why is the night sky dark?" that results in an infinite universe. Witt revives an old theory of "tired light" and points out that a fully relativistic calculation of wave propagation through "curved space-time" results in a very small but continuous loss of energy. Thus, light becomes redshifted just by moving through empty space. His claim is that the background microwave radiation from space is not the remnant of a Big Bang, but is in fact Olber's "bright nighttime sky" redshifted down into the microwave bands. Past a certain distance, it is redshifted so far that it becomes undetectable, providing a finite radius to the observable universe.<br><br>His treatment is quite different from the usual mystical cosmology in that he makes specific experimental predictions. For instance, he says that as we keep building better telescopes, the whole "dark energy" theory is going to reach a breaking point, because it's just plain wrong: it's a coat of paint over a nasty problem with the Big Bang theory. His theory comes much closer to the current numbers that Big Bang theorists need to invoke dark energy to fit, and his curves are qualitatively different and diverge from dark energy results at greater distances: if he's right, Big Bang theorists will need to invoke progressively darker energy to keep their model together, and at some point even the die-hards will give up and call the approach silly.<br><br>A similar thing resulted from the so-called "ultraviolet catastrophe" of the late 1800's, which resulted in quantum theory.<br><br>I'm not intending to promote Witt's work as "right" or "wrong" -- the point is to shake up the foundations of what most people think we know about the universe. If Witt is right, the universe is much closer to what JMG is describing here than either Joachim's or Augustine's model.<br><br><a href=#c2379824376370840060 title="comment permalink">5/30/13, 8:45 AM</a><br><br>

Thus, you bring Nietzsche's thought to the point where it seems as though it advocates for the affirmation of a reality that, because it always repeats itself exactly, never basically changes. In other words, you make Nietzsche into a particularly tortured kind of Platonist: in fact, because of the eternal repetition, the truth is that things really remain the same, the more they change. It takes an immense amount of time, but in time, all will return to *exactly the same* point.<br><br>And you seem to leave his thought at that.<br><br>Isn't this ridiculous, though? You even suggest that *this* was the thought that could have stirred him into madness, that fateful afternoon in Turin...<br><br>But this, in fact, is not the content of the doctrine of the eternal return of the same. I will explain:<br><br>If we do, in fact, suppose that (as N. himself claims in a wonderful passage of Will To Power, which you paraphrase) that time is infinite, and that there is only a finite quantity of matter and energy, then it would seem that this implies repetition *of the same* (the same configuration will return). But what this misses is the deeper teaching: that the 0-th moment of the whole configuration, leading in time to the very 1st repetition, is utterly unique for being the 0-th. Likewise, the 1-st repetition is also unique -- utterly different -- precisely for being a repetition. And so on ... each becoming of the universe (the 2-nd, 3-rd, ... n-th), as it returns to the same configuration, is *for that reason* utterly different.<br><br>Exactly in this way, we may say that Nietzsche's doctrine teaches a kind of "double affirmation" (as the philosopher Deleuze showed): at once, the affirmation of repetition, *and* difference. To fail to see how the latter leaps from the former in Nietzsche's thought is simply to miss Nietzsche altogether.<br><br>In short, you're missing the much more interesting and much more subtle philosophy of time contained within this doctrine, and, moreover, you've not really tried to come to terms with other of his doctrines which are equally important for this realization (like the notion of "will to power", etc<br><br>All of the interesting philosophical (or anti-philosophical, as I'd argue) possibilities in his thought are contained here, and it will take a lot of work to think them through to the end.<br><br><a href=#c2840738937238492293 title="comment permalink">5/30/13, 8:47 AM</a><br><br>

Believing that each moment is eternal, or eternally repeating can be comforting. It makes me smile to think that even though it isn't 'now' the happy moments I shared with my deceased grandparents, or good times I had with friends I grew apart from still exist, woven into the fabric of cause and effect that binds the universe together. Thinking in this way has helped to free me from trying to relive the past, either to revisit good times or make a bad situation come out better on the second try. Those are both ruts I was stuck in at one point. I find myself much better able to accept change, and also striving harder to make each moment count. The idea of being able to choose in a fated existence makes my mental gears grind sometimes.

It seems to me that Nietzsche struggles with the formulation of the eternal return between ontology and epistemology because those traditional categories of philosophical inquiry (or language, or for that matter ordinary experience!) are being dissolved in the caustic abyss of his will to power concept. The ontological expression of the eternal return becomes a kind of physical description of the formal structure of the universe including the repetitive nature of experienced time; and becomes subject to the critique you describe. But when considered as an epistemology, the eternal return can serve a different purpose in Nietzsche’s thought. In the “Vision and Riddle” Zarathustra describes time to a dwarf in such a way as to reduce time, or perhaps better, to return time, to the moment. Epistemologically this interpretation is very much in alignment with Nietzsche’s formulation of the will to power, that time’s past and future are entirely subject and reducible to the moment (there is an eastern thought seeking the surface here), and the quality of one’s will determines the shape of time (consider the various types of history and their impact on life in his essay On the Use and Disadvantage of History for Life, or for that matter the Three Metamorphosis). Freedom from the imposition of time’s “It Was” and accompanying “Thou Shalt’s” requires the young shepherd to bite the head off the Ouroboros, precisely to counter the collapse of the will to time’s eternal return. From a moral perspective, the eternal return is as destructive of life as nihilism’s assertion that everything has already happened, that nothing new can ever happen, etc. They are “metaphysically indistinct” concepts from that point of view, right?<br><br>The eternal return is that abysmal thought that must be overcome, as presented in the Convalescent. Though his animals make a song and teaching of the event, Zarathustra chastises them for giving words to inexpressible experiences. The eternal return, or something like it, represents the greatest depth of knowledge. It frightens his animals (passions) away, but they come back with rest of the world and its beauty to salve his living soul. Life trumps knowledge.<br><br>With that thought in place, there seems to be a wide open valley at our feet for describing the nature of human intellection in the service of life where the concept of life is freed from afterworlds and other “provisional lives” to service of the living earth. What do you think?<br><br><br><a href=#c9069866592868126833 title="comment permalink">5/30/13, 11:04 AM</a><br><br>

If the universe were truly infinite, then we would expect a continuous spectrum of light ranging from the longest radio wavelengths (for stars so distant they get redshifted past even microwave wavelengths; radio astronomy could easily pick up this signal) all the way through the infrared to visible light. But the CMB is just a single nearly perfect blackbody spectrum - which is precisely what we would expect if the universe used to be at a nearly uniform, high temperature and then expanded dramatically, redshifting the resulting light into the microwave spectrum. This is exactly what would be expected by the Big Bang theory. <br><br>Does Witt address this issue? Perhaps there's still a way to reconcile his theory with CMB observations, but I can't think of it myself.<br><br><a href=#c4138421222227018420 title="comment permalink">5/30/13, 11:28 AM</a><br><br>

If we can imagine that somehow, over infinite time, the elementary particles of matter all manage to get randomly rearranged in exactly the same configuration as at some earlier point, then it follows, assuming a purely deterministic universe, that history would have to repeat from that time forward. But that means that all of time that passed before the first re-arrangement could never repeat.<br><br>Just some of the craziness you can get into thinking about infinity. But as far as we (whatever that is) are concerned, what does it tell us? Even if all of the pieces come together to exactly re-create me, down to the smallest detail, is there anything to say it is me? And if there is no memory of the previous time (indeed, memory is not possible, or it wouldn't be exactly the same) then is there any way of knowing or doing anything with the knowledge that everything repeats. In other words, it would be exactly the same as if it does not repeat.<br><br>In Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, there is an infinite universe in matter and space, but finite in time.

I'll have to look that one up. <br><br>Tom, I haven't read any of Tolle's work, so it's interesting to hear that the same ideas are in another source. <br><br>BrightSpark, actually, the closest equivalent to Tibetan Vajrayana in the Western tradition is theurgic Neoplatonism and its later offspring, the magical traditions of the Renaissance, early modern, and modern world, and nearly everything you'll find in Tibetan Buddhism has close equivalents there. Stoicism, by contrast, is a rationalist philosophy with a pantheist spiritual basis. <br><br>Jamie, we'll be getting to that. The thing I'd suggest, to begin with, is to pay attention to what's happening around you right now; as I pointed out in an earlier post, this is what the early stages of collapse look like. <br><br>Twilight, stay tuned! I think you'll be pleased by the next few stages in the journey. <br><br>Garden, excellent. It's good to hear that some of my readers have grasped the enormity of the challenge posed by Nietzsche's ideas in this context. <br><br>John, it's certainy true that the Stoic version works better. Still, treat it as a thought experiment: if you knew you were going to repeat this same life in all details for all eternity, how would you choose to live? <br><br>Greg, that's an interesting connection, and there's a point to it, since Nietzsche's ideas were important influences on some of the Existentialists.<br><br><a href=#c302361692659822674 title="comment permalink">5/30/13, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

That said, I think you do Nietzsche and yourself a disservice by watering down the impact of his "most difficult thought." <br><br>Richard, by the time the ancient Greeks took up Stoicism, they'd been out of the hunter-gatherer economy for something close to five thousand years, and had already weathered the collapse of at least one civilization. That sort of philosophy is something that comes to a people with a rich history and a habit of literacy. <br><br>Sunyata, I'd encourage you to read Nietzsche, then! Probably best to take him in chronological order, starting with <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>. His thinking may be what you need just now. <br><br>Developer, that's one way of putting it. <br><br>Michael, good! I'd encourage you to follow the same advice I offered Sunyata, and see if Nietzsche is your cup of tea. <br><br>Carlo, you're not separate from nature; human nature, your nature, is a subset of nature. You're never outside the flow; when you think you are, that's just the part of the flow that you're expressing at that moment. <br><br>Peter, I'd say that it's always awkward to try to express inexpressible experiences! <br><br>Robert, Nietzsche was one of the two or three greatest masters of German prose; I'd put Heine in the same league, but nobody else.

People who talk about the need to be hard and cruel are usually the kind of people who have to read Ayn Rand for an hour or so to work up the nerve to cut off a chicken's head, while if you want to see vicious, brutal interpersonal conflict, your best bet is usually the internal politics of a pacifist group.

Caesarism, though, is a topic for a different series of posts; it's simply what happens when institutions and ideologies become too sclerotic to function any longer, and the only kind of leadership that's still an option is charismatic individual leadership.

The only world we can ever know is always and inevitably born of the interaction between the "buzzing, blooming confusion" of uncorrelated sensation and the figurations imposed on it by the act of experiencing it. It's possible to experience the world as a unity in which all opposites are reconciled, but is that experience any more real than the one in which self and other exist? Both are experiences filtered through an individual human mind, and are equally unreal -- or equally real. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Moshe, that's good to hear.

I didn't get around to posting this last week, but the cliffhanger and the hint about a Nietzsche influenced thinker on industrial decline has me certain of two things. One, that I'm not going to guess the person. And two, that my shape is interesting enough at least to be worth sharing. The shape is an ordinary human life: birth, growth, midlife crisis, decline, and death.<br><br>We live near the apex of our age, perhaps just a little past. Decline and death are the shapes we need to think about and the ones that we fear. We were born and we will die and so will our present age of fossil fuel powered industrial culture. I think that we are having midlife crisis because we have no idea how to pass the half way mark gracefully.<br><br>Let's face it. We're getting old. Our infrastructure is wearing out. Our space program isn't what it used to be. Our economy really needs its rest, and a few cups of coffee, before getting to work. The boundless energy of youth is fading. It's not totally over, we still have our moments. The north slope was invigorating and this fracking craze feels amazing but in the back of my mind I know I was way better back in the early seventies. And while we're talking about decades, just how long have we been post modern anyway? It was trendy and hip at first but, my god, it feels like beating a dead horse* these days.** <br><br>(*Unrelated to Nietzsche's horse. **I wanted to work in a parallel with stealth drones as red sports cars, Sarah Palin as a trophy wife, The National Ignition Facility (fusion) failing to light my fires, and and a bumper crop of college grads failing to stimulate the creative juices, but it didn't feel clever.) <br><br>People have always died. The difference between my looming death and the death of countless others is that my age is dying with me. Most of the other shapes of time have been laid out in such a way that something treasured and personal doesn't die with the person. Something of fundamental goodness was kept after death. This time I will die with my culture, probably my nation, definitely my industrial economy, and who knows how much knowledge. Not in an epic NTE or a Valhalla way but in a bland and depressing Limits to Growth way. Me and my whole world are getting old and that implacable jerk with the sickle is coming for us both.<br><br>The question is what to do about it. There are powerful narratives that can give meaning to our lives but most of them represent some sort of escape from the actual lives that we are living. I can't speak for anyone else but for me the problems we face are epic enough not to need embellishment. We are living in the beginning of the long descent (though I call it The Crappening, the process of things getting gradually crappier, but it basically means the same thing: peak oil, over population, degraded environment, decline and fall of industrial civilization, coming dark age, overshoot, die-off, and bottleneck. People tend to have a poor ability to handle the verbose explanation, but my friends and family, peers and coworkers seem better able to handle the scope and scale and time frame when I call it The Crappening). So, what are we going to do about it? I suggest that you do or save something of fundamental goodness. I can't tell you what it is because it is your life. Maybe it is saving Wagner or Robert's Rules of Order for posterity. Maybe it is getting some level of comfort and autonomy for yourself for the coming crappening. How are you going to handle death with some level of dignity or even joyously affirm it? It bears thinking upon because you are going to die.<br><br>That's my stab at the shape of time. I'm curious how close I come to what you have in mind.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=#c6670215969779254987 title="comment permalink">5/30/13, 10:53 PM</a><br><br>

The book is this fascinating text woven with a weft science and a warp history and out of that text comes not a shape of time but of humanity.<br><br>Heisenberg spends a lot of time on the Greeks though he misses the Stoics perhaps because he is looking at conceptions of the world (he spends a lot of time on the Milesian School however). His point however seems vaguely like the rock at lake Silvaplana, that these ideas stand outside of any conception of progress or time that we have, and recur over and over. When he gets to Heraclitus, he mentions in passing of course that E-mc^2 is merely a quantified version of Herclitus's view that fire was the prima materia.<br><br>Heisenberg thus attacks the modernist view of time and science in two directions (it is worth remembering he was one of the most important physicists of the 20th century). First, he notes that real, objective knowledge is impossible. Faced with such an impossibility, he suggests, we take pre-existing assumptions that we currently hold and project them onto the data we see, and in so doing find meaning in that data. That meaning becomes the theory.<br><br>As Heisenberg repeats throughout the book, "Data does not imply theory." To him scientific theory is as much a product of ourselves as it is the data we have accumulated, and thus one can never be sure at all whether a scientific theory denotes a reality or just a model that happens to work.<br><br>I think it is somewhat interesting that Heisenberg spends as much time as he does on the recurring ideas of cosmology throughout history. Maybe the Stoic view was not so far off afterall, if we are prepared to take a big view.<br><br><a href=#c7979646448903356775 title="comment permalink">5/31/13, 2:57 AM</a><br><br>

That gets us to what I take to be Nietzsche's real point of the eternal return--that it is not a belief about how things are but a tool to drive us back to the concrete. I'm not very romantic about Nietzsche's madness--I think he likely got syphilis and had his faculties eaten away by sickness. It's sad, but I don't like to hang much on it.<br><br>I know, it's an I say tomato, you say tomato sort of affair--we both basically come to the same place about what the point of it is. I struggle with the value of making the distinction, but clearly I still believe in them on some level.<br><br>Back to ths substance of things, though, I personally have always thought that Stoicism often needs a hearty dose of the Skepticism to keep it grounded. Skeptics had a robust appreciation for the value of custom (what we would probably call culture these days, though I admit I grow weary of that word)--that's probably because I need the reminder about custom's value, too ;-).<br><br>@Mike Cifone: I love Deleuze's work, very deeply. He has a place in my heart quite close to Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Adorno, for their life-changing influence on me. But, dear Lord, that way of talking about the eternal return is little more than a useful formalist exercise. Like most propadeutics, it helps make you stupid in the right way. It prepares you to think through the cross-cuts that the labor of thought makes possible across time. That is a wonderful and magnificent practice, but it is really more proper to Deleuze than to Nietzsche. <br><br>Remember, Deleuze quite openly confesses to productive distortion of his sources. The trendy 'anti-philosophical' academy (here I try not roll my eyes and heave a sigh) loves to talk about that, but yet somehow still acts like Deleuze gets the history of philosophy better than anyone else.<br><br><a href=#c9193345634718308084 title="comment permalink">5/31/13, 7:03 AM</a><br><br>

Although I'm still high, I can make it a little more concise, topical to your article, but I'm not gonna kiss butt, and I don't necessarily subscribe to the limitedness hypothesis. This really is about time.<br><br>It definitely makes sense to bring up Nietzsche, who resolves, in some ways, many of the sticking points in the lived experience of time, according to Augustine, and time according to Joachim. In some ways Nietzsche does not resolve anything, because it's still not living in reality, which it only makes sense to live as something unique: a one-time shot.<br><br>Now, in material terms, there are finite limits on earth, and they should be used as wisely as possible. We should consider them a one-time gift, a jewel, and as much as possible of it should be used to make a sustainable, renewable energy system. Since sunlight is pretty limitless, then committing as much as possible of the fossil fuels to that end is the best course of action. Now there are ways to store solar energy chemically, other than batteries: by manufacturing fuels using solar energy. Even rocket fuels. That just takes time, and commitments. It takes an abundance of energy, not a scarcity. So what are the finite earthly limits to population and consumption worldwide that allow for an abundance of solar energy, then stored up in fuels. Then it is just a technical question, and a matter of time.<br><br>So it helps to think of oneself as connected not only to every one else on the planet, but also to future generations: not see ourselves as separate in time.<br><br>There, I think that's pretty topical, and much more brief. thank you for busting my chops, but if this can't go up... well, there's no reason for that.<br><br><a href=#c7405175588228891404 title="comment permalink">5/31/13, 7:37 AM</a><br><br>

There have even been books devoted to breaking typists and desktop publishers of habits learned on the typewriter. Typewriters have idiosyncrasies such as using monospaced type, where every character occupies an equal amount of space and using two spaces after a period makes a document easier to read. Other devices use proportional typesetting, making two spaces a remnant of the past and unnecessary for readability. Some believe two spaces after a period or colon actually decrease readability.

Ask a professor about the self-energy of the electron, or the unbridgeable gap between gravity and quantum theory, or renormalization in quantum field theories, or (of course) the proliferation of string theories, all indistinguishable experimentally, that require anywhere from two to twenty extra "invisible" dimensions in space-time.<br><br>Seriously, this is supposed to be better than Leprechauns?<br><br>Incidentally, I don't find all of Witt's arguments more compelling than Leprechauns, either.

But the exotic is always attractive, and, just as the traveling evangelist can undermine foreign cultural practices by dangling the Christian trinkets of immediate salvation and everlasting life before naive audiences, so the guru (swami, shaman or mystic) can divert us Westerners from the positive and life affirming traditions built into our own culture.<br><br>I don't know anything about nan, but I sure as hell can't be fooled when it comes to cinnamon crumb cake!<br><br>I'm not a Christian, but Jesus was a pithy fellow and well worth heeding.

For example, our skeleton can be made to model all sorts; and I can imagine mediaeval master builders (the ‘right stuff’ of their day) thus innovating flying buttresses and crafting a cathedral without benefit of formal theory or the ability to paraphrase reality in mathematical language; they could intuit models and then talk (and ‘work’) it through.<br><br>Also, your drawing on the account of the rock at Lake Sylvaplana and Chris / Heisenberg on repetitious pattern reminds me that wild species do actually live that experience. I saw one of our dogs in at least two behaviours reproduce respectively the exact complex behaviour of a triumphant coyote carrying off her ‘trophy’ as well as that of a particular wolf who hunts mice – as filmed in the wild. This is ‘eternal’ recurrence, no? I don’t think our human ‘wild’ species has ever done it quite that way, but I speculate that our ‘mirror neurons’ if that is what they are, can extract meaning not only from the human, but also out of the non-human and even inanimate worlds. That would give us whole other chunks of the working Universe to talk about and work on. We can even apply the ‘models’ to ourselves and see how they work out? (Those poor souls Nietzsche &amp; the horse and that d’mnable man make an appalling loop in the thread.)<br><br>I will pipe down fast and see if I can’t read-up a bit more before next week!<br>best<br>Phil H<br>PS I like Phil Knight’s “rolling x” – sure does work in Britain!<br>PPS Now Phil said it I will go with the Harz as well.<br><br><a href=#c2331636848924299933 title="comment permalink">5/31/13, 2:53 PM</a><br><br>

Thanks for the heads up about Deleuze, btw -- I haven't read him; I finished my degree in a school that was full of fashionable Derridadaisme, and it left a sufficiently foul taste in my mouth that I haven't worked up the ambition to read anything French and philosophical later than Sartre since then. <br><br>Onething, Stoicism is meant to have the impact of a cold wet towel across the face. It's not meant to be warm and comforting. To the Stoic, what you encounter in life is predetermined, but your reactions to them are not. Your actions will only make a difference if they're destined to do so; therefore it's a waste of time to worry about the outcome, and far more sensible simply to do the right thing and let the chips fall as they may. Harsh? Sure, but in a time of crisis and trauma, it works. <br><br>Hadashi, glad to hear it. <br><br>Chris G, limitedness is not a hypothesis. It's an essential fact about every kind of embodied existence, including yours. If you don't grasp that, you're living in a dream world. Yes, it really is that simple. <br><br>Onething, the Stoics argued that the soul is a physical substance. If, during your life, you make it coherent and integrated, it will survive the body's death as a conscious personality. If not, when you die, it simply dissolves back into the cloud of soul-stuff that fills everything, and that's the end of you. They were really pretty uncompromising!<br><br>Robert and Ing, good! Double-spacers, unite...<br><br>Joseph, have you considered propounding a leprechaun theory of physics, in which each unverifiable ad hoc hypothesis needed to hold the standard model together is replaced by a leprechaun, or some other legendary being? It might make a splendid satire. <br><br>Greg, an excellent metaphor! <br><br>Ozoner, funny. Still, there's a point to taking delight in a bull's-eye. <br><br>Juhana, I was quoting Nietzsche, not myself, and I did mention that he had a bad habit of thinking that the only alternative of something he disliked consisted of going to the opposite extreme. As for the future of religion in a postprogress age, I'll be getting to that in quite some detail in later posts. <br><br>Developer, progress as it actually exists is simply one kind of historical change among many, usually a fairly short-lived form due to the law of diminishing returns.

I'm a mathematician who read Nitzsche back in his early 20s... I remember some of the infinite return passages, and as I recall he picked up the idea after being exposed to some of the mathematical physics of the day. Fact is, he got it wrong, but subtly.<br><br>Eventually these ideas were formalized under the rubric of "Poincare recurrence," and it is indeed a theorem, yes, a theorem, of classical mechanics. Specifically, if (and it's a big "if") the phase space of a system has finite volume, then given enough time the system will return to a state that is arbitrarily close to the original state. ("Phase space" means, roughly, the set of all possible configurations of particles in a classical system---one then overlays a Lagrangian which defines an "action", and motion proceeds by the least action principle. It is a very beautiful formulation.)<br><br>However "arbitrarily close" does not, for instance, mean "stays arbitrarily close for arbitrarily long" (as previous posters have pointed out, there is the phenomenon of "chaos," aka sensitive dependence on initial conditions). So parts of Nitzsche's life may well be approximately lived over and over, but not necessarily in order, and not necessarily all at once---the physics gives no information here. All this is to say nothing of the finiteness of phase space. If the universe itself is unbounded, then Poincare recurrence doesn't apply. Most obviously, we no longer believe nature works in a classical Newtonian fashion (with discrete particles and continuous forces), but in a quantum fashion, wherein Poincare's theorem does not apply. Though there is a panoply of related results for quantum systems.<br><br>It goes to show that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing: Nitzsche had a good layman's knowledge of the state of science of his day, but not being an expert, the subtleties &amp; caveats escaped him.<br><br>To Mr. Greer's credit, he roughly speaking points out this trap, and faults Nitzsche for his unimaginative embrace of what was originally a "thought experiment." Mr. Greer proposes his readers try the same experiment, but as an exercise, and without, presumably, assenting to Nitzsche's actual claims.<br><br>By the way, there's a chance that Mr. Greer's mystery thinker is Poincare himself---indeed the last great polymath.<br><br><a href=#c2006813432670965343 title="comment permalink">5/31/13, 6:58 PM</a><br><br>

It took Dion Fortune to give away the secret, though, when she wrote -- in her version of the same cosmology, in <i>The Cosmic Doctrine</i> -- "these teachings are meant to train the mind, not to inform it."

It may not be the term that goes eventually to official history books, but it is great one anyway.<br><br>Has anyone noticed how assets trading and world of finance in general is following quite faithfully model of catabolic collapse..? There was first unraveling in -08, now there has been calm period for some years, during which many operators have made profits and recovered. This recovery of course is bought by booting parts of former middle class to poverty, setting free tied up resources in the process. Now warning signals in parallel worlds of economy and manufacture are flashing red again, so we probably are going to see next phase of unplanned scaling down pretty soon... And so called middle class shrinks again. <br><br>If anyone wants to see what world is going to look like after decade or two, just look any relatively stable Third World country. Small and extremely influential cleptocracy on the top, tiny middle class below working as enforcers for this aristocracy and great masses of people left to manage themselves best way they can, as long as they do not challenge status quo. In that kind of world, it truly matters that you know your neighbors and have somekind mutual assistance pact between your group... Having a territorial gang to belong, if you want to put it that way. It actually works that way for Third World citizenry already, so their world is not going to shapeshift out of any recognition, unlike world of Westerners.

No kidding. <br>I remember telling my mother and younger brother when I was about 11 or 12, having heard something about Einstein (that was BBC radio I guess!) and the concept of unified space/time, that it meant – in my mind – that anything that had ‘existed / happened’ could not be ‘un-existed’. Maybe that memory is what got stirred by your account this week. Quote JMG: <i> It’s one thing to accept the present moment, and another to accept the whole of your life; it’s quite another to imagine that same life repeated endlessly through infinite time, and accept that as a whole, without wishing a single thing to be different.</i> Quite right: it is very difficult to accept –though perhaps I do not get your meaning precisely – difficult especially in the case of moral responsibility or of ‘avoidable’ grievous losses. <br>Over the rest of my life from time to time I questioned the ‘meaning’ of my childhood apercu, and found no useful way to think about it any further –with the exception perhaps of another conjecture that “no moment of existence can be re-created in its reality, ever, even given infinity”. Which might be the same as saying; “that which is done can never be undone”. And there is still no moral let-out or escape clause – which is perhaps Nietzsche’s dilemma - ‘the innocent condemned to suffering each moment’s horror without remission’ – a kind of existential hell. <br>So I turned as I grew up to bootstrap thinking about the wide world and animal and vegetable natures. In my infant world there had ‘always’ been ‘the’ Robin (European – tame behaviour because it follows the human spade with a beady eye) and ‘the’ hedgehog, as well as a wide and sometimes quarrelsome cast of birds and animals. In old age I have thought: “Because these apparently endless repetitions of the non-human pre-date and in a more normal time for the human imagination could be expected to outlive our kind, we might have taken solace by assuming their embodiment to persist, even beyond our descendants.”<br>‘Endless’ on the human scale is not ‘infinite’, as you rightly point out I think, nor is it associated with the vertigo of the void. (I remember as a child visiting the brink of that place as well). There are stranger places for the human mind to visit – I find it especially difficult to think about these modern engagements with our historical cultural representations of existence – going back even to the origins and historical constructions of the ‘soul’ or of the ‘afterlife’, or of ‘God’s purposes’ in the world. But needs must: we actually did hit the 20thC, and there is more to come! We know enough to know that. I am looking forward to our next ‘thinker’ next week!<br>Best<br>Phil H<br><br><a href=#c7585032678198017631 title="comment permalink">6/1/13, 3:44 AM</a><br><br>

Reading these recent posts I keep hearing that Churchill quote in my mind - "history is simply one damned thing after another”. But it’s how we react to all these events, how we think about them and put them in context, our stories, that determine our own sense of the shape of time as we experience it. Personally, I tend to put macro events into the context of slow, catabolic collapse. But twenty years ago, I was thinking pretty much the opposite. And then at either stage, within my own life, I’ve tended to be fairly action-oriented and productive. So my day-to-day reality usually feels positive regardless, even though I now carry a lot of beliefs in my head that previously I would have considered negative. How we interpret and experience reality is such a soup, with so many variables. <br><br>Churchill is interesting for lots of reasons, combining this great determination live large and impact his times, with a very moody personality, and some depressive tendencies. He dedicated himself to maintaining the Empire, but ultimately you could see his life as one long losing Imperial battle, finally leaving office just before Suez. No wonder he was depressed sometimes. Clearly, he didn’t embrace the more stoical position of calm acceptance of Britain’s inevitable decline. And yet it was this same instinct for fighting back against reality that positioned him to fight back against the Nazis when many others in Europe were rolling over. And we remember him as a great statesman for fighting Hitler, and don’t dwell so much on his central failure with regard to Empire. People seem to admire the fighter a good bit more than the stoic, perhaps because the fighter is trying to mould and shape and turn back material reality, rather than yielding to it for deeper spiritual reasons. Another reason why this current collapse will be quite long and drawn-out, in my opinion.<br><br><br><a href=#c3036348579007629818 title="comment permalink">6/1/13, 7:10 AM</a><br><br>

There are many good guesses thus far, several in line with the ecological view of time as seral succession that framed much of The Ecotechnic Future if I'm remembering it correctly.<br><br>As someone whose natural tendencies veered away from discussions of philosophy, this series has been a crash course on being in over my head. I'm appreciating the opportunity to bring balance to my education, though, and before we learn the answer next week to the cliffhanger, I'd like to mention a time narrative that hasn't appeared in the guessing yet.<br><br>Aldo Leopold's story of the history of his farm as the rings of a dead oak tree as he cuts it for firewood has stuck with me for years. The sawyer/historian's three tools of the crosscut saw, the axe, and the splitting wedge each have their purpose and offer a different view of the story contained in the tree. The tree grows, thrives, dies, and decays or is dismantled for other purposes in much the same way as other trees; yet the individual story of each tree is unique. Meanwhile the forest inhabited by the tree is subject to the same pressures for change or stability as any forest anywhere but is unique in its own niche, and the parallels scale up and down. <br><br>The thought experiment of eternal return is a powerful one, and thanks for bringing it up! It's quite something to look at one's life in the context of making judgments about past patterns balanced by present and future choices and actions with an eye to being destined to repeat them all over infinite time. Something like "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry Self" comes to mind.<br><br>--<br><br>I'd like to apologize for my part in the spat that took the Pleasures of Extinction thread off the rails. This week's post pointed up some of the things that were happening that I didn't clearly understand, but I also could have handled it better and will work to do so in the future.<br><br><a href=#c895407139200668890 title="comment permalink">6/1/13, 9:51 AM</a><br><br>

Severed flower does not bloom but short moment." <br><br>The second sentence is a beautiful aphorism. I agree with both statements, with the minor caveat that some secular ethics, such as the idea that all people are entitled to some basic material dignity, come straight from Judaism. Because of the Sermon on the Mount, Christianity has a sentimentality about the moral goodness of the poor which Judaism lacks.<br><br>In America, the middle class still has an attachment to some shared civic values. I'm using "middle class" in the popular sense of people whose income comes at least partly from earnings for work and who can afford to buy more than a day's worth of food at a time.<br><br>These shared values include the belief in the right to choose our political leaders, freedom of religion and freedom of speech, fairness in the sense of "may the best man win", a feeling of responsibility to help at least some people that we don't personally know, and admiration toward people who make some kind of contribution toward society.<br><br>What is termed "the American way of life" is often reduced to the right to make money, but it also encompasses this set of civic values. Immigrants are expected to embrace them and most do. Though some of these values are rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition, they are also part of the American civil religion, I think.<br><br>Belief in these values can be undermined by life experience of corruption and injustice, which will happen more and more as things fall apart. Until now, the American civic values have held up through hard times and civil unrest, and I have some hope that they are robust and flexible enough to be sustained without a Christian underpinning.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c7112621153948000134 title="comment permalink">6/1/13, 11:29 AM</a><br><br>

Wish I'd thought of it, and in general I agree with the entire comment.<br><br>One thing that I think about on and off is the different modalities of our engagement with the Crappening based on our own stage of life (age, etc). For me, I'm almost in synch with my civilisation: I'm on the cusp of middle age, still healthy and hale but showing some signs of apoptosis :-) feeling some limits, seeing that my time here is getting shorter, I'm on the downhill now, not the uphill. So I suspect that the melancholy of civilisational collapse is tangled up (in my thinking/feeling) with the melancholy of the first intimations of elderhood, mortality not as a distant vague concept but as a precipice that seems to be approaching more and more rapidly as I run this river of time.<br><br>I wonder how it feels to be, say, 20 and full of energy and youthful fires, and to be living in this time of civilisational decay? I have a few friends who are in their 70's and 80's and their attitude differs from mine; if anything they are more cheerful, they feel they will not live to see the worst of the decline and are openly grateful to have reaped the best bennies of the fossil binge. They seem like disinterested bystanders at a stranger's funeral; I feel more like a mourner at the wake of a family member; but what does a young person feel?<br><br>If we should seek out the philosophies that counterbalance our innate personality traits then I -- sterotypically Celtic, volatile, emotional, moody, sentimental and fierce -- should definitely cultivate Stoicism! I remember enjoying the Meditations very much and should read them again; and in fact I practise some Stoicism in daily life, now that I come to think on it. In business dealings f'rexample I try not to worry about what the other party is doing or thinking or whether I'm getting the best deal possible, but just do what *I* believe to be fair and right. If I get fooled or cheated, at least I will have nothing to reproach *myself* for. It's much more relaxing than trying to second-guess in an adversarial game of Battleship. "Do what's right and let the chips fall where they may" is something I've struggled long and hard to learn, and if this is Stoicism then I think I'll seek out more of the same :-)<br><br><a href=#c918647225744825768 title="comment permalink">6/1/13, 1:21 PM</a><br><br>

It seems to me that that explains the matter quite well all by itself. <br><br>Juhana, I've certainly noticed! It's been of interest to me just how closely the disintegration of industrial society in the US and Europe has followed my catabolic collapse theory -- at least so far. <br><br>Cherokee, exactly. The concept of progress contains no content, just a value judgment -- that's what makes it so convenient as a justification for the status quo. Glad to hear you've gotten some rain!<br><br>Phil, your childhood insight is something the Stoics would have liked. As for the origins of the figurations we impose on time to create history, that's going to be a central theme later on. <br><br>JP, in theory, that's possible.

If you want to talk about ways to moderate the swings in some particular case, on the other hand, that seems like a reasonable goal. <br><br>Yupped, the interesting thing is that the Stoic is often a fighter. Marcus Aurelius, who was a brilliant Stoic writer as well as emperor of Rome, spent his entire career doing battle against one barbarian horde after another, to sustain the relative peace and security of the Roman world in the face of all opposition. Again, from a Stoic perspective, you don't waste your time complaining about what the world throws at you; you simply do the right thing as best you can determine it. <br><br>Steve, thank you.

Basically you are assuming, essentially, that scientific progress is a given and leads to an understanding of cultural progress in line with current progressive narratives.<br><br>However there are two major reasons to dispute this. The first is that it applies, if you will, a flawed understanding of evolution (as progressive) to the development of social ideas and ideals. In fact evolution is more typically understood to be adaptive and dynamic, and so for your vision to be consistent with that, we would have to be able to form testable hypotheses which shows that progressive narratives dominated everywhere because they were most useful. JMG quite concisely demolished any such universalist case you can make around such a mechanism. If you are going to suggest such a mechanism it will have to be much more narrow than what you have proposed.<br><br>The second reason to be sceptical is that there is no apex of evolution generally (I say this with some small background in evolutionary ecology). Instead what we typically see is specialization when resources expand and generalization when they contract. This is because there is no one path to success but rather a multitude of paths. Bats may be better at eating gypsie moths than at eating their larvae, but some other animals may be much better at eating the larvae. When gypsie moth populations explode, these animals specialize, but when they return to normal they generalize much more.<br><br><a href=#c7890233141445130762 title="comment permalink">6/2/13, 1:42 AM</a><br><br>

I can't even pretend to know where we are all being led, although it seems that you have a particular destination in mind. Surely this destination would relate to your own belief system, although few commenters seem willing to grapple with this? <br><br>I don't expect an answer to that question as I'm happy to accept that things will be revealed in your own time.<br><br>Getting back to the main story though, I kind of feel a bit sad for Nietzsche as to my mind he fixated on the details and in doing so missed the big picture. This is a common problem in our culture. Yes, the horse was being beaten and the owner was probably not a very nice person, but what of that? There would still have been lots of beauty and things to celebrate in the world despite the injustice that was before him.<br><br>Many questions are raised by Nietzsche’s actions: Is he even responsible for the actions of the owner? Would he associate with the owner knowing what he knows of their actions? Were the actions of the owner part of the accepted norm of the day? Was the horse dying anyway and Nietzsche's actions ended up being largely irrelevant? Where does Nietzsche begin and end his struggles as he cannot be intervene in every injustice in the world (he lacks boundaries)? Did Nietzsche have his house in order before becoming involved in others struggles?<br><br>Controlling other people’s actions is a difficult thing and also the point at which magic comes into play.<br><br>Perhaps my attitude is incorrect and some may find my perspective to be debatable or even repugnant, but it is my own preference to consider a person’s interface with the environment (including people). In doing so, it sort of neatly side steps the murky problem of time and instead focuses on impacts and outcomes. It is mildly ironic that the dreamtime stories also provide this sort of structure / code / ethics / advice or whatever you may want to call it. It is a way of thinking that is probably well adapted to this crazy chaotic environment that I find myself living in.<br><br>Nietzsche had the courage to do an honourable thing, but in the larger context I find that his actions are baffling and even self-defeating.

Let’s back into the eternal return from the will to power with a little help from Jasper’s thoughtful observation, I paraphrase, “the will to power is the last intelligible concept before the abyss.” The point is that all intelligible concepts can be reduced to will to power, but of course there is no further intelligible reduction from will to power. If you try that, you are confronted with a very serious case of inexpressibility! The primacy of will to power means that human thought is always in the service of some project of aggrandizement, no matter how insane or twisted. It is not the kind of concept that helps us better understand our experience of the world, because the concept will to power is always dissolving the fabric of intelligibility. <br><br>So then what can be said about the shape of time? Strictly speaking, nothing at all (from Nietzsche’s point of view), at least not in some objective, externally valid form. As JMG has been pointing out, the various shapes of time are in the service of various modes of human life, some highly adaptive, some deeply maladaptive. <br><br>My best guess is the eternal return is the conceptual core of nihilism, a particularly vicious and extraordinarily maladaptive vision of time and life, really a kind of insanity. From a certain point of view, the human mind is susceptible to nihilism like a kind of conceptual virus. Nietzsche’s great task was to use the power of that concept to overcome nihilism. Because of the close association between nihilism and modern industrial society, there is perhaps a further extension of the project tied to this historical circumstance, but I would not want to stretch that connection to hard.<br><br>As for next week, I shudder to think you are going to take us through the dark forests of Sein und Zeit!

I avoided reading great literary and philosopical works and pondering the big questions. Regardless of my own predisposition in favour of the practical and day-to-day I cannot entirely escape the great issues. <br><br>Like, for example, "where did we come from"? Or "why all this" as opposed to something else entirely or nothing at all. And I noticed that there are two approaches to these questions both of which are rooted in emotional response. <br><br>Some people cannot abide the notion that human life is without purpose, that it is a meaningless nightmare of suffering (Woody Allen?), that it is the byproduct of impersonal and random physical forces that could just as easily have resulted in an Earth of green slime or a molten, lifeless rock. <br><br>Others cannot abide the notion that there IS a purpose, that the forces of creation had initial conditions that would, after the passage of billions of years, of necessity result in our being up on our hind legs. And why is this so unpalatable? Because that would raise icky questions that had their place in an earlier superstitious era, questions unworthy of the modern, rational and educated mind. <br><br>These latter scorn the approach of the former as emotionally immature, as not rooted in "fact". Whereas, in my opinion, these high and mighty rationalists don't have two facts to rub together either and are just as emotional in their aversion to the alternative view. <br><br>What testable facts are there to support the contention that there ISN'T a purpose? But, as I said, maybe I'm deficient in my understanding. What does an accountant know anyhow?<br><br><a href=#c5178008597938175405 title="comment permalink">6/4/13, 10:21 AM</a><br><br>

And regret -- so many years spent caring about and hoping for all the wrong things -- as Bruce Stirling quipped, "A Good Old-Fashioned Future."<br><br>I don't know what our parents could say to my generation, or what my generation could say to yours, other than "Sorry."

I don't seem to have the knack for responding even on the gentle Archdruid internet rhythm, though, so here you'll have it.)<br><br>Re: Nietzsche: it's a reasonable approach to treat Nitzsche through that lens, no doubt. I just tend to think that, at the height of his powers, Nietzsche uses concepts like the return in a less literal fashion and prefer to read his work that way. <br><br>I sympathize with your dislike of Derrida--until I read his "Force and Signification" essay, I had a hard time not loathing his work. After reading it, well, okay it wasn't much better but I could see him as this guy who had this vital insight that was subsequently lost under a wave of trendy obscurantism and smugness.<br><br>To be fair, Deleuze suffers from his share of trendy obscurantism, but I do feel like there is much that can be extracted and made sense of outside of that, which is where later Derrida seems to fail for me. <br><br>Deleuze was also quite a fan of Bateson. I stumbled across Deleuze by accident during my archetypal psychology phase before I knew he was anybody important and proceeded to make an obsessive (though not always well-informed) study of his work as an undergrad--I first took French in college because I hoped it would help me chase down his footnotes better! Anyway, I first learned of Bateson from Deleuze and started reading him shortly thereafter.<br><br>I've been thinking a lot about how amenable the core wisdom of modernity is to emendation and consolidation. The kinds of luxury we have had the last couple of centuries has supported sprawling intellectual works that can only become increasingly inaccessible as that luxury wanes.<br><br>I've been considering the tight fusion of practice (which Western philosophy seems to have all but lost) and theory you find in the indic sutras, wondering if it can be meaningfully replicated. Of course, the sutras without the community to preserve them aren't all that useful. Still, I can read a sutra or a Platonic dialogue and come away the better for it.<br><br>This is surely long enough for a tardy response!<br><br><a href=#c2057735155498254189 title="comment permalink">6/6/13, 6:56 AM</a><br><br>
