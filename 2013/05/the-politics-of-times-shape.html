<div class=MsoNormal>
Last week’s discussion was a bit of a divagation from the main theme of the present sequence of posts here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, but it was a divagation with a purpose. The three movements I traced from hopeful beginnings to their final guttering out in fantasies of universal destruction—Christian fundamentalism, the New Age scene, and the environmental movement—each attempted to change the direction in which the industrial world is moving, and failed. Both the attempts and the failures are<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>instructive, and make it possible to glimpse certain aspects of contemporary life that all parties involved have done their best to keep as obscure as possible.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To begin with, it’s important to recognize that no fixed rule sets apart those changes that get called “progress” from the ones that don’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The three competing kinds of progress discussed in <a href=../../2013/04/the-god-with-three-heads.html>an earlier post in this sequence</a> are responsible for part of that diversity, but the majority of it is a function of ordinary power politics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Any change in any part of society will benefit certain people at the expense of others, and in the bare-knuckle brawl of modern political life, slapping the label of progress on those changes that will benefit one’s supporters and annoy one’s enemies is an obvious and constantly used tactic. Just as common and effective is the gambit of pinning labels such as "regressive" on those changes that would benefit one’s enemies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At any point in time, as a result, what exactly counts as progress is a fiercely contested matter, and the success or failure of a pressure group in the political sphere can often be gauged to a fine degree by noting where public opinion puts that group’s agenda on the spectrum reaching from most progressive to most reactionary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Those assignments can shift dramatically with changes in context and the relative strength of different factions. Thus the kind of Protestant religiosity that’s now associated with the far right in America used to be an ideology of the far left—William Jennings Bryan, the radical Democratic politician whose fire-breathing speeches against corporate power make most of today’s anticorporate rhetoric look tame, was also the prosecuting attorney in the famous Scopes monkey trial—and environmental protection was dismissed by the American left of a century ago as a reactionary notion that stood in the way of bringing prosperity to the poor. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These shifts are possible because the concept of progress has no content of its own. In one sense, to borrow a bit of edgy mockery from C.S. Lewis, the contemporary faith in progress can be described as the conviction that the word "better" simply means "whatever comes next."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the age of unparalleled abundance and technological power that is now passing,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>what came next was usually settled by the most recent round of political and economic struggle, and the winners of each round were pleased to see their partisan agenda redefined as the next inevitable step in the onward march of progress. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And the losers?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That’s where things get interesting. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Each of the three movements I sketched out in last week’s post started out as a contender—a movement that might have succeeded in accomplishing the changes it wanted to make to American society, and so in defining those changes as the next inevitable step in that same onward march of progress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first surge of what would become today’s Christian fundamentalist movement spun off the youth movement of the 1960s, embracing the teachings of that bearded and sandaled hippie, Jesus Christ, as the next stage in the moral transformation of American society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The days of the Jesus People,
<i>Godspell</i>, and the Good News Bible have been so thoroughly erased from our collective imagination that it can be hard, even for people who were there at the time, to think of fundamentalism as a radical movement, a social force that saw itself as moving forward toward a brighter future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The transformation of the New Age movement was even more drastic. In its early years, most of what provided the New Age scene with inspiration had at least some claim to be called scientific; quantum physics and a dozen or so avant-garde schools of psychology played a far larger role in the movement than, say, the mutterings of channeled entities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There was plenty of interest in extrasensory perception, to be sure, but parapsychology hadn’t yet been blackballed by the American scientific establishment, and significant figures in the sciences argued that the possibility of extrasensory knowledge ought to be taken seriously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Early New Age books such as Marilyn Ferguson’s <i>The Aquarian Conspiracy</i> raised the hope of a convergence of science and spirituality, in which scientific research would put a solid foundation of proven fact under such traditional practices as yoga and meditation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The environmental movement had much the same flavor in its first flowering. To many of us in the appropriate-tech scene, industrial society’s encounter with the hard reality of planetary limits was at least as much an opportunity as a threat, and the integration of technologically advanced societies with a thriving planetary biosphere—the goal of a great deal of enthusiastic thinking in those days—seemed to promise a future of almost unimaginable richness and possibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The coming world of solar panels and geodesic domes, thriving organic farms and lively human-scale cities, in which Paolo Soleri’s arcologies would rise above newly reforested landscapes and dirigibles would move silently through unpolluted skies, set the stage for many soaring hopes and dreams. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s instructive to observe what happened as each of these movements followed its trajectory through time. The New Age movement, despite the overblown hopes placed on it by some of its supporters, never had a shot at significant political or cultural power, and it soon found its way to the fringes, where it shed its links to science, mingled with the remains of older alternative spiritualities, and began to take the unwholesome interest in conspiracy theories and apocalyptic prophecies that eventually dominated the whole movement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Christian fundamentalism and the environmental movement had far more political clout even in their idealistic early phases, and so had to be bought off; in both cases this was done, as it’s usually done, by dangling the bait of money and influence in front of organizations and spokespersons in the movement who were willing to "be realistic"—that is, to scrap any serious challenge to the existing order of society and focus on a narrowly defined agenda instead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once the bait was taken, in turn, the jaws of the trap snapped smoothly shut. The organizations and spokespersons who had swallowed the bait were expected to cooperate in the marginalization of those who refused it, and to buy into the broader agenda of the people who were cutting the checks even when that agenda contradicted the original purpose of the movement, as it inevitably did. Meanwhile, the narrowing of each group’s purpose committed it to an increasingly defensive and reactive stance:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the fundamentalists fixated on defending a handful of sexual customs, the environmentalists on defending a handful of species, and in both cases the larger partisan coalition to which the movement now belonged made plenty of noise about supporting the movement and then did essentially nothing, insisting that the hard realities of politics made it impossible to follow through on its commitments. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Both movements thus became what I’ve called captive constituencies of existing power centers. The current fracas around the Keystone pipeline shows just how much effective influence the environmental movement succeeded in buying by cashing in its hopes, its dreams and its principles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Obama administration, if it chooses to do so, can agree to the pipeline and suffer no noticeable backlash from the environmental movement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There would be some yelling in the media and the blogosphere, to be sure, and a few protest marches in designated free speech zones, but come 2016 the Democrats will wave the scary Republicans at whatever remains of the environmental movement, the leaders of the big environmental organizations will give speeches about how disappointed they are in the Democrats but we still have to support them against the GOP, and rank and file environmentalists will line up meekly and vote for the Democratic candidate despite it all. Obama could as well order the national park system strip-mined for coal and launch a new biofuels program that will turn endangered species into synthetic petroleum, and the results would be precisely the same; it doesn’t help, of course, that the Republicans treat their captive constituencies with the identical degree of scorn. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s no accident that when movements for social change fail—whether the failure is simply a matter of banishment to the fringes, as happened to the New Age, or whether the movement is courted, seduced, betrayed and abandoned like the hapless heroine of a Victorian penny-dreadful novel, as happened to the fundamentalists and the environmentalists—apocalyptic beliefs become increasingly central to their rhetoric. Partly, that’s a reflection of the massive role that threats of imminent doom have always had in the rhetoric of social change, especially but not only here in America. Since the Reverend Jonathan Edwards thrilled colonial New England with his famous sermon "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God," attempts to move American society in any direction have normally relied on the insistence that failing to make whatever change is being proposed guarantees some awful fate or other. The less effective the movement, by and large, the more strident the threats of apocalypse tend to be, and the decline of a social movement into political irrelevance is normally accompanied by a final burst of rhetoric pushing the movement’s apocalyptic claims to their ultimate extreme. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, there’s more going on here than the common tendency of activists at all points on the political continuum to respond to the failure of rhetorical threats by doubling down. The distinction made in an earlier post between the shape of time defined by Augustine of Hippo and the one proposed by Joachim of Flores has a great deal of relevance here. All three of the movements I’ve discussed above started their trajectory with a Joachimist model of history:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the world had arrived at the brink of a grand transformation, and once people embraced the great forward leap that the movement offered, some equivalent of Joachim’s Age of the Holy Spirit would usher in a bright new future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The New Age movement officially kept that faith—it could hardly do otherwise, having defined itself in terms of a new age that was supposedly about to be born—but as the Aquarian Conspiracy fizzled out and the world kept following its accustomed path, New Age thinkers drifted out of a Joachimist model into an Augustinian one, in which the repeated failures of ordinary history would finally be redeemed by an equivalent of the Second Coming on December 21, 2012. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For the fundamentalist and environmentalist movements, the shift from Joachimist to Augustinian models of time was if anything more sharply defined. Once both movements abandoned the hope of changing society as a whole, they had slipped over into Augustinian time, and they promptly identified themselves with the righteous remnant of the Augustinian vision. Once they did that, their defeat was certain; the role of the righteous remnant in Augustine’s shape of time is to strive to defend the good against the assaults of an evil world, and fail heroically, so that the triumph of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the Second Coming or its secular equivalent can be all the more glorious. Activists in both movements, without ever quite noticing it, accordingly embraced tactics that were guaranteed to fail. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What media activist Patrick Reinsborough has called "defector syndrome"—the fine art of arguing for your side in such a way that only those who already agree wholeheartedly with your viewpoint will be favorably impressed, while everyone else will be repelled—has played a large role in such exercises. I’m thinking here, among other things, of a book on energy issues I got in the mail not long ago, an unwieldy coffee table-sized object that started out with a photo essay in which each page had an slogan in 60-point type, all caps, yelling something or other about the world’s energy situation. It’s hard to imagine that anybody but a true believer in the editor’s point of view would get past the bellowing; I found it unreadable, and I more or less agree with the book’s viewpoint. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To the ordinary citizens and opinion makers in the middle of the road, the people the environmental movement desperately needs to engage, that sort of tirade simply confirms the other side’s insistence that environmentalists are by definition a pack of raving extremists. The same sort of self-inflicted damage is even more common in the fundamentalist scene—think of Reverend Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church, whose shrill ravings about the alleged evils of homosexuality have probably done more to make ordinary Americans sympathetic to gays and lesbians than any other factor in living memory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s the kind of own goal that tends to get scored when a movement for social change embraces the Augustinian shape of time in an uncritical fashion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s important to understand why this should be so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The shape of time that Augustine proposed in
<i>The City of God</i> was ultimately a response to failure—the failure of the Roman state and society to maintain itself against the forces that were dragging it down the road to collapse, and the failure of the Christian religion to make good on the promises of an earlier generation of theologians and save the Roman world from itself. As a response to failure, in turn, it was extraordinarily effective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>If you and your civilization are staring the Dark Ages in the face, a way of thinking about time that treats ordinary history as an evil irrelevance and focuses all hope on a shining vision of a world after history ends is not merely comforting, it’s adaptive. It inspired monks and nuns across Dark Age Europe to preserve the cultural and scientific<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>heritage of the ancient world, and helped many ordinary people find a reason to keep going even in the harshest times. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A way of thinking that’s adaptive during the decline of a civilization, though, may not be equally so in struggles for influence in an age of abundance. As I suggested earlier in this post, any social change will benefit some people at the expense of others; what counts as progress from the point of view of the winners in any given struggle, in other words, will usually look very like decline from the point of view of the losers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the only two ways of thinking about historical change your culture offers you are the Joachimist and the Augustinian shapes of time, in turn—and this is decidedly true of contemporary industrial society—the winners in any given social conflict are likely to embrace a Joachimist view in which their triumph marks the arrival of a grand positive transformation and a great leap forward along the inevitable track of progress, while the losers are just as likely to embrace an Augustinian view in which their defeat will inevitably be paid back with interest by some apocalyptic transformation in the near future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Those beliefs are comforting, they allow the cascading randomness of history to be forced into an emotionally satisfying shape, and they encourage each side to continue to enact their assigned social roles as winners and losers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is one of the core reasons, I’ve come to believe, that peak oil has been the red-haired stepchild of the environmental movement since the contemporary peak oil scene began to emerge in the late 1990s. There have been any number of attempts to force it into a Joachimist patterm—think of all the attempts to claim that we can overcome the challenge of peak oil through some great collective leap to a better world—or an Augustinian one—think of all the attempts to extract a satisfyingly sudden cataclysm from the long slow downward arc of fossil fuel depletion—but the great collective leaps have proven embarrassingly out of reach, and the sudden cataclysms contrast awkwardly with the reality of rising energy costs, disintegrating infrastructure, and economic dysfunction that peak oil is helping to bring about right now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If peak oil and the wider impact of the limits to growth define the future we actually face, both the winners and the losers are out of luck.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course this points up one of the other features of peak oil that’s rendered it so unwelcome:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>it provides a basis for accurate predictions. I accept that there are at least a few people on any given side of today’s reality wars who believe, totally and trustingly, that victory for their side will bring about a great leap forward to a new epoch of history, or that the inevitable defeat of their side will be followed by a vast catastrophe that will prove to the rest of humanity just how wrong they were. I find myself questioning, though, just how large a percentage of those who make such claims can be counted among the true believers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve known far too many people whose belief in the imminent destruction of the world didn’t keep them from putting money into their retirement accounts, or whose loudly proclamed commitment to some cause never quite caused them to live up to the ideals they claimed to espouse. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I commented <a href=../../2012/04/seascape-with-methane-plumes.html>in a blog post last year</a> on the odd way that mainstream climate activists had reacted to news that the Arctic Ocean was fizzing with methane. Many public figures—iconic climate scientist <a href=http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/23/11144098-gaia-scientist-james-lovelock-i-was-alarmist-about-climate-change?lite>James Lovelock among them</a>—who had insisted not that long before that releases of Arctic methane meant "game over" suddenly backed away from those claims, making embarrassed noises. Those who accepted at face value the predictions of imminent doom issued by Lovelock and his peers are at least being consistent when they decide that, now that methane is bubbling out of the Arctic ooze, it’s all over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It may simply be their bad luck to have missed the winks and nudges that signaled, as I suggested in the post just mentioned, that the predictions had more to do with putting pressure on China and her allies than they did with purely objective science. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times">Peak oil might have become another excuse for such maneuvers, except that it’s shown an awkward capacity for appearing on schedule and causing exactly the sort of disruptions that have been predicted by peak oil researchers all along. It’s hard to threaten someone with a crisis that’s already arrived, and harder still to rouse enthusiasm for a great leap forward when every attempt to make it ends in a messy slide backward.  Both the shapes of time our culture is willing to consider, in other words, have passed their pull dates—and the obvious alternative, though it’s a better fit to the evidence and arguably more adaptive as well, is utterly unacceptable to most people in the industrial world today. We’ll discuss that in the next post in this sequence. </span></span></div>

When I speak to Tibetans here in India they understandably hold such beliefs, and it helps them adapt to a tough life, though many don't really seem to believe it if you see how they're building permanent monasteries on a grand scale in India.

I see the movement's influence as minimal - no more than, say, the Hare Krishna kids's importance to the spread of Hinduism. I don't remember anyone taking the Jesus Freaks seriously. Like smoking pot, wearing bellbottoms and engaging in the a cross-racial relationship, Hip Christianity was a phase - a rite of passage, if you will (one of many available at the time). The Jesus Movement's most attractive characteristic was that it was different from the standard Catholic and main-stream Protestant church experiences that the hippies had grown up in and had come to associate with 'The Man'.<br><br>Most of the Jesus Freaks who remained in the faith at all were absorbed into the larger Fundamentalist movement that had been brewing for decades among the poor and working classes of America's cultural and economic backwaters. Jesse DuPlantis and Jeff Fenholt (of Jesus Christ Superstar fame) were only two of a number of Jesus Freaks who went on to become Fundamentalist functionaries of note.<br><br>We call it 'Fundamentalism' but it is really an odd blend of true Fundamentalism - mainly Baptist concepts - and the more active and emotive Pentecostal approach to Christianity...A heady concoction, indeed, and one that became very influential once its leaders gained mastery of the magical tools of politics and the airwaves.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c5790380489429149641 title="comment permalink">5/23/13, 6:08 AM</a><br><br>

Maybe I should issue a "SPOILER ALERT" ...<br><br>JMG, I think, envisions the "Slow Decline" instead of the steady upward progress, instead of the sudden radical New Age transformation, and instead of the sudden Apocalypse. It's a subtle point, which a lot of people fail to see, mostly because the "Slow Decline" bears some superficial resemblance to the Apocalypse. But it's fundamentally different than any of the others.<br><br>For one thing, in the "Slow Decline" model, the past Age is viewed neither as some kind of all-wise Paradise, nor as some vile, evil Original Sin. It's viewed as a societal and resource "overshoot", a hedonistic binge that we engaged in for understandable, pleasurable reasons, which we'd all like to repeat, but it can't be sustained. I'm tempted to call this model the "Binge/Hangover" model. <br><br>The second fundamental difference with a "slow decline" is that there is _no_ single defining point that marks the transition, unlike the sudden New Age Transformation or the sudden Apocalypse. (After all, when you binge on alcohol, there isn't usually a defining moment, "2:47 AM I made the sudden transition from pleasurably drunk to hung-over".) Therefore, those who are waiting for a sudden turning point in order to "prove" that their vision is correct, will never be proven right or wrong.<br><br>You could look up JMG's essay on "catabolic collapse", which went around the Internet, for more details. His vision is more like "falling down a flight of stairs". Instead of one sudden calamity that wipes everything clean, we'll suffer a series of indignities, any single one of which taken by itself would be a trivial bump in the road. But because they're all connected, (the staircase of Peak Oil), their effects accumulate before we can right ourselves, and before we know it we're at the bottom of a steep staircase with a bunch of broken bones. The difference between understanding what's going on, the Shape of Time, versus not understanding, is lying at the bottom of the stairs with a broken arm and ankle, as opposed to a broken neck.<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c6515598764798899838 title="comment permalink">5/23/13, 6:35 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps it's because while we always have the moment, we also need some shape for the past and future. We can't just not think about them. <br><br>The human mind is wired for survival to seek patterns, and that seeking takes place temporally as well as spatially, aurally, and what else have you. So examining the past and future is essential, and our shape-of-time stories are how we do that. <br><br>The striking thing about the two shapes on our culture's menu is that neither of them is objectively true. Is there something about the role these stories fill that precludes simply describing the universe? <br><br>I think so. To tell a story that accurately reflects what really happens in the world is tantamount to buliding an accurate rational model of it. Time is made of many processes, some of them cyclical and many of them complex and non-linear. To accommodate this even in coarse terms is a task of formidable mathematical complexity. Any story that can be remembered, and passed down in the form of tales, sermons or sound-bytes, must necessarily constitute a distortion, either in omitted information or in simplified axioms. That distortion will always eventually break the story by compromising its pattern recognition utility.<br><br>But a story we do need. It seems that with modern additions to our understanding of nature, we should be able to conjure up something that's a much closer fit than Gus and Jack. Something that is essentially cyclical, but also acknowledges that the Sun will turn into a red giant eventually.<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c7727924912393444660 title="comment permalink">5/23/13, 6:50 AM</a><br><br>

New Agers, environmentalists or religious fundamentalists were easily absorbed by industrial society because they came along at a time of relative comfort and growth, and they generally weren’t prepared to use violence. So, the leaders got co-opted and so did many of the potential followers – the whole yuppie thing was about millions of newly minted professionals being given a lot more space in the economy. But that had its effect, of course - in raising and temporarily meeting so many people’s expectations of greater material prosperity it pushed society closer to the kind of real resource crisis necessary for more dramatic (and less controlled) change to occur. Similarly, new spiritual, economic or environmental ideas that floated up from the 60s and 70s triggered a strong reaction, without which it might not have been possible to have Reagans and Thatchers elected (perhaps more mild mannered leaders would have chosen to muddle through and adopt more). So, action and reaction, until we meet circumstances we can’t adapt to so easily, leading to more discontinuous change. Which is where we are getting to now. <br><br>Finally, I know a few people who would be considered New Agers. Yes, some were hoping for some sort of ascension to happen over the holidays last year (although most were still planning on having the in-laws over for Christmas dinner, and weren’t looking forward to it!). But many are still doing things in their lives that are driving positive changes, even just de-stressing and de-cluttering, spending less. It does seem possible to have a lot of silly ideas in your head about a New Age of mass enlightenment, while also working on your own, personal enlightenment. And it’s the latter that really counts, even if the light is quite dim at first.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c4021510330590726541 title="comment permalink">5/23/13, 7:40 AM</a><br><br>

The whole point was about trying to have the planet and eat it, too, as the obvious conflict between middle class lifestyles for all and the biosphere made efforts to reconcile them kind of ridiculous. It's still happening, of course, but the historical reminder of what the left looked like when conservation was still a conservative cause is really interesting. <br><br>Peak oil as the red-headed stepchild of the environmental movement makes sense. Though it was ultimately born from the environmental movement, it doesn't seem to belong with either the Joachimist cornucopian solar-powered-Walmart wing or with the apocalyptic Augustinian wing. Perhaps that's why the albatross of a coffee table book doesn't work quite so well. I thought the editors made a terrible mistake putting the billboard-sized random phrases of outrage on pictures that really say more than enough. It was almost like the PCI was having a consensus meeting of the editorial board and one Augustinian holdout wouldn't budge, thus dragging the whole book into cognitive dissonance. <br><br>My first introduction to the concept came from Al Bartlett in a graduate seminar the second month into engineering school. He didn't polish the numbers one way or another, but simply talked about the dynamics of exponential growth in consumption of finite resources and ended by challenging us to dig up the numbers and do the math for ourselves. Sure there've been exceptions to this, but in the main I've seen peak oil presented from the Limits to Growth perspective of system dynamics, ecology, and cold hard math. Those manners of presentation don't lend themselves as well to apocalyptic or progressive narratives, but rather to historical comparisons with other resource-intensive civilizations. I'm not surprised that at the same time that the Peak Oil movement was really coming alive there was such a focus on the resource-based theories for the decline of past empires and civilizations.<br><br>Oh the suspense.

The only consistent aspect to this field is that there is no way to characterize what's going on. It's essentially a chaotic mass of actors all going in a wide variety of directions all at once, some of whom rise to the surface and gain success, but the vast majority of which simply give energy to the roiling and unpredictable field - if you can even call it a field.<br><br>Geopolitics, for another example, is in a similar boat - there are so many actors on the stage all with different motives moving in a wide variety of directions - the middle east and north africa, for example, is especially chaotic and unmodelable.<br><br>In an era that is characterized by radical ununiformity, how can we hope to produce a model that can inform us about the shape of time? <br><br><br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c4603794593254085777 title="comment permalink">5/23/13, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

Since I've only lived in America, I don't claim to be able to address conditions in other parts of the world; if you can apply these ideas to your own region, all the better. <br><br>Raven, Islam has its own variants on the triumphalist and apocalyptic mythologies I've discussed here. I'd encourage you to do the research. <br><br>Rita, that word "democracy" can mean a lot of different things, some more adaptive than others. <br><br>Anagnosto, good. For a variety of reasons, I've postulated that a Muslim Europe is tolerably likely in the future -- it's one of the background details in my blog-novel <a href=http://starsreach.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>Star's Reach</a>, for example. <br><br>Jeffrey, no argument there. The foredoomed attempt to deny the arrival of a future of living within limits is one of the major themes of modern thought. <br><br>Phil, if it wasn't the energy limit, it would be something else. As Kenneth Boulding pointed out, only madmen and economists believe in the possibility of limitless growth on a finite planet. <br><br>Mike, all in good time...<br><br>Greg, my take is that the mainstream fundamentalist movement was what emerged when the Jesus People et al. were safely co-opted and absorbed by the status quo.

That's likely to be a major source of trouble in the years immediately ahead. <br><br>Will, I do indeed. As for the environmental movement, though, it's dead; the question at this point is what might be born from its ashes. <br><br>Yupped, I'd draw a distinction between the New Age movement and the broader current of popular occultism that the movement partly absorbed during its heyday. That broader current contains plenty of useful things,and they'll still be practiced long after the label "New Age" has gone the way of "New Thought." <br><br>Chapel, good! The answer to both questions is yes. <br><br>James, I'm not a fan of the Not-so-great Beast, thus didn't see any more reason to mention his theories than those of the dozens of other Edwardian occultists who came up with similar notions. I may find room for Yeats' far subtler theory of historical ages, though...<br><br>Onething, in comparing the processes I've outlined with the sort of conspiracy thinking that's come to dominate the New Age scene, I'd ask you to reflect on the following questions. Does the Democratic Party secretly run the entire world? Has it done so since at least 15,000 BCE? Is it headed by evil lizard-beings from outer space? Are all other conspiracies subordinate to it? Does it use sinister mind control technologies to get its way? Does it have secret high-tech weapons that are responsible for all the world's natural disasters? Is it about to impose a nightmare reign of terror on the entire world? If not, you might find it useful to check these questions against the sort of thing that's been all over the New Age scene for decades now, and you might get some sense of the distinction I'm drawing here. <br><br>Steve, I expressed my concerns to one of the main people involved in the book project, and got back a lengthy and distinctly heated defense of the tone and approach of the thing. I don't think it's just one holdout. <br><br>Richard, some will get it; the rest will probably die. Natural selection is a harsh teacher. <br><br>John, er, I don't think you got the point of what I was trying to say. The other direction of what? There are <i>many</i> other directions.<br><br>Joseph, that's raw material for an entire post by itself; I'll consider that for future reference. <br><br>St. Roy, it's not just Madison Avenue; the environmental movement has approached this pipeline fight with a stunning disregard of all the principles of political strategy and tactics, and has all but handed a victory to its opponents. More on this when I get to the post Joseph requested.<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c873204971772486529 title="comment permalink">5/23/13, 6:41 PM</a><br><br>

Through most of history, the urban-civilization form of society supported itself on a foundation of decentralized villages; the latter is the basic form, the former an occasional blossoming, which runs its course and ends. Our current civilization, as I've argued in a couple of my books, is as brittle as it is precisely because it tried to replace the village system with factory farming powered by fossil fuels; as those run out, it's not going to last -- and then, as you suggest, we'll be reverting to a stabler form. <br><br>Derek, trust me, injuries caused by non-firearm weapons can be just as ghastly as those caused by guns, if not more so.<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c5467724550416918194 title="comment permalink">5/23/13, 7:08 PM</a><br><br>

Rural areas in the West have had the benefit of many aspects of modern technology and infrastructure for some time now. So in relative terms to actual"villages" in the third world the life in such villages can be qualitatively idyllic.<br><br>But "rural" systems are not just driven by an agrarian economy their cultural and moral structures are driven by metaphysics, religion and heirarchy.<br><br>The modern progressive ideas driven world of individuality,political correctness and rights is not to be found in the more rural parts of the simple world(at least the same tenor).<br><br>I say this because I often find that people who deal with ideas in the West romanticize the village as some kind of idyllic haven in their image.<br><br>The Western romanticization of Tibet and now Bhutan are such examples.

The future reaches out just as much and has the same influence on the present that the past does.

The hard part is weeding out the false prophets, from either perspective.

My fault, no doubt. I have always gotten good grades in school but I never claimed that made me a good student. Circular time, as Thijs points out, would seem to be the only other undiscussed option besides steady-state.<br><br>On the other hand, I think most everyone here would agree, grudgingly or no, with other writings of yours, writings which state that fossil fuels are (were) the pinnacle of energy density and EROI that humans had or will ever get their hands on. Since that resource has basically peaked as we write, it would seem to follow that human society is now entering a state of permanent, irrevocable decline -- at least, if our yardstick is graduated in terms of energy, consumption, materialistic possessions, and probably in terms of raw population numbers. If our analysis includes only abstract sociological/psychological/maybe biological measures... such as harmony, ecological balance or human happiness... then in that case I could forsee human-observed time following a cyclical path. But the hard numerical measures such as energy per capita or raw population, while certainly not the complete lens through which civilizations should be evaluated, are nonetheless impossible to ignore.<br><br>Wasn't it a commenter here (not JMG) who cited an article on Ugo Bardi's blog: "<a href=http://cassandralegacy.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-next-ten-billion-years.html rel=nofollow>The Next Ten Billion Years</a>"? It's a fascinating read, at least from a storytelling perspective, and the storytelling is always the key. In it, he presents two visions of the shape of time, from the distant past through the present to the deep future. One he calls "good", a future of steady upward progress (bounded by at least moderately realistic energy limits) where human intelligence ultimately spreads across the galaxy very slowly at sublight speeds. I take it JMG would be skeptical of the eternal upward progress in that scenario. The other one, the "bad" one, includes a return of the Earth to its ecological balance and fecundity, but only millions of years after the near-term extinction of mankind, and while there's time for another species to evolve intelligence, they never get close to humanity's technological achievements, because the dense energy sources (fossil fuels) were all burned by humans right before we went extinct. Any comments on Ugo's article??<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c3893189655051853124 title="comment permalink">5/23/13, 10:06 PM</a><br><br>

The algorithm predicted a kind of maximum novelty singularity end of time that would occur around November-December 2012.

For life of me ,I would never stay in villages, unless the village is 15 km away from city.<br> In yesterday's Indian Express, I read one articles which sharply contradicted Indian govt model of "urbanization”. The growth of middle and small cities have far exceeded growth of mega metropolitan cities. Even villages in some part of country like Punjab, Western Maharashtra are better than cities. The dismal living conditions combined with low wages have started eroding faith of villagers in big cities. They still come, but only to work for some time and they go off. Indian metros are going to become just stopover for unemployed but not permanent abode.<br> BTW JMG,when I look at Indian landscape, I see huge ecological disasters in every part of country. For ex. grazing land for domestic livestock is sharply reduced and most of the animals were sold to butchers in last 5 years. That is why India is now a major exporter of meat in world.<br> Average Indian is more aware of peak oil problems than average European or average american,since we face these problems every day.I think JMG,we are already living in post collapse society.<br> The social engineering experiments carried out by our Royal family form last 65 years might come to end as reality starts biting the govt coffers. In last 10 years Indian govt,in view of surpassing west, have passed most wasteful central welfare schemes which often benefits bureaucrats and politicians who create them.The vision to create a politically correct, socially equal society might face reality very soon.<br> The model of secularization carried out by American and European govt has failed in India.<br> My question to you JMG:<br>Will EU really get converted to Islam so easily?

It's just my thoughts on this topic.<br><br>At the beginning of this series, when I brought up René Guénon's contrast between tradition and modernity, you said he made some major mistakes, and I assume this post summarizing the flaws of the Augustinian model in 20th century America is meant to highlight that, by demonstrating how being the Puritan crying out about the decline of morals only encourages disrespect from those progressives who disagree with your morality.<br><br>On material grounds I am not disagreeing with peak oil. Despite the ominous warnings of rapture-ready Protestants, there's no reason to expect that economy recapitulates theology, and the Hubbert Curve promises, statistically, a long decline. But I think you may have done some misreading here.<br><br>Guénon's objective was not to prove that the world was swiftly coming to an end. He rejects that explicitly, and in fact adopts comforting language quite similar to your post last week: "This end only appears to be the 'end of the world', without any reservation or specification of any kind, to those who see nothing beyond the limits of this particular cycle... In truth there can be many 'ends of the world', because there are cycles of very varied duration." (Reign of Quantity, ch. 40)<br><br>What is swift, and urgent, and terrorizing according to Guénon is not the world itself, but our way of looking at it. Modernity demands that we see every development as a growing crisis. The cries of crisis and danger merely tie us tighter in to technological harnesses as we continue down the slope of peak oil. But the world itself is not in danger. It will go on without us. True sustainability requires rejecting the entire dialectic of crisis. Integrating that understanding into our lives allows escape from modern ways of thinking, but it will grow harder with every decade.<br><br>I think, as well, that this fills a gap in your description of Augustinian time. Augustine did not teach, "things are just going to get worse from now on"; such incredible pessimism, more fitted to Nietzsche, would not have inspired anyone in the 5th century AD. Instead he said, "truth will not disappear even if this world falters". And that is how new societies were born from Rome's ashes.<br><br>What does this mean for the long descent? In my humble opinion, it means that the future does not belong to those willing to make simply material changes. As long as one's way of thinking does not embrace a permanent ideal which is appropriate to those conditions, society will remain uninspired. It is back to the books for us-- and, preferably, old ones.<br><br>Avery<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c9192399291060305683 title="comment permalink">5/24/13, 2:38 AM</a><br><br>

Anyway thanks for your kind response. You mentioned about previous green Enactments as promising progress, but I view it as piece-meal-improvement under the current "democratic" political culture, which by definition has to balance and entertain as much vested interests (including greens) as possible. Any "radical" thought promising a rose garden (which in that case may mean radical or fundamentalist green) is ideological and doom to go either route (or a hybrid) that I mentioned. The Russians failed. The Chinese (Chinese Communist Party) is trying with some initial economic success (but with serious environmental and moralistic problems that I shall not deal with here). The fundamental Islams are trying to. The New Age meditators begin to know their limit, the apocalyptic predictions groups also doomed to fail. Fundamental Christians don't even come close to control anything influential. No hope of violent revolution despite gravity of issues (North Korea is an example). My thinking is that there will be future rose garden promises and there will be future despairs - not that I have any clue as to what is "progress" or there is any meaningful meaning of "progress" in our contemporary world.<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c7447818884739651651 title="comment permalink">5/24/13, 9:48 PM</a><br><br>

Under the rule of Sharia law, apostates are to be killed, hence the great incidence of intra-Islamic violence, Shia vs Sunni, Sunni vs Shia, Shia vs Sufi and on and on. Fairly large numbers of Muslims - especially educated Muslims - have abandoned Islamic faith, even though they go through the motions especially in Islamic countries where they could be beheaded if found out.<br><br>Most of the "extremist" and "moderate" Muslims in the West (Europe, UK, US) are of the Wahhabi subset of the Sunni branch of Islam. The extremists style themselves as Salafi, even though they would be regarded as heterodox by Sunnis in the first 400 years of Islam. The Muslims who carried out the Boston Marathon, the firebombings in Sweden, and Woolwich murders are of this Wahhabi subset, as are their imams. What they follow isn't really a religion, it's more of an ideology, and they seek hegemony over populations outside of the traditional Islamic lands now under Sharia law. Here's a rather long explanation of this for those who might be interested: http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/AAlexievWagesofExtremism032011.pdf<br><br>That being said, they are funded largely from two sources - Saudi oil money, and welfare payments from taxpayers in the countries to which they immigrate, although they also get money from the trade in illegal drugs, human trafficking, and Western intelligence agencies - the Afghan Freedom Fighters of the 1980s, enlisted by the US in the fight against the USSR, were Wahhabi/Salafis, as was Osama bin Laden, scion of a wealthy Saudi Arabian family. The Muslim Brotherhood which now runs Egypt is another group of Wahhabis supported by US aid and Saudi oil money, and they have great influence in the US State Department and the UK Foreign Office: http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/3672/muslim-brotherhood-us-government Currently, it appears that the US will come into the Syrian war supporting the Muslim Brotherhood-backed faction in that conflict.<br><br>Now, what will happen when the oil money runs out and the welfare benefits dry up is anyone's question.

There were about 50 tubers in there, so I couldn't walk past them. Plus, I recently discovered that fresh walnuts are a taste sensation compared to the dried variety. When I was very young, dried walnuts were some sort of child abuse for sure. Horrible things. So, a few more walnut trees got bunged into the orchard, even though it will take at least 6 years before they produce nuts. The chooks have even started to lay a few more eggs per day too as they've come off the autumn moult.<br><br>Alright, I've been avoiding it so far, you've got my interest peaked. What is it?

The notion that Europe was a "Christian continent" is a myth. Until a few hundred years ago large parts of today's Spain and Portugal, as well as Sicily, were predominantly Islamic. Today there are European countries where Islam has for a long time been the majority religion, such as Bosnia, Turkey and Albania (although Islam is reportedly shrinking in Albania at the expense of Catholicism). The Maltese, although almost 100% Catholic, direct their prayers to Allah – a legacy of their being situated between cultures.<br><br>I think we don't even need to talk about the mutual influence of Arabian and European culture on each other. European rennaissance would have been impossible without the Latin writings preserved by Arabian scholars, and in the middle ages many scientific concepts, ways of thought and – perhaps most apparent – our numbering system came from Arabia. What we call "Western culture" today is in large parts of Arabic origin, and Arabic culture today is of course also heavily influenced by European concepts. Even religious discourses, e.g. on the nature of God, influenced each other.<br><br>So it's not "European/Christian culture" vs "Arabian/Islamic culture" at all. Rather, we've been two sides of the same coin for a long time. Most people and politicians do recognize this, even if there's often an undercurrent of resentment against immigrants (not only Muslim ones, though – it's more about "they're taking away our low-skilled jobs" than religion). The German president made some waves a few years ago when he stated that Islam was an integral part of Germany, but in the end, most people accepted that he had simply stated a fact.<br><br>Also, while the descendants of Muslim immigrants are still Muslims, they somewhat seem to lose interest in the daily practice of their religion: Imams are already complaining that young people don't go to the mosque any more. Bad influence of European culture, I suppose. :)<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c6944942732963446570 title="comment permalink">5/25/13, 3:34 AM</a><br><br>

I'd add Hesiod's in there as well, as its' ultimate ending is in total barbarity (all instinct, all the time, with no impulse control).<br><br>How we "get to the future" is an interesting guessing game, but I feel that history shows that those who are seriously invested in the business of power and control will use EVERYTHING in their toolkit to maintain it, leading to some very savage outcomes... deserved or undeserved, depending on your moral prism.<br><br>But, downsize we will, desired or no.<br><br>My idea of a "proper" state of humankind is the abandonment of triumphalism is all its' permutations excepting in the area of "fun/entertainment". "Whatever will we DO with our [much downsized] selves?", we cry. I would say, some sort of hybrid of Amer-indian subsistence living combined with the intensive study of the workings of the Cosmos, from the micro to the macro. I don't believe the interactions of all these various "systems" can EVER be completely fathomed by the mind of man, but should keep him well-occupied (busy) until a "big one" winks him out for good and all. I would consider this a good use of that big brain, and a fine replacement for all this acquisitiveness. Acquiring knowledge may be considered a "dangerous" thing to some (especially those interested in maintaining power), but I think it to be a benign "end" in itself.<br>The ultimate religion; respect for and study of Nature and the massive meshing of the gears of our Cosmos and our actual, tiny "place"/"cog" in it. (IOW, perhaps we're here to try and understand it [that anomalous brain and all], not to conquer it. Surrender Dorothy!)<br><br>Of course, we may "do ourselves in" or have it done TO us a'fore that eventuality, but I really can't picture a more "pragmatic" way to inhabit our place in time.

That rings a bell for me.<br><br>The first wave of feminism lasted about ninety years in America and England and ended when its final goal, the vote, was achieved.

Early in Lyndon Johnson's term, it degenerated into a fringe movement whose oppositional ideology made looking for concessions impossible.

William Gibson essentially invented cyberpunk, and some of the genre's core features—technological saturation, human modification, pervasive digitization, and neo-feudalization in the form of international techno-corporations that displace the nation state—seem to be gaining ground fast by virtue of the solutions they can claim to offer for peak oil, global warming, and American decline.<br><br>Google's initiatives aimed at making as much information as possible to as many people as possible are certainly impressive, but there is a good deal of eschatological rhetoric bundled into the package, rhetoric in which enabling networked individual creativity and innovation figures as the solution to all of earth's big problems: The engineer's faith that no problem fails to yield in the presence of enough cleverness and enough data. <br><br>People are increasingly attracted to that vision, and to its more extreme manifestations (Kurzweil's Singularity) as the nation-state continues to disappoint in keeping oil prices low and maintaining American prominence. Consider the pronouncements emanating from the (Google funded) Singularity University that America will soon reclaim its manufacturing predominance by virtue of 3D printing <br><br>http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/9/4315720/white-house-looks-to-3d-printing-with-200-million-plan-for-military. <br><br>People are also increasingly attracted to the promises of human augmentation somehow turning us into our own Deus Ex Machina. <br><br>http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/how-engineering-the-human-body-could-combat-climate-change/253981/) <br><br>As Google, Apple, Amazon, and the other tech giants continue to complain about how far behind the curve of innovation the legislative apparatus of the nation state inevitably leaves us, I think we'll see more and more evidence of a strange shift in the structure of loyalties, as people invest their hopes in the exemplars of techno-utopianism as opposed to a nation-state model that seems prepared to go the way of the dodo.<br><br> In a curious way, it resembles the dynastic structure of medieval Europe, in which great families held disconnected properties over wide areas, and loyalty was predicated on a personal attachment to the dynasty and its fortunes. Perhaps the relationship between techno-giants and their voting shareholders will develop into a curious analogue of that between the medieval king and his great magnates.<br><br>As the realities of peak oil and global warming become more and more obvious, I suspect more and more people will invest their hopes in a technological game-changer, and Gibsonization will continue. The dreams will more likely than not be disappointed, but the structural shifts they will enable may have a very long heritage indeed.<br><br>I've been trying to investigate how the structures of hope around which we erect our societies operate in practice.

But a subject standing at any one point may see herself rising, falling, turning a corner, on a long flat straight-away.<br><br>It may have been here in comments again that someone quoted a Russian: "Optimists believe the future is uncertain; pessimists have enough information to know otherwise."<br><br>Since we're immersed in time, the shape of the future is ultimately unknown, though we can glean clues from the shape of past time.<br><br>What's interesting to me is to break down this apparent dichotomy between Augustinian and Joachimite time. Indeed, I think many people would agree that in many ways agrarian lifestyles are transcendent: not covering the galaxy in 10 billion years transcendent, but in terms of the transcendence of the moment.<br><br>The reasonable path,as will become increasingly evident to people right and left with time, is to cooperate in taking care of our own needs locally; I think that's a bottom line.<br><br>There is also an interesting parallel in our modeling of time and of social organization. At least at the present we're kind of at the top of a pyramid (embedded in a wider wandering). All human organizations are inherently pyramidal in shape, more or less, of varying sizes. And there is, loosely speaking, a pyramidal structure on the world scale, covering economic to cultural life. One thing that bars people from seeing this pyramid for what it is, is that there are pyramids on top of pyramids; like a Christmas tree. So within USA, efforts to help our own poor often just mean exporting the evils we hope to escape. Meanwhile, the entities at the top of the pyramids are not really people at all, but an ideology of profit. We know there are many secrets from the people. But the real conspiracy is what has become a prime belief in a materialistic world: that humans are merely rational animals that maximize self-interest. One of the aids provided by a discussion of the shape of time is to see that something gets carried through the ups and downs, and it's not a material thing.<br><br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c8893365713002050262 title="comment permalink">5/26/13, 9:42 AM</a><br><br>

The GOP's antigovernment ideal isn't really antigovernment, but for progressive decentralization. But if they suddenly gained enough power to sink the ship now, they'd quickly reverse course and protect the status qup anyway, so its symbolic important to keep awake the realization that things won't last, and we have some more time to experiment before the next global crisis. We have some time to think, and to try things. That's a good thing if we don't go back to sleep.<br><br>I found this presentation last week on localized money and it got me thinking more what relocalization can look like:<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNl62LVvr2E<br><br>A insight that came to me is that "debt" is the problem - i.e. who owns our debt? If your debt is in dollars, then you have to find a way to earn dollars to survive. And so the only way a local currency can compete is to help people who DON'T have debt in dollars, and DO have skills and time to give. <br><br>Debt is one way that enslaves people to the dollar, and "retirement" is a second way, a promise that the government or investments can and will support decades of unemployment at the end of life, and so at some point those promises become not credible, and again, a local currency can offer a way of "saving" surplus.<br><br>So however these ideas come out in practice, they are revolutionary because they are divestments from dependence upon a central state for security.<br><br>I don't think they're easy at all, because there's a huge cost to alternative systems, but they can grow up where they make sense and grow faster in crisis times where people have more time than money to spend.<br><br>And for me, the only reason I think people will do the work is because they have the GOP and Dems doing their thing to keep awareness alive, that things can't stand, and we need to be creative to find our future.<br><br>The internet is the strange unexpected progress that really did change everything, and perhaps if Carter's sweaters had won, we'd be running on 300 baud modems and saying good enough, so whatever else is true, there's MONSTROUS creativity activity going on now. And it is too messy for hope, but evolution only happens in the culling process when we are forced to choose a bad future to avoid a worse one.<br><br>Right now I think the best invention might be "security software" that prevents people from internet connectivity except during brief periods of time. Perhaps people with such power will change the world while the rest of us refuse to leave the dreams that come from infinite unlikely possibilities.<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c3692943602988401522 title="comment permalink">5/26/13, 10:26 PM</a><br><br>

Cold facts about our resource, energy, demographic and pollution predicaments are out there for anyone to see. Inability of social systems and individual human beings to adapt to these verifiable physical limitations just shows how we are rationalizing, not actually rational animal species. We see only what we want to see as long as possible. <br><br>To jump from one narrative of mind to next one we need things that offer hope and dignity: ancient Romans did this when they threw away imperial pretensions and big chunk of classical civilization and embraced Christianity as replacement. New faith offered them consolidation and dignity when world around them was reverting into small, dirty and violent place for peasant and landlord alike.<br><br>This is what most peak oil writers forget: people need hope, or they do nothing to steer off from catastrophe. Being poor is standard faith for majority of human race from beginning to end of time, but being poor with pride and dignity intact is something else from being poor like suffering animal, with no moral spine or pride.<br><br>It is nice to see that you are trying to offer people some new ways to see world around. Materialism and current cultural trends have all but destroyed ability of Westerner to feel pride without material benefits attached.<br><br>They remember no longer, unlike their Afghan adversaries for example, that there are more important things in life than material abundance. Faith is stronger armor than money. That is reason why your country is destined to lose its current wars; you have no faith left as an nation to win enemies like tribes of Central Asia, illuminated by warrior's honour and pride.<br><br>This ecotechnic vision of yours is one path available. It is many ways tempting one, and it has casted dose of optimism into me at least. I am still not sure if you are counting all variables into picture you are drawing. <br><br>What you Americans tend to ignore is strong tendency among human race to splinter into small ethnic tribes as soon as it is possible. It happens even in high-tech countries when they enter period of extended decay and chaos. Same people who earlier thought their ethnicity has mostly trivial value have met their neigbor with Kalashnikov in hand and bad intentions in mind on practically all modern battlefields. It takes just smallest of disturbances with running of overcomplex logistical structure known as modern state and tribalism is back from the dead. Anyone who has seen war zones from 90's onwards can confirm that modern conflict has brought all the horrors accompanied to irregular troops back from the grave, and that trend is only escalating with no reverse trend in sight. I am not sure if your vision has incorporated that rising tide of violence into it. That phase must be lived through in many modern countries, especially in the West, before more serene, calm days can be returned. That fact changes many things you should do to make your family safe in forthcoming Dark Ages. If some hippie song talking about San Francisco and flowers was theme music for Baby Boomer generation, something like below shall be theme music of current babies:<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pEFoE28SDQ<br><br>Hail the divine kingship and all that.<br><br>@Chris: Yep, you have to be one from rank-and-file of working class of West to truly understand deepness of betrayal that was served to us from golden plate. Political representatives who had from late 19th century onwards stood for unions and manual workers of the West managed to do one of biggest coat-turnings of history... All this globalism and multiculturalism of later decades has erased position of their old constituency, so political loyalties are on grand sale right now through Western world...

One where many people pick and choose the bits they want from the catalogue and ignore the rest. Out here in the bush, sustainability is being forced upon many people, largely for economic reasons. People grow their own food, because they have to. People go to town once a week, because it costs real money to get there. Mind you, not many people wear jeans with as many patches as mine (to the point where I’ve been asked where I got them by tourists who like the idea of spending five hundred bucks to look poor) and I suspect that this is because the skills to make the repairs have been lost.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Les<br><br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c6188056405337313394 title="comment permalink">5/28/13, 4:15 AM</a><br><br>

The trends of which you speak were in full swing as early as the '20s and '30s.<br><br>I was born in 1942, and thus was already a teenager during most of the fifties. I lived in California, specifically in the San Francisco Bay Area. Many things were as true then as they are now: there were no-go areas (e.g., all of Emeryville, dangerous even for a male in a locked car), gangs that challenged police power, corrupt and violent police who sometimes simply killed inconvenient people without reference to the law, large-scale criminal enterprises, ethnic violence and riots, etc. My father's mother was the bookkeeper for one of these criminal enterprises during the '20s and early '30s, and she also ran her boss's payroll every week -- including pay for his staff of thugs and enforcers. Family values still got lip service, but weren't practiced by very many people -- certainly not by my own parents' families. <br><br>So not much has changed, if I look at these things from my 70-year perspective. Yet there are rather more of all these things now than back then. <br><br>The city in which I actually lived during the '50s was Berkeley, which was comparatively an oasis in the middle of all these things. This was not because of the quality of its inhabitants, but because of the uncommon control the city's police department exerted over all facets of life, and especially the uncommon level of its surveillance of the populace. Berkeley's legendary first chief of police, a German-American named August "Gus" Vollmer (1876-1955) had been a US Marine during the Spanish-American War. He systematically studied the most advanced and rigorous German advances in police work and surveillance of the populace, and he applied them with uncommon skill and intelligence to the task of policing Berkeley. <br><br>(It is impossible to understand what happened in Berkeley during the '60s and '70s without knowing what Chief Vollmer's Berkeley was like in the '40s and '50s. One significant datum was that all boys age 10-12 in elementary school had a mandatory hour of military drill every week under the command of a uniformed police officer.) <br><br>But the oasis of calm in Berkeley was only relative, and the efforts and means that were used to maintain it led to a crisis soon after Chief Vollmer ceased to exert influence over the police department. (Suffering from Parkinson's disease, he took his own life in 1955.) <br><br>Already during the '50s, such pillars of family values as Freemasonry had begun to lose their influence. By the time I was a teenager, not very many young males were entering the Freemasonic "side organization" for boys (The Order of DeMolay). It was already pretty clear which way the culture was tending . . .<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c3289822151820572223 title="comment permalink">5/28/13, 11:14 AM</a><br><br>

You have lived quite a different life there in the New World compared to my grandparents! This just reassures my feeling that USA has very different soul compared to many European countries. Fragmented social landscape has not been fact of life here before; only deep division in the past has been between working class and bourgeois. <br><br>When results of peak cheap oil really hit through haphazard firewalls build in haste, one obvious problem for the long run is this: real-life, working social models for semi-industrial societies are very different from all current models of developed countries. <br><br>There must be reason why mainly agrarian or pastoral societies have been so uniform in their basic structure. I don't believe at all that we can keep modern moral imperatives after reverting back to world powered largely (but not exclusively) by muscle, wind and sun. <br><br>This ecotechnic model is tempting one because it offers one theoretical model how to blend new and old together. Even then, I believe that history is the best oracle; if aristocratic monarchism or confined "city state" republicanism have been almost invariably models of political organisation with pre-industrial societies, well... They probably make a comeback after this s**tstorm has passed. <br><br>Your country, Robert, is fascinating because it is that exception which confirms the rule. It was ruled with consent of quite wide constituency from day one, before true industrialism. Those with voting right in the beginning were motley group when compared to voters of almost xenophobic Mediterranean republics of Antiquity and Middle Ages. French tried to do same after you, but failed miserably. "Emperor Bonaparte" does not sound very democratic, eh..?<br><br>One tragedy of current USA is that you actually have very much to be proud of, and many over there does not seem to get this. It is not this semi-empire of yours to be proud of, but strong values which formed foundation of your nation. Many of those values are quite alien for me personally, but I don't understand why people with such a history indulge in self-shaming. Empires come and go, but basic values of civilization lay deeper. You just have to stop making them somekind universal rule; you are actually the exception from universal rule, if there is one to speak of. <br><br>I personally respect your country's foundations - behind the comfortable distance :).<br><br>Interesting life story, thanks for sharing it with us.<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c1610108895802875777 title="comment permalink">5/29/13, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

I think, however, the real architect of all the confrontations in Berkeley was Edwin J. Meese III, who was an attorney in the office of the Attorney General for Alameda County, 1958-1967. Meese had been very badly bruised in 1960 over his efforts to prosecute the people who protested at the House Unamerican Activities Committee meeting in San Francisco in 1960. I think he had been smarting for vengeance on the whole Berkeley activist community, and he got his chance in the later 1960s. <br><br>Some of my high-school classmates were among those arrested during what was an extremely polite and peaceful and well-mannered protest (in suits and ties!) by today's standards, so I heard a good deal about it at the time. Meese publicly proposed a slate of felony charges against the protesters that would have sent my friends to prison for decades, maybe for life, for their role in this protest. His proposal was such an overreaction that many influential people (some of whose children were among the arrested) came down very hard on him behind the scenes, and in the end all the legal issues were resolved quietly. <br><br>But in 1967 Meese went on to join Regan's staff, and in 1967 he became Regan's chief of staff. Regan already seemed to many California voters to be half-witted even then, when he was Governor, and those of us who thought that also suspected that it was his staff (esp. Meese) and his wife who formulated all his policies, and who wrote the actor's scripts that he could follow during his public appearances. <br><br>Meese stayed with Regan all through his Presidency and beyond, and seems still to be one of the most powerful and influential men behind the throne in Republican and Conservative circles. But ever since the bruising he took in 1960, he has always kept a very low profile, and so his role has been largely overlooked by historians and popular chroniclers.<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c3465319681264180242 title="comment permalink">5/29/13, 12:04 PM</a><br><br>

Benjamin Franklin admired the Iroquois Confederacy and was influenced by their governing system<br><br><br>I have partial American Indian ancestry, Cherokee to be exact, a cousin tribe of the Iroquois and tribal life of the Cherokee was not as you expect. Women owned the land they farmed and had their own tribal counsel, it was they who decided if the tribe went to war. If a woman felt an enemy had done her great damage and she had no male family members left alive she could petition the men's tribal counsel to go on the war trail with the men. If she could keep up with the men and all the male counsel members agreed she was allowed to join a war party to avenge her family honor.<br><br><br>That is an example of successful social justice in what most people would call primitive living conditions.

Kumarappa but I am familiar with Gandhi's writings.<br> <br>Gandhi was a staunch conservative, he sought to fight untouchability within the boundaries of Hinduism as they existed when he lived, which is why he selectively used his own interpretation of the scriptures to show that the dalits were really "Harijan" or "Children of God". In a similar fashion he was horrified by western materialism and sought to fight it by invoking the romanticism of a village life.<br><br>Contrast this with the other great thinker and low caste hero Dr BR Ambedkar who described villages as black holes of ignorance and dogma.<br><br>I am more inclined to side with Dr BR Ambedkar here, I see the same tinges of elitism in people who romanticize village life that we can see in environmentalists who have never endured the daily privations of a truly sustainable lifestyle. Gandhi for all the hardships he endured was really privileged in an Indian sense, he never had to go through the daily rituals of discrimination and neglect that people of lower caste do, hence his romanticism.<br>In fact his latent nationalism was triggered when he was meted out similar discrimination that lower caste people endure everyday by the Britishers!<br><br>I don't know of a single dalit (low caste) intellectual who idolizes village life. They detest it with a vengeance and view the cities as forces of freedom and embrace it openly.<br><br>To your question of whether it was a mistake or not. It's hard to tell, we cannot rewind the clock back and see which strategy would have worked out better. One thing I do know is that most villagers do not want to live in villages provided they can eke out a decent living in the cities.<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c6827624857579478828 title="comment permalink">5/29/13, 9:29 PM</a><br><br>

Kumarappa did not approve of the unnecessary poverty either. So I am confused about which part of village life you think that Gandhi romanticized. Experiencing discrimination himself, he was able to better understand it, not romanticize it. He and Kumarappa thought that science and technology could better the life of villagers, but not by shifting production to big urban factories, rather by lightening the load of local craft industries. Of course you can't wind back the clock, but you could try a different tactic, one that wise men have promoted for a long time, not just your two countrymen.<br><br>Can you back up your claim that most villagers would rather live in cities? I could imagine it may have been true, but after being exposed to the reality of city slums, as opposed to the romantic ideal of comfortable western life that many villagers were seduced by and that is simply not possible for the majority, do they still feel that way?<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c1756744728176080644 title="comment permalink">5/30/13, 10:46 AM</a><br><br>

So of course villagers who are in a village choose the city. It's like Buchenwald inmates choosing Auschwitz. The question I have is whether most of the villagers who are in the city slums, or their grandparents would choose to live in the slums rather than the villages the way they were before industrialization and urbanization, or the way they could have become if Kumarappa's programme had been followed.<br><br>Did Gandhi read National Geographic? My idea is based on post-industrial villages like The Possibility Alliance and Earthaven, but I admit there is also the romantic aspect from movies such as Lord of the Rings, or Fiddler on the Roof. I think that that romantic ideal is actually based on a racial memory, which is why it appeals to so many people on a deep psychological level.<br><br><a href=the-politics-of-times-shape.html#c8179897565232632445 title="comment permalink">6/2/13, 10:22 AM</a><br><br>
