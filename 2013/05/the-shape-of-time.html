<div dir=ltr style="text-align: left">
Trying to have a conversation about the issues central to this sequence of posts, to make use of an apt if familiar metaphor, is rather like trying to discuss the nature of water with fish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ideas that play the largest part in shaping our experience of the world and of ourselves are so deeply woven into the act of perception itself that we rarely if ever notice them until we run face first into their limits. <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even suggesting that there are ideas woven into the act of perception, for that matter, gets a blank look much more often than not. Most people, most of the time, think and act as though the things that they experience with their senses and sort with their thoughts are objective realities “out there,” and pay no attention to the generations of careful research that’s shown that what we perceive is a cooperative project in which external stimuli, the biologically defined structures of our sense organs and nervous systems, and the culturally and individually defined contents of our minds all have roles to play. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s good reason for that lack of awareness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Patterns of thinking, like patterns of action, are most efficient when they don’t require conscious attention. Just as you can’t really become skilled at playing a musical instrument until you no longer have to consciously move every finger into position on the keys or strings, you can’t really use a way of thinking about the world until it slips below the surface of the mind and starts to structure how you experience other things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Pay attention to the way your mind works when you wake in dim light in an unfamiliar room, and the vague shapes around you take time to turn into recognizable furniture, and you’ll get a sense of the way this affects your awareness of the world; learn some cognitive skill such as plant identification, and notice the shifts in perception as foliage changes from a vague green blur to a galaxy of legible patterns, and you’ll get a sense of the same process from a different angle. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty with this otherwise helpful process comes when the unnoticed ideas you’re using to frame your experience of the world no longer tell you the things you most need to know. Wilderness tracker Tom Brown Jr. tells a story in one of his books about a group of students who were learning plant identification, and were out with Brown on a herb walk. Brown stopped them at one point along the trail, pointed to a plant, and said, “What do you see?” The students all correctly named the plant. “Get closer and take another look,” Brown said. The students did so, and confirmed that it was, in fact, the plant they’d named. After several repetitions, they were almost on top of the plant, and it wasn’t until then that the rabbit that was nibbling on the plant leaves bounded away, startling the students. They had been paying so much attention to plants that they hadn’t seen the rabbit at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same thing happens in far less innocuous ways when the unnoticed ideas aren’t simply the product of a weekend workshop’s focus, but provide basic frameworks for the experiences and the thinking of an entire culture. The cognitive framing that I called the shape of time in last week’s post is a case in point. Most people, most of the time, don’t notice that all their thinking about past, present and future is shaped by some set of unnoticed assumptions about time and history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The assumptions in question usually come out of some fusion of culturally valued narratives and recent experience—not a bad idea, all things considered, unless events begin to move in ways that a fusion of culturally valued narratives and recent experience no longer explain. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s easiest to understand this in practice by taking an example that’s as different as possible from the common habits of thinking today; fortunately, the history of ideas has no shortage of those. The one I want to introduce here comes to us courtesy of Hesiod, one of the very first ancient Greek poets whose works still survive. He lived in the eighth century BCE in the harsh if beautiful hill country of Boeotia, halfway down the eastern side of the Greek peninsula. That we know of, he wrote two major poems,
<i>The Origin of the Gods</i> and <i>Works and Days</i>, and the latter of these sketches out a vision of the shape of time that was to have a great deal of influence long after Hesiod’s day. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a vision of relentless decline. For Hesiod, the zenith of human happiness lay in the distant past, in the Golden Age when the old wise god Kronos ruled and the earth produced crops without human labor. Since then, age after age, it’s been all downhill:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the Silver Age of folly and ignorance, the Bronze Age of merciless warriors, the Age of Heroes immediately before Hesiod’s time, and finally the bitter Iron Age when misery and hard labor are humanity’s lot. In his vision, it’s not going to get any better, either: eventually the last frail scraps of goodness will go whistling down the wind, infants will be born with their hair already gray.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then Zeus will destroy the humanity of the Iron Age as he destroyed the inhabitants of the previous four ages, and the story ends. If the Golden Age was scheduled to return after that, Hesiod doesn’t mention it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To some extent Hesiod’s model is the human life cycle, seen from the perspective of an old man looking back on life in a hard age: happiness in infancy, folly in childhood, war and passion in adolescence, hard productive labor in adulthood, and finally the miseries of old age and death. Still, there’s more to it than that, because Hesiod’s vision of the shape of time was a tolerably good reflection of the history that part of the world had experienced in the centuries just before he lived. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Two thousand years before Hesiod, prehistoric Greece had been the home of a lively assortment of village cultures making the slow transition from polished stone tools to bronze. On that foundation more complex societies rose, borrowing heavily from contemporary high cultures in the Middle East, and culminating in the monumental architecture and literate palace bureaucracies of the Mycenean age. Those of my readers who have some sense of the rhythms of history will already know what followed: too much clearcutting and intensive farming of the fragile Greek soils, made worse by the importation of farming methods better suited to flat Mesopotamian valleys than easily eroded Greek hills, triggered an ecological crisis; most of the topsoil of Mycenean Greece ended up at the bottom of the Aegean Sea, where it can still be found in core samples; warfare, migration, and population collapse followed in the usual manner, as Mycenean society stumbled down the curve of its own Long Descent. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the past that defined Hesiod’s vision of the present and the future. Those of my readers who are up for a challenge might consider trying, for a few moments, to fit their minds around that vision—to try to sense what it would have been like to see history as a long and bitter descent, and to imagine that view of things not as an interesting speculation or a theory, but simply as the way things are, the way they have always been and will always be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Think about the way the world would look to you if humanity’s best years were in the distant past, the future held nothing but a long trajectory of decline ending in extinction, and your chances of relative happiness depended on being smart, tough, and intensely aware of the downside risks in every choice you made. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Hope is not a virtue in such a world. Whether or not Hesiod invented the story of Pandora’s box, he’s the source from which every later version derives, but there’s a detail you’ll find in modern versions of the tale that is not in his account. The usual version these days is that when all the plagues and curses in the box flew out to afflict humanity, Hope remained behind as a kind of consolation prize. In Hesiod, it’s not a consolation prize, it’s the nastiest of the curses that Zeus put in the box, the enticing delusion that things will get better when they won’t. Early Greek poets liked to use fixed adjective-noun pairs—the rosy-fingered dawn, the wine-dark sea, and so on; when the word “hope” appears in ancient Greek poetry, the adjective normally assigned to it was “blind.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the world in which Hesiod lived. The point that too many of his modern interpreters don’t grasp is that his attitude, and the practical implications of that attitude which filled the verses of
<i>Works and Days</i>—distrust the new, rely on traditional wisdom, aim for modest goals, keep a year’s supply of grain on hand so you don’t starve—were better suited to his world than, for example, our faith in the limitless potential of the future would have been. In an impoverished tribal society scrabbling for survival amid the ruins of a far more complex culture and the long-term impacts of ecological collapse, accepting the reality of decline and the likelihood of further trouble to come was a better strategy than any of the alternatives; in the language of evolutionary ecology, it was adaptive. It’s unlikely to be an accident that visions of time like Hesiod’s are very common in the hard times that follow the collapse of major civilizations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course Hesiod’s bleak vision is far from the only alternative to the vision of progress that defines the shape of time to most people in today’s industrial world. For a third alternative, consider the distinctive way of thinking about time that’s common to a great many tribal societies around the world. In this vision of the shape of time, everything important took place <i>in illo tempore</i>—in the Dreamtime, as the Australian aboriginal term has it, the time when animals lived and spoke like people and the powers who defined the cosmos traced out the patterns that humanity would follow ever after.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In this way of thinking about time, all of the history that mattered happened long ago, and is chronicled in the mythic narratives that the elders recite to children so that they will know the right way to live. Each event since then, whether it’s part of the cycle of the year, the cycle of a human life, or what have you, simply reiterates and reflects some feature of that original time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I have no idea if this is still the case, but when I was growing up, there were any number of children’s novels set in “primitive societies”—that is, cultures that experienced time in the way I’ve just outlined—which focused obsessively on some imaginary individualist who turned his (or, very rarely, her) back on tribal custom via one triumphant innovation after another. Those stories were very flattering to the sensibilities of readers in modern industrial cultures, to be sure, but they missed nearly everything relevant to the tribal cultures in question. By the time a society following a hunter-gatherer or village horticulture ecology has inhabited a given bioregion for a few thousand years, it’s a safe bet that the people in that culture will have tried all the available options, figured out which ones work and which ones don’t, and enshrined that hard-won knowledge in stories, customs, and taboos, the normal technologies for passing knowledge down through the generations in societies that don’t have writing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In such a context, innovation is rarely a good idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The resource base that would be necessary to deal with subsistence failure or ecological instability simply isn’t available—the ability to store food over the long term doesn’t come in until the invention of grain agriculture, so nothing as substantial as Hesiod’s year of stockpiled grain stands between a hunter-gatherer or village horticultural society and starvation. The innovator who introduces the bow and arrow to a people used to hunting with spears thus might be dooming them to starve to death when the new technology proves too successful at killing game, and wipes out the herds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In that ecological setting, an understanding of time that wards off such potentially lethal possibilities is adaptive.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s look at another example, drawn from among the cyclical cosmologies that emerge like clockwork in literate urban civilizations, once they’re past their adolescence and start paying attention to the traces of earlier civilizations around them. There are dozens of such cosmologies, some of which have been discussed at length in these essays; the example I have in mind this time around, though, is the traditional Chinese version, which guided historical thought in China from archaic times straight through to the 20th century. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The basic theory of the Chinese science of time is that events are guided by many different cycles, some faster and some slower, some influencing one dimension of human life and some shaping another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The cycle of the seasons was one of these; the cycle of human life was another; the cycle of the rise and fall of dynasties was a third; there were many more, each with its own period and typical sequence of events. Just as no two years had exactly the same weather on exactly the same days, no two repetitions of any other cycle were identical, but common patterns allowed the events of one repetition to be more or less predicted by a sufficiently broad knowledge of earlier examples.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On a much broader scale, all cycles of every kind could be understood as expressions of a single abstract pattern of cyclic change, which was explored in the classic Chinese textbook of time theory, the I Ching—in English, the Book of Change. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Most people in the western world who are familiar with the I Ching at all think of it as a fortunetelling book, full of obscure oracles accessed by flipping Chinese coins or, for the cognoscenti, sorting bundles of yarrow stalks. Back in the day, that was the kindergarten level of I Ching practice. The masters of the Book of Change recognized that each of the 64 hexagrams was an abstract representation of a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>particular stage in the unfolding of a cyclic pattern; each hexagram could turn into any other hexagram under the right conditions; and the goal of study was to be able to contemplate any given sequence of events, identify what pattern was in process just then, figure out where it was going next, and get there first. This wasn’t a purely philosophical pursuit by any means—many Chinese martial arts rely on the I Ching as a basis for strategy, and “getting there first” in this case involves bringing a fist or a foot up hard against the opponent’s vulnerable spots. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Like the other shapes of time we’ve discussed so far, cyclical cosmologies are highly adaptive in their own historical context. They emerge, as I’ve already suggested, in mature literate civilizations that have access to the records and ruins of older societies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whether it’s Chinese scholars pondering the rise and fall of dynasties, Chaldean priests mulling over the fates of the kingdoms of the Mesopotamian plain, Roman Stoics sketching out the rhythms in which Greek city-states flourished and fell, or early 20th century European historians recognizing familiar patterns in the historical events of their own time,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>students of the cycles of history recognize that the past has lessons to offer the present, and use a sense of cyclic change to guide their efforts to understand those lessons and put them to work. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Does that make cyclical cosmologies more accurate than the others we’ve just considered?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Is the circle the true shape of time?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s hard to see any way in which those questions could mean anything. What I’ve called the shape of time is an abstraction, a convenient model that sums up the way that events seem to unfold from the standpoint of particular people in a particular historical situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Abstractions of this kind are tools, not truths—you might as well ask if a hammer is factually accurate. It’s nonetheless true that different tools are better suited, more adaptive, to different situations. If you live in a society struggling to endure in the wake of cultural and ecological collapse, Hesiod’s vision may be your best bet; if you live in a society that has a stable relationship with its bioregion but very few resources on which to fall back in time of trouble, the Dreamtime cosmology will likely be a better choice; if you live in a society that has a literate historical tradition, and want to use that resource to help you duck some of the troubles that overwhelmed earlier societies, the cyclical approach is the tool you need. Other situations have other tools better suited to them—the handful of shapes of time I’ve outlined here are only a few of the many options that have been tried, with more or less success, over the span of recorded history. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the others is of particular importance to our broader theme.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you happen to live in a society that has stumbled across an energy source of unparalleled abundance and concentration, a source so rich that the major economic challenge faced over the course of three centuries is that of finding enough ways to use it to replace human muscle power and the other, far more limited energy sources of less lavishly supplied eras, then a vision of time as endless progress is going to be your most adaptive choice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s arguably the main reason why belief in progress has become so deeply entrenched in the collective imagination of the industrial world:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>for more than three hundred years, much more often than not, it worked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>During that era, those people, companies, and nations that gambled on progress by and large did much better than those that bet their money and other resources on stasis or decline.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the fine print says, though, past performance is no guarantee of future results, and a shape of time that was highly adaptive to some particular set of historical conditions can become maladaptive when the conditions suddenly change. Ancient Greece went through such a shift, beginning a century or so after Hesiod’s time, as the reopening of trade routes closed since Mycenae’s fall made it profitable for Greek farmers to turn hillside acreage over to olive orchards and vineyards for the export trade. By the beginning of the sixth century, as Greek wine and oil flooded markets across the eastern Mediterranean and brought a corresponding flood of hard currency and imported goods back home, Hesiod’s harsh but functional views stopped being relevant, though it was many years more before that lack of relevance was really processed by the Greeks. Another millennium passed before the old pattern repeated itself, and the civilization of classical Greece stumbled down the curve of decline and fall toward a dark age that Hesiod would have recognized at once. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The central theme of this blog, in turn, is that the same sort of transformation is happening in our own time, but in the other direction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The shape of time that governs nearly all contemporary thinking in the industrial world, the vision of perpetual progress, was adaptive back when ever more abundant energy supplies were being extracted out of mines and wells and poured into the project of limitless industrial expansion. The end of the age of cheap abundant energy, though, makes that shape of time hopelessly maladaptive, and a galaxy of assumptions and ideas founded on faith in progress are thus well past their pull date. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times">Since most people in the modern industrial world aren’t even aware of the role that faith in progress plays in their thinking, their chances of adapting to the end of progress are not good—and certain habits of thought the civil religion of progress has inherited from older theist religions make the necessary adaptations even harder than they have to be. We’ll discuss those next week.</span></span><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

One of the things I read was the Transition Handbook by Rob Hopkins. I sailed though the chapters on climate change, energey depletion, the problems facing the industrial world and the need for action, and it all seemed to make a lot of sense.<br><br>I then got on the the "hearts and minds" chapter, about visualising the positive future that could arise if the right action was taken. This chapter included fictitious newspaper pages full of happy-ending stories and smiling children. I know the point of it was trigger action by inspiring people rather than just frightening them, but I found it a complete and utter turn-off.<br><br>I find it difficult to explain why in so many words, or put my finger on it. Maybe I just smelt a rat - it was a deep-down feeling that this is not how it's going to be, the reality will be much more complicated, and I recoiled against it (even though I'd had similar hopes myself prior to this!)<br><br>In the light of this week's post, perhaps my reaction was just a gut feeling that dreaming of a rosy future is really not a good idea at this point. I'm aware of your reservations about the Transition Movement, but I'm just wondering if you have any further psychological insight on this particular point?<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c5090158252637085190 title="comment permalink">5/2/13, 4:05 AM</a><br><br>

I agree with what Stonymeadow says. Further, if you look as well at the way we're incredulous, patronising, about works done in ancient time, e.g. Stonehenge, the pyramids ("They're so clever! How did they do this?" etc) it's the same.<br>I've been to several of the caves in France and Spain where there is ancient art. And you know? It's sophisticated. I certainly couldn't do it, and I can draw and paint reasonably well. When you think about it, why on earth would anybody want to show the work of "average" craftsmen or women. I went to the British Museum a month or two ago and say the "Ice Age Art" exhibition of prehistoric sculptures, engravings, displayed with modern pieces (Picasso). You couldn't see too much difference. <br>It doesn't really fit with our idea of progress, of us being the best there's ever been, so we just continue to smile knowingly at it.<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c9041614672894059447 title="comment permalink">5/2/13, 4:10 AM</a><br><br>

As you say, it is a huge and largely unconscious filter. And it is quite addictive - looking back at the arc of industrial history since the 1970s you can discern a kind of massive huge primal scream of rejection of the resource limits that were becoming clear about that time. And so now we'll all be kicked out of our unconscious habits much more painfully than if we'd all decided voluntarily to wake up. <br><br>But I have to believe on a personal level for many people that this faith in the American Dream view of progress is starting to crack now, or has already cracked, especially if you are living in the rust belt or a smaller town in rural area of the US. If you are a long-time resident of Detroit, for example, you are probably adjusting your relationship to hope in a better material future about now. <br><br>But we still need hope on a personal level, or at least a motivation for happiness. I do find a lot of hope in the idea and practice of a simpler life as being more deeply rewarding. Or at the very least just perfectly adequate and enjoyable. And dealing with reality as it is is also very grounding and satisfying.

Just one current (very minor) example would be the furor over the NYC law curtailing large soft drinks. Maybe someone has the right to drink all the soda they want, but society is running out of money to pay for their diabetic care. Since people no longer act on their own to protect the commons, it must often be legislated (though I realize this is not going to help much in the long run either).<br><br>Along the lines of the costs of "Progress" to society, I picked up an early 70s essay reader,<i> Economics of the Environment</i> [1972, W. W. Norton]at a garage sale recently. It's almost depressing how many good ideas were floating around 40 years ago. I'm looking forward to getting a copy of E.J.

The WSJ had a negative article on fracking, which might have been a first for them. The writer (Liam Denning) estimates that Hess Oil spent about $1,140 million for leases and drilling in the Texas Eagle Ford shale, received about $100 million in cash from the oil/gas extracted, and then sold out their position for $265 million resulting in a loss of $775 million or 68% of their investment.<br><br>However, as the title of the article is Hess Shows That Timing Really is Everything with Shale, the article implies that poor execution was the reason for the failure of the project, not that the concept itself is of dubious merit.<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c269768159573221815 title="comment permalink">5/2/13, 6:27 AM</a><br><br>

On the downslope the same is true, though the new religion is the anti-religion of earlier days. At the crest of the wave, though, where we are now, seems to be an interesting time for the shape of time. At this crest we look around and notice so many other times when peoples have crested other waves, only to return to the troughs again, as we will. <br><br>The meme seems to be spreading, though, about the adaptive shape of time. I've read several stories of people in the US lowering expectations for material wealth, leaning more in Hesiod's direction than Jiminy Cricket's, and my personal interactions mirror the same. The tough part seems to be getting over the sense that it's some kind of betrayal to believe in the anti-religion of Progress's vision of time, rather than the escape-valve of apocalypse. <br><br>In my own mind, the Golden Age came for my parents' generation of baby boomers. My father taught high school for 40 years in the same Rust Belt city, and he well remembers the days when teenagers would graduate and walk right into a good middle-class job making more money than he did in any of a dozen factories across town, buy a house, get married, and start saving up for a little cabin on a lake up north to take the kids fishing on vacations. All of that is long gone now, and the changes in mind wrought by those changes in opportunity and landscape are a major reason why I agree that the future of America is happening today in places where Progress has already been stripped of its valuable materials and shipped to China for recycling.<br><br>Thanks for the interesting fodder for reflection, JMG, and I'm looking forward to next week's installment.<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c2173051350942320786 title="comment permalink">5/2/13, 7:19 AM</a><br><br>

They called them something like "Skraeling". They were the people of the Canadian/Alaskan far north before the arrival of the Eskimo. The Eskimo were much more aggressive than the Dorset, and supplanted them except for small cul de sacs, until the remnants were eventually done in by European disease much much later.

I also very much look forward to your treatment of theistic religion’s influence on these same concepts next week. Great stuff!<br><br>I find myself teaching this material from time to time (and intend to borrow from your presentation, with credit of course!). When I do so I cover the same forms you have mentioned, though often already conflated with theistic influences (I might change that, but we’ll see what you do next week!). I think this is a bit of a tangent to your main argument, but there is a third form I treat and I wonder if you think it is a useful addition and if you have any ideas about its presentation. So in addition to “linear” forms of time (progressive and regressive), the “cyclical” form, I also talk about time as “point” to refer to the more difficult and often esoteric presentations of time by some philosophers. Zarathustra’s compression of time into the moment is a good example, so also the dissolution of time in Taoist and some Zen writings, and to some degree in the Platonic dialogues, perhaps also Rousseau’s Reveries. This form of time has limited social or political value, hence probably remains tangential to your argument, but as I said, I am interested in your thoughts here.<br><br>Many thanks for your generosity!<br><br>-p<br><br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c1586653431739409555 title="comment permalink">5/2/13, 7:58 AM</a><br><br>

The believers in progress see an exponential uptrend. The peak resource analysts see a gaussian curve. The students of history favor sine curves, with repeated peaks and valleys. Anthropologist Diamond sees a sawtooth curve with repeated ascents and sudden collapses. If one wants to take a longer view than human history gives us then we have to account for periodic meteor impacts on the earth which make evolution look like the kind of curve that believers in progress favor, only that when the meteor hits, progress is wiped out and gets to start again from a reduced field of genetic resources.<br>Given that what most of us know best is what we experienced in our own lifetimes, deciding what sort of curve best fits reality depends on whether we have spent most of our lives on an up slope or a down slope. <br>Our present predicament seems to be that our culture can't decide whether we are on a temporary or more long-term down slope. In the political arena, the argument translates into whether we should spend our resources trying to bring the upslope back or whether we should try to figure out how to make the down slope less painful. Actually, at the mainstream level there isn't even any discussion.

When I was a Peace Corps Volunteer, one of the hardest things for us to adjust to was the rigid ideas of what place/role there was for each person in that society. If you were a mother, you were home raising children, cooking and cleaning. There was no discussion about how women could do the work of men, probably better, and men would chip in to do work at home.

The energy crisis of the early ‘70s had a profound impact on my outlook, as I sense it did yours. I believe we are nearly contemporaries (I was born in ’64), so at a very early age I was conscious of decline. I looked backwards towards an ideal (not to say golden) era that lay in the pre-WW2 past, when things were better by virtue of being more authentic. I later understood that was my way of rejecting the suburban lifestyle and all that went with it. I did not climb aboard the back-to-the-land bandwagon, though tempted, nor did I ever buy into the techno-wonder gadget-obsessed culture that seems to prevail today. We are living what can be described as a sustainable urban homesteading lifestyle, along the lines of The Integral Urban House (again from the ‘70s). I always assessed any situation from the standpoint of energy scarcity, wondering how a particular project/place/structure would fare when the electricity was gone or the oil ran out, well before I ever heard of peak oil, which was in the ’98 SciAm Campbell article. I can report that it is entirely possible to exist in contemporary society while maintaining these views. It’s a contrarian outlook, but the notion that today is better than tomorrow, and things are as good as they ever will be materially speaking, is actually quite liberating. Such an approach is critical to living deliberately, that is, in the moment, which doesn’t necessarily imply lawless abandon (as in Defoe’s ‘Account of the Plague Years). Living with less by design isn’t as difficult as it sounds once you embrace the fact that contraction is the reality, not expansion, so the only choice is to take Thoreau’s approach and choose to be rich by making one’s wants few (to paraphrase Emerson).<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c5582323945646342417 title="comment permalink">5/2/13, 10:42 AM</a><br><br>

What I am wondering about is what happens to a society when its viewpoint of the shape of time is in flux? Suppose, for example, that youth are growing up in an environment in which the shape of time suggests a Hesiodian decline. When they were children, things seemed to be abundant, but now they and their age mates are all struggling and it doesn't look as if things will get any better. Meanwhile their parents and grandparents grew up at a time when progress seemed to be endless and still act as if it is, or at least it should be. It seems like a recipe for intergenerational conflict.<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c7729644542252858385 title="comment permalink">5/2/13, 12:42 PM</a><br><br>

That fella from Bronze Age thought exactly as I do. There is no new things under the sun... Later part of my sentence of course represents cyclical thinking, so it must be possible to believe in cyclical decline also :).<br><br>Creation myth around I Ching is rich and intertwined to actual book. Immoderate emperor Jou-Sin using mandate of heaven to indulge in decadence, to be replaced by minister of West, Wu of Zhou... There is plenty of drama and soap opera moral teachings surrounding birth of that book. Personally I think that paired trigrams with their changing lines are vague enough to offer consolidation in widest possible variety of situations... True recipe for best seller :).<br><br>Person using pen name "morenewyorknews" gave good point reminding how Soviet manufacturing know-how declined after unraveling of logistical networks. Soviet organizations always had hidden agenda of autarchy on their roster, because allocation of resources was made not by prize signals but political decisions, and getting enough resources outside crucial heavy industry was therefore chaotic process, dependent on grace and patronage of standing members of Central Comittee/Gosplan/Orgburo/Politburo, you name it. Pont being, they tried to be as self-reliant as possible, unlike manufacturers in the West. Still, during decade of chaos tons of silent knowledge was lost, and they actually had to bought it back from places like Finland after oil-fueled economy kickstarted mighty but rusty engines again. You can get the impression what it was like by watching news reels (I assume there are some floating around) about gargantuan skeletons of mighty plants stretching from misty horizon to misty horizon, and population experiencing demographic crash scavenging all they can... It was like being inside some German expressionist film from 20s. After watching some low-quality internet videos about that urban decay, take a minute to remember that West is no different, it was no sure winner in Cold War either, and wisdom of Hesiod hits home run.<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c8963199924773976067 title="comment permalink">5/2/13, 12:42 PM</a><br><br>

Chop wood and carry water until winter. Then chop water and carry wood. That is my life.<br><br>We're in a small, spring drought here in Maine. On the one hand I'm worried that it won't break and wells will run dry by August. On the other hand I'm grateful as it's given the opportunity to recover large swaths of garden lost to weeds when I was working/in school 18 hours/day. So after several weeks of daily shoveling and raking, both gardens are on the verge of total restoration. <br><br>Like the Greeks, I'm focusing this year's garden on value crops. Squash and potatoes are cheap up here. Eggplants, mixed greens, sugar snap peas, not so much. My eggplants -- first I've tried -- pushed their happy little heads above soil on May day and are heading toward the light as I write.<br><br>Also the warm drought brought opportunity to get the filly back under saddle a month early. Arabians remember everything you want them to forget, and forget everything you want to remember. Silly human forgot this most basic fact, and started the filly up too quickly in April. She smacked me upside the head quite literally, like any good Zen teacher would I suppose.

And I like the idea of "living in two worlds" if a person can keep awareness of both the visible power systems and see the anti-world that exists in the shadows of power.<br><br>Its fun for environmentalists to look back to the 1970's energy (oil) crisis and say we (America especially) missed our opportunity to change path, and we choose Reagan's vision of greatness over Carter's moral conservation. And I've heard stories of people who went "off the grid" to wait for a collapse that never happened, so many came back and some of those are now the new urbanites who have decided community is a more sensible response to chaotic times. I was too young for the 70's but my current bet is debt-free city living is better than isolation.<br><br>Where the holes of the progress narrative fail for me is not in how much easy energy is left, which might yet be relatively large, is the amount of garbage we create. Composting is the smallest effort that still isn't quite mainstream, but it opens up a way of thinking that isn't apparently as long as someone picks up monster smelly garbage bins every week. So seeing the flow of materialism is depressing and also hopeful, because what we do is so monstrously wasteful.<br><br>I think also to William Blake's 4-fold vision, and seeing things from radially different points of view, single vision of self-interest and rational utilitarianism, double-vision which includes awareness of relativity of good, and that collective decisions can be done when every point of view is as the table, and then triple vision where people see a large enough vision to contain the needs of others, and cooperative spirit can lead. Finally four-fold vision that voluntarily seeks above all self-interest to see the world as it is, and gives us a chance to redesign our sense of place in the world to fit what is. Something like, that, and my bad attempt shows my limited understanding.<br><br>But so like the "off the grid" people of the 70's or preppers now-a-days, they learned more about their dependence, but there's also a high cost to trying to stand outside the system, to try to be "pure" so you don't need other people's good behavior before you act.<br><br>I also think of Richard Bach's "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" whose flock lived in a garbage dump, while he sought higher things, to learn of the limits of seagull fight, and he ended up dead, but ascended. I didn't like Bach's cop-out of spiritual ascension, even if life really is a Matrix Video game so we can move on to level 2 when we die. I see JLS's quest for excellence like the Flock - extravagent and self-destructive. I don't care that he was selfish, but that sort of individualism, if it can't find a way to bring something back to a community of others, seems impotent to me. So its a stunted vision of ego.<br><br>I recently saw a TEDx speech The Science Delusion - Rupert Sheldrake, and appreciate his attempt to shake up science by challeging its core "dogmas", and with his pet theory of "Morphic resonance" to express a connectivity of life, that our minds are not just in our head, etc. Scientists generally hate it, and I fear speculation that can't be proven, BUT in Blake's vision, suggests the single vision of mechanical science fails us, and even if we can't know exactly what more there is, our models can break wider what facts we see and which facts we filter.<br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TerTgDEgUE<br><br>I definitely can see the threat that "hope" is also a curse, and yet maybe its a blessing as long as it helps us try to see things from different points of view before we fight to the death for a view that is too small.<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c1175645971454252521 title="comment permalink">5/2/13, 2:40 PM</a><br><br>

This applies both at a societal level and also at an individual level as we journey through our own lives towards either heaven or hell.<br><br>It seems to me that cultures with cyclical views, and possibly the idea of reincarnation, might have citizens who could more easily handle changes for the worse (or better) in the state of their societies or in their own lives....<br><br>Because of this limitation I think that in the West when we stop thinking that time is progress shaped we will have to switch to some "declinist" vision of the shape of time because this is the only other option available..and this transition period will be pretty painful.... Older people might be able to reconcile themselves to such a view as it mirrors their own person trajectory, but it seems that in the young it would likely breed anger or despair, a sense of having been robbed just by being born at the wrong time.... this in turn could lead to protest, revolution and war, the sort of jagged drops in the progress graph that Mr Diamond has suggested.... maybe the Occupy movement is a first stirring of what is to come? <br><br>I'm sure over time as we descend down the ladder of progress cultural forms that are adaptive will ease the transition and minimise harm but the transition between different views of time will be pretty messy...<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c8102952359303216801 title="comment permalink">5/2/13, 7:48 PM</a><br><br>

What does the idea of time as healer imply about humanity and its place in the world and time? <br><br>Jeffrey, yes, I'm familiar with that theory. In my view it massively understates the scale of the energy subsidies from fossil fuels that underlie every aspect of contemporary life. <br><br>Rylan, good! Our culture pretends to value originality, and so it's very hard to notice just how many of our "original thoughts" are simply rehashing the contents of the collective imagination. It's when you notice this that the doors start to open. <br><br>Sixbears, the old mill town where I now live is in exactly the same state, and belief in progress is wearing very thin here, too. <br><br>Larry, thanks for the heads up! The person who wrote the headline was quite correct: in a speculative bubble -- because of course that's what the whole fracking thing is -- timing is indeed everything; you need to get in early and get out before prices turn down, or you're just another one of the suckers that gets taken to the cleaners. <br><br>Steve, it's usually at or shortly after the peak of the sine wave that cyclical theories become popular among intellectuals, so we're right on track.<br><br>Russell, thanks for the correction. <br><br>Zach, those two statements are standard only in a minority of Christian traditions -- admittedly it's a minority that gets a lot of air time these days, but it's still a minority.

The cultural mainstream is still stuck in the notion that time naturally moves in the direction of progress, and is scrambling to come up with one excuse after another to explain why this doesn't seem to be happening; out here on the fringes, by contrast, it's possible to talk in terms less constrained by popular mythology.<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c2841627362533342118 title="comment permalink">5/2/13, 9:06 PM</a><br><br>

You might consider reading it again, and paying attention to my comments about abstractions as tools rather than truths. <br><br>Denys, it's implicit in the mythology of progress that certain social changes -- for example, toward more gender equality -- are hardwired into the direction of time, and so come about more or less automatically as we move further into the future. I'd encourage you to consider scrapping that idea, and seeing those social changes as things that happened because people worked hard to make them happen. Do you want those same things to continue into the future? If so, be prepared to work as hard to preserve them as the suffragists and the feminists worked to create them. <br><br>EnergyLens, excellent! Adams is always worth reading, though he would have been less perplexed if he'd known in advance about Ilya Prigogine's equations, which show how entropic energy flow through an open system acts to increase the complexity of that system. That's the thing that makes Darwinian evolution work in a universe run by the laws of thermodynamics, of course. <br><br>Villager, computers don't build themselves, they don't power themselves, they don't mine the raw materials to make their own spare parts for themselves, and so on. They're simply the final hurrah of the age of cheap abundant energy, and will go away as the immensely complex and energy-hungry infrastructure needed to support them becomes too costly to keep running. Thus I don't think that the invention of computers is anything like a game-changer. <br><br>Glenn, you're ahead of the curve. In a couple of centuries, odds are that the attitudes you've sketched out here will be normal, and the notion of perpetual progress will seem bizarre to everyone but a few historians. <br><br>SLClaire, indeed it is. Hang on for the explosions. <br><br>Juhana, of course! The classical Hindu vision of time is one of cyclical decline: things start out with the golden age, decline steadily over time, reach the bottom, and then Shiva hits the reset button and the cycle starts again. It's Hesiod's vision, but with the end folded back to the beginning. Mind you, the more standard sort of cyclical theory sees half of history as decline, so there's room there as well. <br><br>Mary, and a happy Bealteinne to you as well. We've got asparagus, rhubarb, and evergreen onions up in the perennial beds, and peas, lettuce, carrots and bulb onions already up in the main beds -- and the local garden plant sale begins on the pedestrian mall downtown tomorrow. <br><br>Bugmwethx, of course -- that's what failing empires always do. <br><br>Ares, the thing about Sheldrake's theory that makes scientists burst into incandescent rage is that he's got experimental evidence supporting his theory of morphic resonance, and has been going around teaching people how to replicate the experiments and see for themselves. In effect, he's showing the gap between science as a useful system for testing hypotheses, on the one hand, and science as a specific set of beliefs about the world founded, like all beliefs, on unprovable presuppositions, on the other. Of course he's getting yelled at!<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c2034526467855601588 title="comment permalink">5/2/13, 9:24 PM</a><br><br>

You're quite correct, of course -- part of the shape of time in today's popular culture is that it accelerates -- thus we think we're so much busier than people fifty or a hundred years ago, and have so much less time to do things. I'll have to work that into the broader argument I've been developing, no question. <br><br>David, exactly.

I certainly was in the late 1970s, when it looked as though we were going to tackle these same changes in a deliberate manner, instead of waiting to have them forced on us!<br><br>Gavin, denial is a common response to cognitive dissonance. If the dissonance keeps getting louder, sooner or later most people give up the denial; the remainder generally wig out. <br><br>Dowsergirl, as I said, Hesiod's perspective is a very difficult one for people raised on progress to grasp. It's worth making the effort, if only to get a glimpse at how many of our own preconceptions are as arbitrary as his. <br><br>Derek, good. Hubris, as you no doubt know, may be neatly defined as the overweening pride of the doomed. <br><br>Bozack, depends on which version of Christianity you're talking about -- it's a much more diverse religious movement than most Americans realize. As for shifting visions of time, well, there's a reason why spiritualities that make use of a cyclical vision of time have been increasingly widespread in America of late. <br><br>KL Cooke, bingo! That's one of the ones I was thinking of -- I'd forgotten the title, though not the author, who was a major fave of mine back in the day.

Seeing and working with reality needs calmness, discernment, acceptance and practical action. Courage, steadfastness, is definitely a vital quality to help us along that path, especially when that path gets rocky. Perhaps a pinch of hope, and maybe a dash of curiosity can be helpful in getting us on the path in the first place? But perhaps not. Hope alone is just froth, of course, and most of us start reassessing our relationship to reality because of a painful upset of some sort. So, yes, more courage and less hope. Either way, I like sixbears phrase - "hard eyed flinty hope". Maybe that's what courage is.<br><br>Having said all that, getting one's relationship with reality right is the work of a lifetime, or maybe several depending on your beliefs. It isn't easy or quick.

And now that you’ve pointed it out I realize again how deeply important and influential the quieter ideals are, and how too easily their voices can be drowned out by the exciting and aggressive ones! I see the tribal form of time in family traditions and also in the “way of work,” for example patterns of gardening or putting up firewood. My friend and I will defend the virtue of any heirloom axe against all modern comers, especially those whose heads and handles have been the most replaced! Family recipes have this same lore about them, no matter the quality of the meatball or pound cake! And I think the presence of humor in this mode of time is perhaps one of its greatest utilities. Hard to laugh when reading Hesiod or the New Testament!<br><br>I sometimes think that the tribal form of time was coopted by the philosophers, girded with intellectual virtues, and sent into the political arena as a champion for human sanity.

I don't think these are qualitatively different than circles. The underlying arrow of time is taken as a given. Whether you see the course of history as progress, stasis, decline, or cycles, everyone has the experience of the shattered stone not reassembling itself, the young growing old, and the sequence of birth, life, death, regardless of how you feel about where the line goes after that death or before that birth. The sequential aspect of time is just kind of there. So when you add the arrow to a cycle, you get a wave or a spiral. A cork bobbing in the ocean traces out circles as the waves pass. <br><br>But I want to expand the ideas of waves and cycles, booms and busts, births and deaths to another level, but not quite to another dimension. If you look at the world, you see these waves and cycles at every scale of time, from inconceivably tiny subatomic quantum-level processes, to the formation and destruction of stars and galaxies over billions of years, No matter what temporal scale you view it at, you see the same complex pattern of jagged trajectories and complexly superimposed cycles. There's a word for this, brace yourselves for the aforementioned "F" bomb...<br><br>Fractal.<br><br>Fractals are shapes that have fractional dimensions. A line has one dimension, a plane has two dimensions. A line that is so complexly jagged that no matter how much you magnify it, it never looks smooth, has a dimensionality somewhere between 1 and 2. The same for a surface that is so intricately convoluted that you can magnify it until you are looking at the Plank Length, and it never flattens out. It's dimensionality is somewhere between 2 and 3. The jagged line has infinite length but zero area; the convoluted surface has infinite area but zero volume. <br><br>One of the features of Fractals is self-similarity. When you magnify them, they still look the same. Isn't this the way time is? If you look at the evolution of a species, or the rises and falls of civilizations over centuries, or the fates and fortunes of an individual person's lifetime, or the events of a single day, don't you see the same sorts of patterns reflected in each?<br><br>I think the inter-nesting of cycles of different periods is an approximation to this fractal nature. But to actually recreate it, you need an infinite number of cycles, with an infinitely broad range of periods.<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c156105630514787235 title="comment permalink">5/3/13, 8:27 AM</a><br><br>

From an early age, I was made to believe that the pursuit of truth ought be the principal trait of all human endeavors. This happened partly because of heavy exposure to science and the religion of progress, and partly by way of various interpretations of the core Hindu philosophical ideas such as Advaitha, etc. These interpretations sought to put a distance between Hinduism and other "dogmatic religions" by taking it closer to the ostensibly scientific goal of knowing the truth. Needless to say all of this had a profound influence on how I shaped my activities and in retrospect the idea of pursuing truth was responsible for a fair share of my life's miseries.<br><br>It was much later that I began to see ideas as tools, models and approximations and those have found echo in your writings. I am not well read enough to know the historical roots of this idea of the "pursuit of truth". My sense is that all systems of thought implicitly assume that it is possible, by using their ideas, to know at least a slice of the truth and thus end up imbuing their ideas with some form of absolute validity. The notion that we can merely approximate the truth but never really know it seems relatively new to me. Do you have any insights on this?<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c8081275312811663644 title="comment permalink">5/3/13, 8:27 PM</a><br><br>

But fractal-like shapes are abundant in nature, from the archetypal rocky coastline to the head of broccoli. The idea of something like a compound fractal is interesting -- at one range of scale it shows one self-similar pattern, but at a smaller or larger scale a different pattern emerges. I can imagine zooming in on the rocky coastline, and then at a small enough scale it shifts into dendritic branching, and at an even smaller scale the tips of the dendrites become snowflake-like hexagonal branching. It would take a real mathematician (i.e. not me) to tell us if such constructs exist, have names, and have been examined. <br><br>Of course one other model of time, the quantum-mechanical multiverse, is inherently fractal and can't be understood in any other way. At each instant time splits into two trajectories, which themselves split again, creating a universe of unimaginably complex layering in space-time. <br><br>Another feature of fractals is that their infinitely complex structures commonly are generated by simple algorithms. These algorithms are often recursive (cycling back into themselves). So staying with the topic of the metaphorical shape of time, if it has a complex fractal structure, what might be the simple, self-referential underlying algorithms that lead to the repeating pattern across all scales, the unimaginably long to the incomprehensibly short?<br><br>Something I might suggest as worth contemplating along those lines (i.e. the fractal-generating algorithm) would be feedback loops and overshoot.

That's the ambiguity inherent in all value judgements, of course. That said, as I discussed last week, the myth of progress specifies particular things that are supposed to increase over time -- the moral, scientific/technological, and economic versions of the myth each define the values by which progress is to be measured, and it's primarily when two of these forms of the myth are in progress that you get disputes over progress and regress. <br><br>Gawain, if that's the shape of time you find useful, by all means. Just remember that it's a useful tool, not a truth!<br><br>Shrama, excellent! You get tonight's gold star for bringing up one of the central issues of this discussion, well in advance of the posts in which I'll be exploring this. Not all systems of thought accept the belief that human beings can know the pure, unvarnished truth -- I'm thinking particularly here of Lao Tsu, who begins the Tao Te Ching with the crucial warning, "A process as described is not the process as it exists." More on this later on. <br><br>Bill, understood, and I wasn't thinking of very big or very small scales. You get some shapes of time, such as the traditional Chinese one, that are profoundly fractal -- every cycle is analogous to every other cycle -- and others in which one pattern applies to a certain set of processes but others follow a wholly different pattern -- think of Augustinian Christianity, in which religious phenomena from the history of the individual soul right up to the history of the universe follow a distinctive cycle of descent and recovery, but historical events in the fallen world are essentially random, having no distinctive pattern at all. That's what I mean about fractal and nonfractal shapes of time -- you could as well say self-similar and non-self-similar.<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c8473781137599548133 title="comment permalink">5/3/13, 11:33 PM</a><br><br>

In my church we did not dwell on the "end times", maybe because the rapture, the millennium, and such were not part of our tradition, but it was not difficult to be swayed by these interpretations as they were all over the Christian TV channel and tons of books and teaching tapes available in the Christian book stores. Most evangelical/conservative Christians poo-poo climate change and energy depletion because they believe that God placed all we needed on this earth, so it will last until Jesus comes. In other words, somewhere in the future after they are already in Heaven. (The common attitude of many is "Come, Lord Jesus...but not yet".) There are some that stress if we really are running out of oil, gas, etc., it means that Jesus is returning soon, since God would only have supplied the earth with what was needed for it's allotted time frame of existence. As peak oil becomes impossible to deny and the economy crashes, and things grow increasingly worse, I predict that more Christians (the ones who hang onto their faith) will adapt to this latter interpretation and use it as a sign for their Messiah to return.

This is without a doubt the most important creed in the history of Christendom, as it sums up the late 4th century consensus about the Christian faith to which all forms of classical Christianity subscribe. As such, the words quoted by Zack express something that is integral and essential to the Christian faith, as understood in all its traditionally orthodox (i.e., non-“modernized”) variants.<br><br>As a former Roman Catholic who is a convert to Nestorianism, the tendency of the Catholic Church to downplay the significance of these words to the point of effectively ignoring them constituted one among several important reasons why I came to regard the Roman Catholic witness to the Christian faith as deficient. If these words are an integral part of the historic Christian faith, then not only ought any traditional Christian not be embarrassed about them, but she is actively called to understand the direction of history in light of her belief in them.<br><br>Also, here is a further historical note about the relation of the Nestorian Church to the development of the Nicene Creed that may be of interest to some: The 4th century conciliar consensus that led to the formulation of this creed as the most single important post-apostolic witness to the Christian faith includes the Nestorian Church. This is true notwithstanding the fact that from the Nestorian standpoint, the church councils at which the articles of the creed were formulated and promulgated were not "Ecumenical" or universal, as they are regarded by all the forms of Roman Christianity (which includes the Eastern Orthodox, the so-called "Monophysite" Churches, and all of Western Christianity in both its Catholic and Protestant forms). <br><br>The Nestorian Church is the only form of Christianity that arose originally in a non-Roman political and cultural milieu. In its inception and early history, it was indigenous to the Parthian Empire, east of Rome. As such, the Nestorian Church regards the Councils of Nicea (325 ad) and Constantinople (381 ad), where this creed took its final form, as local Roman events - to which, however, they gladly lend their assent of faith, thus rendering the Nicene Creed a truly universal expression of historic Christianity<br><br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c4577426017366565029 title="comment permalink">5/4/13, 6:26 AM</a><br><br>

And then, when I speak to friends and family, and hear the implicate faith (as you mention) in “upward and onward” as if there is no other choice (ironically, more faith as there is less proof – could that be because everyone is getting used to not having a clue about how things work??) I remember the first time my concept of linear upward procession was challenged: as a teen, reading the Norse sagas and their Ragnarok – it was a horrible sensation, thinking that everything would just end in collapse! Lost that concept in the busyness of young adulthood, but Peak Oil and climate change brought it back – now it seems insane to think there’s some easy, technological way out of this! And as you say so well, if they don’t realize their underlying perception/assumption, then trying to discuss details is fraught with misunderstanding. So, I simply watch and wait for any opening… not easy. But the concept of cycles does help me tremendously – seeing that we are in decline, but thinking perhaps there will be another beginning after this end. Not a given, nor anything I’ll see, but I hope it will be so.

I'm aware that there has always been a more learned inner system of beliefs, which Alan Watts talked about. An "esoteric" church within the larger church, which he claimed exists in all religions. He pretty quickly gave up on practicing that within mainstream Anglicanism, but then, he was doing his work during the 50s and 60s, and those weren't the best times to be trying to work within tradition.

The Religion of Progress is sufficient to describe many features of our current arc, but I think another Enlightenment heritage with enormous power at this moment is Individualism. <br><br>That got me thinking about a binge of witchcraft research I once did after taking a class on shamanism. There is a peculiar symmetry between the way that stable subsistence societies like those of Greenland and a whole spectrum of Bantu and non-Bantu Africa define witchcraft, and what we in the West have come to define as the natural prerogatives of the imperial individual. <br><br>I tried to synthesise this with some research I've been doing on neoliberal capitalism, which has been the dominant model for the Western economy and polity since about 1979, and has presided over the arc largely under discussion here. The post is called: <br><br>"The Crucible of Neoliberal Capitalism."<br>http://thesacrificinganimal.blogspot.com<br><br>There is a crucial question that has been hovering in the background for me through all of this. Thus far JMG, you've been discussing the history of ideas as a set of subsistence tools, meta-narrative implements for securing the means of biological homeostasis at a given historical moment and ecological niche. That's a fantastic and effective way of thinking about pre-industrial religious and philosophical narratives, but it also strikes me that, prior to the disaggregation and specialisation that has so characterised modernity, these narratives were also supposed to advance a picture of human flourishing, and the way you might aspire to it in the structure of your life and the conduct your relationships. <br><br>I'm personally a 65/35 agnostic about the prospect of sharp downslope/ingenuity and innovation puzzle something out (I have a friend who intends to devote his fortune to space mining if his start-up idea takes off). But regardless of which way it goes, I'm really dissatisfied with the modern Western narrative of what human flourishing, happiness, well being, eudaimonia, etc. consists in. <br><br>I value the way we prize individual creativity and innovation, and I'm eager to hold on to elements of that in whatever future comes down the pike, but I'm radically unhappy with our tendency towards solipsism and consumption at the expense of relationality and contribution. We are maniacally focused on what you can TAKE. And although I think the individual must have a certain autonomy as a pre-requisite to this, I also believe the pulp of life is in what you can GIVE.<br><br>In other words, this discussion has been almost exclusively about methods and modes of securing the material basis of human flourishing (which the contemporary West makes contingent on a MASSIVE product substrate—to its sorrow). And it's been wonderful and stimulating. <br><br>But human flourishing itself is found in that ethereal tissue of relationships, loves, creations, and contributions that happens after we secure the means of biological homeostasis. The contemporary binge-consumption model must be predicated at least partially not only on an inadequate cognitive apparatus for modelling our historical and ecological niche but a desperate poverty in our ideas of how to live well. <br><br>I have difficulty not assimilating our material crisis to the spiritual or philosophical crisis that I've seen carry so many members of my generation into internet binging, drinking, hard drugs, and eventual suicide or overdose. The increase in incidence of depression and suicide in particular is frightening to behold, statically as well as anecdotally. <br><br>(I am, in fact, in my early twenties, and yes I can confirm that it seems like a less pleasant time than most to be in this age bracket.) <br><br><br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c2404676631562213584 title="comment permalink">5/4/13, 12:26 PM</a><br><br>

Thank you. <br><br>Joy, thanks for the input. I'm familiar with the "God gave us as much petroleum as we need" argument -- I'd be interested to hear those who believe it defend the claim that Jesus approves of today's lifestyles of gargantuan extravagance and waste, given the rather different testimony of the Christian Bible. <br><br>Sgage, it's definitely a distinctive shape of time! I also respect the fact that McKenna made hard and falsifiable predictions about the future. Mind you, he was wrong, but that's the risk you always run. <br><br>Bill, that seems like a perfectly workable way of looking at it. <br><br>Nestorian, are you familiar with preterist interpretations of the prophecies of the New Testament? That and other traditions within the broad realm of Christian religion do not share the more common belief in an imminent, physical Second Coming. I'm quite aware, of course, that those traditions are heretical from your standpoint, but they do exist and have, and have had, a significant role in that end of the history of ideas. <br><br>Onething, there we'll have to disagree. Capital-T Truth, as I see it, is not something that human beings can know, and moving from one small-t truth to another does not bring us closer to Truth in any absolute sense. (That was one of the central points of Kuhn's <i>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> -- science does not get closer to truth, it simply generates models that are more useful for making sense of whatever phenomena are considered most important at a given period in history.) Furthermore, I would dispute the notion that truth, or any other virtue, ought necessarily to come ahead of all other concerns. To name only one example, when your elderly aunt asks you what you think of her new hat, truth is a needless brutality! <br><br>Cathy, that's exactly why I talk about cyclical change -- in the kind of historical period we're in just now, it tends to be an extremely useful tool. <br><br>MawKernewek, good. In all three cases, you've got a scientific way of thinking about the shape of time that is not usually applied to our everyday experience of time, and in all three cases, I'd argue, at least part of the reason is the conflict between those shapes and the shape of progress, which is the preferred default option these days. <br><br>Hal, as I mentioned to Nestorian, I'm aware that a belief in a physical Parousia in historical time is common to a great many Christian churches; my point was simply that it's not universal. As for the Emerging Church and New Monasticism movements, no argument there -- the former is far too reminiscent of other religious movements of the overly comfortable, while the latter is an extremely promising sign. <br><br>Joseph, of course "progress" is a value judgment -- the shape of time defined by the religion of progress is that time moves in the direction of whatever the believer happens to value. As I pointed out last week, that can cover some very diverse territory! Hesiod, and a great many others who shared his inclination, argue that time moves away from what they value. Belief in progress, as I have described it, is not a belief that progress occasionally happens; it's the belief that history has a bias toward it in favor of progress. That's what I've been saying all along, you know.<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c6714059487968465210 title="comment permalink">5/4/13, 3:12 PM</a><br><br>

This is not what you are doing here, but it's a question that presses just as hard on today's twenty-somethings if not harder, at least in my experience. <br><br>It's not for nothing we've seen a rash of complaints about American literature since WWII being nothing but an extended wail over the miserableness and dysfunction of those middle class families that achieved the material American Dream. Neither is it a coincidence that so many seem to be anticipating an age of economic hardship and capital letter Social Problems with a curious relish, as a sort of spur to spiritual growth. Those anticipations are certainly naive and misplaced in many ways, but there is a substrate of something true and important from which they grow. <br><br>It's not just that the American Dream is slamming headfirst into the tough realities of a finite planet, it's that even for those who—from the outside—have achieved its material substance, even for the much despised 1%, the parousia escapes them, like the green light on the end of Gatsby's dock. They find themselves enslaved to the impossible horizon of genuine material fulfilment. Those who have 'made it' often deserve our compassion more than almost anyone. Which raises much stickier and more spiritual questions, which I certainly understand your being reluctant to deal with, given how dreary and politicised any such talk has become. <br><br>At any rate, please forge ahead with this magnificent dog.

The Dreamtime provided an important perspective and guidelines on the ecology and interactions between plants, animals and the environment. It also provided clear warnings, not to be dismissed lightly. Our current relationship to the Land here is dysfunctional.<br><br>Your observation is very clever as we do think in terms of stories, I certainly do, and I regularly use metaphors to explain complex concepts to people as part of my paid work. Even the ancient Greeks had their morality tales. It is a credit to their ancient culture that they are still read.<br><br>Perhaps it is as you pointed out many months ago to me that every end is a new beginning? Perhaps even the changes that we now face - it is still eerily warm and dry here for autumn - mean that we are now, or soon will be, in a new Dreamtime?<br><br>Time to me is sort of like spaghetti (I’m hand making pasta tonight) as it travels in all sorts of random directions and everyone perceives a different start and end point. Have you ever noticed how often that Hubbert's curve matches so many other representations of life experience? I've even seen marketing people discussing it as the product life cycle! The universe seems to be in the grip of entropy and it is a constant force. I work hard here to produce a surplus with most of the systems here and people always seem a bit dumbfounded by this.<br><br>It is really interesting reading about your growing experiences so many thousands of kilometres away. Lettuce, peas, rocket, mustard are all just now becoming edible. I understand why spring is the lean time in your location. Did you know summer here is the lean time here? It must have been a shock to the convicts when they were dumped here all of those years ago (in the middle of summer).<br><br>PS: Contact with the local seed savers group has produced some interesting results and I now have over 30 varieties of garlic growing here plus I’m getting access to some really well acclimatised open pollinated varieties of edible plants. People who garden really love sharing, I even provided a visitor recently with a bucketful of good soil from here with which to inoculate their own garden.

Still you probably start with better soils.<br><br>However, such systems are only one part of the whole. They produce grains and/or meat for consumption. There are many other edible plants that form part of your diet (well, I hope so anyway) that you may want to consider and these do not tolerate soil disturbance.<br><br>I would suggest that the best lands for producing grains in Finland are now being utilised by industrial agricultural systems and these will need a few years to transition to organic (old time) methods before they are as productive as the traditional systems could possibly be.<br><br>Also, you mention foraging for food in your forests. It might be worth pondering how old your forests are? Regrowth forests (ie. younger than 100 years) don't generally support much of the original diversity they once had.<br><br>Also, another thing comes to mind. When your plot of land is laying fallow, where are all of the weedy / pioneering plant species going to come from? Does surrounding farmland support these? What about the surrounding forest? <br><br>It is a worthwhile exercise to find a patch of organically farmed land that is laying fallow and count the number of species growing in it.

Why? Because everyone else in Greece thought they knew something, and he alone recognized that he knew nothing. Wisdom is not the same thing as knowing the truth; as I see it, at least, it starts with the cold awareness that we can't know the truth -- all we can do is create models of our experience that more or less seem to explain part of the cosmos around us. In my view, that existential modesty is the foundation of wisdom, as it is also the foundation of tolerance and compassion -- you'll probably have noticed that those who think they know the unvarnished truth tend to be very deficient in these latter virtues.

Eg, why the banksters/politicians/realtors couldn't see the housing bubble, why the Keynesian economists think printing up more little green slips of paper will make us wealthier, etc. It seems to fit a whole variety of things i've observed about why people ignored obvious warnings over the last decade, to why modern architecture is so ugly. We really are an insane society!<br><br>Going further, some argue this has a spiritual dimension. Maggie Ross (pen name for Martha Reeves) is a 30-year professed anglican solitary, book author, and blogger at ravenwilderness.blogspot.com<br><br>For many years she spent half the year in remote alaska, and half the year teaching theology at oxbridge.

As I understand her arguments, what McGilcrist discusses as the right hemisphere function is what christianity would term 'beholding'. And while 'beholding' appears 1300 times in the new testament, more modern translations leave it out entirely. According to her, the 'golden age' was in the twelfth century or so, and since that time, the church has lost it's contemplative perspective, and hence it's ability to properly interpret it's own scripture. A brief post about this is: Language Matters:<br>ravenwilderness.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-language-matters.html<br><br>For those interested in going deeper, two papers (both in multiple posts on her blog) related to her ideas and McGilchrist are titled: Manchester Talk May 31, 2012:<br>ravenwilderness.blogspot.com/search?q=Manchester+Talk<br><br>and Exploring Silence:<br>ravenwilderness.blogspot.com/search?q=Exploring+Silence<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c2302843375284742363 title="comment permalink">5/6/13, 1:01 AM</a><br><br>

It was a well-done series, I thought; but Jamieson's sadness and puzzlement at the end about people's alienation to putting what they had found in silence into traditional words and church structures seemed the only disingenuous moment. He was right on when he pointed to the relationship between silence and the evolution of doctrine, but oblivious of how those doctrines have been divorced from silence, twisted, and used to beat people up, keeping them immature and dependent, narrowing the parameters of what it might possibly mean to be human.<br><br>How can Jamieson stand the conflict between what deep silence teaches and what being a Roman Catholic forces you to assent to? Does he just glaze over, tune out, the way so many RC monastics do when confronted by contradiction (as opposed to paradox)? <br><br>I'm a professed religious and my sympathies are all with the alienated. Organized religion has become so embarrassing that it's not surprising people don't want to be associated with it. I'm not willing to use the fossilized language, either, not unless it's ringed about with explanations and caveats and provisionality. Some of it can still be useful, but only as it is understood in its wider relationship to silence and as it is restored to its relationship to silence and, most of all, as it yields to silence.</i><br><br>-----<br><br>i think some of the above ideas are related to your topics so far re: mental models.

This view is widely held within the more conservative precincts of American Protestantism today as an alternative to the equally widespread Dispensationalist Futurism.<br><br>In addition, Reformation-era Protestantism advanced the so-called "Historicist" interpretation, which correlates biblical prophecy to the entire span of history between the first and second comings of Christ. The Historicist approach was very convenient to Luther, et al., in that it made it easy to assign the papacy to the role of the "Whore of Babylon" in Revelation 17. <br><br>There is also the so-called "Idealist" interpretation, which regards the symbols of apocalyptic prophecy as real metaphors insofar as they describe the essential nature of the ongoing drama of the battle between good and evil in history, but as misleading and illusory metaphors insofar as they are held to correlate in an exact way with concrete, particularized historical events. The recently resigned Pope Benedict XVI would be an example of a leading theologian who holds largely to such an Idealist interpretation. <br><br>In one combination or another, the Futurist, Preterist, Idealist, and Historicist interpretations of the apocalyptic prophecies in the Bible represent the full range of possible interpretations of this literature by any one who affirms faith in classical (i.e., non-Modernized) variants of Christianity. (There is, of course, also a fifth mode of interpretation that regards these prophecies as mere illusions and fantasies of fevered human imagination, but such an hermeneutical approach is not available to those who maintain Premodern forms of allegiance to Christian beliefs.)<br><br>My point with regard to the words from the Nicene Creed quoted by Zack is that they are an important testimony to the prominence of Futurist interpretations in the early Church. In fact, the explicit presence of the words “He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead” has made it impossible for both the Roman Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches to maintain anything other than a Futurist interpretation of at least the Second Coming of Christ itself – much as both these Churches would have sorely liked to dispense with Futurism of any kind, as it constituted a continual source of embarrassment over the course of the many centuries following the fatal Constantinean political compromise that both Churches made in the 4th century, and is an even greater embarrassment to them today.<br><br>Moreover, the fact is that the considerable majority of ante-Nicene Church Fathers were maximalists in their futurism. For example, if one picks up writings by Justin Martyr (mid-2nd century); Irenaeus of Lyons (early 3rd century); Hippolytus of Rome (early 3rd century); or Lactantius (early 4th century, and one of Constantine’s tutors, if I remember correctly), the resemblance between their thinking and that of modern Dispensationalism is quite striking. Indeed, even early writers who have a reputation of being strident Anti-Futurists, such as Origen (early 3rd century) have in fact left behind a literary legacy that contain decidedly robust elements of Futurism. <br><br>I know it is nothing more than an historical curiosity to almost all who read this blog, but it is nevertheless a fact that the central core of Dispensationalist Futurism has by far the strongest foundation in Christian Tradition of any of the four modes of apocalyptic interpretation delineated above. At the very least, Dispensationalism should be cleared of the charge of inventing something totally new in Christian history, for it is a false one.<br><br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c4835138964629915356 title="comment permalink">5/6/13, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>

This could be viewed as circular time in denial or with deficient epistemology, cf. the sayings of the French, Russians, and English, etc., according to which “the more things change, the more they stay the same”. <br><br>Second, consciousness-only-of-this-moment time, or “goldfish memory”: My stomach hurts now, hence all of life is miserable. I was just given a lollipop, now everything has always been great. This is time-as-a-moment without a sense of perspective. Advertisers encourage people to think like this, cf. Clotaire Rapaille's aphorism that “the reptilian brain always wins” meaning that consumers can be manipulated to purchase things against their better interest. <br><br>Up to a degree, the old man who views time as a process of decay because of his own personal experience can also be viewed as misrepresenting time because he isn't transitioning his point of view to his sons and his daughters' sons et cetera.

The image of the stubborn, unadapatable and racist Vikings in Greenland has most likely been popularized by Jared Diamond's <i>Collapse</i>. Scholars specialized in the topic have criticized his writings and pointed out some of their errors, particularly his claim that the Greenland Norse did not eat fish. <br><br>For one thing all the North Atlantic colonies, as well as the Norwegian motherland, traditionally practiced fishing; so it really should take a mass of evidence to prove that the Greenlanders did not eat fish. Perhaps Diamond's claim partly derives from a biased desire to prove a point and partly from a failure to account for the social context: land-based food (meat and dairy) held more prestige in both Icelandic and Greenlandic society, since power and wealth primarily came from land ownership. Fishing was available to everyone, meaning that the poorer you were the more you had to subsist on fish. The bishopric of Gardar, where more meat would have been consumed than in poorer households, has naturally been studied most by archaeologists, and Diamond often refers to evidence from there.<br><br>Keep in mind that the Greenland colony persisted for nearly five centuries. During at least four of those centuries it was in contact with the outside world, particularly with Iceland. The reasons for its eventual disappearance are still unknown. A number of areas within Iceland were also abandoned sometime between 1300 and 1500; even the reasons for that process are not fully known but Icelandic scholars have gradually come to favor a varied explanation taking both social and environmental developments into account. The same is likely true for Greenland. Pinning the supposed failure of the Greenland Norse (despite their staying half a millenium in a harsh and remote environment) on some unique lack of adaptability is not really helpful for understanding the topic.<br><br>As to their view of time... "good vs evil" may be one feature of it but I would also say that there was a cyclic view in Norse paganism. In the Völuspá (ancient verse describing the creation and eventual fate of the world), the follow-up to the terrible Ragnarök is that the world is reborn more beautiful than ever. Mankind and the gods also come back and live in a state of bliss. The last verse describes the ominous appearance of a "dark dragon"; this can be interpreted in many ways, though to me it implies that evil is also reborn, thus completing the cycle. Now, the Greenland Norse did of course also become Christian, which likely affected their view of time in some ways. Finally I would add that Iceland, faced with increasing environmental degradation, poverty and backwardness, eventually developed a strongly "Hesiodic" view of time. I would expect that the same occurred in Greenland as it faced its decline.<br><br>P.S. I'm a native Icelander studying geography and history. I would refer to Kirsten A. Seaver's <i>The Last Vikings</i> as an example of a recent scholarly title contradicting the popular view of the Greenlanders.<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c1191404096539057732 title="comment permalink">5/6/13, 5:55 PM</a><br><br>

Many thanks for the video -- that tank looks worth the effort!<br><br>Les, I've encountered your father-in-law's theory before, and find it puzzling, in that a day doesn't seem to go by any faster now than it did when I was young. Maybe that's because I avoid activities (such as TV) that consume time and give nothing back; I don't know. <br><br>Phil H., I've discussed the weirdly trancelike quality of modern consciousness here before. Heraclitus' point is something beyond that; he's not saying that we act like people under a curse, he's saying that we act like the kind of people who put curses on others. <br><br>Nestorian, good -- but that makes my point even more forcefully; the prevalence of Preterist and Idealist interpretations of apocalyptic passages in the Bible makes it clear that, as I said to Zach, a literal interpretation of the Second Coming as an event located in the near future is by no means a non-negotiable part of Christian faith. That said, your point about Futurist interpretations and Dispensationalism is quite correct: a great many Christians, since very early times, have in fact embraced the same belief that motivates today's "rapture ready" fundamentalists. To my mind, this shows the ease with which the human mind reinterprets spiritual teachings in the most crassly material of forms, but of course your beliefs may differ and your mileage may vary. <br><br>Edward, good! All good points. <br><br>JP, the shape of the self is just as contentious an issue as the shape of time...<br><br>Thulensis, very good. To quite a significant extent, current notions of progress are motivated by the lollipop factor: people just now have plenty of lollipops, therefore the process that gave them lollipops is good, and the thought that this same process has horrific consequences in the not too distant future is unthinkable because, well, we've got lollipops!<br><br>Chuck, a valid point.

With the right sphere deactivated, they draw just a single branch; with the left sphere deactivated, they a draw the whole tree but without much detail in the branches; with both hemispheres active, they draw a tree with both the full structure and also the detail.

McGilchrist, while accepting Jayne's intention, felt that Jayne's hypothesis was "the precise inverse of what happened" and that rather than a shift from bicameralism there evolved a separation of the hemispheres.[34]”<br><br>Shortly after originally hearing about the book, i stumbled across an article about architectural myopia, which seemed to support this same view of a detailed view of the world with an in-context view of the world.

Have to say that doctrine leaves lot to interpretation there... And when remembered that the triumph in the fourth century AD of a brand of state-sponsored Christianity was the thing originally narrowing down even wider disarray of opinions,it makes you wonder... <br><br>Four decades after the Nicaean Creed in 367, bishop of Alexandria called Athanasius wrote to the churches under his command. In his letters, he prescribed 27 books to be considered to constitute a "New Testament". Simultaneously, Athanasius said that all gospels not included in his canon were no longer to be read, NEVER. Just for example, gospel of Philip is one of heretical texts giving quite different picture about same events. <br><br>It is probably easier to forget this bewildering soup of differing interpretations of same event if person lives in New World, far away from original birthplace of this religion. If you live closer, and belong to Catholic branch which actually has held all sees around original places of wonder, this historic clean-up of differing opinions by command of Roman emperors (mostly from Constantinople, I mean)is harder to miss... I am NOT challenging authority of religious scholars, just reminding that human being is fallible creature in all aspects. Cultural integrity brought by ancient traditions and faith is beyond doubt, but there are deep undercurrents of differing interpretations going at least from 4th century AD to this very day. Which opinion won and which opinion lost was mostly decided by power-hungry, politicizing emperors of authoritarian regime known as the Roman Empire. Like I have said time after time, human being is unable to understand actual reality beyond imminent, touchable one. For more complicated things, we only sculpture crude images of them and call them the Only Truth. Mystical core remains pure, but our boring fights over doctrinal purity does not. I am happy just with cultural continuity, being man of mostly practical mind, but things should not be oversimplified.<br><br>@Cherokee Organics: It is just that deathly dependence between petro-chemical industry and agriculture that really worries me. Food production is on totally unsustainable foundation right now, has been from days of Green Revolution. We can survive without stereos and cheap plastic junk made in other side of globe, but having agriculture that depends on non-renewable resources is recipe for disaster. Fortunately, here in my country, there are many good things that agri-biz model has not displaced...yet. Most farming is done in (relatively) small-scale, family-based farms. Field sizes are actually not that big, field are regularly split by forest areas. Forest and field areas are sharing same space, and inter-pollinating on the way. No corn fields from horizon to horizon here, you can walk through almost any field in relatively short time. But fossil fuel dependency, it is here of course... Fallowing works very well here, and life cycle of meadow phase includes bewildering array of species, both plant and animal. Famines you mentioned... It is cold here, man. Really, really cold. Bad harvests just happen because of that. That is reason why hunting is even today national hobby here. Got to have those skills. There is not even word in English to translate our deeply meaningful word for survival skills in nature..."erätaito". You have to have skills to pay your family's bills, or leave the stage. Living through winter here without fossil fuel input is hard for anyone. Explains a lot about national mentality here...

I think the error is a bit more subtle than is evident from what you write. In particular, traditional cultures tend to be relatively dynamic and innovative in their own way, but they innovate differently.<br><br>One interesting data point here (besides Victor Turners works on Ndembo ritual) is in comparing La Tene swordmaking techniques to Roman equivalents. The La Tene craftsmen were far more traditional than the Romans, but they developed, over hundreds of years of steady effort, the methods of ironworking that would win out in terms of weapons through the first half of the Middle Ages.<br><br>The two things you have to remember is that early iron was significantly worse for tools than late era bronze was. It had the major advantages of being cheap and locally available however and so while the Romans focused on mass production of weapons, the La Tene Celts spent their effort trying to make weapons like their older bronze ones. In essence the Romans looked at the new material and said "how can we make weapons in new ways?" while the Celts looked at the new material and asked "how can we make weapons as good as the ones we are used to?"<br><br>Over hundreds of years you can see the La Tene smiths going from trying to apply bronzeworking techniques to iron (with no success of course) to developing case hardening and early steel, which was used in making heterogenous iron/steel swords.<br><br>The first error in the story of the individual who turns his back on tradition is this idea that traditions are static things. The second is that they don't innovate. They do, but they assume (rightly I think) that the people who have mastered the old ways are the best at creating new ways. It is the innovation of Homer or Pindar instead of the innovation of Longsfellow or Whitman.<br><br>The question (which I think is what you are asking here) is what is the relationship between the past and the future? We are told from when we are young that we should break free from the past, and there are countless ways we (in our society) use this to victimize people. To this question, perhaps, it is best not to have only one answer.....<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c5585427736626858740 title="comment permalink">5/7/13, 2:23 AM</a><br><br>

Did they get wiped out by the Innuit? Did they intermarry and get absorbed? It is hard to say.<br><br>What is pretty clear however based on what is known is that what doomed them as a Scandinavian culture was their dependence on wood particularly for shipbuilding as well as construction, and the fact that the increase in ice in the North Atlantic made this very problematic. <br><br>Mr Diamond for example suggests they build opulent cathedrals, but the cathedral in Greenland was basically no different than a dwelling or a barn except that it had a bell imported from Norway (I guess that must make it opulent). Cut off from trans-Atlantic trade and possibly even from harvesting wood in the New World, the Norse Greenlanders as such could not have survived long.

I've long thought that it's vital to learn something completely new and unfamiliar every few years, and learn it thoroughly -- that's one of the few ways to avoid the mental fossilization that otherwise sets in during middle age." <br><br>That's certainly true, however, the truth of the matter is that a science is not on the top of my to-learn list. The main reason for my regret is that my high school taught exactly two things well: math and physics. Everything else was busy work and largely a waste of time. I made good use of the math program, but for largely misguided reasons, not of the physics program. That opportunity is now gone. I could recreate it for myself if I wanted to badly enough, but at least at this stage of my life, I'm prioritizing other things. <br><br>It so happens that I've mostly used foreign languages for the purpose that you cite, namely the avoidance of mental fossilization. It helps that this is something that I also thoroughly enjoy. I've studied four in my life, two starting as a child, and two starting as an adult, and I speak them with various degrees of fluency (from very basic to native-like). I find that, at any given time, I can make room for one serious intellectual commitment that is independent of my professional work, but if I try doing more than one, it quickly becomes counterproductive. The balance may be different for other people, but this is what it is for me. Well, there are quite a few things that are independent of my professional work that I'd like to learn, and learn thoroughly, but given the fact that it'll have to happen one (and no more than one) at a time, chances are that science will remain simply a missed opportunity of my adolescence. <br><br>On a note that is completely unrelated to the above, but much closer to the subject of your post, I was wondering if you were going to say anything about what gives people with radically different perceptions of time a sense of purpose. I can see fairly easily what might give a sense of purpose to the believers in Progress, and also to those who see time as a cycle or have a vision of Dreamtime, but I'm having a really hard time envisioning what might motivate someone with Hesiod's vision of relentless and inevitable decline to move forward. Other than perhaps crude sexual desire, what might motivate such a person to bring children into this world? I'd be grateful if you could shed some light on that.<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c6972385050194589615 title="comment permalink">5/7/13, 3:00 AM</a><br><br>

Why? Because everyone else in Greece thought they knew something, and he alone recognized that he knew nothing. Wisdom is not the same thing as knowing the truth; as I see it, at least, it starts with the cold awareness that we can't know the truth -- all we can do is create models of our experience that more or less seem to explain part of the cosmos around us. In my view, that existential modesty is the foundation of wisdom, as it is also the foundation of tolerance and compassion -- you'll probably have noticed that those who think they know the unvarnished truth tend to be very deficient in these latter virtues. All this will be coming up for discussion later on in this series of posts.<br><br>I have come to the conclusion that there is a subtle but very important problem at heart of philosophy regarding this formulation of truth seeking. It can be found at the center of the esoteric or “mystery” teaching of the Platonic Socrates from the dialogue titled Symposium, the only dialogue about the gods. Socrates relates a vision of truth seeking in this dialogue that uses erotic love as the most useful and accessible analogy for the movement of the soul towards wisdom. Eroticism is described as both goal oriented and resourceful, and painfully aware of the absence of its object. For the sake of analogy, the erotic love of a beautiful woman or man is experienced by a clear understanding of their beauty and desirability, and by the awareness of their absence, distance, etc. It doesn’t matter if the man or woman is completely out of your league, so long as the remotest possibility remains the erotic desire will seek some path to success.<br><br>However, the knowledge that no such person exists is destructive of erotic passion. In philosophy this is experienced by the subtle and slow advancement of provisional truths and limitations regarding the possibility of wisdom. Also, in a funny way, by the increasing assertions of the value of philosophy by philosophers (consider only Aristotle, who should have known better!). Eventually this can lead slowly towards those heaviest thoughts of Zarathustra and the antagonism between knowledge and life that inspired much of Nietzsche’s writing, and of course worse things as well.<br><br>The point is subtle. Is there really so much difference between “I know I know nothing” and “the truth can’t be known?” I think somewhere above there was mention of the first puzzle of the Tao “The Tao that can be spoken is not the real Tao.” Of course this was not meant to be read “the Tao cannot be known.” It does mean that the puzzle of knowing the Tao is not going to be easy.<br><br>-p<br><br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c7883686498851384392 title="comment permalink">5/7/13, 10:20 AM</a><br><br>

Up here in the far north, nature has always been more threatening than other humans, and mass fighting has historically been rare. It's a cinematic idea really, perhaps easier to entertain because of the warlike image of the Norse and the alienness of the Inuit hunters.<br><br>Even once the Inuit had migrated south to where the Norse colonies were placed, they settled on the outer parts of the fjords, while the Norse lived deep within the fjords. They were barely competing for the same resources, the Inuit primarily being hunters while the Norse were pastoralists and part-time fishermen. They probably did have hostile encounters occasionally, but I wouldn't be surprised if more Norse were killed by other Norse than by Inuits. On the other hand there is evidence of friendly relations. Norse artifacts, particularly metal tools and weapons, have been found in both Inuit and Dorset camps within Greenland and in the Canadian Arctic. Inuit items have likewise been found in Norse ruins. It makes a lot more sense that the groups would trade with each other, given that they had very different skills and specializations. Depictions of the Norse in Inuit art also usually show them as farmers and fishermen, not warriors.<br><br>However I don't doubt for a second that the Greenland Norse looked down on the Inuit.<br><br>As for the dependence of wood, yes it was likely an issue but possibly not as much of a life and death issue as has often been supposed. In Iceland, it's a popular idea that the country was crippled by a shortage of wood for shipbuilding; it's a lesser known fact that there was enough driftwood for all the basic needs of building houses, boats, tools and furniture. Imported wood was more of a luxury desired by the elites for various types of "opulence" as per Diamond's comments on Greenland churches (which are correct I guess). But opulent churches are of course not needed for survival, so lack of imported wood for luxuries did not doom Iceland, only frustrate its wealthier inhabitants. <br><br>Now, I don't think the inner fjords of Greenland get as much driftwood coming their way as the shores of Iceland, so that solution would not apply there. There are however very interesting Icelandic annal entries from 1347 stating that a ship arrived with a shipment of wood from "Markland", after drifting off course. No further details, as if that were a wholly unremarkable thing. "Markland" is believed to be the coast of Labrador. The implication is that the Greenland Norse harvested wood from the North American forests. This is in fact also supported by studies of the wood used in their ships: it's mostly larch, which does not grow in Greenland.<br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c2402508871530016731 title="comment permalink">5/7/13, 12:51 PM</a><br><br>

I suspect that it came to him after his youth, after he experienced, as you say "the subtle and slow advancement of provisional truths and limitations regarding the possibility of wisdom".<br><br>If this is true, then there is value in the pursuit of truth. On the simplest rung, are the people who have never questioned their belief systems, and wouldn't even think of doing so. Then you have those who think of pursuing truth, and of those only a few will push that pursuit past the earliest discomforts, in which truth might make them uncomfortable in some way. And from those last, a few might begin to realize the size and nature of the problem, coming to the suspicion or conviction that they cannot ultimately know the truth. And if this is, as JMG states, the beginning of wisdom, then surely the pursuit of truth is of value.<br><br>I have certainly thought of erotic love as a good analogy for the soul's journey toward the divine; I'm having to rethink that a bit to use it for the pursuit of wisdom, but they are very close.<br><br>Can you explain a little what you mean about the antagonism between knowledge and life? <br>I'm afraid I have to confess I tried to read Nietzsche and couldn't seem to get into his communication style.<br><br>I do not think the two statements are the same, and as to whether the truth can't be known, that is a definite statement that almost contradicts the former statement. If I know nothing, what do I know of all the possibilities in the cosmos and for the future of my being? I am not sure but I suspect that when JMG says we can't know ultimate truth, he means that is our situation now and here.<br><br>As for the opening verse in the Tao, that seems like a slightly different point. The Tao that can be expressed in language is not the thing in itself, is what I think it means.<br><br>That problem at the heart of philosophy is exactly what I'm arguing about, isn't it?

I think a case can be made that the young Socrates was not nearly as modest in his claims for wisdom as we find in the version created by Plato. Consider only the impetus for Aristophanes scathing critique in the Clouds or even Plato’s hints in the Parmenides. Certainly wisdom relies on hard-won experience to some degree.<br><br>As far as I can tell, the western “dialectic” philosophical method arrives at wisdom through an exhaustive critical analysis of all claims for complete discursive knowledge. This method attracts a certain type of soul that enjoys the competitive exercises of learning. Ultimately that can be a serious problem, as many of these young philosophers can grow quite ugly as they become more confident in their abilities. Consider reading Plato’s Theaetetus for a discussion of the nature of the philosophical soul.<br><br>The conflict between knowledge and life is one way to articulate nihilism. Nihilism is a pathological condition of the soul. The nihilist is convinced that there is no basis in reality for our moral and intellectual aspirations. They are convinced that truth is an illusion with the purpose to advance the power of the individual adherent. Conviction in this knowledge becomes destructive of the moral and intellectual life of man because this knowledge undermines our commitment to the value of our aspirations. We live in a culture deeply informed by a nihilistic and proto-nihilistic intellectual tradition, so I am sure you are familiar with the above description. Incidentally, nihilist thinking can be traced back to the very beginning of our western philosophical tradition: it is not a new or particularly modern problem. It has, however, become a much more common world view in the last 50 years or so, and that is probably a significant weakness in our “social capital” as we enter the long descent.<br><br>I’m okay with your formulation of the Tao puzzle, just keep in mind that as a puzzle it is more of an invitation than a conclusion.<br><br>Here’s another puzzle for you. How do you know what ends are of “paramount importance?” Consider this: part of the problem of nihilism is found in the nature of those moral and intellectual aspirations. It just might be that we’re erotically barking up the wrong trees! <br><br>-p<br><br><br><a href=the-shape-of-time.html#c4075513229281166546 title="comment permalink">5/10/13, 10:30 AM</a><br><br>

I've declined to wade through quite a few philosophical treatises once I found that such and such a philosopher came to conclusions that seemed nonsense.

I haven't come across such a negative tradition in the eastern philosophies; perhaps it does exist. What are its ancient root causes in the west?

As for me, I have a very strong sense of the value and reality of morality, even for atheists.<br><br>By ends of paramount importance, I refer to the existence of God or consciousness as a primary reality, an understanding of nature and our place in it, the relationship of consciousness to the body, what we are, that sort of thing.

I know this one is far from current, but I had to share:<br>I remember confronting my own perception of time when I was about thirteen. One of the few teachers I had ever encouraged critical thinking, and one day a particularly insightful promoter of it asked the class how they imagined the passage of time, and everyone but me insisted it was a foward moving straight line, while I raised my hand in an attempt to explain that I saw it as cyclical. I can't remember how or why I came to such a divergent concept to my peers (possibly due to an early interest in astrology and the cycle of seasons/ages/processes implied within - of course it's anyone's guess why I automatically agreed with those assumptions when introduced to them), but I do remember how alienated and baffled I felt. First, there was incredulousness and outrage: I knew I was right and couldn't imagine how they'd all think differently. Second, self-doubt when I realized I was in a very small minority. I was shocked at the unanimous agreement within the culture around me. I wonder if my classmates would have all agreed that time brings overwhelming improvement, as well. Probably.<br>Had I agreed with the majority in that class, for whatever reason, I doubt I would be able to enjoy your post or agree with it as much.
