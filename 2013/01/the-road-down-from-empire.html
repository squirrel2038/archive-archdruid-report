<div class=MsoNormal>
Here in the Appalachians, at least, there’s something about the month of January that encourages sober thoughts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Maybe it’s the weather, which is pretty reliably gray and cold; maybe it’s the arrival of the bills from the holiday season just ended, or the awkward way that those bills usually arrive about the same time that the annual crop of New Year’s resolutions start landing in the recycle bin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Pick your reason, but one way or another it seems like a good time to circle back and finish up the theme I’ve been developing here for most of a year now, the decline and fall of America’s global empire and the difficult task of rebuilding something worthwhile in its wake. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The hard work of reinventing democracy in a post-imperial America, the subject of several of last month’s posts, is only one facet of this broader challenge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve mentioned before that the pursuit of empire is a drug, and like most other drugs, it makes you feel great at the time and then wallops you the next morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s been just over a hundred years now since the United States launched itself on its path to global empire, and the hangover that was made inevitable by that century-long bender is waiting in the wings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I suspect one of the reasons the US government is frantically going through the empties in the trash, looking for one that still has a few sips left in it, is precisely that first dim dawning awareness of just how bad the hangover is going to be. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s worth taking a few moments to go over some of the more visible signposts of the road down from empire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>To begin with, the US economy has been crippled by a century of imperial tribute flowing in from overseas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s what happened to our manufacturing sector; once the rest of the industrial world recovered from the Second World War, manufacturers in an inflated tribute economy couldn’t compete with the lower costs of factories in less extravagantly overfunded parts of the world, and America’s industrial heartland turned into the Rust Belt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the impact of the tribute economy spread throughout US society, in turn, it became next to impossible to make a living doing anything productive, and gaming the imperial system in one way or another—banking, investment, government contracts, you name it—turned into the country’s sole consistent growth industry. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That imposed distortions on every aspect of American society, which bid fair to cripple its ability to pick up the pieces when the empire goes away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As productive economic sectors withered, the country’s educational system reoriented itself toward the unproductive, churning out an ever-expanding range of administrative specialties for corporations and government while shutting down what was once a world-class system of vocational and trade schools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We now have far more office fauna than any sane society needs, and a drastic shortage of people who have any less abstract skill set.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For the time being, we can afford to offshore jobs, or import people from other countries to do them at substandard wages; as our empire winds down and those familiar bad habits stop being possible, the shortage of Americans with even the most basic practical skills will become a massive economic burden. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile the national infrastructure is caught in a downward spiral of malign neglect made inevitable by the cash crunch that always hits empires on the way down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Empire is an expensive habit;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the long-term effects of the imperial wealth pump on those nations subjected to its business end mean that the income from imperial arrangements goes down over time, while the impact of the tribute economy at home generally causes the costs of empire go up over time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The result can be seen on Capitol Hill day by day, as one fantastically expensive weapons system after another sails through Congress with few dissenting votes, while critically important domestic programs are gutted by bipartisan agreement, or bog down in endless bickering.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The reliable result is a shell of a nation, seemingly strong when observed from outside but hollowing out within, and waiting for the statistically inevitable shove that will launch it on its final skid down the rough slope into history’s compost bin. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You may well be thinking, dear reader, that the logical response of a nation caught in a predicament of this sort would be to bite the bullet, back away from empire in a deliberate fashion, and use the last bit of income from the tribute economy to pay for the expenses of rebuilding a domestic economy of a more normal kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>You’d be right, too, but there are compelling reasons why very few empires in history have had the great good sense to manage their decline in this manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Imperial China did it in the fifteenth century, scrapping a burgeoning maritime empire in the Indian Ocean, and of course Britain did it after 1945, though that was largely because a 500-pound gorilla named the United States was sitting on Britannia’s prostrate body, informing her politely that in future, the global empire would be American, thank you very much; other than that, examples are few and far between. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The logic here is easy to follow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Any attempt to withdraw from imperial commitments will face concerted resistance from those who profit from the status quo, while those who claim to oppose empire are rarely willing to keep supporting a policy of imperial retreat once it turns out, as it inevitably does, that the costs of that policy will include a direct impact on their own incomes or the value of their investments. Thus politicians who back a policy of withdrawal from empire can count on being pilloried by their opponents as traitors to their country, and abandoned by erstwhile allies who dislike empire in the abstract but want to retain lifestyles that only an imperial tribute economy can support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since politicians are, after all, in the business of getting into office and staying there, their enthusiasm for such self-sacrificing policies is understandably limited. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The usual result is a frantic effort to kick the can as far as possible down the road, so that somebody else has to deal with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of what’s going on in Washington DC these days can be described very exactly in those terms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Despite popular rhetoric, America’s politicians these days are not unusually wicked or ignorant; they are, by and large, roughly as ethical as their constituents, and rather better educated—though admittedly neither of these is saying much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What distinguishes them from the statesmen of an earlier era, rather, is that they are face to face with an insoluble dilemma that their predecessors in office spent the last few decades trying to ignore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the costs of empire rise, the profits of empire dwindle, the national economy circles the drain, the burden of deferred maintenance on the nation’s infrastructure grows, and the impact of the limits to growth on industrial civilization worldwide becomes ever harder to evade, they face the unenviable choice between massive trouble now and even more massive trouble later; being human, they repeatedly choose the latter, and console themselves with the empty hope that something might turn up. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a common hope these days. I’ve commented here more than once about the way that the Rapture, the Singularity, and all the other apocalyptic fantasies on offer these days serve primarily as a means by which people can pretend to themselves that the future they’re going to get isn’t the one that their actions and evasions are busily creating for them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The same is true of a great many less gaudy fictions about the future—the much-ballyhooed breakthroughs that never quite get around to happening, the would-be mass movements that never attract anyone but the usual handful of activists, the great though usually unspecified leaps in consciousness that will allegedly happen any day now, and all the rest of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The current frenzy of meretricious twaddle in the media about how shale gas is going to make the US a net energy exporter gets a good share of its impetus from the same delusive hope—though admittedly the fact that a great many people have invested a great deal of money in companies in the fracking business, and are trying to justify their investments using the same sort of reasoning that boosted the late housing bubble, also has more than a little to do with it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s likely to be plenty more of the same thing in the decades ahead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Social psychologists have written at length about what James Howard Kunstler has usefully termed the psychology of previous investment, the process by which people convince themselves to throw bad money after good, or to remain committed to a belief system even though all available evidence demonstrates that it isn’t true and doesn’t work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The critical factor in such cases is the emotional cost of admitting that the decision to buy the stock, adopt the belief system, or make whatever other mistake is at issue, was in fact a mistake. The more painful it is to make that admission, the more forcefully most people will turn away from the necessity to do so, and it’s safe to assume that they’ll embrace the most consummate malarkey if doing so allows them to insist to themselves that the mistake wasn’t a mistake after all.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As America stumbles down from its imperial peak,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in other words, the one growth industry this country will have left will consist of efforts to maintain the pretense that America doesn’t have an empire, that the empire isn’t falling, and that the fall doesn’t matter anyway. (Yes, those statements are mutually contradictory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Get used to it; you’ll be hearing plenty of statements in the years to come that are even more more incoherent.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the decline accelerates, anyone who offers Americans a narrative that allows them to pretend they’ll get the shiny new future that our national mythology promises them will be able to count on a large and enthusiastic audience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The narratives being marketed for this purpose need not be convincing; they need not even be sane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So long as they make it possible for Americans to maintain the fiction of a brighter future in the teeth of the facts, they’ll be popular. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The one bit of hope I can offer here is that such efforts at collective make-believe don’t last forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Sooner or later, the fact of decline will be admitted and, later still, accepted; sooner or later, our collective conversation will shift from how America can maintain perpetual growth to how America can hold onto what it has, then to how America can recover some of what it lost, and from there to figuring out how America—or whatever grab bag of successor societies occupies the territory currently held by the United States—can get by in the harsh new deindustrial world that grew up around it while nobody was looking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s a normal process in an age of decline, and can be traced in the literature of more than one civilization before ours. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It bears remembering, though, that individuals are going through the same process of redefinition all by themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This process differs from the five stages of peak oil, which I’ve discussed elsewhere, in that it’s not primarily about the emotional impact of loss; it’s a matter of expectations, and of the most pragmatic sort of economic expectations at that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Consider a midlevel managerial employee in some corporation or other whose job, like so many other jobs these days, is about to go away forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Before the rumors start flying, she’s concerned mostly with clawing her way up the corporate ladder and increasing her share of the perks and privileges our society currently grants to its middle classes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Then the rumors of imminent layoffs start flying, and she abruptly has to shift her focus to staying employed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The pink slips come next, bearing bad news, and her focus shifts again, to getting a new job; when that doesn’t happen and the reality of long term joblessness sinks in, a final shift of focus takes place, and she has to deal with a new and challenging world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This has already happened to a great many people in America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s going to happen, over the years ahead, to a great many more—probably, all things considered, to a large majority of people in the American middle class, just as it happened to a large majority of the industrial working class a few decades further back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Not everyone, it has to be said, will survive the transition; alcoholism, drug abuse, mental and physical illness, and suicide are among the standard risks run by the downwardly mobile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A fair number of those who do survive will spend the rest of their lives clinging to the vain hope that something will happen and give them back what they lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a long, rough road down from empire, and the losses involved are not merely material in nature. Basing one’s identity on the privileges and extravagances made possible by the current US global empire may seem like a silly thing to do, but it’s very common.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>To lose whatever markers of status are respected in any given social class, whether we’re talking about a private jet and a Long Island mansion, a fashionable purse and a chic condo in an upscale neighborhood, or a pickup and a six-pack, can be tantamount to losing one’s identity if that identity has no more solid foundation—and a great many marketing firms have spent decades trying to insure that most Americans never think of looking for more solid foundations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That last point has implications we’ll be exploring in a later sequence of posts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For the time being, though, I want to talk a bit about what all this means to those of my readers who have already come to terms with the reality of decline, and are trying to figure out how to live their lives in a world in which the conventional wisdom of the last three hundred years or so has suddenly been turned on its head. The first and, in many ways, the most crucial point is one that’s been covered here repeatedly already:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>you are going to have to walk the road down from empire yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nobody else is going to do it for you, and you can’t even assume that anybody else will make it easier for you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What you can do, to make it a little easier than it will otherwise be, is to start walking it before you have to. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That means, to return to a slogan I’ve used more than once in this blog, using LESS—Less Energy, Stuff, and Stimulation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The more energy you need to maintain your everyday lifestyle, the more vulnerable you’ll be to sudden disruptions when the sprawling infrastructure that supplies you with that energy starts having running into serious trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Today, routine blackouts and brownouts of the electrical grid, and rationing or unpredictable availability of motor fuel, have become everyday facts of life in Third World nations that used to have relatively reliable access to energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As America’s global empire unravels and the blowback from a century of empire comes home to roost, we can expect the same thing here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Get ready for that in advance, and you won’t face a crisis when it happens. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same is true of the extravagant material inputs most Americans see as necessities, and of the constant stream of sensory stimulation that most Americans use to numb themselves to the unwelcome aspects of their surroundings and their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You will be doing without those at some point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The sooner you learn how to get by in their absence, the better off you’ll be—and the sooner you get out from under the torrent of media noise you’ve been taught to use to numb yourself, the sooner you can start assessing the world around you with a relatively clear head, and the sooner you’ll notice just how far down the arc of America’s descent we’ve already come. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Using LESS isn’t the only thing that’s worth doing in advance, of course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve discussed elsewhere, for example, the need to develop the skills that will enable you to produce goods or provide services for other people, using relatively simple tools and, if at all possible, the energy of your own muscles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the imperial tribute economy winds down and the United States loses the ability to import cheap goods and cheap labor from abroad, people will still need goods and services, and will pay for them with whatever measure of value is available—even if that amounts to their own unskilled labor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are plenty of other steps that can be taken to prepare for life in a post-imperial society skidding down the far side of Hubbert’s peak, and the sooner you start taking those steps, the better prepared you will be to cope with that unfamiliar world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, it may be possible to go further than that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In several of December’s posts here I raised the possibility that, in the wake of empire, the deliberate cultivation of certain core skills—specifically, clear reasoning, public speaking, and democratic process—might make it possible to kickstart a revival of America’s formerly vibrant democratic traditions. The same principle, I’d like to suggest, may be able to be applied more generally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Certain core insights that were central to pre-imperial America’s more praiseworthy achievements, but were tossed into the dumpster during the rush to empire, could be revived and put back to work in the post-imperial era.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If that can be done at all, it’s going to involve a lot of work and a willingness to challenge some widely held notions of contemporary American culture, but I think the attempt is worth making.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We’ll begin that discussion next week. </div>

The mention about education sparked a memory.<br><br>I read an article this week observing that our education system has become obsessively fixated on leadership. Yes, our kids are tomorrows leaders (sounds like a marketing slogan), but I read this slogan actually being used in the article. <br><br>If you think about it, it is quite disturbing because it implies an expectation of issuing orders and having someone else do the work.<br><br>There was a classic quote from the 80's film Caddyshack that seems somehow appropriate to me in this instance, "Son. The world needs ditch diggers too."<br><br>I was thinking about all of the comments last week in relation to radioactive pollution. It seems that this is another phenomena that is consistent with the general theory put forward in the Limits to Growth. Radiation is just another pollutant after all. Like water availability here, it will probably be a factor limiting the ultimate long term size of the human population? Dunno really, but it is certainly a factor, albeit a rather unpleasant one.<br><br>If infrastructure is being catabolised, then it is all about appearance.<br><br>It is 40 degrees Celsius (about 104 Fahrenheit) here today in the shade and it is hard not to sound like I'm whingeing, but I'm seriously over summer. I think by and large when people in cooler climates think about the possibilities of global warming they think of it as a linear event. You know how it goes, an extra 2 degrees over winter would be really nice! However, it is my observation - not backed up by science - that whilst the temperature average increases, the peaks just get more extreme as more energy is fed into the system. The heat and lack of rainfall here are not unprecedented (only 1939 was more extreme in terms of heat, just), but like the record breaking rains last summer, they are at the extreme upper end of the variations in records.<br><br>Also, I was really quite impressed with your simple observation that any usage of non-renewable materials is unsustainable. This is an inconvenient fact that we try our best to ignore (much like acknowledging the certainty of our own deaths). As a society we tend to focus on the complex and the abstract when there are perfectly serviceable and simple solutions available and I saw this in some of the more cornucopian comments last week.<br><br>I've been wondering too for some time now about those unemployed citizens of the US that have had their benefits cut off after 99 weeks of unemployment. Have they fallen off the statistics? The head of the US Federal Reserve has stated that the program of quantitative easing will not cease until unemployment is at 6.5%. <br><br>Food for the brain as usual!<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c884445275613722913 title="comment permalink">1/16/13, 10:58 PM</a><br><br>

It documents the 1905 diplomatic mission to Hawaii, Japan, China, Philippines, and Korea. It is a heart rending look at the beginnings of American empire, actions that are still generating waves of Ugly Americanism. The Cruise also highlights racism of White Aryan supremacy (British and American at the very highest levels) versus "Pacific Negroes" and the Japanese "Honorary Aryans." Teddy –and William Taft - carried a big stick, but it is bouncing back to hit the US in the head.<br><br><a href=#c2425055708202537731 title="comment permalink">1/16/13, 11:32 PM</a><br><br>

A couple of weeks back I mentioned the issue of the per capita allocation of Oil in the US. The reason was because of the graph that you linked to from JH Kunstler's blog (which had further graphs) which showed that despite jettisoning some of your Industrial base, the consumption of Oil was still quite relatively high in the US.<br><br>World supply of Oil has effectively peaked for a few years and flat-lined so I've been wondering about how this works in the real world on a per capita basis if the population continues to increase in whatever fashion.<br><br>Perhaps, and I could be wrong, but the illusion of growth could only be maintained through the jettisoning of that Industrial base, otherwise harsh decisions would have had to be made on an allocation of energy per capita basis? There seems no other explanation for the continued high consumption (despite the small dip), although I'd like to be proven wrong.<br><br>In addition to this, the process of sticking it in the neck to the working classes, can also be construed as an attempt to continue with business as usual and the maintenance of appearances. Again, I'd like to be proven wrong, but pushing a portion of the population into poverty allows many other portions of the population to continue with business as usual in a declining resources scenario and maintain energy availability on a per capita basis.<br><br>You could almost view the continued depreciation of the built infrastructure from the same perspective.<br><br>Yikes!<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c8768774220020635480 title="comment permalink">1/17/13, 12:04 AM</a><br><br>

Using it yesterday for the first time, I couldn’t help but wish (more than I usually do) that my grandmothers were still alive, as their children, my parents, have no experience with such matters or machines. They've choosen instead, like many of their era, to depend on the grocery store for all their needs.<br><br>I also couldn’t help but think that I would like to be a different sort of parent to my kids when they are adults. I want to be relevant in their daily lives as a resource for knowledge and skills that I can share with them—perhaps they will be less likely to stick me in a home, should there still be such places. What an opportunity I have, think I, to be the first generation in several to realign our family’s social structure whereby elders have something of value to teach youngers, and are kept about the place at least in part because of this value.

You have a real talent for taking the seemingly disparate realities of the current age, weaving them together with their historical context and then presenting commonsense and workable ideas for dealing with these realities and improving lives on a personal level. <br><br>You've also piqued my interest in Druid philosophy/spirituality and prompted me to begin to delve deeper through my own research on the subject. <br><br>I realize you tend to keep the discourse about your spirituality mostly sidelined on this blog and understand why; although I can feel and am thankful for the undercurrent of it throughout all of your writing here. Still, I wonder if you might not write a bit more explicitly about your spiritual beliefs here in the near future. Even in my cursory research I'm beginning to see that it could really help people as they adjust to the more resource-limited reality of a post-industrial America.<br><br>One of my concerns as the empire winds down and the lie of exponential growth is painfully exposed in people's everyday lives is that fanatical religious dogmas ramp up as a way to escape the new reality and scapegoat other segments of society.

When you pose to folks that you think there's just a global long-term permanent one-way economic contraction and there is no way that the U.S. can buck that trend forever, I often see folks actually seem to think I might have a point. But then they pull out what seems to be a standard piece of rural mythology: "Well, we've been poor around here before, we know how to do it again." But they say this while standing beside their SUV and repeatedly glancing down at their smart phone. I don't think they really do remember how to be poor, if they are under 80 years old. We are even more dependent on the automobile than urbanites are. I think they believe they can just hunt and garden their way away from starvation; but they have no idea how to do either of these without regular trips to the Mall*Wart for chinese-made provisions and equipment (never mind the fact that if the local population really did start relying on game for survival the White-tailed Deer, Wild Turkey, and both local species of squirrel would be extirpated in a year or two).<br><br><a href=#c1395818393728021337 title="comment permalink">1/17/13, 6:07 AM</a><br><br>

In Vietnam it was 8 percent. under Reagan it was 6 percent. today, despite the wars, it is about 4 and 1/2 percent and falling. <br>our deficit has little to do with defense costs, and much to do with paying too much for the past (the elderly) and not enough for the future (education and infrastructure). <br>the answer is to pay higher taxes, as the Nordics do. no one will say that now, but eventually they will.<br>as for the awesome results of peak oil to which you point: this is an issue that i have taken very seriously for many years. yes, it will be a problem. but the vast amount of waste and mis-investemnt in contemporary American society means there is a LOT of low-hanging fruit for rationing by price or by coupons.

Wrenching as the transition from Empire is going to be, I think there is one great untapped resource that we sometimes underestimate - namely the fact that most people are not happy or fulfilled in this society. I don't mean that to dispute or diminish the many ways that you have pointed out how reluctant people will be to give up their privilege - only that when it happens the people who can physically and psychologically survive it, will find themselves no worse off - and perhaps better off than they were.

For one thing, we'll have plenty of infrastructure to catabolize for some time. On the other hand, though, all of our trade policies, tax structure, and regulations of all kinds are set up to make productive economic activity prohibitively difficult. In other words, it's not just the brownouts, rationing, and dearth of skilled workers, but it's the political legacy as well that will hamper the US economy in its attempts to recover some higher level of functionality. I see these posts as aiming at that set of issues where much of the green wizardry was aiming at making do with LESS.<br><br>"What distinguishes them from the statesmen of an earlier era, rather, is that they are face to face with an insoluble dilemma that their predecessors in office spent the last few decades trying to ignore."<br><br>This comment goes a long way to explaining why those on the political right lionize Reagan while pretending that the pols they've elected since don't exist, while those on the political left long for the days of FDR, totally ignoring the reality of how both Obama and Clinton governed.<br><br>"The critical factor in such cases is the emotional cost of admitting that the decision to buy the stock, adopt the belief system, or make whatever other mistake is at issue, was in fact a mistake."<br><br>That one hits home for me. For much of my life a good chunk of my identity has been wrapped up in not being wrong. I'm still working on unpacking it and dealing with the baggage, but at least I'm at the point of being willing to be wrong (even if I don't like it). Just that step has allowed me many new avenues of education and growth.<br><br>Looking forward to the continuation of December's very interesting thread.

You can get a Byzantine legal document, that would have looked pretty familiar to the ruling Paleologoi, even today. I gather, namely, that if as an American or Canadian you are given permission to visit the monasteries of Mount Athos, you are issued a kind of Byzantine-Empire visa, unique to Athos, on top of your more conventional Greek visiting-tourist stamp-in-passport formalities, and that the appearance and wording of the visa are eminently pre-1453. <br><br>Perhaps you can at some stage give us your thoughts?<br><br><a href=#c2874105005050455410 title="comment permalink">1/17/13, 8:28 AM</a><br><br>

We once had a street car system that was the envy of the world and it was powered entirely by electricity provided by St. Anthony Falls, not coal or nuclear or natural gas. This system was scrapped in the 50s and replaced by buses, the street cars were sold to Mexico and the rails paved over. But today, everytime they tear up a street for repair the beautiful paving bricks and old street car rails are exposed, reminding everyone- and all are in agreement about this- of what a better system we once had and "if only we could have that again". This serves as a counter narrative to the myth of "progress": that seemingly indestructable belief that things always get better. And there are many elderly people here who still remember the Great Depression, which destroyed the faith in the ponzi scheme we call free market capitalism for millions of working people and forced them to become self and neighborly reliant. So we haven't all abandoned the local and the public, despite the powerful forces lined up against us. People here still fight hard for public parks, schools and libraries- most people vote overwhelmingly for the continued funding of these things. This is what gives me hope as we relearn the skills of self reliance but also of taking care of our friends, family and neighbors. The more we move away from our isolating, self-preservation instincts and acknowledge that we're all in this together the easier, I believe, the transition to a more sustainable way of life will be for everyone.<br><br><a href=#c7335289564184294423 title="comment permalink">1/17/13, 9:26 AM</a><br><br>

But I don't want that life even if I could have it; it strikes me as boring beyond belief. Too often the people who do it are not much more than overgrown children in attitude. In the preindustrial past, elders had an important role: they were the carriers of culture, the holders of memories and the group's past, the ones who passed on knowledge and wisdom through stories and example.

Two of my cousins live in Japan and have started families over there and I believe Japan is in better shape than the UK because it has far more social captial than we do and its business elite have a greater sense of duty to the general public and to the nation than our financial elite who are totally irresponsible to the point of being sociopaths.<br><br><a href=#c5626079182996400806 title="comment permalink">1/17/13, 11:54 AM</a><br><br>

I have had this feeling, starting at late nineties, that interests and goals of working class and liberal middle class have drifted apart for good. Before reading your blog I never managed to see whole picture; I always observed particular circumstances coming with increasing frequency. Big picture is actually quite simple, as it always is, you just have to look from long distance. As there is even/decreasing amount of industrial wealth (=energy) to be shared between increasing population, middle classes threw working classes in front of firing squad, just to buy more fat times for themselves. As price of labour was put down to poverty level with iron heel of globalism, this was possible...for a while. Now there is new round going on. Upper middle class and managerial level is doing same thing for so called middle and lower segments of middle classes. To borrow terminology from old guard trade unionists, battle line of class warfare is moving upwards in pyramid. This actually explains SO much about this growing animosity and even hatred you can sense between liberal middle class and working class here in Europe. Working classes have been on downward curve of real income for quite a while; being poorer than your parents were is already reality for at least one generation of blue collars. Those old leftist-liberal dreams have already lost their appeal among at least one generation there. New images of identity are being formed right now, images of nationality and belonging by blood. Million dollar question is: what is going to be new self-image of former middle classes in not-so-distant future? Thanks for some widening of historical perspective, JMG. It is always jaw-dropping moment to even dimly perceive gargantuan, slow powers of historical change moving around you.<br><br>@Cherokee Organics (and JMG): Now I have took my time to reflect this earlier conservation about ploughing and farming. I have consulted some friends who are actually dirtying their hands by farming,i.e. true experts. I believe to have some answers for you, about farming more environmental-friendly with plough. Because this is widely off-topic in here, can I comment it in your blog or something..? Or is it some kind etiquette offense to comment it in here..?<br><br><a href=#c6457656946256982112 title="comment permalink">1/17/13, 1:35 PM</a><br><br>

I see them as the most spolit generation in history who have presided over the biggest misallocation of capital of all time. Many of them seem quite happy to scapegoat the working class as "chavs" and go along with the Tory narrative of blaming the unemployed as workshy scroungers. Only when reality hits their own grandchildren are they likely to change their attitude. <br><br>I think the younger generation of the middle class are going to leave university up to their eyeballs in debt and their will not be the jobs for them to lead the kind of middle class lifestyle their parents enjoyed. As a result they will become alienated and potentially politically quite dangerous. Apparently there was a report by the British Ministry of Defence back in 2007 which predicted that the younger generation of the middle class might form a revolutionary class taking on the role envisaged for the proletariat by Marx.<br><br><a href=#c3068633332466175041 title="comment permalink">1/17/13, 2:27 PM</a><br><br>

You're likely to be able to make contact with some experienced canners that way. <br><br>Drew, I'll consider it. I was very surprised by the positive reception my discussion of magic on this blog in the fall of 2011 received; if people can handle that, they might be able to handle a discussion of nature worship, experiential polytheism, and why the notion that religion is about having the right opinions about unknowable issues is among the most thoroughly exploded of all hypotheses around just now. <br><br>Bill, now I'm going to have to go back to last February and figure out what your question was...<br><br>Escape, fascinating. Thanks for the link. (I had to use the second link, though, since the first one has two missing slashes.) <br><br>Edde, I haven't taken a permaculture course, and haven't yet heard a really good reason why I should spend the considerable amount of money to do so. Of the people I know who have, some talk about how wonderful the course was, others describe it as "Green est" -- those who recall the human-potential cults of the '70s will get the reference -- and say they got more out of an afternoon reading books in the library, for much less money. So I'm not at all sure what to say. <br><br>Liquid, hang onto Batman. There's a place for things that aren't strictly pragmatic, too. (It's been a while, but I was a major fan of the Batman back in the 70s.) <br><br>Jen, nice! Now remember that every single one of these skills will need to be preserved or reinvented, and preservation is a *lot* easier. <br><br>Koho, at this point further robotic replacement of jobs is a sign that mythology has erased the last traces of common sense. With energy prices certain to rise over time, wages falling, plenty of skilled and unskilled labor ready to hand, and investments in new productive capacity pretty much guaranteed to bring negative returns in a falling economy, it's hard to think of a less productive investment -- and yet it'll happen for a while yet, because people are still stuck in the thinking patterns of a world that isn't there any more. <br><br>Barath, fascinating. I'll have to read some of his work. <br><br>Will, no, the tribute economy is quite real -- why do you think the 5% of humanity that lives in the US gets to use 25% of the world's energy production and 33% of its raw materials and industrial product? Your other points, while quite valid, are the reasons I cite to explain why the decline and fall of industrial society will be a long slow process rather than a sudden collapse. As for handloom weaving, we've got about a century before declining energy and collapsing infrastructure make that a viable career again, which makes it all the more important to preserve the techniques now, and pass them on, so they won't have to be reinvented later. <br><br>Andy, I see it as a parting of the ways. As industrial civilization unravels, those who can find new sources of meaning and value may do fairly well at life; those who can't -- and there will be a lot of them -- will not.

You can truck water in, but 16,000L (about 4,000 gallons) will cost you $220 and as things get drier, the waiting list gets longer. I have storage for 85,700 litres (about 22,500 gallons) but will definitely add an extra 22,500 litres capacity this year. <br><br>This is a good reminder as to why practical experience is so important as you can road test systems and skills. <br><br>All water is captured on the roof of the house, chook shed and shed. It is then stored in above ground tanks. It has to then be pumped back up hill to be of use. In a drought year (400mm), I will still be able to collect 120,000 litres (about 31,500 gallons) of rainfall from the roof catchment area. To replenish my storage though, means reduced consumption for many, many months.<br><br>The quality of the water from the water tanks is much better than town water. <br><br>The town water I suspect has a much higher bacterial count, or a different biology.<br><br>Any water that ends up being used in the orchard comes from my allocation of household water (and vegetables, herbs, chooks and bees) so this necessitates some compromises and uncertainty on my part! I won't go into that...<br><br>Down Under, drought is addressed through:<br>- shading (plant trees closer together);<br>- don't dig the top layer of vegetation, just cut it down and drop it where it falls (digging will lose the top soil to wind. Dead vegetation still holds the top soil together);<br>- water (if you can get it);<br>- mulch heavily (go hard with mulch as it acts like a blanket);<br>- get your trees slowly used to reduced watering so that they develop deeper root systems (cutting them off puts them into instant withdrawal - I saw a local council do this to some 100+ year old elm trees and the results weren't good, although they eventually pulled through); and<br>- be honest and recognise that you are in a drought and act accordingly.<br><br>I also have to keep a massive reserve on hand for fire fighting purposes so I can't use all of the stored water even if I really had to. There are lots of uncertainties.<br><br>By the way <a href=http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/heat-records-fall-as-sydney-sizzles/23289 rel=nofollow>Sydney just had its hottest day ever today</a>!<br><br>I'm interested to hear what you and other people do with your gardens in a drought?<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c2215266111417819996 title="comment permalink">1/17/13, 9:42 PM</a><br><br>

I've done that for a decade, and as a result, I'm having some difficulties with this discussion.<br><br>Post-collapse generations will understand their conditions to be "normal.” Yes, they won't have oil -- they won't have any use for it, either. Yes, they'll have nuclear waste to deal with -- they'll post areas as "haunted" and stay away, or the shamans will organize bioremediation based on ancient lore, or they'll just live on top of them and die young. Yes, the globe will be warmer, with consequent weather anomalies, and people will migrate, as they have been doing for at least 100,000 years. In short -- they'll be fine: poor, by our standards, but not by theirs.<br><br>This whole "crisis" is strictly about us. The trust-fund babies. The Civilized. The Disappointed.<br><br>But in a century, WE will all be dead, even the infants born this morning. In a century, the imperial catabolism won't be entirely over, but it will be well enough along that the slope to the bottom will no longer be precipitous. People will no longer be looking over a cliff. They may even be looking up again.<br><br>Presuming that we don't do something inexcusably stupid as a species -- like global thermonuclear war and another Permian-level extinction -- this entire discussion spans only the next century before The Disappointed are buried along with their unrealistic expectations.<br><br>So I'm having real trouble with the sense of urgency: this idea that we “have to DO something.” Why do we have to do anything at all?<br><br>As an actor in a play, I'd be demanding to know my motivation.<br><br>The advice I offered my own sons when then wanted to know what they should do with their lives is that everything is in flux, so any fixed advice I give them about anything is guaranteed only to be unreliable. I told them that every downturn is the dark side of an opportunity, and that they had no choice in the world that was coming but to learn to spot the opportunities. One son has a college degree, the other has a 1.2 GPA from high school. They're both standing on their own feet, and doing well for themselves.<br><br>Rely on your wits. Play to your strengths. Be observant. Be objective. Be flexible. Be honest in your dealings, and proud of your work. Thrive and find happiness. <br><br>It's for them to adapt to their own future <i>as it actually comes to pass.</i> I've already passed on the best of my advice, and they seem to have taken it. I'll do the same for grandkids, when the time comes.<br><br>I can't see saddling any of them with a 1000 square foot garden any more than I'd saddle them with the idea they need to get a good job, join a union, and ride it to the gold watch. It seems wrong to me. It isn't that the 1000 square foot garden is wrong -- it might be just the right thing. But they could just as easily join a farming collective or a quasi-military religious cult as the empire winds down. That's their choice to make. If they thrive and find happiness, I don't care.<br><br>I can't see most of this discussion as anything more than how The Disappointed want to spend the rest of their own lives. Personally, I have a job that pays well, doing something I enjoy, telecommuting, working with people whose abilities I respect. It could all vanish tomorrow. I've been through that. It is in fact depressing -- like locusts or dust bowls. Advice to myself: rely on your wits. Etc. <br><br>My biggest personal concern is not survival, but end-of-life. We're dealing with that now with the previous generation, and the government dole for advanced elders is already mean-spirited, and not even particularly frugal. I expect that to only get worse. Which means I'll probably have to take my ending into my own hands. It's terrifying to me to watch how the really old people lose their minds, memory by memory, and how the US American Self-Reliance narrative plays out for them.<br><br>So -- I'd appreciate an article on motivations.<br><br><a href=#c6196288844510963088 title="comment permalink">1/17/13, 10:12 PM</a><br><br>

Roads, are closed all over southern Britain, and we're being warned not to travel unless it's an emergency. This happens every so often; every time, the question is asked as to why we don't improve our roads, invest in more snowploughs, and so on. The answer is alway the same: it's too expensive, we can't afford it… <br><br>This week, there's been outrage in the media. One of our national supermarket chains had its cheapest frozen beefburgers tested, and they were found to be 29% horsemeat. Well, you'd think it was a national disaster from the outcry. However, as one of our more prominent food critics pointed out: if you're paying only a pound for a packet of burgers, you take what you're given and like it. After all, burger-munchers are, by the very act, choosing to eat lips, genitalia, eyelids, and the sweepings from the abattoir floor; horsemeat (generally accepted to be very healthy meat) is raising the quality substantially. However, it's easier to be sentimental about poor old Dobbin than to finally address the issue of what cheap, industrial meat products actually involve. There, in a nutshell, is our current national awareness of our lifestyle's real nature. Ho hum.<br><br>Elsewhere, a tsunami is in the making. French troops have arrived in Mali to assist the local army against the Islamists who have taken over half of the country. Unnoticed by most - after all, Lance Armstrong was about to appear on Oprah! - the French report that the Islamists are far better-trained and better-armed than expected, and must be considered a professional army. No surprise; many of them are Tuareg who had gone to Libya and joined Gadaffi's army. It turns out that despite his eccentricities, his army was actually rather good. When he fell, they grabbed every arsenal they could find, and went back to Mali, with the results we are only just beginning to comprehend. The national army of Mali, by the way, is on the verge of complete collapse.<br><br>As a commentator wrote about this in one of the papers: the Islamists now control large areas of the Sahara - and the Sahara is a sea, one through which they can travel at will, from the Atlantic coast in Morocco, to the Mediterranean via Algeria and Libya, and to the Red Sea through Egypt. And they will. As I write, jihadis are fighting through the burning remains of one of Algeria's oil wells; the total shutdown of Algeria's oil industry is on the cards if the companies decide to pull out their foreign workers. Remember the spike in oil prices during the Libyan revolution? I bet the Islamists do, and I have no doubt that what's going on today in Algeria will see a repeat in Libya before long. In this situation, they are TE Lawrence, and we are the Turks; they are the Fremen, and it's we who are the Harkonnens… I don't find this a comfortable feeling.<br><br>A slice here, a slice there… each one makes the global empire bleed a bit more.<br><br><a href=#c5723877533981388333 title="comment permalink">1/18/13, 12:28 AM</a><br><br>

I respect the guy and his works and it truly is an awesome design. Unfortunately, one of the few things we have common in terms of environment is that we're both on the side of a mountain, other than that it's apples vs oranges.<br><br>Hi Robert,<br><br>Yeah, the hypothesis fits the facts in a most disturbing way. It doesn't paint a good picture of the future either. Youth unemployment may be a good litmus test? I've read that in Greece and Spain both it now exceeds 50%.<br><br>As to Japan, I dunno. The government there has debt that is equal to 240% of GDP. It is one of the highest in the Industrial world. I read this week that the government in Japan is about to embark on a massive series of infrastructure projects to boost the ailing economy all funded by printed money. Printing money is a huge boost for Japanese exporters. However, given most of their energy is sourced externally, then devaluing the currency is a double edged sword for them, and like the US (or indeed even the UK) it is a strategy that can only be pursued for so long. You’ll be happy to note that we’ve started the process here too.<br><br>It is not the size of the debt, but the gamble that your creditors won't call your bluff and exercise control over the asset. There is an old adage that says, "whomever controls the debt, controls the asset". This is particularly relevant to the US situation.<br><br>The main ecological difference between Japan and the UK is forest cover. Japan has a lot higher percentage of forest cover than the UK and for many historical reasons may not be willing to compromise on this issue. In fact, their culture and history may indeed favour reducing the human population over deforestation? Dunno, only time will tell. <br><br>The UK on the other hand, has large tracts of arable land which are held by very few people that may quickly be turned to appropriate agricultural pursuits. Legal ownership of an asset is no guarantee of the continued enjoyment of that asset and such change occurrences are not unknown in history. Again, I dunno but I wouldn't want to be a foreigner testing out that particular hypothesis in Japan.<br><br>Hi Juhana,<br><br>The Green Wizards forum is probably the appropriate place to start a discussion thread? The Permaculture Research Institute of Australia also hosts a forum and I’ve found that permies.com is quite an active forum too.

As they say here, "it is as clear as mud"! I just don't quite understand why it is not being shouted from the rooftops by the impacted individuals. Magic, I guess, maybe? The individuals end up blaming themselves and their lack of status becomes a source of embarrassment to them? Dunno.<br><br>I was a victim of the recession back in 1992 - the recession we had to have, they tell me - and it just left me with the determination not to be in the same situation in the future.

That reminds me of an old game I saw back in the 1970's (or thereabouts), the Ten Books Game. Your name is Adam and you're headed off to a lush island with someone named Eve, where the two of you are going to reboot civilization after the rest of the world burns up in a nuclear conflagration. You get to take ten books with you. What ten books would you choose?<br><br>I've never particularly liked the game, because you have to make so many arbitrary assumptions about the future.<br><br>For instance, have you read any of Hank Wesselman's books? (e.g. Spiritwalker). Brief synopsis: he has a visionary experience in which he finds himself inside the head of a distant descendant some 5000 years in the future. It's a good read. In that future, the remaining residents of North America (or the part the story takes place in) are nomadic hunter/gatherers.<br><br>Nomads don't like "stuff" because it has to be moved around. Every bit of "stuff" is kept to a minimum. Valued items are stories and lore that can be committed to memory. They aren't going to haul ten books around -- it will be more like one book, if that. Projecting a nomadic society presupposes one set of valuable technologies, and moveable-type printing is not in that set.<br><br>A gift economy -- particularly if it interlinks different tribal groups -- presupposes a different set of technologies. Items of value are things that can be given away, or that produce things that can be given away, because the unit of exchange is the social obligation created by acceptance of the gift. One-of-a-kind items, like books, require care and maintenance, but provide no economic benefit because -- being one-of-a-kind -- they can't really be given away: they're too valuable, and incur too much social debt if accepted. Their perceived value would be in helping people produce stuff that can be given away.<br><br>A high-tech police-state dystopia requires yet a different set of technologies. Personally, I don't think we'll be rid of either energy profligacy or high technology for centuries to come -- it will simply contract to smaller and smaller groups. This came up in Michael Ruppert's "Confronting Collapse" -- the question is, how long could we sustain our current standard of living in a world of only two billion? Or two hundred million? His dark suggestion is that the First World would be happy to see, say, India and China implode, and might even give it a little push in that direction. But aside from that kind of (justifiable) paranoia, the rapid separation of the haves from the have-nots already rations goods and services, and it's very likely it will come to where one percent of the global population (or less) has access to technology and energy, and the rest don't. That's currently the norm in Third World countries.<br><br>A frontier-style 1800's US America requires yet a different set of technologies.<br><br><a href=#c7410264317776041281 title="comment permalink">1/18/13, 9:29 AM</a><br><br>

When snow starts falling, county employees pile into the pickups and start driving all the main streets and a lot of the minor ones, scraping the snow before it has a chance to build up. It's cheap and fairly effective -- and of course you won't catch any of the wealthier counties in the state, or the region, doing it. <br><br>As for the so-called "Islamists" -- what an ugly neologism! -- they <i>know</i> they're the Fremen; <i>Dune</i> has been a bestseller in the Arab world for decades, and I suspect it's had a fairly large influence. <br><br>Nuku, fair enough.

The trust-fund babies. The Civilized. The Disappointed.”<br><br>Occasionally I wake up in the morning and wonder why I should trouble myself with the deindustrial future. I made the decision, in my early 20s, to not have children. The notion of a future with no fossil fuels, limited resources, and global warming had nothing to do with my decision (I was not even aware of these issues). Now, 20+ years later and hopefully more enlightened, I know that I made the correct personal choice. I will not have great, great....great-grandchildren trying to thrive and find happiness. So why bother myself?<br><br>I think you are correct. At the very basic level it is about us. How do we want to be remembered? What legacy to we want to leave for the deindustrial future?

One thing that strikes me: everything you say about the course of the US economy applies equally and simultaneously to Britain, even though it lost its empire decades earlier. I suppose - following up on your "empire of time" idea, or on the better-known notion of the resource curse - you could identify North Sea oil as having had much the same effect as imperial tribute. But even so, important details seem somehow culture-specific; Norway or Qatar don't have a lot of manufacturing (and have a good deal more oil wealth per capita coming in), but still don't seem to go in for the extravagant speculative investment of New York or London.<br><br>Also, on a more pernickety note: Dune hasn't even been translated into Arabic as far as I can tell, and I've never seen it in any bookstore in the Arab world (where science fiction has never really taken off much anyway).

I had to go look up "Fremen," having never been interested in the Dune franchise even back when everyone else I knew was reading it. So I gotta confront you with this:<br><br>Why is it that the pop culture from your youth and early adulthood can be a source of archetypes and insight, but the pop culture of the present-day is all vapid, worthless, and best avoided? Note I do not mean why has pop culture gotten worse (this is highly debatable, as here has been tons of extremely vapid pop culture my entire life, and you and I are about the same age). I mean why do you personally reject everything post-1985 when you eagerly embrace significant items that came before then? This is especially puzzling to me given that the "spirit of dissensus" is actually more alive now than possibly ever before in mass culture. Sure the same ridiculous trends dominate the bulk (and have for much longer than just the last couple of decades), but the volume of material and the routes for disseminating it are so vastly enormous now that there is in fact a phenomenal diversity of physical, audio, and visual media out there for those who make even the modest effort to seek it out. And exposure to media does not automatically make people into mindless drooling slugs glued to Honey Boo Boo. Many folks manage to explore the vast ocean in moderation and come across some truly remarkable things, as well as a wide variety of pretty high-quality entertainment floating amidst the pablum.<br><br><a href=#c6081552439011907782 title="comment permalink">1/19/13, 7:55 AM</a><br><br>

If the shift continues, there may be a good deal that can be accomplished -- including some things that I, at least, had written off as probably out of reach. <br><br>Farka, no, I'm not thinking of Huntingdon. I've read repeated claims that <i>Dune</i> has become an underground bestseller in the Arab world. If that's not true, I'll have to poke around and see if I can figure out where those stories came from. <br><br>Bill, if you go back through past posts you'll find that I routinely cite such bits of current pop culture as come to my attention -- e.g., the Kardashians, science fiction novels by Neal Stephenson, etc. -- as sources of metaphors. I tend to borrow older bits of pop culture as a metaphor source more often, simply because I don't follow contemporary pop culture. I discussed <a href=../../2011/08/twilight-of-meaning.html rel=nofollow>in a post a while back</a> why I think it's a good idea to bail out of contemporary pop culture altogether, and the reasons for it aren't the ones you've just cited -- oddly, you seemed to get that in your comments to that earlier post. Nor do I think that the pop culture of our youth was much better -- again, don't mistake a source of convenient metaphors for any broader approval; I'll no doubt keep on making fun of the Kardashians, but that hardly means I think highly of Kardashian-watching as a pursuit, you know. <br><br>Richard, the only reason I'm slow to suggest reading a blog as a form of action is that a lot of people seem to think that reading blogs, and posting comments on them, is all the action they need to do. <br><br>Mustard, please pass on my congratulations to your wife!

Skepticism, positivism, conspiracism, nationalism, military traditions, a panoply of political ideologies, even brand-named self-help and salesmanship methods, are all better understood as systems incorporating narratives, practices, and experiences.

A friend sent me links to the most excellent writings you offered this past December on democracy. I very much appreciated you nailing the extent to which phatic communication enters into this country’s troubling incapacity to have reasonable debates. <br>I was kicked off a well-read progressive site’s comment threads last summer for challenging people’s “warm-fuzzy”/”cold-prickly” associations when it comes to education, and having the nerve to say that progressives must listen respectfully to people outside their strict orthodoxy—that is, if we hope to get some traction going in breaking the Pepsi/Coke choices we are met with each election year.<br> <br>Perhaps even more importantly, you grasp the tools necessary to build a functioning democracy. I teach freshman English as an adjunct at local colleges, and have begun all my classes with your excellent “Consuming Democracy,” “Producing Democracy,” and “Enacting Democracy” essays this semester. I have found nothing else that so succinctly and accessibly explains what is necessary in a society’s education in order for an effective democracy to flourish, which has been a focus of the readings I assign to my classes for some years. <br> <br>The first problem I must address in these classes is that many students, particularly those who have recently been freed from the high schools, are incapable of having discussions about anything more controversial than their consumer fetishes. In fact, the schools have by and large insulated our young people from knowing that issues of pressing concern even exist—try suggesting that the US is an empire to most in this country, let alone that it is a crumbling one—and they will think you’re a dangerous extremist. The schools assure them with myths of progress and exceptionalism, all while ignoring the practical skills our young people will likely need to survive. <br> <br>I also much appreciated that your essays took an even-handed approach and did not throw cold-pricklies at the right. Students who have picked up right-wing viewpoints complain that many teachers shut them down, and even grade them down, for expressing opinions unfriendly to their teachers’ POV. This clearly has the opposite effect these teachers seem to hope for: their students stop listening, and become even more closed to ideas outside their fuzzy understandings than before. But what do they expect when they assume the mantle of the autocrat?<br> <br>You are entirely correct in saying that dialectic and rhetoric must be taught, and seldom are. As I’m sure you know, the ancient Greeks and Romans required all citizens to study the trivium so they could participate in the political process. In our schooling system, borrowed from the Prussians and elaborated upon by the behaviorists, the trivium has been abandoned—even grammar has been confused with “whole-word” theories of reading and “new math,” so that college students characteristically cannot do long division and get sleepy when they try to read. One could say a spell has been cast. I have trouble finding it a mere coincidence that like Prussia, the US has become a military with a country rather than a country with a military. <br> <br>In presenting your writing, I took the liberty of cutting all mention of Druidry and a few opinions that I predicted might prompt an emotional rejection in the students. Once we have finished discussing the readings, I will introduce them to The Archdruid Report and the full range of your interests, which will hopefully jar their assumptions a tad. So again, thank you for your work; I am presently working through the archives and am most impressed.<br><br><a href=#c38376868925192407 title="comment permalink">1/20/13, 8:57 AM</a><br><br>

Still, the point that I've been trying to make about pop culture is not that it's pablum -- it's that huge corporations are spending billions of dollars a year, backed by a couple of generations of increasingly sophisticated research into the psychology of marketing, to use the pablum in question to furnish the inside of your head with stuff that makes it harder for you to think clearly about some very important issues. That's the basis of my suggestion that modern pop culture is best avoided -- not that it's trash, but that it's thaumaturgy. <br><br>Myriad, any thorough response to your question would take a post to itself. I'll keep the theme in mind for future posts. <br><br>Lumen, not so. Take a look at the statistics for income distribution in the US between 1928, the last full year before the Great Depression, and 1940, when it had more or less run its course. The fraction of the nation's wealth owned by the wealthiest Americans dropped like a rock over that 12 year period -- demonstrating that, while all classes lost ground, the rich got hit proportionally harder than anybody else. <br><br>Dwig, this is good. Would you like to write up a more extensive discussion of the issues involved? A paper like that might be worth including in the anthology!<br><br>Ray, do it. That sounds like a very worthwhile project indeed. <br><br>Blockhill, that's a very difficult question to answer. Some tributary nations (for example, Israel and Taiwan) will probably go down in flames. Some (for example, Japan and Britain) will likely face long rough transitions with a lot of impoverishment and social turmoil, Some (for example, Canada and Australia) will probably transfer their allegiance gracefully to the next imperial overlord, the way they did when the US took over from Britain, and may get by just fine. New Zealand? Heck of a good question, though I'm guessing the latter camp. <br><br>Richard, and something tasty, too. <br><br>Frank, thanks for the link!<br><br>Adrian, thank you. <br><br>Elizabeth, I'm delighted.

So many of us have college degrees and no full-time work. In the city I live in, many twenty-somethings are opting to bike instead of ride cars. And I can't even tell you how many twenty-somethings have expressed to me a desire to learn to farm or garden, out of some strange collecting understanding that knowing how to do these things will matter to us in our future. I see that eating organic is sort of faddish these days, but I can't imagine the percentage of twenty-year-olds proudly canning or growing food crops in the windows of their apartments or expressing interest in taking some of my worms for their composting use ten years ago. <br><br>We are already observing the breakdowns of the promises we had been given as children.

And I thank you for that, as I think all readers of this blog benefit when you present us with another one of those proverbial "babies" thrown out with the bath water of yesteryear.<br><br>In the software development field I am presently working in, there is an interesting term I keep bumping into: "regression testing." It's basically a process that measures what's been lost. <br><br>As a user interface designer I often find myself having to scold the young propeller head programmers who, in their haste to launch flashy new features, have forgotten to test how their 'progress' will get along with what's been working just fine without it. <br><br>In short, I've become an advocate for the human part of online transactions-- the often forgotten 'warmware' part of the software/hardware relationship. So if you're able to get through any online (or even an ATM) transaction, quickly and without any confusion, you can thank someone like me. ( but you can hold your applause, as I do this job holding my nose and with some reluctance because I consider myself a sellout; a compromised artist; a disappointment to my muses--but, a steady paycheck for my loving domestic captors :-)<br><br>When first presented with the term "regression testing" it sort of grabbed at my throat and slapped me into a serious state of wistfulness.<br><br>If we only did more regression testing as individuals, as a society--as a species! Perhaps that's what evolution really is-an ongoing process of testing weakness and strengths. <br><br>From my little home office/studio here in rural New England, if I stretch my neck to look out over my big fat, 27" iMac monitor, I have a clear view of the headstones in an old historic family cemetery on a small hill just outside my window. I'm quite familiar with this old cemetery as I walk past it most every day. And its sort of a comfort for me to know that right outside my window is land that hasn't changed in centuries and will most likely remain untouched for some time.<br><br>Buried there more than 208 years ago, are two brothers aged 11 and 15 who died within two weeks of each other in the winter of 1805. I did some research and discovered that the winter of 1805 brought severe cold and a few blizzards. <br><br>Most likely, the bodies of those two boys (who both probably died of some terrible virus that was going around at the time) had to be kept above ground, perhaps in a barn, as the ground was frozen solid with at least a few feet of snow covering it.<br><br>How interesting that the grandfather of those boys, buried directly across from them, died 25 years later, in 1830 at 75 years of age. How could this man possibly have lived so long, in a world still ignorant of germ theory and pasteurization? In a world without electricity? <br><br>Through our 21st century eyes life back in 1805 New England looks impossibly harsh, but to folks back then I'm guessing they must have felt the same about their ancestors from Jamestown and Plymouth Colonies. <br><br>My little bit of research further informs me that the big breakthrough in 1805 New England was ice harvesting, which began to employ many farmers even in the dead of winter. They learned new skills which made it possible to tightly pack thick blocks of ice in sawdust within 'ice houses' which made ice available even in the 95 degree heat of summer. (take note Green Wizard Forum!)<br><br>So what have we gained- we with our marvelous healthcare systems, who've been conditioned to believe that we are just a sack of complicated chemical reactions that only a skilled physician could be trusted to figure out?<br><br>What have we gained? Perhaps in 200 years our post-industrial descendants will be forced to do some regression testing and decide that they're doing just fine without the burden of relentless progress.<br><br><a href=#c3098694852720205162 title="comment permalink">1/20/13, 6:30 PM</a><br><br>

I usually pick wild plums in late December as fill for the apricot jam. This year however, there were so many plums on the trees that I thought, well, why not? To be brutally honest, it was a rough drink and the people (err, victims) who I road tested it on were less than impressed! They're a fickle lot as one bad batch...<br><br>As to the UK, well I reckon it is less in overshoot on an ecological front than Japan, but well, it is like the joke about being a little bit pregnant as you either are or you aren't and there is little middle ground. The UK horse meat debacle doesn't surprise me (I avoid unidentifiable meat products such as rissoles etc), but that is what you get when you are in overshoot. <br><br>Once a country is a net importer of food, you are really at the whims of the exporting country. For example, didn't Russia ban wheat exports after the last drought? It hasn't been reported on yet, but the wheat crops here will most certainly be affected by the drought and heatwave here. Yikes!<br><br>Hi Adrian,<br><br>Thanks. It is really smoky here today as there is a really big (about 60,000ha burnt so far 1ha = 2.47 acres) out of control fire a couple of hundred kilometres east of me which will almost certainly get into the Alpine National Park. Mind you, there's a grass fire burning under 40 kilometres due east of here right now which is not good either. The wind is blowing cooler from the South, although it is pushing it towards a housing estate at Kilmore. I'll post a photo to the Internet of the smoke over the next few days and leave a link to it. It is a day to day thing here.<br><br>The osage orange sounds like an incredibly useful tree. Hedgerows are a great idea and good for wind breaks and fencing animals (those thorns sound like an effective barrier).<br><br>I went picking seeds this afternoon for acacia melanoxylon (blackwood wattle) which will be used for continuing the boundary hedgerow which also contains oaks.

The article was very cagey about timing for obvious reasons. Did you note that a withdrawal from France was also occurring? What was interesting was that they were leaving 13% in the Bank of England and 37% in the Federal Reserve (despite what the article says nothing comes for free). Again, I'm very cynical but 50% sounds like a less than arbitrary number to me and more like an negotiated cost.

And, there are so few of them I don't expect them to skew the future much.<br><br>Plenty of wealthy people in history started at a higher baseline and lost everything. Collapse and depressions don't just shave 10% off everybody, leaving the wealthy with 90% of a magnificent fortune. They can, and have, lose everything. <br><br>And, you may be assuming that "money" can buy whatever you want. This isn't always the case. "Money" can only buy what people are willing to sell.<br><br>But, as I noted recently, it may just be that we are all talking past each other--using the same words with different assumptions about their meaning. When I read Glenn's post, it sure looks to me like he is planning for a time when "money" will have very little currency, as has been the case through most of human history.<br><br>So the rich may have gold but, the occasional bottle of Goldschlager notwithstanding, gold makes mighty poor eating. Land may be only useful if you know how to work it, and growing your own nutrition is actually not that easy.<br><br>My assumption about this blog is that most of the readers put a much higher exchange rate on tools and skills than on gold and diamonds.

As I’m sure you know, the ancient Greeks and Romans required all citizens to study the trivium so they could participate in the political process.”<br><br>Just how much did the Greek and Roman citizens participate in the political process? <br><br>When JMG was on holiday last year I read two books in the time I might have spent reading the Archdruid Report and comments. They were “The Greek Commonwealth” by Alfred Zimmern and “The City State of the Greeks and Romans” by W Warde Fowler. (freely available on line)<br><br>I read these books to try to answer some questions relevant to our own situation. The questions are:<br>Is it possible for democracy to thrive when fossil fuels are extremely limited?<br>What are the conditions for a successful democracy?<br>Why does a society allow itself to be ruled by an oligarchy?<br>Does oligarchic rule imply wealth for the few at the expense of impoverishment of the many?<br>If that is the case it is especially important to understand and promote democracy as a defence against elite rule. <br><br> This is what I learned from Alfred Zimmern. In the best days of Ancient Greek Democracy there was an extraordinary amount of active participation by citizens in decision making and administration even though most people were poor in a material sense. Many citizens were independent small farmers able to make independent judgements and not beholden to powerful people. Many farmers grew wheat or barley between widely spaced olive trees in a farming system that gave them free time to take part in politics between busy periods of sowing and harvest.<br><br>From Fowler I learned that at the time of the Roman Republic many Roman citizens were similar small farmers, but they left governance of a growing empire to an oligarchy of powerful (and skilled) administrators. As this elite gained wealth they dispossessed many small farmers creating large slave run farms and landless and powerless ex farmers swelling the numbers of Rome.<br><br>The lesson seems to be that awareness and the ability and willingness of citizens to participate democratically will be critically important in surviving the Long Descent. <br><br><br><a href=#c7594039149762137373 title="comment permalink">1/21/13, 2:02 AM</a><br><br>

Of course one way to counter unwelcome thaumaturgy is to block it by separating yourself from it. But (and I'm sure I don't need to tell you this!), another way to disempower it is to be consciously aware of it and examine it. There is probably no better way to dash the intended effects of a thaumaturgic ritual (other than by not attending it at all) than by taking a step to the side and examining it -- why was that chant chosen, there's an interesting image, clearly this is drawn from such and such and is trying to put me in mental state X, etc. Magicians-in-training often fall into this trap unwillingly when participating in others rituals, and it very effectively prevents them from actually experiencing the intent of the magic. <br><br>We approach the media thaumaturgy in this way. When we are watching or listening to media (at home, it would be rude in a movie theater!), we are always commenting on the pervasive implicit assumptions, manipulations, and archetypes that are being pumped out by it; the morality plays, the desires being instilled, the things being sold, the social roles being preached, the images of ourselves, others, the past, and the future being promoted. I feel it gives a lot of insight into the forces that permeate our society, and we can still be entertained as well. And I gotta say, I don't find older pop culture to be much less thaumaturgic -- it may not have been selling the mass consumption lifestyle to the same extent, but it was VERY aggressively "thaumaturging" a view of society and our places in it -- proper gender roles, christianity, American exceptionalism, captalism, white supremacy, the inevitable upward march of technology, etc., etc. That's why I have always hated Star Trek -- every episode was nothing but a covert morality play, from a slightly-left-of-center but still very mainstream 1960s view of the ideal society, sold using the glitz and glamour of a techno-utopian futurist fantasy.<br><br><a href=#c1595785765259675180 title="comment permalink">1/21/13, 6:07 AM</a><br><br>

Unless one lives an entirely isolated life (which by definition no one reading this does), it comes at you from every direction whenever you interact with another person. People who live in a culture with a constant bombardment of this particular form of magic often begin to actually practice it themselves, without thinking about it. Hence everyone you meet on the street is radiating it. It's kind of like thinking you could have gotten away from the influence of the medieval church by just not going to the cathedral, or avoid the evangelical fundamentalist movement here by just staying away from the church of Christ. In some ways, if one approaches it this way, mass media are a concentrated and transparent example of the process, which makes them sometimes EASIER to de-fuse than the more diffuse forms of it that are everywhere else. <br><br>An example of how this permeates far beyond the boob tube: I have recently been besieged by the mainstream medical establishment trying to get me to submit to all sorts of tests and procedures that even the mainstream medical literature has found to be of little if any value. It's the hazard of being over 50 and having health insurance: When you go in for an actual acute condition that they really can help you with, they then begin forcibly trying to "sell" you on all sorts of stuff to try to get you to believe you have some chronic condition that requires regular followups, drugs, and claims to be filed. It feels like fighting off the timeshare salesmen at a beach resort, and is the exact same process at work. <br><br>But anyway though this is generally "on topic" it's not specifically on topic this week, and it's almost time for next week, so I'll leave this as my last comment on the issue (for now...).<br><br><a href=#c8050130524813897337 title="comment permalink">1/21/13, 8:24 AM</a><br><br>

Of what you took from the texts you recommend, you write “[t]he lesson seems to be that awareness and the ability and willingness of citizens to participate democratically will be critically important in surviving the Long Descent.” Yes, and best to start now, or at least very soon, as JMG says. And don’t depend on our schools, whether they be K-12 or our colleges and universities, to do it. There’s a growing awareness that our formal educational systems aren’t up to the task, and although I earn my bread within a couple of them, I definitely catch some flak from administrators because I tend to compile readings designed to lead my students out of their consumer dreams, and fundamentally question our schools’ hesitance (to put it mildly) to expose students to issues that might distress them. Colleges are in it for the profit motive as much as anyone else, and most flagrantly these days, and we wouldn’t want to upset the children as they seek entrance into the wonderful world of bureaucracy with student loans that will dictate their wage-slavery. Funny, though: the students don’t complain much at all.<br><br>The interchange between JMG and Bill Pulliam is of especial interest to me because, although it’s nothing new, popular culture as a focus of intellectual and artistic investigation seems to be more popular than ever in the colleges. My daughter, who’s in art school, keeps telling me I must watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer and is going to loan me her collection of academic articles on Buffy when she’s done with it. My teaching colleagues are very hot on the idea of using Toddlers and Tiaras as fodder for cultural investigations. Although I “get it,” more or less, I still agree with JMG that pop art and narratives, be they “reality” or fiction, are largely employed, with a great deal of financial investment, “to furnish the inside of your head with stuff that makes it harder for you to think clearly about some very important issues,” and that while pop art does yield some interesting perceptions, it inevitably acts much more forcefully as thaumaturgy. I only have one semester to impart something potentially meaningful to my students. How can I agree that analyzing Honey Boo Boo is a good choice? <br><br>Plus, in such academic investigations, a disturbing divide occurs between the “intellectuals” who are publishing such analysis and the “plebes” they are analyzing through pop culture. Mostly, from what I can tell, the plebes consume such entertainments because it’s gratifying to see how people “stupider” than they are fixated on garbage, while the intellectuals are meanwhile filling their heads with the garbage they look down upon the “stupid” plebes for making so popular. For Whomsoever’s sake, can we get real here? It all seems kinda circular. <br><br>Naturally, I do understand that I’m greatly simplifying and editorializing. <br><br><br><a href=#c5746933255016315675 title="comment permalink">1/21/13, 12:44 PM</a><br><br>

Just skimming through there were a few points I wanted to add.<br><br><br> Granted, Islamist is an unfortunate and inaccurate term. However, there is a militant movement within the Muslim world that is relevant to discussion. Given that this movement crystalizes into various organization of varying goals, ideology, commitment, and geography, it would seem that we require an umbrella term to describe this phenomena. I have usually used the word "Jihadi", though I admit, this term is also flawed. Can we agree on a label to indicate the greater movement, and perhaps an additional label to refer to these violent offshoots?<br><br>Far Northern Mali is dominated my the Tuareg people, not anyone vaguely "Al Quaeda"esqe. The Tuareg are also the main force that led to the successful 2012 rebellion that led to downfall of the Mali government and the coup establishing what is now called the government of Mali. AQIM (Al Quaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) was a minor partner in the rebellion and only took control of a portion of Northern Mali after the Tuareg withdrew to the Sahara. (Having dispatched what they understood to be their oppressor. The point being that the Tuareg are currently tolerant of AQIM, but the Sahara is not dominated by "Islamists". Whether AQIM is even truly "Islamist" or not is another question worth asking.<br><br><br>Speaking as a younger person (I'm 29) I uncomfortable with the generalization of the youth as feeling "entitled". If you poll the 20-30 crowd I doubt you will find them looking forward to a rosy future. Considering the social forces at work, I am constantly surprised by the realism of the outlooks I encounter. (no social security, meaningless elections, America's inevitable decline, etc) This is sometimes difficult to recognize as there is a significant disconnect between these expectations and the seemingly optimistic mannerisms generally exhibited. My current theory is that this behavior is somehow related to the disassociative symptoms commonly exhibited by victims of childhood trauma, but that's another matter.<br><br><br>This may have been addressed elsewhere, but I think it is worth pointing out that America's population (and that of the EU) is very likely to fall by quite a bit in the next couple of decades for purely economic reasons. Europeans as an ethnic class have been breeding below replacement for decades. What keeps the population of the West from declining is immigration in pursuit of economic opportunity. When that opportunity shifts elsewhere (Brazil, China, India, etc) population in these region will begin to fall. <br><br>Impoverishment may eventually lift the birth rate in these regions, but the trend to smaller families may prove more correlated with gender equality than median wealth.<br><br><a href=#c5196202904679566269 title="comment permalink">1/21/13, 2:11 PM</a><br><br>

You are so lonely over there in America. It is same as with our own overeducated, liberal burghers here. Joseph mentioned "taking matters to his own hands" considering his old age, because your governmental pension system is collapsing. What has government to do with this? I understand from his comment that he has many sons. Is it not responsibility of his children to take care of him, when he is old? If person abandons small child, he/she is rightfully viewed as bad person; abandoning family's elderly when they are helpless is equally bad thing to do. What a lonely prison you have build for yourselves with all that "individuality". Doctrine of Bogomils, or Catharians for you Westerners, embodied at Earth: material prison of lonely existence wit no direction, driven only by animal impulses of lust and greed. These comments give away many unintentional revelations about your system. Want to survive coming contraction? Abandon illusions of individualism and "freedom" and cherish bonds of family, tradition and religion. Throw away any grandiose illusions that you are somehow special as individual; you are not. Countless generations have lived, loved and died before you, countless generations shall live, love and die after you. Your place in community and family, however humble that position might be, is what makes you truly special and needed. Together you are strong and resilient. That is true success recipe for poverty-stricken future. Be willingly bound to your kin, feel what they feel, act together to ensure survival as community. Government's true nature everywhere is that of big racketeering syndicate; family, extended family, is true community.<br><br><a href=#c519036912330807419 title="comment permalink">1/21/13, 2:19 PM</a><br><br>

But two or three factors work very strongly against many children actually being able to do this in the USA. <br><br>One factor is the sheer size of the country. The search for steady work, and the difficulty of finding it, very often drive the young to live far away from wherever they spent their childhood. In those far-away places they eventually marry and raise their own children. If they return to their parental neighborhood or town at all, it is very often only for short and sentimental visits.<br><br>A second factor is the nature of the steady work they have found. The unwritten expectations of their employers are often that white-collar employees work 10 or more hours each day, six or even seven days a week for their salary, or that blue-collar workers must work mandatory overtime every week. <br><br>And a third factor is the great sums of money needed to keep up a life-style of consumption that meets the social expectations of their employers, their fellow employees and even their friends who have similar careers with other companies.<br><br>These three factors make it quite hard for a young couple even to raise their own children well, let alone take good care of their aging parents. Indeed, marriages very often crack and break under the need for ever more money and time, or if a marriage remains intact, it often becomes dysfunctional. <br><br>One pattern of high-status family living is to have a large house, in which each child has his or her own bedroom and bathroom, his own TV, his own computer, and so forth -- in short, a small apartment of his own within the larger family house, each taking his meals when he will, not as part of a family meal. This way of daily living isolates children from their parents even further.<br><br>With wise parental care and oversight, of course, all these factors can be overcome, or even turned to advantage in cultivating self-reliance, self-discipline and other virtues. But that requires a heavy investment of parental time, which is already in short supply.<br><br>So, in short, an aging parent in the USA may indeed have a moral claim for help from his children in his old age, but very often he cannot realistically expect that they will be able to provide this help -- or be willing to do so even if they are able. The prudent person, therefore, considers what alternate arrangements he may be able to make for his old age, up to and including Sir Terry Pratchett's well-publicized plan for managing his own impending debility and demise.<br><br>This, at any rate, is how may of the young people who passed through my classes at Brown University grew up. More than half of them have never been able to get to know even one of their grandparents as a person, and perhaps one tenth of them do not even know as much as the names of their grandparents -- that is how little contact there is between generations in adulthood here. One gregarious young student of mine, from a wealthy suburb, told me once that she was the only one of her very wide circle of high-school and college friends whose parents were actually still living together in the same house.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c7378980860718547948 title="comment permalink">1/21/13, 7:18 PM</a><br><br>

TV had barely been a part of my life until late 1990s and I had long ago left SF behind. I think it might have been because I was seeing Star Trek only after the Soviet collapse. Some was Jean-Luc (Patrick Stewart), but a lot was <i>because</i> it was so ludicrously American – at this stage for me probably more poignant than prophetic, a tolerance for someone else’s gilded childhood! - But, oh … those ‘Admirals’; dear me … those ‘away-missions’!<br><br>‘Training’ was an earlier buzzword in Britain when we were trying to recover some imperial glory and cash – and we were spending a fifth of entire government budget in 1959 on the military before we launched our ‘white heat of technology’ in the early 60s. Our PM (mage) Harold Wilson was embarrassing at that launch but at least he kept us out of Vietnam.<br><br>The Star Trek I was watching followed the conventions of much of kids' stories - it was so unreal. Nobody for example could survive serial trauma perpetually on a battleship with a bunch of other villagers, however educated or ‘trained’, without serious psychological disintegration and other dysfunction, anymore than kids in an adventure story could survive their adventures outside parental care, let alone the impact of time-shift etc. But stories were ever like this.

On the other hand, I've come to like, appreciate, and even admire the balance you've been striking to date, and I'd miss it, even as I'm certain I'd be prompted to wade in and argue back (and I'm sure you'd draw others, as well).<br><br>That wouldn't be a <i>bad</i> conversation, but it would certainly be a <i>different</i> one than you've been having. Are you sure that's what you want to do?<br><br>On the gripping hand,(*) I think it's quite true that our civilization's crisis is not only a crisis of ecological limits, but a religious crisis as well (particularly for the Religion of Progress). Therefore, any discussion of that crisis's trajectory is going to be inevitably religious in nature, whether it's explicitly so or not. So, perhaps it can't be helped.<br><br>(*) Old sci-fi culture reference alert!<br><br>@Juhana,<br><br>That's a very insightful observation about Americans - and an unwelcome one for most. The conditioning that we're <i>supposed</i> to break ties with our close family, strike out on our own, and "make it" hundreds or thousands of miles away, with nothing but loose sentiment connecting us to our parents or to our "clan" of extended kin (who are likely scattered to the four winds themselves) is very strong.<br><br>There are Americans who have noticed that this leads pretty directly to substituting the State for the Tribe or Clan as the means of security and support, but this observation is a minority viewpoint, and even among those who have noticed it, it has only led to limited practical effects so far.<br><br>@Brother Kornhoer,<br><br>Well, as a Christian myself, I'd say that faith as "believing without evidence" misrepresents what faith is. But then, I'm enough of a traditionalist to think this whole "faith vs. reason" dichotomy is actually a modern pathology, and not the Faith itself. Thomas Aquinas would find it ludicrous, for example - and one of the best modern writers, for that matter, on the right relationship between faith and reason (and how each requires the other) is Pope Benedict. (It's extremely helpful to actually read what the man writes and says himself, rather than press accounts and interpretations - the mismatch is pretty severe.)<br><br>And, on the other hand, true faith is ultimately a gift of the Holy Spirit. You may be closer to the Kingdom than you know. :)<br><br>Regarding bioremediation, that's really interesting. I keep wishing someone would write an accessible account of the current state of the art. Of course, I mean "someone else more qualified than I," as I would hardly know where to begin. Maybe you could consider that for JMG's contest?<br><br><br>peace,<br>Zach<br><br><a href=#c5558842675165367451 title="comment permalink">1/22/13, 8:08 AM</a><br><br>

I know some of JMG's books on the subject but I admit they left me unsatisfied.<br><br>A friend just posted a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZXAC6K1QWE9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0865716390#wasThisHelpful" rel=nofollow>nice review of <i>Eco-Technic</i></a> which showed a similar appetite. I think JMG that when it comes to the relation of time and creation -- and evolution -- to spirit, what you <i>don't</i> believe is far clearer than what you <i>do</i>, as yet. :)<br><br>You are after all engaged in religious conversion here. Sure, it's conversion <i>away from</i> rather than the more usual conversion <i>to</i>, but the linear-teleological time of "progress religion" is acknowledged as basic to so much in the West and does ultimately issue from Abrahamic ideas. The Enlightenment couldn't dislodge it -- hence Hegel, Nietzsche, and Teilhard, who in so many ways repeats your Joachim of Flores... and so on. (Spinoza of course was with you that there are no ends in nature or god, but was soon overruled!)<br><br>Some basic different view of the divine's workings in time might help a lot of people in choosing or designing just what they'll convert <i>to</i>. You've skirted this before -- I remember in particular <a href=../../2008/12/historys-arrow.html rel=nofollow>this</a> from four years ago. The comments of Jacques de Beaufort at that time have stuck with me. You made clear the divine or "faith" element in his view, but that was well before you were ready to give the similar element in your own.<br><br>I for one have always hoped for some approach with less criticism of religious teleology and more positive alternative... and I don't think it <i>need</i> count as proselytising if that worries you!

FWIW, I agree with Lumen on this one.<br><br>I think it's hard to grasp the magnitude of the disparity in wealth between the upper tier and the rest of society. Consider that in the last election, several individuals spent in excess of $100 million dollars out of what appears to be discretionary funds. The mind reels at such wealth.<br><br>A person at that tier could lose more than 99% of their wealth and still be far better off than the average American who lost nothing.<br><br>Before the Depression, my grandfather was nowhere near the top tier of wealth in this country. He was a banker in a smallish Delta city that boasted at the time of being the largest long-staple cotton market in the world. His bride, my grandmother, inherited one of her father's two plantations. So they were very well off for the area.<br><br>His bank failed during the Crash, and he personally paid off every depositor out of his own personal funds and credit. He had to move his rather large family into a 2-bedroom house. My mother, his youngest, never got to go to college as had all of her sisters. One story my mother told was of the time her mother killed all of the chickens and made sandwiches and sent her downtown to sell them to the gamblers at the local card house.<br><br>Several parcels of land changed hands. But at the end of the day, the older sisters found work and my grandfather took over running the cotton gin on the plantation, and they avoided selling the land. That left them wealthier than the vast majority of white people in the county, nevermind the blacks, who at that time were little more than indentured serfs. Heck, the fact that my grandmother saved her silver set would have probably made them wealthier than most just by itself.<br><br>And remember, at this time, the Rockefellers and others of that ilk were the REALLY rich.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c2548638559122971070 title="comment permalink">1/22/13, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

I was being bombarded by emails from people who wanted to do "guest posts" whoring various products and services, and it got tiring to keep on telling them to get lost. <br><br>Bill, sure, but why go out of your way to wallow in the stuff? <br><br>Chuck, <i>Casablanca</i> was a straightforward propaganda film, one of hundreds that came out of Hollywood in the war years; it's one of the few that anybody still watches today. <br><br>Jeffinwa, that's eerie. Krampus is clearly back with a vengeance. <br><br>Brother K., I'll consider it. For the moment, I'd point out that "believin' something you know ain't so" -- Mark Twain's definition of faith -- isn't necessarily what people who practice religion are talking about. <br><br>Luke, I have no problem with the label "Jihadi," not least because it's one many of the people in question would acknowledge. As for a sense of entitlement, if that's going away, I'm delighted. Like many other teachers of occultism, I've spent the last decade or so dealing with twentysomethings who claim they want to study with me, so long as "studying" involves no work, no commitment, and no challenges to their existing opinions about subjects about which they generally know very little. There have been some stellar exceptions, but they're in the minority. <br><br>Juhana, remember that the people who settled America in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries were precisely those who left homes and extended families behind to cross the ocean and make a new life for themselves. The people who thought as you do are the ones who stayed home. <br><br>Phil, heck of a good question.

I have my differences with Spinoza, btw, but his cogent discussions of the futility of trying to impose human ideas of ends on a deity are to my mind far more convincing than the opposition -- and don't even get me started on Teilhard de Chardin. Gah. <br><br>Ceworthe, I think you're misjudging Zach there. His advice was specific to the project of this blog, and will be considered. <br><br>Hal, it's a source of repeated irritation to me that people keep on taking statements I've made and stretching them into something they're not. All I said was that (a) proportionally speaking, the rich will on average lose more of their wealth than the rest of the population -- and that's borne out by evidence from the Great Depression -- and (b) that those who take sensible steps now may well come out of this in better shape than some people who are millionaires today. Please note the qualifiers in that sentence! <br><br>Those rich people who happen to have a lot of their wealth in the form of land and economically productive assets will likely get by fairly well, but a very large fraction of the excess wealth held by the rich these days is entirely in the form of paper -- and a great many people who are very wealthy, on paper, own essentially nothing of value except the paper, and such not exactly productive assets as homes in exclusive estates. Many of that segment of the rich will be destroyed this time around, as many of their equivalents were destroyed last time around -- look up the big names in finance in the roaring 20s, and then see what happened to them afterwards. For every Rockefeller, who had most of his wealth in productive assets, there was at least one Ivar Kreuger, one of the richest men in the world in 1929, who blew his brains out a few years later when his investment empire collapsed in a tangle of fraud and plummeting stock prices.<br><br><a href=#c6091257247546320647 title="comment permalink">1/22/13, 11:00 PM</a><br><br>

JMG said that "people who settled America in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries were precisely those who left homes and extended families behind to cross the ocean and make a new life for themselves". Again we see formula of ancient tragedies: qualities which have made your country great and strong nation in the past are now exactly same qualities that are turning against you. In this material plane of existence even strengths are ultimately hidden weaknesses; only veiled truth beyond our understanding is pure by its essence. I tried not to gain any high ground by moralising your society, I have just seen things done differently also. Persons volunteering to work part-time and home nursing relatives who are ill or old, other relatives donating money and helping with food and transportation every month. It is actually very low profile actions that matter most. No revolution or new government can make people behave as they should, this kind of things start from inner realm. From your comments I get the picture that earthly possessions matter very much for Americans. That is dangerous situation, because all earthly things are just temporarily borrowed to us, none of them can last. Everyone is tempted by luxury, most of us like it, but we should not be owned by our desires. Below are two examples, to direct thoughts into inner world. Other is from Finland, other is person from Russia who stood strong against attack of Communism, and guided people there back to spiritual path after inevitable fall of despicable atheists.

I am 27. By and large I lurk and listen to those living the life I am trying to ramp up to on this blog. <br><br>You said: "But it does seem to me that the vast majority of the readership of the peak oil sites I've been to are at least middle-aged, if not older. I wonder why this is..."<br><br>The vast majority of people in the 18-30 age categories are little more than kids, some, if they have the ability to draw a paycheck (last statistic I read said about half of that age bracket is unemployed) then they are blowing it on pleasures after they pay rent if they've made it out of the house. <br><br>Something I am seeing out of my son is a willingness to let go of what he no longer needs with or plays. There was no fight when it came to "let's donate most of the toys to Goodwill". It was "okay!" and he gave up far more than I thought he would. <br><br><br>"I haven't run into many people my age who have any inkling of what is unfolding; then again, I haven't run into many older people who do either."<br><br>The idea that we've been sold a lie from a very, very young age turns in the stomach. It makes me angry knowing I blew so many years trying to 'get an education' that, in the end, has about a 50/50 chance of helping me provide myself a livelihood. I say this after graduating with a B.S. in Psychology last semester, and furiously debating whether to go into deeper debt for my CSW for a total of approximately $80,000 in debt. I could put a down payment for a piece of property for that much and not have to gamble on whether I could get food from it.<br><br>"After spending most of my thinking life as a scientifically inclined techno-optimist with the view that long-term progress is inevitable...It's been a really painful process...I have found it even harder to change my habits, which I have so far made little progress on."<br><br>I don't know about your situation but post the 'hey this is real and boy am I rocked' stage there's been a lot of 'now what?' on my end, if for no other reason than land costs money. So that is what I am saving up for: a down payment on land so I will hopefully not have to go into debt to provide a better quality of life and life skills for my children than what my folks provided me.<br><br>"I certainly understand why most of Generation Y hasn't yet woken up to humanity's predicament."<br><br>It makes the driving narrative behind a lot of the reasons we put ourselves through deep amounts of pain, angst, and debt fall apart. Like Mr. Greer noted, failure is hard to absorb let alone accept, but we need a reworking of the word "fail" into "learn".<br><br><a href=#c5501050246542527259 title="comment permalink">1/23/13, 4:55 AM</a><br><br>

A billionaire can lose 99.9% of their wealth and still be a millionaire. If the average person's wealth is mostly in a $200K home that loses a mere 50% of it's value, who is worse off?

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c9143031591634883991></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/10472643369176429251 rel=nofollow>Farmer Dirt</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>A couple years back, I used to live in the city (where they had things like "PantheaCon" and guest speakers like JMG) and make $100,000 a year as a software engineer. Now I live in the country and try to make $20,000. My family and myself live unquestionably better; we have good food, fresh air, quiet, nature, and great neighbors. However, it's not easy even to make that much. We live in a manufactured home that requires constant repair, along with our outbuildings our fences, our driveway, our soil, and many other things. We have to be our own electricians, builders, vets, and schoolteachers. <br><br>We tried to prepare for the move before we traded our city life and 401k for a broken-down house on 10 acres. I volunteered at farms. I grew a garden and raised chickens (much to the annoyance of my suburban neighbors). My wife cooked all our foods and we homeschooled. However, the truth is, other than a fine mindset, none of this really prepared us for what was coming.<br><br>At some point -- maybe when my wife and I were in the middle of butchering a cow that was supposed to be too young to be pregnant but had a half-grown calf in her uterus, after having to chase her for an hour and a half due to poor planning, and the sun going down and the hide starting to freeze to the flesh -- I realized I was in over my head that day, and that day was just like the day before, and the day before. In fact, being in over my head and having to make up a solution out of nowhere because the alternative is not acceptable is the paramount skill of a homesteader. At what temperature in the winter will pigs die? Where can I get alfalfa? How can my animals get water when the power goes out? Will that wind blow down the barn? What is that, and is the animal still edible? Where are the turkeys laying their eggs? How do I stop that owl from eating my chickens' heads? These and a thousand other questions often can't be answered in books or online. Google does not know, trust me.<br><br>The point to my ramble is that we are able to figure this out with the current cushion of cheap gas, cheap hay, cheap grain, and constant electricity (and wonderful neighbors). But now is the time to figure it out, not next year or the year after that. Too many people I know think they can buy some "victory seeds", store some frozen-dried food, have some books and bleach on hand, and a few nice guns with plenty of ammo, and when the time comes, they'll outlive the "fools." Oh, the dismay that will follow. We know so very little compared to what people a hundred years ago knew and we need to learn it back, fast. <br><br>If any of your readers are contemplating a move to a more self-sufficient lifestyle, but hesitant to give up a good job, all I have to say is that learning to live on a great deal less money and a lot more time is absolutely required to make it. There is no other way. And the sooner, the better, for there is no substitute for experience. I say this not self-righteously, but just as advice. If you would become self-sufficient, you would become poor, and learn to love it. That's just the way it goes.<br><br><a href=#c9143031591634883991 title="comment permalink">1/23/13, 7:51 PM</a><br><br>

One is brought towards faith in something by reason and evidence and experience. Faith isn't divorced from reason, but it's a different thing.<br><br>A secular example: if we know someone well, and have trust in their character, we might say that we have "faith" in them. So, then, if an accusation is made against them, you might say "that can't be right - I know Joe, and he'd never do anything like that." You are exercising faith in your friend, against apparently contrary evidence - but this is not <i>without</i> evidence. Your evidence is your prior knowledge of your friend's character and behavior.<br><br>Another example, on-topic for this blog: It's one think to give intellectual assent to the Peak Oil model, and "believe" that Hubbert got his model of world oil depletion correct. But, really <i>believing</i> that enough to get off your butt and make difficult, radical, sustained changes in your life because of it -- well, that takes a kind of "faith," one that can be tough to maintain in the face of current comforts, social disapproval, etc.<br><br>As for Benedict's writing, I think his <a href=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060912_university-regensburg_en.html rel=nofollow>Regensburg lecture</a> is a masterful exposition of the right relationship between faith and reason, although it's dense and technical enough that it makes tough going as an introductory read. Your question is making me realize that I can't think of a simpler introduction to this line of thought to point you to. I should fix that; thanks for the challenge.<br><br>@JMG,<br><br>Thank you.<br><br><a href=#c5983241688181248633 title="comment permalink">1/24/13, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>
