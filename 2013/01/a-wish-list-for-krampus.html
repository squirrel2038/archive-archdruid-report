<div class=MsoNormal>
It's always a bit of a gamble to sit down at the computer and start writing one of these weekly posts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>I don’t know how it works for other writers, but for me, the writing process is inherently unpredictable; I may think I know what I’m going to write, but once the fingertips get within range of the keyboard, all bets are off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A news story off the net, a stray passage from some old book, a series of those things we like to call coincidences because we haven’t yet noticed that a belief in coincidence is the most popular superstition of the age of science—take your pick, it can be any of those things or others, but all of a sudden what should have been a quiet evening of sipping tea and anatomizing the decline and fall of industrial civilization becomes a leap into the dark. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This time, it was a question raised by a reader of last week’s post.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That post, as my readers will recall, ended with some suggestions about how readers in the world’s industrial nations might consider changing their own lives, to cut back on the burden their lifestyles put on the living Earth. The reader in question applauded those suggestions, but asked what suggestions I might have if I were addressing an audience of scientists and engineers—that is, people who might be able to come up with new technologies to help cushion our species’ face-first collision with the brick wall of planetary limits. What would I want them to explore? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I confess the question took me entirely by surprise, and I stammered something about how it was an interesting point, but I didn’t expect ever to have the chance to address an audience of scientists and engineers along those lines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of course the inevitable result followed promptly, as an assortment of scientists and engineers popped up to say that they were regular readers of mine, and they would be interested in hearing my suggestions for what they could do. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a far more complex question than it might seem at first glance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To begin with, there are at least two limits that nearly all attempts to imagine technologies for the future systematically duck. The first of those limits come out of the laws of thermodynamics, which dictate that the amount of work you can get out of any energy source is a function of the difference between the concentration of energy in that energy source and the background concentration in the environment. Fossil fuels are extraordinarily concentrated energy sources—a single gallon of gasoline, remember, contains as much energy as one ton of fully charged lead-acid auto batteries—and nearly all of today’s technologies depend on that huge difference in energy concentration between the chemical energy of petroleum and other fossil fuels, on the one hand, and the ambient heat of the lower atmosphere on the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second limit comes out of White’s Law, which is arguably as important in human ecology as the laws of thermodynamics are in physics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>White’s Law states that the level of economic development possible in any society is determined by the amount of energy per capita at its disposal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The immense infrastructure that makes today’s industrial world lifestyles possible depends on constant flows of concentrated energy, not merely to power it but to provide it with raw materials, spare parts, skilled and unskilled labor, and all its other necessities, and these requirements each have further requirements of their own, cascading outwards in a net of dependencies that ultimately includes much of the planet. Nearly all of today’s technologies depend on our current industrial infrastructure or a close facsimile thereof, not only to keep them fueled and running, but to give what they do some value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These two limits interact in ways that are fatal to most projects for future technologies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Any future society in the real world is going to have to get by on a lot less energy, and a lot less of the products of energy, than people in today’s industrial societies are used to having at their beck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This means that any advanced technology will have to compete with other technologies for a share of the limited energy that’s available, and it will also have to compete with other, less technologically complex ways of accomplishing whatever it is that it does.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Furthermore, the relevance of any advanced technology to a future society will depend on how complex an infrastructure that society would need to build the technology, fuel it, maintain it, and give its work economic value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Whether or not computers will be viable in a future society, in other words, is not a question of whether it’s technically possible to build them; it depends, first, on whether <i>all</i> the things needed to build, power, maintain, and get useful work out of them can be provided; second, whether other, simpler technologies can provide the same services at a lower cost in energy, resources, and labor; and third, whether the sharply limited resources available to a future society would be better spent on some other project altogether. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
All these issues will be familiar to regular readers of this blog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s also probably worth saying that while I try to stay abreast of major developments in half a dozen sciences, there’s no way any human being can keep up with everything that’s being done by the world’s scientists and engineers, and so any guesses I may offer here may already have been rendered unnecessary or proven impossible by somebody sitting at a lab bench in Cleveland, Cape Town, or Kowloon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’m still going to take the risk of making some suggestions, but in a bit I’ll also have a challenge to offer to the scientists, engineers, and basement inventors among my readers. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
First, though, my wish list.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In honor of the holiday season just past, we can call it a solstice list—those of my readers who celebrate Christmas instead can call it a Christmas list if they wish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, I’d like to ask that the list not be sent to Santa Claus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>No, this list is for Krampus. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Krampus?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He’s a Yuletide figure across much of central Europe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Horned, clawed, covered with shaggy black hair, and equipped with a long red tongue, he carries a birch switch, has a basket on his back, and visits houses on long winter nights. Good little children wake to find gold coins in their shoes; bad little children get thwacked with the birch switch; and really, <i>really</i> bad little children—the sort of spoiled, shrieking little horrors who take consumer society’s cult of self-centered greed to its logical extreme—get popped into the basket on Krampus’s back and taken away by him, and nobody ever sees them again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I suspect that lingering belief in Krampus may be one reason why children in central Europe are by and large better behaved than their American equivalents. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Krampus, in other words, is all about consequences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That in itself arguably makes him a better Yuletide figure than Santa Claus, whose ancient custom of putting a lump of coal in the stockings of offensive children is hardly even a memory these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, that’s only part of the reason I propose to send my wish list to Krampus. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fact of the matter is that I’ve been bedeviled by Krampus over the holiday season just past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Part of that’s due to the publication of a new fantasy novel, <span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times"><a href=http://www.bromart.com/krampus.html>Krampus the Yule Lord</a><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times">,</span></span> </span></span>in which the horned Yuletide spirit escapes from half a millennium of imprisonment to do battle with Santa Claus for dominion over the holiday season: something, that is, like a cross between <i>A Christmas Carol</i> and <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>. It’s got a portrait of Krampus on the front cover, and for months, when I visited libraries or walked past bookstores or waited in train stations next to one of those wretched little newsstands with a few books tucked in among the junk food and the magazines, there he’d be, leering out from the shelves. Meanwhile Krampus-themed holiday cards arrived from friends, as did emails from other friends asking me if I’d ever heard about...well, you get the picture.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, in my line of work, you learn early on how to recognize when an archetype is trying to get your attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Why exactly this particular archetype is clearing its throat and casting significant looks in the direction of a mild and middle-aged archdruid is something that I’ll doubtless figure out in due time. Meanwhile, though, it seems sensible enough to offer Krampus my wish list for next Yuletide, or whichever Yuletide is convenient; perhaps he can cash in some of those gold coins for a few research grants to get the process rolling. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So here are the things I’d like to see under the solstice tree one of these days, if a few scientists and engineers are willing to be Krampus’s little helpers and put them there. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
At the top of the list—well, let’s start by talking a bit about the most important legacy our civilization is going to leave to the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No, it’s not any of the things for which we like to preen ourselves; it’s the vast quantities of nuclear waste we’re heaping up for tomorrow to deal with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>I don’t know words sufficiently forceful in any language to describe the sheer brutal selfishness of the attitude that insists that our supposed need to prop up our extravagant lifestyles a little longer justifies generating wastes that remain lethal for a quarter of a million years, while doing absolutely nothing to keep them away from the biosphere for more than the smallest fraction of that interval. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, that’s business as usual in most of the world’s industrial nations these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sooner or later—probably after we get the statistically inevitable nuclear waste accident that turns a couple of hundred square miles or so of some industrial country into a dead zone nobody will be able to enter for the next millennium—finding some less self-destructively stupid way of dealing with the backlog of nuclear waste is going to be a major issue. When that time arrives, I’d like a technology that can do the trick:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>if at all possible, some way of making spent fuel rods and other high-level waste physically stable, chemically inert, and biologically inaccessible. Oh, and it needs to be tested thoroughly; this is not a situation in which it’s helpful to rely on the alleged properties of vaporware. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So that’s one thing I’d like to see appear under the solstice tree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another, along similar lines, is a more thoroughly developed system of bioremediation for getting persistent poisons out of soil and water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>High-level nuclear waste isn’t the only kind of poison industrial civilization likes to produce, and most of the others aren’t even sequestered temporarily in storage pools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All over the world, a great deal of soil and water has been contaminated with toxic metals and other pollutants, and these are things that our descendants are going to have to deal with for a very long time to come. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Bioremediation is one of the few effective low-tech methods for dealing with that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It so happens that some plants, and some other organisms, selectively take up toxic substances from the soil and concentrate them in their tissues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Experiments have been done showing that it’s possible, using repeated plantings of the right plants, to extract enough toxins from contaminated soils to make them safe again. A great deal of further work needs to be done in order to evolve a sufficiently extensive toolkit of bioremediation methods that can be applied, without high-tech infrastructure, to clean up the mess our civilization is going to leave behind it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It should have plants and other organisms suited to the widest possible range of ecosystems and climatic conditions, and it should also include relatively simple tests—the sort of things that can be done in a makeshift lab using readily available reagents—for sorting out what toxic substances are in a given body of soil or water, and need to be extracted.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Right next to that kit, I’d like to see something a little more literary—a good clear manual of ecology for laypeople, written in relatively simple language, focusing on the principles that our descendants are going to need to know as they contend with the heap of problems we’re leaving them. William Catton has usefully described ecology as “the study of the processes that matter;” our civilization has tried to pretend that those processes don’t matter, and the consequences of that pretense are among the most important factors tipping said civilization into the rubbish heap of history just now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It would be particularly nice if the manual were to walk its readers through the scientific method, teaching them how to formulate hypotheses and test them, so that the most valuable part of the grand intellectual adventure of science doesn’t get lost irretrievably during the dark age ahead of us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Finally, I’d like to see a way to turn sunlight into electricity that doesn’t depend on silicon chip fabrication and doping, or any of the other high-end infrastructure of the modern industrial system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve pointed out in previous posts that the way we use electricity nowadays, with sprawling regional grids to convey power from centrally located power plants to wall sockets that are constantly supplied with current, is as wasteful as it is unsustainable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That doesn’t mean that the future must do without electricity; it means that electricity in the future is far more likely to be generated and distributed on a village-scale or homescale basis, and used when it’s available, however intermittently that may be. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Generating electricity from wind and water will be easy for our descendants even in the absence of an industrial system—generators suited to that use can be built easily enough in a garage workshop, and so can waterwheels and wind turbines quite adequate for the purpose. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Solar electrical generation is considerably more challenging.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Photovoltaic (PV) cells, the mainstay of most solar electric systems today, require much the same manufacturing infrastructure as any other silicon-based semiconductor, and the likelihood that chip fabrication plants and everything needed to keep them running will be available in a deindustrial world is probably too small to worry about. The question remaining is whether there’s a less infrastructure-intensive way either to make PV cells, or to turn light into electricity in some other way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My hunch—and it’s only a hunch, I admit—is that thermoelectric generators using the Seebeck effect, and simple parabolic or conical mirrors to collect light, are a good bet; the technology’s simple enough that an ordinarily enterprising medieval alchemist could have knocked one together while waiting for the athanor to get up to heat. Still, it will take a good engineer or two to tinker with the technology, try different options, and work up a prototype that can show whether my hunch is right; meanwhile, there are no doubt plenty of other options to explore. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So that’s my first tentative list.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If I ever were to be plopped down in front of an audience of scientists and engineers, though, I’d get through the list as quickly as possible, and concentrate thereafter on the far more interesting project of seeing if the scientists and engineers can come up with other proposals to add to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The challenge there, of course, would lie in getting them to grips with the hard limits of a deindustrializing world, where population, gross domestic product, and resource availability are all declining steadily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In such a world, as already noted, the only technologies that can count on being preserved are those that can be kept running in an environment of scarcity, provide goods or services valuable enough to justify continued investment, and do so more economically than any other way of getting the same goods and services. These are not constraints that today’s scientists and engineers are used to facing, and getting them to take them seriously may take a certain amount of patience. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, it’s arguably worth doing, and for that reason I’m going to propose the challenge I mentioned earlier in this post. The peak oil science fiction contest this blog hosted back in 2011 left me very impressed with the creativity of this blog’s readership—those of you who weren’t following this blog yet back then can see for yourself in the pages of the anthology that resulted from that contest, <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/ >After Oil</a>—and I think it’s time to draw on that same resource again. So...drumroll please...we’re going to have another contest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here’s what I’m proposing. I’d like to ask this blog’s readers to break out their word processing programs again, but this time I’m looking for nonfiction papers with a scientific or technical slant, written for an intelligent nonprofessional audience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Each paper should either describe a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>problem that will confront the deindustrializing world in the course of the Long Descent, or propose a practical solution to some problem of this kind, or both.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Successful entries will start from the assumption that the unraveling of industrial society sketched out in this blog and my books <i>The Long Descent</i> and <i>The Ecotechnic Future</i> is a reality that has to be accepted, and go from there to deal with specific challenges that will follow from the shape of that future. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Please don’t simply rehash some issue that’s already been discussed a godzillion times already.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the other hand, you can certainly propose a novel solution to a familiar problem, just as you can come up with an unfamiliar problem that has some readily available solution; you can take a solution that’s currently in the conceptual stage, build a prototype, and report on it, and you can also present a problem that nobody’s thought of yet and say "we need to come up with some effective response to this." If your solution relies on vaporware—that is to say, theoretical technologies that haven’t been built or tested yet—say so, and don’t pretend that you can be sure in advance that it will work as well as you hope; you might also suggest some ways in which your vaporware can be tested for efficacy once a prototype gets built. If you build a working prototype of your proposed technology and describe how it worked, on the other hand, you get a good dollop of extra credit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I should stress here that I’m not looking for vague generalities, wishful thinking, or another round of apocalyptic fantasies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Long Descent is going to be a very challenging process all ‘round, but a great many of those challenges will be concrete problems that can be solved, or at least ameliorated, by applying the methods of science and engineering, or of plain pragmatic common sense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Creative thought is important here, but so is a solid grasp of the realities we face, backed up by a clear sense of what’s already known and has already been done; thus the essays that will come out in front in this contest will be those that combine original thinking with plenty of relevant footnotes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Essays should be between 1500 and 6000 words in length, not counting footnotes and references; they should be posted somewhere online—if you don’t have a blog, <a href=https://www.blogger.com/ >Blogger</a> will happily set you up with one—and a link posted on the comments page here. As before, the best dozen or so essays, as selected by me, will be going into an anthology, which I’ll edit and introduce; whatever royalties there may be will be split among the authors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Entries to the contest should be posted online by November 1, 2013.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After all, Krampus will doubtless need a little time to get the results ready to tuck underneath the solstice tree. </div>

Specifically, I’m thinking of biochar, to help restore degraded land (of which there is no shortage), and also charcoal’s ability to act as a water filter. And, hey, it’s also a useful fuel that is carbon neutral (if coppiced), easily controllable and doesn’t give people asthma if they are using it to cook indoors. <br><br>I’ll be doing my own pseudo-scientific experiments into all three of these possibilities as the years roll by, and will report my results.<br><br>As for Krampus and Yuletide, some of your readers might be interested to know that Christmas here in Denmark is still called Yuletide (albeit spelled Jul Tid) – which basically translates as ‘wheel time’.

I definitely intend to enter your contest. It’s late now, so I’ll digest your post more tomorrow and see if I’ve come up with any other ideas, but just to start:<br><br>What do you think of genetic engineering? By this I don’t mean inserting herbicide resistance genes into crop plants and patenting the resulting organism – I strongly object to that sort of behavior, as it goes against everything science stands for and diverts a substantial part of the world’s food supply into the coffers of a few corporations. But recent advances in molecular biology have allowed us to determine the function of many of the tens of thousands of genes that are located in any given organism, and it is possible to clone potentially useful genes into organisms that don’t ordinarily have them in order to develop new strains with useful functions. We can also knock genes out or upregulate them to increase their function.<br><br>This sort of technology is only going to be possible until science funding is slashed enough to render molecular biology research unaffordable. This will probably happen within the next decade or two. But, if we can engineer organisms (usually bacteria or fungi) with the capability to perform efficient bioremediation of chemical pollutants that are difficult to break down, the biosphere might benefit. The genetic changes are usually stable, so that a strain we create will retain the changes we have introduced over many generations. Thus, a genetically engineered organism used for bioremediation, produced when resources are still available, may be able to retain its function even after humans have lost the ability to do molecular biology.<br><br>Genetic engineering might also used to optimize the production of biogas in a fermenter or to produce cellulosic ethanol more efficiently. In both cases, only the C, H, and (sometimes) O in the biomass would be used to produce energy – the other elements could be returned to the soil. <br>I’d be the first to admit that genetic engineering is not some sort of panacea, and that GMOs could end up creating unanticipated ecological damage. But it is a relatively powerful technology, and one we’ll probably only be able to use for a limited time. The near future will probably involve many choices between certain environmental calamity and possible problems, and scientists and engineers are increasingly being forced into the position of having to gamble to minimize our damage.<br><br>Is this the sort of thing that you would be willing to consider? I ask mostly because my work involves genetic engineering of fungi for pretreatment of biomass to produce cellulosic ethanol more efficiently. Biofuels are bad in a number of ways, but they may be the only source of liquid fuels once fossil fuels are depleted, and we are trying to reduce their impact on food supplies and the environment. <br><br>I’m also going to try to think of other things that would meet the criteria a technology would have to satisfy in an era of resource decline. There are a number of alternate designs for solar cells, for instance, but I’m not sure that any of them would be less dependent on fossil fuels than our current silicon designs. I’ll look up some things and see what I find. <br><br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c8391389383151293307 title="comment permalink">1/10/13, 1:09 AM</a><br><br>

That quickly put local problems into perspective.<br><br>It didn't take much to Google the “Chernobyl exclusion zone”, and do a quick translation of that to Japan. OK, there are lots of variables which could affect the actual size and shape of the contaminated area, but my initial guess was that the situation could quite easily render a metropolitan area of tens of millions of people – i.e. greater Tokyo area – uninhabitable, if not eventually all of Japan. In due course, I wouldn't be surprised if that did happen, especially given the apparently farcical response to dealing with the situation, and ongoing lack of containment. And as so much has been leaking into the ocean, the damage is likely to be global.<br><br>So if this festering mess of a disaster isn't enough to cause panic and provoke some action to deal with the contamination, then I doubt anything will, at least until it's too late (assuming that it isn't already, and that the problems are tractable anyway).<br><br>Of course, the nuclear industry has no major incentive to do anything about it (other than manage the spin and downplay the damage).

Highly radioactive substances become inactive extremely quickly. Waste which might remain after 1/4 Million years is hardly hazardous in terms of its radioactivity. The problem is one of toxicity as is the case with many heavy elements which occur naturally in the environment.<br><br>Perversely, wildlife thrives where we have been excluded because of nuclear contamination.

The gases could be stored in tanks and used as fuel sources later on, producing clean water in the process. Although the amount of energy produced this way was not astoundingly large, it was relatively resilient, simple to operate, and less dependent on rare elements than photovoltaic cells are. The researcher hoped that his research could someday be used to produce enough energy in a day to cut down on the amount of fuel wood needed in Third World homes, limiting deforestation and making clean water more available. Interestingly, what he did not claim to be able to do was to figure out a way to power industrial society with sunlight - he more or less admitted in the article that this would be close to impossible. But he said that all sorts of interesting ideas opened up in his research once he moved beyond that - basically, beyond the limiting paradigm that anything he created had to be able to replace fossil fuels.

As I’m sure you realize, bioremediation is mostly about bio-accumulation — concentrating the pollutant in plant tissues so it can be more easily recovered and/or disposed of. What’s most exciting about myco-remediation is the fact that a number of fungi secrete enzymes that actually break down many toxic substances into harmless, or less harmless substances, including petroleum products. Many also hyper-accumulate heavy metals, and there has been some fascinating work done on bio accumulation of radiation, and some studies done on melanin-containing fungi that use radiation to convert sunlight into chemical energy.

Hadn't even known about this - and obviously Krampus is one variation of what in Finnish folk tradition is called Nuuttipukki (translation: Yule goat). Some photos from a folklore collection http://www.nba.fi/fi/kansallismuseo/kokoelmat/kuukauden_esine_2010/nuuttipukki (showing a mask used when being nuuttipukki and a somewhat unclear photo of a nuuttipukki in action wearing traditional attire). Definitely not a Santa character. The santa from coca-cola adverts has definitely usurped the original. Although a lot of the old tradition still survives. Like the bundles of branches that may be given to naughty children instead of presents. Or that's what is told to kids. A nice representative of the repressed part of human psyche in the agrarian past: drunken womanizer, rowdy and loud, doesn't work for living, somewhat scary and hairy. But what I am starting to think: what is repressed today? What kind of shadows do we project? Any schoolkid can access all sorts of sexual perversions freely in this information heaven. Mind-altering drugs of different effect are available either from doctors or the unofficial market, so a Krampus character would nowadays pass as a citizen among others. All the forbidden things are laid out for all to see. So, what is it that we as culture want to turn our heads away from? The thing that comes to my mind is waste. Garbage, the physical stuff (including nuclear wate), the inner garbage, all the dirt we think we can hide inside forever like a landfill that gradually grows into infinity - without anyone noticing. As if there's some invisibility cloak that covers waste, enabling most people to tune out of the reality of garbage. Hm, I vaguely remember Peter Sloterdijk saying something like this: nuclear bomb is the buddha of our day. But that goes as well for nuclear waste, doesn't it? It is just sitting still, doing nothing, and exposing us in our stupidity - to those who have eyes to see.<br><br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c3348701747869398665 title="comment permalink">1/10/13, 7:12 AM</a><br><br>

While our current era of cheap concentrated energy may go away, the idea of "technology" itself - as represented by the tools and methodologies with which we subjectively improve or further understand our world - will not, though it will change significantly. <br><br>One large area in which I have some serious concern is medicine. Some of the world's highest non-military technology goes into the medial field and has produced some incredible results (fMRI, scanning/tunneling electron microscopy, etc...). These technologies would likely be limited to extremely few institutes as the ability to maintain and produce them degrades. And a large part of modern medicine's successes stem from our ready access to heavily oil dependent pharmacology lab product and the logistic train that provides medical supplies to areas where they are not locally manufactured. Of course, we'll have to radically re-think our medical process, but perhaps there are ways to maintain reasonable care (e.g. for the most common maladies), local production of the more nature-based medicines, and effective prevention regimens for epidemics by thoughtful application of principles. This is an area in which I can see a huge need for research starting immediately as well, with virtually zero discussion among medical professionals that I've seen.<br><br>Also, along with the Seebeck effect, Stirling engines and the like are relatively simple to construct and also take advantage of thermal differences. Solar powered Stirling engines are growing in popularity as are those powered by other normal heating sources (wood, geothermal, etc). These are excellent and proven ways to generate reliable and often more-efficient-than-PV power from the sun which require not much more than slightly-enhanced-medieval manufacturing to produce. They are also far less likely to be damaged than PV and being convertible to other heat sources, are adaptable to varied climates and conditions seasonally. <br><br>Thanks again for a great, thoughtful, and thought-provoking post.<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c5811461211373394106 title="comment permalink">1/10/13, 7:25 AM</a><br><br>

There are ways around that awfulness, but you need to nanostructure the material to do it-- in short, the electrons need to be able to flow freely, as in a metal, but heat flow needs to be frustrated as in a glass. Figuring out what said structures would look like is not a trivial task, but one being embarked upon with the (insane) computational resources now available. <br>The problem is then synthesizing a real material with said structures. That is very difficult-- especially if you add the constraint that you want an alchemist to be able to perform the synthesis. <br>None of this is to say it's not doable-- but I wasn't able to get any funding or university support for it (too ambitious, I was told, and of course it does not fit in with the high-tech paradigm and our myth of progress; if it's better it HAS to need clean room techniques!) and have pretty much abandoned my hope of getting a PhD by consequence. <br><br>Fact of the matter is, even the ideal thermoelectric material faces the same thermodynamic constraints as the ideal mechanical heat engine; both are subject to the Carnot efficiency.Given that we can get fairly close to Carnot with a well-designed heat engine but nowhere near with the best thermoelectrics (and mechanical-to-electrical is never below 80% unless you're doing something awful) you're actually better off with the clanky steampunk version. For that matter, NASA's free-piston sterling project is still getting better efficiencies than existing or near-term thermoelectrics, and it doesn't clank-- the piston is the only moving part!<br><br>Ideally, we'd figure out a good thermoelectric nano-structure you could generate with something like a hydrothermal mineral synthesis out of readily available elements, but...

Coming from a physical science background, (physics B.S., currently Master's candidate in atmospheric science) I have to admit I'm a bit skeptical of your list of proposed technologies. Out of your four main wishes, the first two fall into what I'd like to call "cleaning up our mess" technologies. While that might make Gaia happy to see waste products no longer wasted, I think this is a bit of a broken philosophy.<br><br>While a bit more nebulous than hard sciences, I'd venture to argue that the psychology behind these first two technologies is to pray for, as you call it, vaporware, to deal with whatever externalities our current industralized house of cards produces. Monsanto likely has a division dedicated to cleaning up "poisioned" soils, until they can outsource more patented seeds and fertilizer to farmers/sharecroppers ready to poison soils all over again. This "mess cleaning" technology would allow our society to perpetuate the same damn mess of contamination and poisoning without actually changing our ways to adapt to any possibility of a deindustrialized future.<br><br>The fourth point sounds like Edison's revenge, and I agree completely. Small-scale energy production, moving towards Edison's idea of a generator on every block, is probably something that ought to happen sooner, rather than later.<br><br>I think the most important science related issue that ought to be dealt with is your third point. We do not live in a society that admires science beyond money making opportunities or exciting gadgets. Instead, I hear that the work I do has a “liberal bias” because it doesn't agree with the establishment's conclusions that we don't have to worry about the environment or what have you. We scientists need to get out there and show the messy, wonderful, and very necessary process that research goes through, to see that we scientists aren't any different from people in other fields, to gain an appreciation for what exactly is in the science we put in our grand applications.<br><br>Thanks for your weekly thought provoking posts JMG!

While I've adopted some high-tech solutions such as PV, my passion, and first choice, is to reclaim as much simple, sustainable technology as I can.<br><br>I'm sitting here looking at two thermostats. One is a fully-programmable electronic wonder, the other is a simple little box with a bi-metal strip and set of contacts. They both do essentially the same thing, excepting that the electronic wonder doesn't require one to remember to adjust it, whenever one needs to adjust a thermostat. What is the cost of this one 'advantage'? A much more resource intensive manufacturing process, battery replacement every 6-12 months, far more to go wrong, and 5 times the initial cost. I'll be surprised if it lasts as long as the simple bi-metal has been functioning perfectly; 40+ years. <br><br>While the daily routine of adjusting the thermostat or opening the blinds to let the sun in has become a meaningful part of my cycle, one wonders how long it will take for our culture to realize this small thing; the cost of convenience and complexity is that it robs us of some things. How to convince others that the simple solution is usually the better choice? I expect that circumstances will remind us that this may be so.<br><br>I encourage those who accept this challenge to review past posts (and other sources) pertaining to appropriate technology. Keep in mind that any solutions designed to allow a population of 7 billion humans to persist in reasonable comfort going forward are really Faustian in nature. Look for closed-cycle solutions that can be an end in themselves, not begging for improvements that beget poor returns, or requiring ongoing inputs other than a little human intervention.<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c2616683214365437614 title="comment permalink">1/10/13, 9:15 AM</a><br><br>

You're paying attention! Of course it's simply a matter of moving toxins from one place to another -- matter can be neither created nor destroyed, and heavy metals in particular are very hard to turn into inert forms -- so the point is to get them out of places where they enter the food chain, and either stash them in a secure location or (if you can do something with the metals that's useful -- for example, lead makes good batteries) extract the metal in usable form. <br><br>Grebulocities, I'm less than thrilled by genetic engineering; I don't think we know enough about whole systems to risk putting new transgenic organisms into the biosphere. Still, if you want to make a case for bioengineered organisms as a deindustrial technology worth pursuing, I'm not going to refuse to consider the paper. <br><br>Sea Spray, are you going to contribute a paper one one of these? <br><br>Kieran, true enough.

Keep us posted on the project; books like the one you've described are badly needed.<br><br>Mr Booch, one cubic meter per year from every nuclear power plant on earth adds up to a lot of high level waste in a hurry. Yes, I'm familiar with the logic used to justify further nuclear waste production; I consider it morally bankrupt, for reasons I've already discussed -- and blaming politics doesn't change the fact that we've got tons of the stuff piling up, and the supporters of nuclear energy are perfectly willing to let it pile up without making any sustained effort to deal with it. <br><br>Jeffrey, are you going to submit a paper on the subject? <br><br>Rhisiart, hmm.

The scientific method's ability to sort out replicable facts from handwaving is worth keeping -- most of the alchemists I know (and yes, I know a fair number of them) are as insistent on relying on experimental results as any scientist. <br><br>John, it's interesting to note that even when the price of nuclear fuel goes through the roof, reprocessing never gets more than enthusiastic words. I tend in situations like that to wonder if the technology is far less economical than it's cracked up to be. As for bioaccumulation, no argument there. <br><br>Dave, that's fascinating.

When you look deeply into it, most such lighting is motivated, at the core, by the desire to be able to see other people's faces at night. To make face illuminators succeed in the short term, the required social engineering (thaumaturgy, in your parlance) would far exceed the electrical, but in the longer term they might become inevitable, as a more compelling aid to social interaction in dim lighting than past methods such as powdered white wigs and big white ruffled collars.<br><br>There are a few other problems and ideas I've been chewing on... is this contest one entry per person?<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c5570185264377495979 title="comment permalink">1/10/13, 10:19 AM</a><br><br>

It's just that, incredibly, Japan has chosen not to abandon that future dead zone and instead is trying to pretend it didn't happen, while the horrifying consequences of that are only beginning to manifest. They simply lack the resources to do what is needed, and in hindsight that outcome is not a surprise.

I started the design of of a TEG several times now, but I'm lacking a couple of key inputs. One of which is the physical aspect of what I wish to use as a heat source and sink, as the design must be based on that geometry and temperature difference. One must also balance two opposing factors, namely reducing the internal electrical impedance of the junctions vs. maintaining sufficient thermal impedance so as not to reduce the temperature difference between the source and sink. This appears to be the fundamental compromise of a TEG. And you sure do need a bunch of junctions! It is a technology with a lot of inherent compromises and inefficiencies, but with the possibility of great resiliency. We will have to learn to live with compromises after all. <br><br>Nonetheless the project calls to me, as I design pulse width modulated switching power supplies. I am thinking less of a basement, craft type design at this point, and more of something that would make limited use of circuit boards and presently available electronic components, as it would reduce the time I must devote by allowing me to use design tools presently available.

Yep, here comes a story.<br> The Hourglass<br>The sand falls. It represents the Earth's life expectancy. It falls through the bottleneck of the hourglass.<br>You and I had hopes of prolonging our time here ... slowing the sand.<br>We've developed survival multipliers for most of our upright existance.

What is it made of ... how does it work. We cannot be sure of precisely how much sand there was, or is, or how much remains. I do think it is not difficult to know the structure and function of the hourglass. Picture it this way. <br>The glass is a rigid structure that on a microscopic level is pitted. One celled organisms inhabited this rugged landscape and formed the living layer that more complex life forms could cling to. Over time, the layers and their complexity grew, shrinking the diameter of hourglass neck. This gave life more time to be. As far as I can tell, only in our hopeful imagination can the neck of the hourglass ever fully close.<br>What happens when events on Earth, strip away living layers of constriction, in the neck of the hourglass?<br>WE, are a living, observable answer to that question. Two reasons. One is our tenacious human nature. The second is that self induced night blindness out of control. We must honestly recognize our nature to constructively work with it. The blindness is a veil we can choose to lift. Or not.<br>Here is the kicker. Even as most of us choose not see clearly, the veil is being lifted for us by our own actions and in-actions. The veil less view is getting tougher to face each and every day, making it less likely that you, the individual, will lift it with your own hands. <br>What we are doing now is "buying time" from our children ( that would be all newborns of all species). We are also losing time spent on the question" Are we as a species capable of recognizing, developing and maintaining a lively hood for our planet?"<br>Assume we are. Tell this story.

This brings up the question of how to transport materials there if one wishes to use the electricity or kinetic energy (skip the middleman) produced for industrial purposes.<br><br>Lo-tech has a couple of excellent articles relevant to this. One was on the industrial use of wind mills as a non-electric source of rotary motion, another was the article on the medieval Dutch use of Peat as an industrial fossil fuel and a recent article on the use of low level heat in industrial processes.<br><br>I'm not suggesting a reversion to burning peat, but some of the processes could be done with solar heat.<br><br>I find PV useful at least as a legacy technology. I'm used to the off the grid approach used in the '70's. The problems were battery life and voltage loss in long runs with 12 and 24 volt DC systems. Roof top applications with fat wire and short runs helps. So does storing your energy in the form of pumped well water in a large header tank, frozen food and water in a chest freezer, and a very _small_ battery bank for night lighting and the stereo. If you use electric appliances, use DC devices by day.<br><br>Glenn<br>Marrowstone<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c4140990831204414699 title="comment permalink">1/10/13, 12:17 PM</a><br><br>

The classic methods to obtain such flux is either an optimized research nuclear reactor or a particle accelerator targeting a lead block.<br><br>An alternative could be a device called a Fusor, shorthand for an Inertial-Electrostatic Confinement (IEC) thermonuclear fusion reactor. It sounds overly complex and quite dangerous, but it's in fact quite simple to build : an amateur can manufacture one for about 2000$ of materials and obtain a flux of 10^9 neutrons/s.<br>http://www.belljar.net/634fusor.pdf<br><br>The efficiency of these basic models is pitiful (Eout/Ein=10^-6) but the energy released by the nuclear transmutation should offset these figures. Other configurations like the PolyWell could offer much better efficiencies or even a break-even.<br>http://www.polywellnuclearfusion.com/PolywellReactor/Wiffleball.html<br>http://www.polywellnuclearfusion.com/PolywellReactor/MakingElectr.html<br><br>- <b>Low-tech photovoltaics</b><br>Someone named Pr. Gerald Pollack claimed to have discovered a "liquid crystal" effect in water exposed to IR radiation. This structuring of the water molecules leads to a charge separation that can be transformed into an electrical current. <br><br>He filled a patent of a PV cell based on this principle that only uses water and transparent hydrophilic materials. <br>http://www.faqs.org/patents/app/20120067390<br>The corresponding document reads like a long science paper and contains all the information needed to understand/build the concept. The claimed efficiency is only 1/5 of conventional PV cells, by this technology is in its infancy and progress is still possible.<br><br>- <b>Low-tech wind power</b><br>Another inventor has proposed an electrostatic windmill that collects charged particles from the atmosphere via airfoil-shaped wind-vanes. The figures given in the patent below are a little dubious, but the invention is now in the public domain and the system is very simple to build, so free experimentation is possible.<br>http://www.google.com/patents/US4494009<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c787145924030941904 title="comment permalink">1/10/13, 2:05 PM</a><br><br>

The destiny of books is not always pretty.) If there are not a lot of copies available, the book is no longer a book but merely a treasured artifact.

That said, have you considered the possibility that PV manufacture might not be the exclusive domain of a high tech, high energy intensity civilization? After all, the first PV cell was made in 1880-something. (Granted they had more fossil energy in those days, but they were not very good at harnessing it, so their effective available energy intensity might be similar to a future scenario.) And it is possible to manufacture LEDs (essentially the same technology) in a garage workshop, which I have done.<br><br>The efficiency of cells made in a low-tech environment would no doubt be poor by modern standards, since the purity of the material and the quality of the cleanroom would both be sub-standard.

There is very little incentive currently to do that kind of research, because a low-efficiency PV cell is worthless in the context of the modern economy.

No, I hadn't heard about the Yule Goat. My take is that Krampus is still very much a projection of our shadow, because he represents the thing nobody in the comfortable classes of the industrial world likes to talk or think about -- our absolute dependence on the cycles of nature and on our own biology. Biophobia is very deeply entrenched in the modern mind. <br><br>Lewis, thanks for the link!<br><br>Captain D., either of those would be great topics for a paper. Shall I expect one or both from you? <br><br>KCR, are you considering a paper on the subject? <br><br>G-minor, no, we haven't. The accident I described is what happens *after* Unit 4 catches fire and makes a quarter of Honshu uninhabitable for millennia. Until that happens, people can pretend that it won't. <br><br>Steve, nope, no limit at all. I'm unlikely to choose more than two from any one person for the anthology, but the more good papers you put in, the better your chance of being included!<br><br>Max, well, let's see whether it actually happens. <br><br>Tyler, that would be a very good paper. One thing I'd bring up, though, is that efficiency of energy conversion is not the only thing that matters. If you have low conversion efficiency, but the technology is cheap, easy to build, and has a very long working life, it can be more efficient in human terms -- and economic ones -- to go with that, in place of a technology that's more efficient in the strict sense but costs more, requires more infrastructure, and has a shorter working life. You can get a decent Seebeck Effect with simple bimetallic strips -- the Soviets used to make DC generators powered by a kerosene lantern to power radios in Siberia, for example, and those were an extremely efficient use of limited resources. <br><br>Max, the first thing on my wish list is the statement of a problem. The second is anything but vaporware -- did you notice that I mentioned there's already been quite a bit of experimentation done? As for the relevance of cleanup, the generations that will come after ours have already been guaranteed a messy, toxic environment, and I don't think it's a bad idea to help get them some tools to help clean it up. As for the third option, I agree that it may just be the most important -- and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to take the lead in making it happen. Somebody in the scientific community needs to do so!<br><br>Steven, of course that's a problem as well.

In the future, for every person thinking about how to minimize the technological complexity needed to build solar generating systems, we will have someone thinking about how to build military hardware to conquer and someone thinking about how to extract the last bit of burnable fuel. Science based technology offers many avenues for pursuit of each of these goals, (and it will allow people to pursue many other goals as well). Appropriate technology in the future is going to depend critically on what humans have done in pursuit of these goals. If we happen to extract a lot of carbon and maintain a large population on a planet 10C warmer than today, we need different technology than if we kill each other off in resource wars. And of course if enlightenment magically started spreading like the flu and everyone decided to work together toward the least disruptive adjustment to the constraints of the future, a different set of technology is needed. It all depends on what the humans do. And we can only guess what the humans are going to do. <br><br>My best guess starts from the hypothesis that there are many configurations of society accessible to people with science based technology. Our current configuration of growth and extravagant resource waste is coming to an end. But the societies to follow may well remain technologically quite complex. (So I don't think White's law is very useful. Complexity clearly doesn't depend directly on energy flow. As a simple example, note that the most complex things in our solar system live on planet earth, not at the surface of the sun. One way for a society to become more complex is to harness more energy. But there are many other ways to increase complexity. Advanced human technologies include hand held computers that require a tiny fraction of the energy that a human requires.) There are massive changes between here and the future configurations of technology because much of our infrastructure is unsustainable. But I don't think 'descent' is a good framework to think about this. It assumes that the final point is simple (or at least at a known elevation), when it seems human culture is likely to evolve on an unpredictable trajectory between configurations that are quite complicated and include some technology that is more complex than we have today.<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c2719148061525763645 title="comment permalink">1/10/13, 6:38 PM</a><br><br>

Frank Shuman showed that CSP was perfectly suitable for significant quantities of mechanical power over 100 years ago. Check out his thermal power station in Maadi, Egypt circa 1912. It looks remarkably similar to the latest parabolic trough systems. <br><br>Plus, while CSP to mechanical power is within the realm of "craft" construction, it is only a slight step up in complexity to run the engine or turbine powered electrical generator that Stuart mentioned. While wind-to-mechanical predates steam, steam to electric predates wind to electric. More importantly, any of the forgoing is far more efficient than heat to electric via the Seebeck effect.<br><br>CSP is so simple in concept and practice that it will likely find a place in human cultures that have technologies ranging from the horse and buggy to the electric train. <br><br>Indeed, when one combines CSP together with inexpensive high temperature sensible heat storage, it could have also powered our present high-tech civilization.

Equally, as I keep on pointing out, it's not the energy used to power a technology that matters, but the energy needed to make it, and to maintain the infrastructure that makes it, powers it, maintains it, and gives it something useful to do. A human being can be manufactured by two human beings of appropriate age and genders; a microcomputer needs one or more factories, plus mines, power plants, etc., etc. Another Lolcat caption: "This computer cannot have puppies; your argument is invalid." <br><br>Joe, I'm familiar with the Maadi installation, and with the history of solar energy generally.

This is why my plan for a solar thermoelectric generator uses a conical reflector -- it's modeled on Augustin Mouchot's solar steam engines -- and one of those evacuated tubes with a copper rod up the middle that are used in a lot of solar water heating installations these days. The tube runs up the center of the conical reflector, soaking up heat; the bare end of the copper rod is behind the point of the cone, and that's where you attach the bimetallic strips, with big aluminum cooling fins to radiate heat from the cold ends; a gimmick to keep the device pointed at the sun also keeps the cooling fins in shade.

For context, you have to know that while I know scientists who <br>will continue to do research even without being paid, those who will without <br>coffee are rarer than pandas in the desert. <br> <br>Anyway, the coffee supplies were bought by one of the senior scientists, based <br>on a trust-and-pay system. When I went to pay for the first time, he showed me a <br>little metal box on a shelf. I opened it, and found money, a pen, and a piece of <br>paper. I put the money in, and wrote down my name and for how much I was in. <br> <br>Then, I smugly turned to him and said "Man, you are the boss of a group that <br>leads computing in one of the top satellite experiments, and who sits on one of <br>the world's three largest and most powerful computing centers, and you keep <br>track of the coffee money like that ? ". <br> <br>To that, he smiled and answered "Appropriate technology". <br> <br>I like to tell this story because each time I feel the reminiscence of the spark <br>it lit in me. You know, this little timeless "click". You might not feel it when <br>you read it, but even then, just the pleasure of telling it was worth the time <br>to me. <br> <br>I remembered it in the context of this discussion, because it made me think <br>again that in an age where we invented "planned obsolescence" (If Hell exists, <br>and Hell has N circles, we deserve an N+1 one for this sin), while we have the <br>potential to make tools so resilient that they could still be useful artifacts <br>in a few centuries, I don't think we have the ability to make them. Several <br>comments mentioned that there is little incentive currently for professional <br>engineers and scientists to explore this path, and it is as true as it is <br>sad. On the other hand, I saw several projects descriptions that were. <br> <br>To them and those I don't know off I offer the little story above, and the spark <br>that goes with it. May you never lack coffee ! (Or tea. Those are two schismatic <br>schools, and since no tea nor coffee crusade has stated yet, this state of <br>affair is likely to pertain for the foreseeable future) <br> <br>Sebzefrog at hotmail dot fr <br><br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c7842909331825540840 title="comment permalink">1/11/13, 12:59 AM</a><br><br>

Dry lightning had kicked off a fire this morning not too far from me in the Lederderg Gorge and I watched as "Elvis" the water tanker helicopter flew off towards it. Volunteer crews were also on the ground too. Apparently it is now contained. Imagine that scene in an energy constrained future. Looking down into the valley below it is fairly smoky. Here, the house can look after itself, but if only it didn't take so many years to grow a productive tree...<br><br>Keep us in your thoughts as you shiver through the Northern winter. Summer has a long way to go yet. Pray for rain seems like a good suggestion just about now.<br><br>As a suggestion to readers, electricity is really useful for pumps (DC pumps are particularly efficient) and moving liquids like water is a really valuable thing - especially up hill (as I can attest). How about an easy to make and efficient hand operated pump than can lift water up an incline?<br><br>I'll put my hand up for a worm powered crap muncher (ie. an aerobic fast compost producer for those more technically inclined). A very simple and useful item indeed for most organic wastes including human wastes!<br><br>I'm planting oak trees, lots of them as a protective border for the orchard, but I need a decade or two of uninterrupted growing conditions.<br><br>Hi Thijs,<br><br>Thanks for your thoughts. There are a lot of individual fires extending from the south in Tasmania through Victoria, New South Wales and right into Queensland. Temperatures generally peak here around late January early February, so I'm quite nervous. The rains have failed here since early September, but the orchard is still limping along. I was literally ready to start the sprinklers today and head off (run from the hills for the musicians in the readership!). Mind you, in the North West of the continent there's a category four cyclone... That's summer Down Under for you.<br><br>Hi BoysMom,<br><br>Antibiotics. Perhaps this may not be as difficult as you think? Herb lore shows that many plants have antibiotic, anti-viral, and / or anti-bacterial properties. That's just the beginning of their uses too.<br><br>Hi Leo,<br><br>Good luck with your placements and I hope you get the spot that you are after.<br><br>Hi Betsy,<br><br>Thanks for the tip re Steve Solomon. I haven't read his work. My go to author here is Jackie French who writes both fiction and non-fiction and walks the talk as she has been at organic gardening and self-sufficiency for over 30 years. I've visited her garden and it is truly an amazing place. I mustn't complain about the weather as one year she had 90 consecutive days in excess of 40 degrees (being a bit further north than me and in a drier location)!<br><br>The food we eat nowadays isn't the same stuff that I ate in my youth.

Which of course does not matter much. Just that I have been surprized.<br><br>The thing with books concerns me as well, but I wanted to suggest something similar to Robert Mathiesen, although I am not a historian of the book. However, if you are interested in history of literature or simply in historical philology, you know there are relatively many books that survived for several centuries, including e.g. low-cost popular literature from the 18th century etc. And if take the example of China (I am a sinologist), one can find both hand-written and printed books dating from the Song dynasty, mostly 12th c., though these tend to be the oldest preserved versions of ancient texts. Ming prints (14th-16th c.) are relatively common. And all this book culture is purely pre-modern and pre-fossil. As well as the whoole technology of print. It is however important that there is someone who understands it and has experience with it: there are still some older people left who worked with metal types, but the art is vanishing, of course.<br><br>More generally, I am happy that philology is not much dependent on high technology (though computers do help much in some respects), and also that I studied Chinese in basically pre-electronic times (though it is only 15 years ago!), so I am comfortable with paper dictionaries, pen and paper, and we my memory. Present students are mostly dependent on electronic devices, and also their memory is poorly excercised (beacause they can always look up a word in a phone and so on) - which fits in the ommipresent ideology of "new learing" - memorizing is bad, you do not need to know anything by heart, it is not creative, everything is on the internet, etc. This is very dangerous in a way.<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c4448725651314313593 title="comment permalink">1/11/13, 1:37 AM</a><br><br>

Though it does not solve the large legacy of energy-wasting housing in Britain (23M homes), I like it. And a large chunk of our house needs re-building, so I guess it will happen one day. I would like to put together the idea of long lived structures that will still work satisfactorily centuries from now. <br><br>Even in wet Britain, cow dung (short durable fibres – see one of the recent comments on this blog) mixed with slaked lime (heated carbonate rock in powder form – and one can use the principles of Roman concrete) protect for 600 – 800 years an otherwise vulnerable quick-grown wooden matrix (e.g. split hazel rods) set in a timber oak frame. A version in France has now got a modern renaissance with short hemp fibres substituted for the dung. The alkali preservation principle still applies and the wet-mix can be cast in a self-supporting wall round a simple wooden frame.<br><br> The lime fraction gradually absorbs CO2 and will eventually go back to rock carbonate. The main advantage though apart from ease of construction is that the wall can be airtight and provides a warm high heat-mass structure fairly easily sealed round openings and piercings. <br><br>We intend to test whether it can be integrated with Passiv Haus design without so much of the difficult and exacting quality control needed for taped and caulked joints, nowadays needing exotic materials with a life-time of perhaps only a few decades.<br><br> Passiv Haus needs glass of course, and I am even contemplating stainless steel for roof sheeting (the latter has been used locally where salt resistance and longevity were rated important). <br><br>It would be nice to leave behind a 500 year house well above the flood plain. And to imagine it could be renewed 500 years from now. That is a lot of families secured for a low energy life. <br><br>I visited a new ‘conventional’ small Passiv Haus where the &gt;90% efficient air-exchange heat recovery machine was a wonder to behold – but at the end of the day a gas porous insulating thatch might have to do for our more distant descendants.<br>best<br>Phil<br><br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c7399197715672438492 title="comment permalink">1/11/13, 3:33 AM</a><br><br>

A lot of it depends on what kind of paper you use. At a previous job I've handled both print and manuscripts all the way back to 17th century and the paper was fine. Many of them (especially manuscripts) had not been stored in any particularly good location, but just in a normal home of those times, which meant no central heating in winter and no AC in summer. Humidity and temperature vary *a lot* between summer and winter here in Sweden, and in wintertime a lot during the course of the day if there's no central heating.<br>The problem with current books is that they're nearly all printed on paper made from wood fibres, which breaks down much quicker than paper made from textile fibres. Paper used to (pre-1840s) be made from rags, i.e. fibres from hemp, linen or cotton. The older the books are, the greater the chance that the fibre is of better quality, since linen and hemp are better than cotton.<br>So the technology for printing and binding durable paper books using low-tech equipment is already well developed, just that very few people nowadays actually possess the skill to do it.<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c2265070490966607635 title="comment permalink">1/11/13, 8:10 AM</a><br><br>

How to make the lesson real in the here and now in whatever space and time is my conundrum.

He invented and sucessfuly built several solar plants, but from what i gather one of his last solar ideas, the low pressure solar engine never saw full development due to the ramping up of the oil industry, WWI and ultimately his age.<br>The concept is that you can build low cost low temperature solar collectors in a variety of schemes. By running a steam cycle at sub atmoshperic pressures you can operate a steam engine with energy from the low cost collector. This was succesflly demonstrated here http://books.google.com/books?id=ygQiAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=shuman+solar+vacuum+steam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eJYbw0hUaF&amp;sig=RgV5kFfoqlFPustSGMD3qUf6sQQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DqHwUPOYFaKW2AXe2IG4BQ&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=shuman%20solar%20vacuum%20steam&amp;f=false<br><br>Of course the drawbacks are low energy densities and low efficiencies. The later can be overcome by superheating the steam with some other combustible fuel source. The result is you could have simple hybrid solar steam cycle that gets 75% of its thermal energy from the sun, 25% from a combustible fuel source and has an overall cycle efficiency of 30%. I skectched out the idea a bit more fully here http://symbioticsystems.weebly.com/blog.html <br><br>I also believe that at such low pressures an alternative engine may be worthhile to pursue. A very simple low speed turbine comes to mind. No it would not need to be complicated, it would be on the order of complexity of an old wind mill, the differential pressures are only 2-3 times higher than what those were designed for. <br><br>The system would also have the advantage of also producing ample hydronic heating for homes, greenhouses or buildings.<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c7122995120910798545 title="comment permalink">1/11/13, 3:54 PM</a><br><br>

First, since we are talking about technological progress I want to bring up Wright's Law. <a href=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/moores-law-semiconductors-intel-chip,16734.html rel=nofollow>link</a> <a href=http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/at-work/test-and-measurement/wrights-law-edges-out-moores-law-in-predicting-technology-development rel=nofollow>link</a> Put simply Wright's Law says that you get better with practice. Specifically it says that you can measure the improvement in a technical process as a function of cumulative production. Wright worked with airplanes and he noticed that every time the cumulative production double the price dropped by the same percent. I bring this up because I misread 'White's Law' in your post and because the cumulative production of parabolic Seebeck thermoelectric generators is approximately zero. That means that there are lots of gains to be had in the early production if, and only if, someone actually produces a few of them.<br><br> Wright's law isn't perfect. It can't forecast novel breakthroughs and it breaks down over the very long run as progress becomes asymptotic. But what it does tell us is right on target for this post. If you want a technology to work well you have to use it. More to the point, if YOU want a technology that no one is using to work well then YOU have to use it. There are somethings that can be counted on to happen automatically: the sun will come up tomorrow all by itself, humanity will burn all the fossil fuels we can find, death, taxes, etc. For everything else you have to be the change you wish to see in the world: democracy, slide rules, organic gardening, etc. <br><br> That said birth control is the technology that I think we will need but might not have. Birth control has a long history and there are some reasonably effective methods from preindustrial times but mass produced disposable latex probably won't make it through the long descent and I don't know enough chemistry to know if the pill can be made reliably in a low tech world. Lamb skins, condoms made from intestines, will always be available but they are relatively expensive. I imagine that regular access to lamb skins will be a luxury somewhat like regular consumption of meat is a luxury to most in a collapsing society.<br><br> The birth control technology that I think will work in the deindustrial future is the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_device rel=nofollow>IUD</a>. It requires only a small amount of copper, plastic, and skill. But every step of the process from the manufacture to the administration is managed by the healthcare industry. Trying to use 'the technology' on the level of the home economy would probably land one in jail for for a variety of violations. The problem, as I imagine it, is that people who lose access to the healthcare industry will lose access to the IUD. More and more people will lose access as we progress through the long descent until, eventually, there are no IUDs. I suspect that a small scale production of IUDs for local health professionals could work in some third world areas where there isn't any healthcare industry controlling the process or taboos and regulations for obtaining care outside the healthcare industry's purview. Doctors without borders and engineers without borders may find a paper on the subject useful. I will see what I can come up with.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c8413655235842502994 title="comment permalink">1/11/13, 7:57 PM</a><br><br>

That is, they can be answered with a reasonable amount of effort in some cases but not in most. Among them are:<br><br>1. How much energy is required to make a [thing]?<br><br>2. What is the EROEI of a given process, taking all relevant factors into account?<br><br>3. What technologies/products are and are not likely to exist in a given (broadly outlined) energy-contracted future scenario?<br><br>(I've split out further discussion of these questions, including why seemingly obvious methods of answering them don't usually work -- for instance, why the amount of energy <i>currently used</i> to make a [thing] often does not provide an answer to Question 1 -- to <a href=http://myriad-library.blogspot.com/2013/01/unanswerable-questions-and.html rel=nofollow>a blog post</a>.)<br><br>I accept that everything that is unsustainable will not be sustained (which is a mere tautology); that significant energy contraction will occur soon and eventually will be followed by population contraction; that fantasies of boundless futures and of apocalyptic endings (neither of which I ever put much stock in anyhow) all miss the mark; and that preparation for worse- and worst-case scenarios, such preparation as is the predominant topic here, is justified, wise, and prudent. All the rest, every crucial detail of the journey and the destination, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMFNQDtGin8#t=1m0s" rel=nofollow>is in doubt</a>.<br><br>So, what <i>I</i> want from Krampus is better methods of analysis and prediction, that can address questions like those I listed. I'm tired of trying to extrapolate from historical analogy, dubious models, false polarities, authority, and intuition. I'm tired of being on either side of some of these arguments about what's going away (my viewpoints make me a relative cornucopian here, and a relative doomer on my "home" forum), and of not even knowing which side I should be on, because the known facts plus the available methodologies fall short of adding up to answers. I'm especially tired of abstruse hypotheses about the mechanisms by which those holding a different viewpoint must have been rendered incapable of valid thinking.<br><br>My request should be right up Krampus's alley, because I'm not asking for reassurance or verification. I don't care about proving anyone right or wrong. I abjure any hopes and fears I might have harbored about those answers. Krampus is welcome to treat my wish as an opportunity to pull a classic "be careful what you wish for" on me.<br><br>So let's see if there's enough of this Krampus fellow in me, for that wish to have any effect over the coming year. Odd; his shape seems to resemble another dude, who's also all about consequences, and with whom I've had some issues in the past.

My father used to tell a me a story about two Russians who rewrote/translated windows 3 into machine code. Not compiled from source code, mind you, but reverse engineered from functionality directly into machine code. I'm told that they did it in 27KB for the whole OS. It booted up in two seconds flat on an 8086. Or so I'm told. It might have been exaggerated like an old fisherman's tales. <br><br> But it brings up an interesting point. I bring this up because I used to think that there was a market for writing a modern OS in machine code. Writing the OS would be a huge undertaking because every line of code would need to be translated to machine code by a real human being who understands both what the program is trying to do and how that could be written in machine code most efficiently for that machine. The upside being that the OS would be much, much smaller and run much, much faster than a compiled version. I gave the idea up years ago because the architecture kept changing so quickly. Any machine I picked to work with would be hopelessly out of date well before I finished and the gains in processor speeds and storage capacities would dwarf any gains I had made.<br><br> But, depending on how the future goes, we may all be working on the same version of Myriad's plywood computer for decades. Just as food for thought Iceland currently has three aluminum smelters running off of the country's cheap geothermal electricity. Also, France has two solar furnaces for research into smelting and purification. They could probably be retasked to make some reasonably pure silicon for low power CMOS. Failing that glass blowers and seamstresses could (and did) make the vacuum tubes, core magnetic memory, and core rope memory for a small amount of computing power.<br><br> But it depends on the economics. There is going to be a heartless triage of resources as our massive fossil fuel subsidy wanes. What makes the cut will largely be determined by the present utility offered by a given technology. <br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c1251586118983385414 title="comment permalink">1/11/13, 10:02 PM</a><br><br>

This sounds great. I've recently been offered (yet to recieve) a position as resident artist at a tip shop. One of the idea's I've had is to have a design competition for making resources that regularly come through the tip into useful objects, that could be turned out on a regular basis, eg solar stills, pvc pipe pumps, etc. The catch is it has to be useful, and not just aesthetic, and it has to be made from scraps only. Maybe some glue or fasteners here or there. <br><br>Bio remediation is the key I feel. I have heard of some very successful uses of this. The problem as Allison mentioned is that it is essentially bio-accumulation. I have read f experiments using worms to deal with municipal sludge, with some pathogens being removed and heavy metals being accumulated by the worms. Together with myco-remediation, I'm picturing a multi stage remedial process including plants and worms. If there was something like a bio-foundry then, that extracted the metals - without causing more pollution in the process - then we may be on our way to a whole new R &amp; D department for future governments and niches for entrepreneurs.<br><br>An idea that I have had kicking around for a while, is a series of greenhouses that extract transpiration from plants and drip-feed it to a well. In my mind it is done with glass doors and simple metal/timber frames and even with a tyre tube controlled vent that expands and contracts with temperature variation to allow for air flow at night.<br>I don't eevn know if it will work but it sounds neat.<br><br><br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c6499524417008773484 title="comment permalink">1/11/13, 11:01 PM</a><br><br>

Having relatively safe and at least moderately effective methods of birth control makes a great difference to women's health and lifespans and to people's ability to match family size to resources. Birth control, if it's safe, does not have to be totally reliable to be of benefit. Without it, you have high infant mortality or infanticide, both of which are tough on everybody.<br><br>Birth control falls into several categories: physical barriers between eggs and sperm, measures to reduce female fertility, interfering with the implantation of the fertilized ovum in the uterus, and bringing on a menstrual period before the embryo has had much time to develop.<br><br>Physical barriers are the most straightforward, but given the differences in male and female priorities, an easily insertable and removable cervical cap dressed with some kind of spermicidal goop,<br>or just the goop in the form of a thick salve would be likely to get more consistent use than any kind of condom. Such things may already exist.<br><br>I've read that in hunter-gatherer societies, mothers suckle their babies for a long time and this reduces the speed at which they get pregnant again. If true, a safe method of hormonal birth control but one that is self limiting.<br><br>Regulating fertility by ingesting hormones is a brute force approach, overriding natural body functions. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Ayurvedic or Chinese or other systems of medicine have gentler methods of influencing female hormone production, that for cultural reasons aren't widely known. But I'm only speculating.<br><br>The original IUD was supposedly a pebble shoved through the cervix of a camel, so they've been around for a while. I have read that IUDs prevent implantation by causing some kind of irritation or low level inflammation of the uterine lining. Some designs of IUDs have a risk of perforating the uterus. Childbirth is dangerous too, so maybe the trade off is worth it.<br><br>The European herbs that are reputed to bring on an early miscarriage are effective in doses that are pretty poisonous, making the woman sick. So not suitable for routine use.<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c170001076575834993 title="comment permalink">1/12/13, 6:16 AM</a><br><br>

Plenty of naturally occurring processes in the wrong place could cause a lot of harm. <br><br>Seb, thank you! An excellent point. <br><br>Cherokee, stay safe. That's not a situation I'd want to be in. <br><br>Lei, based on what I've read, Krampus is primarily a tradition in Germany, Switzerland, and Poland -- does anybody go around with St. Nicholas in Bohemia?

I've already pointed out that the issue I'm trying to raise focuses on whole system issues, and here you are trying to refocus the debate on some individual detail, where you can easily insist "Oh, sure, we can do X to solve that." It's like the situation of the guy who has $1000 a month in income and $1500 a month in expenses; you can always argue that he has enough money for any individual expense -- $750 for rent is less than that $1000 income, so is $150 for food, $200 for utilities, etc., etc., but at the end of the day the guy is still going broke. <br><br>Karim, will you be submitting a paper? <br><br>Flagg, I'd welcome a paper on that topic. <br><br>Jcummings, it's a good start, but falls below the minimum word count, and I don't see any citations of sources to back your claims.

Are you up for writing a paper on simple Stirling engines for the competition? <br><br>Ceworthe, glass is tolerably easy to make, and it makes a better glazing for solar box cookers anyway, so that'd be my suggestion there.

Yes, low-tech ways of cleaning polluted water are important. <br><br>Ken, we can't uninvent the last 200 years, but information loss can do it for us; you might look up some day how much Roman technology vanished for centuries, or forever, with the coming of the Dark Ages. Information is no more durable than whatever material substrat carries it, and nearly all our information these days is on highly vulnerable substrates. <br><br>Richard, well, there have been plenty of ideas tossed around so far in the comments to this post -- do any of them catch your fancy? <br><br>Wall, will you be writing a paper on any of them? <br><br>Nick, will you be writing a paper on this?

No, it won't wipe out most life on the planet, though it would kill a lot of people and other large vertebrates. One of the downsides of the internet is the sort of apocalypse machismo you see on so many forums -- "I can imagine a more devastating cataclysm than you can!" -- and that leads to inaccurate information of the sort you've repeated here.

(Some fast-talking Harold Hill neon salesman must have moved through our town, because in the last year many new businesses have acquired these signs, even a mortuary, which flashes pictures of the recently dead on theirs). He informed me that no one would give up their rights to all-night lighting because of fears of crime. Yet we had a derecho that knocked out electricity for days, with no attendant crime wave.

That wouldn't be consistent with their licenses, of course. Whether or not the FCC (or anyone else)will be in a position to enforce licensing of amateur vs. commercial radio stations is a question worth some thought. Decline need not mean anarchy.<br><br>Without spectrum management (that is, allocating frequency channels to specific uses), a radio system can become useless due to interference from other stations. If a reliable link is to be established, the receiver needs to know where to listen. Ham radio has very few specific frequencies, though certain users have such strong habits that they have de-facto ownership of the frequency (such as the maritime amateur net on 14.300 MHz, or W1AW's list of frequencies). But these are essentially "water holes" where many hams can gather. To run a wireless telegraph carrying 3rd-party traffic would work best licensed to a small set of frequencies (like ShipCom LLC has).<br><br>Within our lifetimes, ham radio will probably best be used to share informal observations, ham to ham, as well as coordinating disaster response when existing emergency communications systems aren't working (whether destroyed by the disaster, or abandoned due to budgetary limits).<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c571100045577889264 title="comment permalink">1/12/13, 7:43 PM</a><br><br>

You can remove, for example, dangerous lectins from legumes that cause bloating in human and cattle in just one season, not generations. Or you can reinforce the plant inmunitary system (yes they have one) in an hereditary fashion, making innecesary the toxic products that are spread nowadays. Although this of course is of no interes to agrobiochemical industry. From my viewpoint the real problem with OMGs is that many metabolic routes are interconnected, and when you modify something, you can easily get unexpected results. We do not know enough yet. But this is also how evolution has worked, and now is certain than non-man-made transgenesis, the exchange of genes across species and phyla has been very usual. Bacteria that use plants originated genes and viceversa, often with viruses as vehicles. The best point but also the worst point of transgenic beings is that they can remain extant after the technology that made them possible has dissapeared.<br>In respect to your question, plants can be engineered to stand toxic molecules by deactivating and restraining their access to vital parts. Knowledge on the mechanisms that could move those compounds to "safe" areas (fruits or epidermal hairs) is still in its infancy but growing fast. In USA something you should be watching carefully is the aquifers contamination by arsenic.<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c7257986705942928471 title="comment permalink">1/13/13, 7:04 AM</a><br><br>

They didn't publish it as far as I know (saying they didn't have a technology issue coming up, but I might have made some snide remarks about high tech permaculture and its uncomfortable relation to industrial technology). The generator was made of junkyard parts--metal wire, coffee cans and 55 gallon steel drums, a bit of plastic or rubber hose, and fishing line. It was powered by falling water, yet had no moving parts. It generated voltages higher than 100KV, but currents small enough not to kill a human or animal that touched it. It had several things that could be improved--such as a needed electrostatic servo mechanism to turn off the water when the charge was sufficient for a zap. We had an essentially "unlimited" supply of water from a spring, so I didn't work on that. More vexing was the low output impedance, which meant that weeds, spider webs and excessive humidity could effectively short out the device. I could think of a solution that required more flow of water. But ultimately, we decided to transplant a bunch of trifoliate orange hedge around the garden, and that seemed a better solution, though less sexy. <br>Which brings me to what I really want to say: with the exception of new problems like nuclear and other toxic waste, and using materials from junkyards, we do not need new technologies. What we need is to network old technologies (and more difficultly, people who are skilled at these technologies). These already have all the constraints we need (locality, energy density, etc). It's mostly an information problem, but a networking type of information, a wholistic, system type of information, as well as recovery of particular trade tricks. Hundreds of different trades need to be renetworked. For example, today's blacksmith will need to be retrained to work with local materials. Today's cooper is non-existant and will need to be resuscitated from libraries. But I don't think it makes sense to do any of this purely in isolation, we have an ecosystem of technology similar to all complex systems. Pragmatically, since I have been unsuccessful so far in getting hundreds of craftspeople, farmers, scientists and engineers together like Oppenheimer did with the Manhattan project, I do work on one problem at a time. I devised a simple way to feed rocket cooking stoves less often. I devised a way to heat up passive solar water without pumps and antifreeze (but not in the dead of winter). I built water cisterns out of plywood, two by fours and tarps. I am working on direct transfer of pedal (human) power to previously electrically powered tools. I will probably soon work on grinding eye-glass lenses out of recycled glass with pre-industrial tech (I've been just looking at the theory so far for this--Baruch Spinoza is an inspiration to use good face masks). My friend is making the frames out of wood. Whatever I do feels like it's not enough and it won't do much good in isolation. It would be so much more efficient to find the people who already know how to do these things, figure out how to reskill them so they network with each other rather than the industrial ecosystem, and get them to train us in the particular crafts. Anyway, would it be better to submit the Kelvin Generator article (if I can retrieve it from PCActivist, I seem to have lost it), or the Luddite Manhattan Project proposal? I also have had ideas about GMO algae producing ethanol, but given that I actually know how to genetically transform an organism (and have done so with nematodes), it looks like too risky a project, not just in the ecological way.<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c7898956348504535792 title="comment permalink">1/13/13, 10:29 AM</a><br><br>

I've already pointed out that the issue I'm trying to raise focuses on whole system issues, and here you are trying to refocus the debate on some individual detail, where you can easily insist "Oh, sure, we can do X to solve that." It's like the situation of the guy who has $1000 a month in income and $1500 a month in expenses; you can always argue that he has enough money for any individual expense -- $750 for rent is less than that $1000 income, so is $150 for food, $200 for utilities, etc., etc., but at the end of the day the guy is still going broke"<br><br>I don't think I've ever been taught much in the way of debating tricks but I have been taught various forms of analysis. And I've spent a lot of time developing expertise in applying these techniques.<br><br>You need to be careful in applying reductionist techniques when teasing out the important threads in a system. JMG uses a nice illustration of the dangers of not considering a factor as it applies to a system in entirety. Bu there's a simple method to ensure you don't fall vicrim to this error. Add up the values for the factor of interest across the system as well as for the component. In the example JMG uses you would look at the input (cash) and sum up cash required for all of the outputs (rent etc) to ensure there wasn't a shortfall.<br><br>The Peak Oil community generally holds as a priori assumption that complicated manufacturing techniques won't survive reduced supplies of fossil fuels. But an a priori assumption - at least in this problem domain - is only really justified when the assumption clearly flows from observable fact. Just because some complicated manufacturing processes currently use fossil fuels doesn't mean that fossil fuels are necessary for these manufacturing processes. It just means that we've tended to use these fossil fuels as they've been cheap and handy.<br><br>A much stonger position would flow from a deeper analysis of the, for example, PV manufacturing process showing how some aspect of the process depends critically on the availability of cheap fossil fuels and that this would be infeasible without their presence. I haven't seen such an analysis. Without this analysis, the whole basis for stating decline is inevitable is, IMO, shaky. It's not difficult to put together a case where the energy requirements of a PV manufacturing plant and its supply and distribution chains and can be satisfied by a mix of renewables or, perhaps, use fossil fuels as one of the remaining fossil fuel consumers in a society ruuning at, say, over 80% renewable energy supply.<br><br>How to allocate available energy in a society with much tighter energy availablity would play an important role. There is effective energy allocation in our current society through cost, various government actions such as taxes and subsidies etc Allocation in a tighter energy system might have to be along more in line with the situation that exists in wartime, blockades, sanctions etc Would societies be prepared to accept allocation of the limited liquid biofuels available to run tractors, mines, distribution networks etc rather than personal use?

Their entire small-town economy ran on gift and barter as much as (or more than) finance.<br><br>A big factor driving our collective decision-making is our system of economic accounting, which determines the return on investment for any decision.

Turns out that ragweed, the old nemesis of allergy sufferers, does a splendid job of collecting lead. She told me the reason for this specificity in plant-physiology terms, but the details are not particularly important. Starting with a brown field, you grow the plants, harvest them when they complete their life cycle in the fall, then dry them and ever-so-carefully combust them, retaining the ashes for safe disposal. My sister-in-law had to give up on environmental science, because there is no way to make a living at it. <br><br>Other bioremediation systems will need to be developed going forward, as the people of Japan are gradually disabused of the longstanding cultural notion that there is such a place as 'away', and that it centers on the Pacific Ocean. Obviously that effort will not begin for a few years yet. This side of the pond it may take even longer. Hopefully the proportion of I-129 in the environment will remain low enough that isotopic separation from I-127 will not be required. (but note that the nuclear industry did not blink at isotopic separation of U-238 from U-235 -- it was done regardless of cost) I have a sort of fantasy of karmic justice in which the movers and shakers of nuclear power, and their descendants for a couple generations, are chained to the bioremediation harvesting machines and the iodine calutrons, toiling away to save the thyroids of generations to come. <br><br>If I ran the circus, the near future would be powered primarily by good old Silicon PV, and power stored in Nickel Iron batteries. My reasoning is this: 1) these are common elements. If they are simply abandoned to entropy and the weather, they will leave neither toxic nor radioactive hazards behind; 2) they scale down nicely to the local and individual level; 3) they involve fewer conversion steps than other technologies; 4) they are lower-tech than you might think. Although microprocessors and solar cells both use the same properties of silicon, PV-grade silicon only requires five-nines purity, while microprocessors require nine-nines. Four orders of magnitude. There are conventional chemical processes which may achieve five-nines purity without going to the lengths employed by semiconductor makers. PV cells are bulk-doped, not requiring precision masking, ultrahigh vacuum, nor ultrapure chemicals. And finally, PV can be counted on to achieve 10% to 15% efficiency in converting sunlight. Photosynthesis only manages about 1%. <br><br>For the really long term, as an aid to those raccoon metallurgists who will need it, perhaps we could deeply engrave a stainless steel plaque with a phase diagram for iron-nickel-carbon ... this, along with an explanation of the properties of the different phases, would have been a great help to iron age metallurgists over the last couple millennia. <br><br>Finally, one item from chemistry that would be useful to remember is that the cellulose molecule can be dismantled. Before the era of petrochemistry, the semi-natural polymers cellophane and rayon were made using this technology. But before the late 1900s, the only usable cellulose fibers were the all-natural ones like cotton and linen. I would think polymers derived from wood pulp or bagasse to be a useful low-energy technology. <br><br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c8428976315865119633 title="comment permalink">1/13/13, 2:11 PM</a><br><br>

The second is anything but vaporware -- did you notice that I mentioned there's already been quite a bit of experimentation done? As for the relevance of cleanup, the generations that will come after ours have already been guaranteed a messy, toxic environment, and I don't think it's a bad idea to help get them some tools to help clean it up. As for the third option, I agree that it may just be the most important -- and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to take the lead in making it happen. Somebody in the scientific community needs to do so! <br><br><br>JMG,<br><br>Thank you for your response! I need to be a bit careful about what I said earlier about my views on the technologies you proposed. I did not intend to say that they were vaporwares or in development. My problem with these “clean up the mess” technologies is that they are misapplied. It is good to have them, but practically, I think they will be misused. Sort of an adaptation of Jevon's Paradox: having technologies to clean up after messes allows us to make bigger messes. There have been psychology studies on people that determine that the safer people feel, the more likely they are to take risks. It's called “risk compensation.” For example, drivers may drive more recklessly, less carefully, when wearing a seatbelt (although this is a horrid example, seatbelts are more likely to protect you in any case). Maybe a better example is of wearing helmets while playing sports, or gloves when boxing. Boxers have such concussion and mental problems because the gloves cushion the hands, allowing the other boxer to throw harder and more reckless punches.<br><br>I think this applies to technologies that clean up nuclear waste, or poisoned soils. The head of Monsanto, or one of our country's nuclear plants, would use the fact technology is available to clean nuclear waste or sanitize soil, to ramp up production and create more waste, or poison more soils – as a result, our amount of nuclear waste or unhealthy soil actually goes up!<br><br>These technologies are wonderful to have, no argument there. But they need to develop concomitantly with a new way of thinking, a method of thinking that understands restraint, cutting back, and can foresee and transcend Jevon's Paradox.<br><br>As for science communication, I have a long history (well, only 3 years) of teaching college level discussion sections, tutoring, and science outreach to elementary schools. I am currently assisting in teaching a course on climate change at the University of Washington, and find teaching growing more and more interesting by the day than my research! We will have to see how my career aspirations change as I shift more towards the communication realm. It would be hard to change the prevailing mindset of the general public. It remains to be seen if I were to become a “leader” in science communication – a truly humbling thought.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Max<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c4742191960891325458 title="comment permalink">1/13/13, 9:42 PM</a><br><br>

I happen to have to have a copy of an experimental physics lab manual, circa 1938, which has a chapter on just that, reprinted by Lindsay Publications I'll come back with the title as soon as I can get to my stack, especially if anyone expresses interest.<br><br>A few months ago, I chimed in here with an idea to not only detect radiation, but to detect and measure the radionucleide species such as iodine 131, cesium 137, struntium, plutonium, etc. Presently, there are $10,000 instruments such as gamma-ray spectrometers that are used to do this job, and I think it is possible to to gin up a DIY version now from commercially available hardware for around $2000. But this technology is not something that can be produced at a workshop level in a de-industrial future. So I think a more realistic method would have to be based on a diffusion cloud chamber as a detector. This was a key investigational tool in the pioneering days of sub-atomic physics and cosmic rays. Many if not most of us have encountered them on some point in our lives in a classsrom, or a science museum such the one in Los Angeles at the Griffith Park Planetarium and Observatory (I last saw it 25 years ago where it demonstrated evidence of cosmic rays. I don't know it that exhibit still remains).<br><br>To use a cloud chamber to assay radionucleides, you need procedures to collect and prepare your sample from air/water/soil/what-have-you, and you need to quantify how your sample reflects your environment. Then you need to place the prepared sample into the cloud chamber, and make timed measurements or observations of the tracks seen. You probably also will need to augment the apparatus with electric or magnetic fields, calibrated barriers and so one to get a sense of the particle charges and energies. Then the data needs to be organized to allow the investigator to compare his/her data with reference values to allow attribution of specific radionucleides to the data, and also determine the absolute quantity of each radionucleide in the sample. Finally, the investigator must calculate the the concentration in the environment of each radionucleide.<br><br>In addition to the intrinsic value of the activity, I think it would also make a good vehicle for the preservation of scientific reasoning.<br><br>By far the biggest technical difficulty is the requirement to cool the cloud chaber to cryogenic temperatures. Historically this has been done with dry ice, but I think tanks of pressurized carbon-dioxide will be a tall order in the de-industrail future. I think the most promising technology will be Peltier (thermocouple) coolers powered by a pedal-driven automotive alternator; those coolers can run at 12 volts.<br><br>I have already begun preparing a white paper with more detail for JMG's contest, I'm hoping I can it to a standard appropriate for publication.<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c3548313999947966039 title="comment permalink">1/13/13, 11:06 PM</a><br><br>

There are Maker Faires where people demonstrate what they've made, and maker magazines.

'He' seemed to be saying that something he called ‘The Peak Oil Community’, despite its few ‘insights’, had not made a case that met his criteria of scholastic rigor. I do not want to waste more of your time; so my apology if this is superfluous.<br>A broad case, of which PO is a distinctive and pointed feature, has been around for a long time. There are not enough resources, even if they could be dug up at a rate several time faster than they are now, for even a small minority of the world population to become ‘Americans’. This insight continues to have implications. The ‘globalised’ world tends to be a very competitive place, including within American society. Given some indisputable if inevitably ill-defined ‘limits’ to maintaining year-by-year growth of industrial inputs and outputs, (we have the math of the ‘rule of 70’ for doubling time) many of us began many years ago to question the ‘scholastic community’, and to pay close attention to the more rigorously argued data as it has emerged. Can anybody disprove the general point?<br>A second and in my view clinching feature has become apparent in the last three decades. Industrial civilisation in any case needs, arguably within 50 years to re-invent the base for industry and reduce the totality of the key fossil fuel inputs to perhaps 5-10% of present daily usage. The 25% of total atmospheric heat-trapping that is due to non-condensing trace gases, principally CO2, is what keeps, the climate sufficiently stable for a biosphere. We can look back to the normal glacial oscillations of these last million years as an example. Unfortunately, recent global use of fossil fuel, and to a lesser extent changes in land use, have already driven the CO2 ‘key to the thermostat’ higher than it has been in 5 million years. This has indisputably severe if still incompletely defined implications. Given the amounts of fuel still in the ground, our economic drivers still have their foot pressed to the pedal. I think it is legitimate to ask ‘scholars’ to use their brains and to argue their way out of that one in a useful and coherent manner! And to tell us what part they play personally against this backdrop.<br>I have met sincere ‘environmental’ campaigners who have maintained that ‘the world’ will be using even more energy 50 years from now than ‘we’ do now; 95% of it from ‘renewable’ resources. I see no sign whatever that this aspiration has any base in reality. I still hope that ‘Renewables’ could help our mass societies to a softer-landing and perhaps help minimise the irreversible environmental damage, but I think it is right for you, if I have understood you correctly, to suggest we give more thought to our personal ‘soft-landings’ and legacies. What ‘scholastic legacy’ will survive the next decades and century or so seems a moot point.<br>best<br>Phil<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c4538480793610225460 title="comment permalink">1/15/13, 9:29 AM</a><br><br>

That is not what I have in mind. Artist colonies are mostly about making art (mostly luxury items) to sell to wealthy customers. Both artist colonies and makers are both totally dependent on industrial technology to survive. What I have in mind is to figure out (because no one knows how to do it) how to cut that dependence and replace it with dependence on a village of people, who would be producing each others' basic needs from local materials, tools, products and their own labor. The resources to support such a project exist, and would be a lot less than what was needed for the Manhattan project, with a much better payoff. But as JMG points out, the will to do it is almost non-existant.<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c7513591899053908032 title="comment permalink">1/19/13, 2:16 PM</a><br><br>

That being said, I believe the most urgent nuclear waste issue is getting the power plant waste now in cooling pools placed in dry cask storage, so it's not dependent on an active pumping system keep it from overheating and catching on fire. Longer term, the glass vitrification of high-level nuclear waste always seemed like a good, if expensive and slow, way to render it inert. The choice of geologic formation to put it in appears to be a bit of a trade-off. From what I know (again not speaking as an engineer), ancient salt formations appear to be a good choice, due to their self-sealing nature, but there's the danger of those formations being mined or dissolved by an errant well.<br><br>Your readers will be happy to discover that there's strong and ongoing research on bio-remediation in the environmental cleanup professions. Most of the focus is on using bacteria to break down toxic artificial organic chemistry compounds, since (unlike metals for example) these can be broken down in the first place, and since bacteria are ubiquitous, evolve very fast, and live in the deep subsurface where fungus rhizomes and plant roots don't reach. Believe it or not, there's a real recognition that cleanup technologies that use a lot of electricity and/or industrial equipment themselves cause pollution and are not sustainable, and so such technologies should be used only where most applicable.<br><br>As several readers have recognized, using plants to accumulate toxic metals merely transfers the toxic metal from one place (the soil) to another (the plant body). Most likely such stuff will end up in an area landfill. Know where your area landfills are and what type they are: 1. construction debris (theoretically innocuous stuff like concrete rubble that *shouldn't* affect groundwater); 2. Subtitle-D - municipal garbage - modern ones are lined and monitored to prevent rain water from getting in or contaminated groundwater leachate from getting out, but someone needs to be paid to do the monitoring, plus there's a lot of nasty stuff in municipal garbage anyway; 3. Subtitle-C - hazardous waste landfills - again lined and monitored to prevent rain water from getting in and contaminated groundwater leachate from getting out, but with basically all nasty stuff in it. <br><br>At some point, people may be mining the landfills for prizes like the busted 1990s vacuum cleaner with a quarter-pound of copper in the motor windings. Let's hope they do it in a safe fashion. As the Archdruid has pointed out, for this hope to be realized, the transmission of knowledge is required.<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c8567046412664139380 title="comment permalink">1/21/13, 1:11 PM</a><br><br>

Here's one that already has been invented. One reader suggested low tech birth control. She suggested a diaphragm like contraption for women. 25 years ago a women's condom was invented, with a closed end with a ring like a diaphragm that rests near the cervix and another ring on the other end that covers part of the external genitalia and a nitrile sleeve connecting the two rings. It has the advantage of also preventing the transmission of most sexually transmitted diseases. Disadvantages include noise in use, some possible discomfort and aesthetics. It's catching on in the third world despite its cost, the earlier version was designed to be washed and reused. Lately they're working on a latex version, possibly with rubber available and a mold, a primitive version can be produced in post-peak workshops. Worth sailing in a square rigger to Brazil for rubber for a reusable female condom or for that matter reusable rubber male condoms to prevent the antibiotic resistant gonorrhea, syphlis and of course AIDS.<br><br><a href=a-wish-list-for-krampus.html#c3265725925966541167 title="comment permalink">9/7/13, 3:05 PM</a><br><br>
