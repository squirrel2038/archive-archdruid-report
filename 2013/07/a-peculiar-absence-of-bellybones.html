<div class=MsoNormal>
The fixation on imaginary “perfect storms” critiqued in last week’s post is only one expression of a habit of thinking that pervades contemporary American culture and, to a lesser extent, most other industrial societies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve referred to this habit in a couple of posts in this series already, but it deserves closer attention, if only to help make sense of the way that individuals, institutions, and whole societies so often get blindsided these days by utterly predictable events. </div>
<br>
Like several of the other themes already explored in this sequence, the habit of thinking I have in mind was explored by Oswald Spengler in <i>The Decline of the West</i>. His way of discussing it, though, relies on turns of phrase that don’t translate well into English, and philosophical concepts that were familiar to every reader in 1918 Germany and completely opaque to most readers in 2013 America. To make sense of it, I’ll need to reframe the discussion by way of an excursion into deep time, so we can talk about the difference between what <i>can</i> happen and what
<i>does</i> happen. <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Unlike the Marcellus shale, the Barnett shale, and some of its other distant geological cousins, the Burgess shale doesn’t contain any appreciable amounts of oil or natural gas. What it does contain is a vast number of delicate fossils from the Cambrian period. It’s been argued that your ancestors and mine are there in the Burgess shale, in the form of a tiny, wriggling whatsit called <i>Pikaia</i> with a little strip of cartilage running down its back, the first very rough draft of what eventually turned into your backbone. There are plenty of other critters there that are unlike anything else since that time, and it’s perfectly plausible to imagine that they, rather than <i>Pikaia</i>, might have left descendants who evolved into the readers of this blog, but that’s not what happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Intelligent beings descended from five-eyed, single-tentacled <i>Opabinia</i> were possible; they could have happened, but they didn’t, and once that was settled, a whole world of possibilities went away forever. There was no rational reason for that exclusion; it just happened that way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s take a closer look at <i>Pikaia</i>, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Study it closely, and you can just about see the fish that its distant descendants will become. The strip of cartilage runs along the upper edge of its body, where fish and all other vertebrates have their backbones. It didn’t have to be there; if
<i>Pikaia</i> happened to have cartilage along its lower edge, then fish and all the other vertebrates to come would have done just as well with a bellybone in place of a backbone, and you and I would have the knobbly bumps of vertebrae running up our abdomens and chests. Once <i>Pikaia</i> came out ahead in the struggle for survival, that possibility went wherever might-have-beens spend their time. There’s no logical reason why we don’t have bellybones; it simply turned out that way, and the consequences of that event still constrain us today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fast forward 200 million years or so, and a few of
<i>Pikaia</i>’s putative descendants were learning to deal with the challenges and possibilities of muddy Devonian swamps by wriggling up out of the water, and gulping air into their swim bladders to give them a bit of extra oxygen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It so happens that these fish had four large fins toward the underside of their bodies. Many other fish at the time had other fin patterns instead, and if the successful proto-lungfish had happened to come from a lineage with six fins underneath, then amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals would have six limbs today instead of four.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A six-limbed body plan is perfectly viable—ask any insect—but the vertebrates that ventured onto land had four, and once that happened, the question was settled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Nothing makes six-legged mammals impossible, but there aren’t any and never will be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In an abstract sense, they can happen, but in the real world, they don’t, and it’s only history that explains why. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Today, another 400 million years later, most of the possible variables shaping life in this planet’s biosphere are very tightly constrained by an intricate network of ecological pressures rooted in the long history of the planet. Those constraints, among other things, drive convergent evolution—the process by which living things from completely different evolutionary lineages end up looking and behaving like each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>100 million years ago, when the Earth had its normal hothouse climate and reptiles were the dominant vertebrates, the icthyosaurs, a large and successful family of seagoing reptiles, evolved what we now think of as the basic dolphin look; when they went extinct and a cooling planet gave mammals the edge, seagoing mammals competing for the same ecological niche gave us today’s dolphins and porpoises. Their ancestors, by the way, looked like furry crocodiles, and for good reason; if you’re going to fill a crocodile’s niche, as the protocetaceans did, the pressures that the rest of the biosphere brings to bear on that niche pretty much require you to look and act like a crocodile. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The lesson to be drawn from these examples, and countless others, is that evolution isn’t free to do everything that, in some abstract sense, it could possibly do. Between the limits imposed by the genetics of the organism struggling to adapt, and the even stronger limits imposed by the pressures of the environment within which that struggle is taking place, there are only so many options available, and on a planet that’s had living things evolving on it for two billion years or so, most of those options will have already been tried out at least once. Even when something new emerges, as happens from time to time, that doesn’t mean that all bets are off; it simply means that familiar genetic and environmental constraints are going to apply in slightly different ways. That means that there are plenty of things that theoretically could happen that never will happen, because the constraints pressing on living things don’t have room for them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That much is uncontroversial, at least among students of evolutionary ecology. Apply the same point of view to human history, though, and you can count on a firestorm of protest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Nonetheless, that’s exactly what I’ve been trying to do in this blog over the last seven years—to point out that historical change is subject to limits imposed by the historical trajectories of societies struggling to adapt, and the even stronger limits imposed by the pressures of the environment within which that struggle is taking place; worse still, to point out that societies have an equivalent of convergent evolution, which can be studied by putting different societies side by side and comparing their historical trajectories, and that this reveals otherwise untraceable constraints and thus allows meaningful predictions to be made about the future of our own civilization. Each of those proposals offends several of the most basic assumptions with which most people nowadays approach the future; put them all together—well, let’s just say that it’s no surprise that each weekly post here can count on fielding its quota of spit-slinging denunciations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As regular readers of this blog know, a great many of these quarrels arrange themselves around the distinction I’ve just drawn. Whether we’re talking about 2012 or near-term human extinction or the latest claim that some piece of other of energy-related vaporware will solve the world’s increasingly intractable energy and resource shortages, my critics say, “It could happen!” and I reply, “But it won’t.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>They proceed to come up with elaborate scenarios and arguments showing that, in fact, whatever it is could possibly happen, and get the imperturbable answer, “Yes, I know all that, but it still won’t happen.” Then it doesn’t happen, and the normal human irritation at being wrong gets thrown in the blender with a powerful sense of the unfairness of things—after all, that arrogant so-and-so of an archdruid didn’t offer a single solitary reason why whatever it was couldn’t possibly happen!—to make a cocktail that’s uncommonly hard to swallow. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There’s a reason, though, why these days the purveyors of repeatedly disproved predictions, from economists through fusion-power proponents to believers in the current end of the world du jour, so constantly use arguments about what can happen and so consistently ignore what does happen. It’s a historical reason, and it brings us a big step closer to the heart of this sequence of posts. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When Nietzsche proclaimed the death of God to a mostly uninterested 19th century, as I mentioned in <a href=../../2013/06/the-scheduled-death-of-god.html>an earlier post in this sequence</a>, he was convinced that he was doing something utterly unprecedented—and he was wrong. If he’d been a little more careful about checking his claims against what he’d learned as a classical philologist, he would have remembered that the gods also died in ancient Greece in the fourth century BCE, and that the rationalist revolt against established religion in the Greek world followed the same general course as its equivalent in western Europe and the European diaspora two millennia or so later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Put the materialist philosophers of the Greek Enlightenment side by side with the corresponding figures in its European equivalent, or line up the skeptical barbs aimed at Homer’s portrayal of the gods and goddesses of Greece with those shot at the Bible’s portrayal of the god of Christianity—by Nietzsche among others!—and the similarities are hard to miss. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s more, the same thing has happened elsewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>India went through its rationalist period beginning in the sixth century BCE, giving rise to full-blown atomist and materialist philosophies as well as an important school of logic, the Nyaya; it’s indicative of the tone of that period that the two great religious movements founded then, Buddhism and Jainism, in their earliest documented forms were wholly uninterested in gods. The equivalent period in ancient China began about a century later, with its own achievements in logic and natural science and its own dismissal of formal religion—sacrifices and rites are important for social reasons, Confucius argues, but to busy oneself excessively with them shows that one is ignorant and unreasonable. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a standard element of the trajectory of literate civilizations through time. Every human society comes out of the shadows of its origins well equipped with a set of beliefs about what does happen. Since most human societies in their early phases are either wholly innocent of writing, or have lost most of a former tradition of literacy in the collapse of some previous civilization, those beliefs are normally passed down by way of the oldest and most thoroughly proven system of information storage and transfer our species has invented—that is to say, mythology:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>a collection of vivid, colorful stories, usually in verse, that can be learned starting in early childhood and remembered letter-perfect into advanced old age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since the information storage capacity of myths is large but not limitless, each myth in a mature mythology is meant to be understood and interpreted on several levels, and learning how to unpack the stories is an essential part of education as an adult in these societies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
For human societies that rely on hunter-gatherer, nomadic pastoral, or village horticultural economies, mythology is amply suited to their information storage and transfer needs, and it’s rare for these to go looking for other options. Those societies that take to field agriculture and build urban centers, though, need detailed records, and that usually means writing or some close equivalent, such as the knotted cords of the old Incas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Widespread public literacy seems to be the trigger that sets off the collapse of mythic thinking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Where literacy remains the specialty of a priesthood jealous of its privileges, among the ancient Maya or in Egypt before the New Kingdom, writing is simply a tool for recordkeeping and ceremonial proclamations, but once it gets into general circulation, rationalism of one kind or another follows in short order; an age of faith gives way to an age of reason. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That transformation has many dimensions, but one of the more important is a refocusing from what does happen to what can happen. At the time, that refocusing is a very good thing. Literacy in an age of faith tends to drive what might be called the rationalization of religion; myths get written down, scribes quarrel over which versions are authentic and what interpretations are valid, until what had been a fluid and flexible oral tradition stiffens into scripture, while folk religion—for the time being, we can define that messy category “religion” in purely functional terms as the collection of customary rites and beliefs that go with a particular set of mythic narratives—goes through a similar hardening into an organized religion with its own creed and commandments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>That process of rigidification robs oral tradition of the flexibility and openness to reinterpretation that gives it much of its strength, and helps feed the building pressures that will eventually tear the traditional religion to shreds. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s the rise of rational philosophy that allows people in a literate civilization to get out from under the weight of a mummified version of what does happen and start exploring alternative ideas about what can happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s liberating, and it’s also a source of major practical advantages, as life in a maturing urban civilization rarely fits a set of mythic narratives assembled in an older and, usually, much simpler time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It becomes possible to ask new questions and speculate about the answers, and to explore a giddy range of previously unexamined options. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That much of the story is hardwired into the historical vision of contemporary Western culture. It’s the next part of the story, though, that leads to our present predicament. The wild freedom of the early days of the rationalist rebellion never lasts for long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some of the new ideas that unfold from that rebellion turn out to be more popular and more enduring than others, and become the foundations on which later rationalists build their own ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With the collapse of traditional religions, in turn, people commonly turn to <a href=../../2013/04/the-fate-of-civil-religion.html>civil religions</a> as a source of values and meaning, and popular civil religions that embrace some form of rationalist thought, as most do, end up imbuing it with their own aura of secondhand holiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The end result of the rationalist rebellion is thus a society as heavily committed to the supposed truth of some set of secular dogmas as the religion it replaced was to its theological dogmas. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You know that this point has arrived when the rebellion starts running in reverse, and people who want to think ideas outside the box start phrasing them, not in terms of rational philosophy, but in terms of some new or revived religion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The rebellion of rationalism thus eventually gives rise to a rebellion against rationalism, and this latter rebellion packs a great deal more punch than its predecessor, because the rationalist pursuit of what can happen has a potent downside: it can’t make accurate predictions of the phenomena that matter most to human beings, because it fixates on what can happen rather than paying attention to what does happen. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s only in the fantasies of extreme rationalists, after all, that the human capacity for reason has no hard limits. The human brain did not evolve for the purpose of understanding the universe and everything in it; it evolved to handle the considerably less demanding tasks of finding food, finding mates, managing relations with fellow hominids, and driving off the occasional leopard. We’ve done some remarkable things with a brain adapted for those very simple purposes, to be sure, but the limits imposed by our ancestry are still very much in place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those limits show most clearly when we attempt to understand processes at work in the world. There are some processes in the world that are simple enough, and sufficiently insulated from confounding variables, that a mathematical model that can be understood by the human mind is a close enough fit to allow the outcome of the process to be predicted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s what physics is about, and chemistry, and the other “hard” sciences: the construction of models that copy, more or less, the behavior of parts of the world that are simple enough for us to understand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fact that some processes in the world lend themselves to that kind of modeling is what gives rationalism its appeal. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The difficulty creeps in, though, when those same approaches are used to try to predict the behavior of phenomena that are too complex to conform to any such model. You can make such predictions with fairly good results if you pay attention to history, because history is the product of the full range of causes at work in comparable situations, and if A leads to B over and over again in a sufficiently broad range of contexts, it’s usually safe to assume that if A shows up again, B won’t be far behind. Ignore history, though, and you throw away your one useful source of relevant data; ignore history, come up with a mental model that says that A will be followed by Z, and insist that since this can happen it will happen, and you’re doomed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Human behavior, individual as well as collective, is sufficiently complex that it falls into the category of things that rational models divorced from historical testing regularly fail to predict.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So do many other things that are part of everyday life, but it’s usually the failure of rational philosophies to provide a useful understanding of human behavior that drives the revolt against rationalism. Over and over again, rational philosophies have proclaimed the arrival of a better world defined by some abstract model of how human beings ought to behave, some notion or other of what can happen, and the actions people have taken to achieve that better world have resulted in misery and disaster; the appeal of rationalism is potent enough that it normally takes a few centuries of repeated failures for the point to be made, but once it sinks in, the age of reason is effectively over. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That doesn’t mean that the intellectual tools of rationalism go away—quite the contrary; the rise of what Spengler called the Second Religiosity involves sweeping transformations of religion and rational philosophy alike. More precisely, it demands the abandonment of extreme claims on both sides, and the recognition of what it is that each does better than the other. What comes after the age of reason isn’t a new age of faith—not right away, at least; that’s further down the road—but an age in which the claims of both contenders are illuminated by the lessons of history: an age of memory. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s why, a few centuries after the rationalists of Greece, India, and China had denounced or dismissed the gods, their heirs quietly accepted a truce with the new religious movements of their time, and a few centuries further on, the heirs of those heirs wove the values taught by the accepted religion into their own philosophical systems. That’s also why, over that same time, the major religions of those cultures quietly discarded claimsthat couldn’t stand up to reasonable criticism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Where the Greeks of the Archaic period believed in the literal truth of the Greek myths, and their descendants of the time of Socrates and Plato were caught up in savage debates over whether the old myths had any value at all, the Greeks of a later age accepted Symmachus’ neat summary—“Myths are things that never happened, but always are”—and saw no conflict at all between pouring a libation to Zeus the Thunderer and taking in a lecture on physics in which thunderbolts were explained by wholly physical causes. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That state of mind is very far from the way that most people in the contemporary industrial world, whether or not they consider themselves to be religious, approach religious beliefs, narratives, and practices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The absurd lengths to which today’s Christian fundamentalists take their insistence on the historical reality of the Noah’s ark story, for example, in the face of conclusive geological evidence that nothing of the sort happened in the time frame the Biblical narrative provides for it, is equalled if not exceeded by the lengths to which their equal and opposite numbers in the atheist camp take their insistence that all religions everywhere can be reduced to these terms.</div>

</span>achievements of the last three centuries or so through the difficult years ahead. How that process might play out is a complex matter; we’ll begin discussing it next week. </span></div>

This looks like a great read.<br><br>JMG, some parts of this essay seem unclear. Notably, I don't think non-European civilizations ever demonstrated widespread literacy.

(Also compare Islamic civilization, where literacy has never equated to discarding the tradition.)<br><br>Your analogy of Plato to the European Enlightenment, and of Neoplatonists to modern seekers of synthesis, is nice and thought-provoking. The main thing Plato had that the Enlightenment didn't was an insistence that the universe itself makes sense, and that things are created for a reason; this allowed Neoplatonism to have some sort of harmony between traditional myths and rationally pleasing geometry, as opposed to today's postmodern mixture of traditions and fictions.<br><br><a href=#c6191854921490995952 title="comment permalink">7/4/13, 12:20 AM</a><br><br>

Things are really starting to come together in this series, especially your talk of negative feedbacks and now the limits of science, really do provide a useful mental framework for interpreting the peak oil blogosphere and much more. <br><br>I was starting to wonder why McPhersons presentations never did mention anything about negative climate feedbacks! I'm starting to feel that including such biased talks at "age of limits" conferences without seriously contesting them, borders on a non-serious and dogmatic treatment of the subject matter. <br><br>In relation to your "age of memory", I've seen this happen. The union of science and religion is certainly dawning. Many people working with permaculture take the mysterious behaviour of plants for granted, and actually negotiate with them and appreciate their efforts. Using "strange" assumptions they arrive at remarkable results. It can also be seen in Rupert Shelldrake's (and many others) pragmatic approach to the dogmatic materialist assumptions and of science. <br><br>As a trained physicist I've long been frustrated by the increased irrelevance of much contemporary scientific activity. This is in fact why I abandoned it. Costs and complexity rise, while results diminish, as you say also. Most of what one can get grants for today, is hopelessly irrelevant for any practical scalable application in real life. And the tiny results are many years off in the future.<br><br>The abandoning of dogmas on the other hand, opens up a space in which cheap, effective discoveries can be made, such as "the sense of being looked at" as an example. These require a shift of faith, however, and a move closer into religion. The assumption of universal consciousness, the notion that consciousness is inhereent in matter, that matter and consciousness are not seperable. This is the position of Charles Eisenstein, and he explains how that from this realisation or starting point, a whole new field of activity springs. Mainly regenerative, in my opinion. When we strip away some of his sensationalism in "Ascent of Humanity", the "Age of Reunion" is just this thing, a move closer to religion, your age of memory. A new practical way of doing science, that doesnt discount notions such as water being alive, mushrooms being the conscious brains of the forest, intentional evolution in biology, and so on.<br><br>And that kind of activity is so much more fun and relevant:) thanks again for your writings and sorry for the long first post, had to draw some parallels.<br><br><a href=#c567742315104558654 title="comment permalink">7/4/13, 1:29 AM</a><br><br>

The old men argued over memories – as we do – and young people brought almost unimaginable new tools to aid imagination and answer questions as to the hard limits of our physical world, and good naturedly explained the intellectual limitations of rational enquiry when it comes to history and the nature of our economies: right beside the Scottish Enlightenment.<br> <br>By a roundabout route this brings me back to your stimulating post and my own cogitations about both the latter-day Scottish Presbyterian Church and the Church of England, thoughts in part energised this last year by your ongoing discourse.

Isn't this the most obscure part of the cycle, least recorded and analyzed? If the current development is a typical part of that cycle, I do not quite see that failures of rationalism (as such) is a direct instrumental driver. Whatever problems we have since 2008 (or somewhat earlier), they are not direct consequences of failures of rational prediction and recomendations. Rational approaches are being politically marginalized for some time already. What would that rebellion be (on the global scale) without the increasingly paranoid and manipulative US political life?<br><br>I see two other factors possibly more instrumental in this rather psychotic and well financially oiled <i>rebellion</i>. The two factors easily enforce each other. One factor is the attitude of elites - at some time a connected part of them might decide that apparences of general welfare and social mobility are great, but the facilitating factors (like education) should be better controlled. The other factor is anticipation of hitting growth limits. Add these two factors together, and there is a big potential for simulated rationality, deceptive show of preferences, even smart anti-rational propaganda and smearing. It is just a way to resolve an overshot within a Darwinian interest. Collective rationality just did not evolve (yet?) to deal with this episode.<br><br><a href=#c6246440398987906883 title="comment permalink">7/4/13, 7:56 AM</a><br><br>

But in order to be successful, it really seems to me that this negative feedback system would have to essentially crash industrial civilization and facillitate a fairly large die-off of the human population (let's say massive killer storms set off by global warming, as just one possibility).

Your model certainly goes a long way to explain India's historical trajectory till about 1100 CE. I can see Nagarjuna, Shankara and Ramanujam as some of the prime actors of the rebellion against rationalism in India. <br><br>But after that things get significantly muddied and the obvious reason for that is the successful series of invasions by external powers and cultures. Once Islam became a powerful player in the sub-continent's politics it led to a great deal of cultural convulsions that might have ended with the establishment of a syncretic Hindu-Islamic civilization but that was not to be (despite what the secularists of this country like to claim). Because the evolving equation between Hindus and Muslims of the sub-continent was completely upset by the entry of a new player in the country's cultural scene - the religion of progress that came along with the British.<br><br>Today this country is a difficult to imagine hybrid with three main cultural forces vying for people's attention - Hinduism, Islam (their vestiges and offshoots) and Progress (the most powerful of the three). In a sense we are like the furry crocodile but also with a pair of proto-wings all of which which is trying to ape the giant whale aka America. How this quaint hybrid will evolve in a time when the animal it is trying to imitate starts shrinking is something that fascinates me but I don't know if I am equipped to give useful answers to this question.<br><br>I haven't read Spengler fully yet but I doubt he would have been able to imagine India of the 21st century or make useful predictions about where a society such as ours is headed. But do you have some general ideas of how extremely diverse and schizophrenic societies such as mine might evolve. I know that you may not be conversant with all the details of Indian society but my question is whether the theory of civilizations that you propose is able to address the trajectory of hybrid societies.<br><br>I guess I must clarify what I mean by a hybrid society. It is one where the dominant myths are so incompatible that they don't even attempt to ask the same underlying questions, leave alone provide different answers. For example, you could argue that both Christianity and Atheism in the west ask the same underlying question about the existence of God but provide completely different answers. However, Hinduism and Progress address (for the most part) completely different realms of human experience and thus do not even ask the same questions.<br><br><a href=#c1236384803071586863 title="comment permalink">7/4/13, 10:17 AM</a><br><br>

Since such an artefact is compact, it can be kept safe even in conditions of social upheaval. <br><br>We know from history what upheaval is like. In 1944, Estonians took to the harbours with compact baggage, carrying individual books - but not whole libraries - out to the safety of Sweden. It was this hand-luggage evacuation that made possible the rapid late-1940s reprinting, at exile Sweden-and-Canada publishing house "Orto", of epic <i>Kalevipoeg</i>, and key novelist Tammsaare, and the like, meeting among other things the needs of Estonian diaspora education. <br><br>A viable microform solution will be one robust enough to forego temperature- and humidity-controlled repositories. <br><br>A high-tech robust solution, involving writing onto metal plates with an ion beam, is described in <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD-Rosetta rel=nofollow>the Wikipedia "High-Density Rosetta" article</a>. <br><br>But how can we proceed if we restrict ourselves to lower-tech solutions affordable to the private experimenter? <br><br>I speculate that something could be done cheaply, at an (adequate) density of, say, 9 or 16 or 25 book pages per square centimetre, by proceeding as follows: (1) deposit a film of some metal, perhaps silver or copper, onto a glass slip, such as a microscope slide (perhaps using some such process as the traditional Victorian chemistry for silvering a telescope mirror); (2) cover this metal film with a photoresist, perhaps of the same kind as used for making printed circuits in an ambitious home electronics lab; (3) project minified book-page images onto the photoresist; (4) use the usual printed-circuit chemistry to (a) selectively etch the metal film and (b) wash away the photoresist; (5) add a removable glass cover to the image slip, to protect the image-etched metal film. <br><br>In the remote future, after some replay of the European 1940s terrors, some people may find it helpful not only to read such a slip with a microscope, but even to take the removable glass cover off and to make contact prints, or to keep the removable glass cover on and make enlarger-easel prints onto paper-backed emulsions, or even onto litho plates.<br><br><br>(signed)<br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>near Toronto, Canada<br>www punkt metascientia punkt com<br>Toomas punkt Karmo at gmail punkt com <br><br><br><a href=#c7354168176541635451 title="comment permalink">7/4/13, 10:23 AM</a><br><br>

(Or, rather, two-volume analysis intro: analysis is to calculus as astrophysics is to astrology, ahem.) <br><br>It is perhaps worth adding that a conservationist library in physics will have the French-and-Taylor M.I.T. Intro Physics series. <br><br>These M.I.T. works, like Apostol, help clarify methods of research. Our remote descendants will need to know less the results than the spirit of the methods (a point which JMG has indeed himself stressed). <br><br>French-and-Taylor make this vivid, sketching experiments. <br><br>For example, they discuss a low-budget experiment at Cambridge U, early in the 20th century, which showed how the dual-slit experiment generates an interference pattern on a photo emulsion even when the light source is so weak as to emit not a barrage of simultaneous quanta, but only sporadic, temporally separated, quanta. One would think that here we have mere particles, and yet we even here find wave behaviour once we put the emulsion into the darkroom developer tray. <br><br>How, for a budget of a few tens of USD, could one better study the subtlety of the wave-particle duality? <br><br>(signed) <br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>near Toronto, Canada<br>www punkt metascientia punkt com<br>Toomas punkt Karmo at gmail punkt com <br><br>PS: As a 1990s student, I ofen found the UofToronto discouraging. Nevertheless, two happy 'Varsity episodes do come to mind. <br><br>(a) In 3rd-year optics, we had a TA who, said our prof, was working on a variant of General Relativity. The prof remarked that if his TA's GR variant was correct, there could be no black holes! Suddenly, one had a sense of the vulnerability of orthodoxy. (That TA disappeared into Cambridge U a little later. I gathered from a hasty chance encounter with the prof, in a Physics-Tower elevator, that the unorthodox variant on GR was probably now kaputnik. But that former TA may do something else later on.) <br><br>(b) For 3rd-year not-very-rigorous partial differential equations, we had a young prof who really at one point thought aloud at the chalkboard - yes, we will try this and that, he said, and now let's see what happens if we (as it were) multiply by an integrating factor. I think he knew no more than we did what the outcome would be, and so he made math emerge for what it really is, namely a fine indoor sport. This was the same prof who, at another stage in the course, asked the class, "Now, we need to write a polynomial: WHAT KIND of polynomial? starts with the letter ell....", to which some irreverent student replied, "Labatt polynomial?" (Our prof was probably seeking the answer "Legendre" - not that I now remember what a Legendre polynomial is, ahem. Labatt is for its part a well known Canadian brewery.) <br><br>On math as a sport, it is additionally worth remarking that Green's theorem, from 2nd-year multivariate calculus, was the discovery of a pre-Victorian autodidact: cf <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Green rel=nofollow>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Green</a>. <br><br><br><a href=#c4340471320904817701 title="comment permalink">7/4/13, 10:28 AM</a><br><br>

The rigs were fine for CW on most of the main ham bands. (Irritatingly, 30 metres was absent, and yet is rather strongly wanted.) <br><br>An Etobicoke vacuum-tube authority tells me the tubes in at least one half of this combo are quite standard, i.e., are rather easily replaced even today. <br><br>The authority himself has an inventory of 10,000 tubes, and of course various tubes are still being commercially manufactured outside now-deskilled North America. French ham Claude Paillard (callsign F2FO) has even shown that the lone worker can make tubes, given skill, patience, and a workshop with a diffusion pump. <br><br>The scary part is that nobody bought the rigs! They stayed at A1 Electronics for months, until I finally snapped them up on 2013-06-25. I will have to work on them over the coming years, understanding the previous owner's mods (I suspect he was good), then eventually getting onto the air. I would therein be applying the 15+ words-per-minute CW skills I have been maintaining with my humble Realistic DX-300 receiver (okay for monitoring CW at W1AW, from Connecticut) and my MFJ-418 "Pocket Morse Code Tutor". <br><br>One problem with the Cheyenne transmitter is that although it is already equipped with a key jack, it puts a potential of 90 volts across the key terminals. That is unpleasantly high, with (I have been warned) possibility of sparking. I presume this would deliver a poor, unprofessional, Morse note on the air, with something like a click or rasp. A solution, as Heathkit themselves point out in the assembly manual, would be to have the key talk to the jack via a relay. <br><br>I think we have to be vigilant these days, ensuring that good rigs do not get scrapped. <br><br>(B) It might be worth asking: what is the best-ever vacuum-tube rig for Morse code; what is the ultimate quality benchmark? Possible answer: the approx-28-tube R-390A (cf <a href=http://www.r-390a.net/ rel=nofollow>www.r-390a.net/</a>. A few years ago, someone saw piles of R-390A sets exposed to the weather, in a USA government sale. <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>www punkt metascientia punkt com<br>Toomas punkt Karmo at gmail punkt com<br>ham callsign VA3KMZ<br><br><a href=#c777579904539994245 title="comment permalink">7/4/13, 10:30 AM</a><br><br>

The picture I have from talking to them is that the representatives of various religions who do interfaith tend to be well educated, appreciate science, have sorted out the claims of rationality and feeling, and don't have much trouble communicating with their counterparts. A Wiccan priest can have a serious conversation with a Muslim cleric, a Catholic with a Buddhist, an agnostic biologist with a rabbi, and find many points of agreement. Of course they are there in the first place seeking points of agreement, but finding commonality isn't a huge struggle for people who have a broad understanding of what they are talking about.<br><br><a href=#c3950719192464695775 title="comment permalink">7/4/13, 10:52 AM</a><br><br>

India? Neither one is Western, and both were (and are) extremely literate. Islam went through its rationalist phase a long time ago; its current tendencies toward fundamentalism are a reaction to the industrial West. <br><br>Nestor, you're welcome! ;-)<br><br>KL, funny. German's a difficult language to turn into readable English -- my understanding is that Spengler is a lot more readable in the original. <br><br>PhysicsDoc, of course. That's the basis for all meaningful study of the world of our experience. "This rock, and that rock, and the other rock, all fall to the ground when picked up and released," says Throg the caveman; "I therefore hypothesize that this other rock over here will do the same thing under the same conditions." If the experiment succeeds, he announces the discovery of Throg's First Law of Rocks, which is that they fall when their support goes away. Much like civilizations...<br><br>Garde, a great many fields of science seem to be approaching, or past, their point of diminishing returns. Much of what's left is in areas that are basically taboo -- for example, I'd like to see Sheldrake's experiments replicated under a range of varying conditions! Still, the interface between matter and consciousness is one of the last really big puzzles left, and it would be good to see the pressure to find new fields for research open that one up to more work. <br><br>Phil H., a definite case of serendipity! I'd like to think that some of the older and more mature denominations might be able to rise to the challenge, shed some of their less productive habits, and speak to the needs of a society in decline; still, we'll see. <br><br>Raven, yes, but it's also worth trying to get a glimpse of the pattern on their loom...<br><br>Chuck, I hear six meters was pretty good, though! <br><br>Ron, if that's the core value for you, good; the challenge now is to find a way to present that value to others, and encourage them to embrace it as well. I encourage you to reflect on that, and then take action.<br><br><a href=#c8082225867600233963 title="comment permalink">7/4/13, 11:58 AM</a><br><br>

It's not obscure at all. Look into the rise of Gnosticism and mystery traditions in the mature Greco-Roman world, for example. <br><br>Rita, a good point. The challenge is to find ways to reinterpret and revise old myths to fit new realities; oral traditions do that easily, but once a set of myths is in writing, it's a lot harder. Still, the thing's been done often enough in the past. <br><br>William, your mission, if you should choose to accept it, is to find out how guitar strings were made before there were factories making them -- the guitar's a fairly old instrument, you know -- and learn how to make them yourself. That's how these things will be recovered and preserved: individuals who are passionate about making it happen will do so. <br><br>Hal, good. Among many others, yes. <br><br>Andrew, there are a lot of scratchy chins in the social sciences that badly need a shave with Occam's razor. <br><br>Mister R., you need to do your own research, and not simply believe the claims of the apocalypse lobby. Dieoff of phytoplankton happens routinely whenever there's a CO2 spike in the atmosphere, and the oceans go acidic. What happens then? Photosynthetic bacteria and blue-green algae, which don't have calcium skeletons and so aren't vulnerable to oceanic acidification, replace them. Once the pH of the oceans returns to normal, in half a million years or so, relict populations of phytoplankton in refugia expand their ranges again. In the meantime, there's still ample photosynthesis going on in the oceans. All this is business as usual for an unstable planet! <br><br>Richard, thank you! <br><br>Harry, you and Plutarch would have gotten along very well. <br><br>Christophe, thank you. One of the challenges I face in writing these is that I've been mulling over most of these points for many years, and have to figure out how to communicate them to people who aren't familiar with the decidedly eccentric contents of my brain! <br><br>Villager, I don't think I've ever heard any discussion, in the mystical literature, of <i>pre</i>-incarnation...<br><br>Shrama, Spengler got there ahead of you. What you've got in India right now is what he called a pseudomorphosis -- a situation in which one high culture ends up, for historical reasons, borrowing political, technical, and economic forms from another, even though there are huge mismatches. The Western forms imported by the British, and reinforced since independence by the pressures of international economics and war, don't fit Indian culture at all; they'll stumble along anyway until the pressures that hold them in place fall away, and then they'll collapse and be replaced with some "revival" (that is, brand new invention loosely based on older traditions) of something more relevant to Indian culture. That's the usual trajectory of a pseudomorphosis.<br><br><a href=#c9002769632191971136 title="comment permalink">7/4/13, 12:15 PM</a><br><br>

Solid, sturdy gear like that deserves a good home. To the rest of my readers, if you're scratching your heads wondering what you can do to preserve some useful technology into the future, and aren't afraid of hands-on electronics, may I recommend getting a ham radio license, making contact with your local club, and learning how to use, repair, and build radio gear? There's a huge need, and a lot of good things you can do here and now -- whenever a natural disaster hits, it's usually the hams who are first to get communications open again. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, I've seen some stirrings of the same thing, thus my comments. <br><br>Doctor W., I hadn't heard that they'd found Udall's body. That's really sad to hear. <br><br>Trajork, there were apparently problems at the Oil Drum -- a lot of their most popular commenters left in the last year or so, there were rumors about censorship and so on; I have no idea what was behind it all, but if anyone else can suggest a good news aggregator site for peak oil and energy news, I'd be grateful. I appreciat what Resilience.org is trying to do, but these days they don't carry as much energy news as they did when they were Energy Bulletin, and a lot of what they do carry is of very little interest to me. <br><br>James, glad to hear it -- to my mind, that's one of my two best books, and thus inevitably one of my two least popular. <br><br>Richard, ouch! What a mess. Glad you've bounced back. <br><br>PhysicsDoc, exactly -- the only difference between me and Throg is that it takes a long time to get experimental results when it comes to falling civilizations. <br><br>Bookwench, it's only depressing if you're still stuck in the delusion that things ought to be different.

I'd be happy to write for such a periodical again if someone would tackle the job of editing and publishing it...<br><br>Sophie, Mumford's very much worth reading as well; I simply find Spengler's philosophical standpoint and ruthless disregard for the western world's collective egotism very comfortable.<br><br><a href=#c714248367946402970 title="comment permalink">7/4/13, 10:05 PM</a><br><br>

The globalisation and homogenisation of this culture should also have negative effects in this regard.<br><br>I still have some reservations about whether or not morphological thinking is powerful enough to tell us more of less when a civilisation has peaked and is facing imminent decline.

A catholic who expresses doubt in Mary being a virgin mother is likely to be given the same treatment as an economist who expresses doubt that private sector beats government intervention.<br><br>Once the basics accepted, every teaching can then be reduced to one of these basic beliefs. Take, for instance, a coal mine.The belief that money sets the value of goods and services, means a manager compares the cost of the mine's security measures to the cost of paying compensation to miners' widows. A sane person would, of course, say the comparison is meaningless; and that people's lives cannot be measured in money. We've been making decisions based upon economics all the time.

From these are derived theorems, which make up the belief system. But the story doesn't end there.

(Yes, we are). This place is different. (Yes, it is). And the grand-daddy of them all, it's different this time. (No doubt). <br><br>Things are always SO different in SO many ways in terms of place and historical circumstance. Anyone can see that can't they? <br><br>What you say applies on a civilizational level and over the broad sweep of history I think can also apply in tighter geographic and temporal frames of reference. I used to work in the real estate industry and saw, up close, more or less the same disasters repeating themselves in different places and at different times. <br><br>The laws of financial gravity may not have the precision of Newtonian mechanics and the trajectory of events may not have unfolded as predictably as planetary movements. But unfold they did. <br><br>The language was always similar. "It's a great time to buy, a house is your best investment, you can't lose in real estate, prices have nowhere to go but up." You guys in the USA would have heard all this pretty recently, no? <br><br>People were unshakeably convinced of these "truths". And you dared not utter dissent. No time for naysayers, no room for impure thoughts. Facts? Data? Common sense? Pah! Sober second thought was for sissies. <br><br>The problem, of course, was that these "truths" were un-true. And there were dogmas that weren't just specific to the real estate industry. People said that times have changed and now it's different. <br><br>Well, yeah, but it wasn't THAT different. There are constraints that channel events in human affairs just as they do in the natural world. Human nature is human nature, the laws of financial gravity still apply. There's no such thing as a free lunch and money doesn't grow on trees and never has. <br><br>I bring this up because what we have right here and right now in this city (and in other places in this country) is a real estate bubble. No, seriously.<br><br>We had a bad real estate crack-up 20 years ago that everyone seems to have forgotten. Now, you'd think that after the calamities of the recent past that people in this city would have learned. You'd think that financial authorities would've smelled the coffee and headed it off. But no. <br><br>And so what do you think people here are saying? You guessed it: it's different this time, lending practices are different, economic fundamentals are different. Yes, yes it's all different. What's the same are the glistening financial aneurisms on bank and household balance sheets. <br><br>Not that anybody listens (not house buyers, not mortgage lenders and especially not developers) but national financial authorities repeatedly sounded the alarm. Way too late, mind you. Again too late, they repeatedly tightened lending rules. Do you know why? To engineer a "soft-landing". <br><br>Have you ever seen a "soft landing"? No? Neither have I. It's like you say JMG, it COULD happen. We COULD have a soft landing, we COULD avoid a wave of foreclosures, we COULD avoid a banking crisis. But will we? We could also have avoided a housing bubble in the first place. And we didn't. <br><br>New lending rules be damned, doubters slapped aside, the bleatings of our central bank notwithstanding, house prices march remorselessly and relentlessly upward driven by smiling, striding "optimists". And, if history is any guide and it usually is, the march downward will be just as remorseless and relentless. And people will say they never saw it coming.<br><br>It's always "different" this time. And it always is different in some particulars or circumstances. But people haven't changed and it's the END that's the same.

The problem we face now is that there's no abundant, naturally occurring substance in this corner of the universe that has more potential energy per kilo than crude oil -- and making a transition to much more diffuse and intermittent renewable resources imposes hard costs very few people want to meet. <br><br>Bugmethx, you might be surprised; quite a few religions are very clear on the fact that they can't explain everything. It's unwise to generalize about religion on the basis of the most popular Western churches!<br><br>Riverhouse, good -- you're almost asking the right questions. The ecology of extinction is tolerably well understood these days; if you research the characteristics of species that are vulnerable to near-term extinctions, and then compare that list of characteristics to <i>Homo sapiens</i>, you'll find that the evidence of past extinctions has something very specific to say about the NTE hypothesis -- and it's not something that believers in NTE want to hear. <br><br>DaShui, nah, he was an alchemist all along -- and a very good one, too; according to his lab notes, which have been published, he got to the stage called the Peacock's Tail, when the matter in the flask starts turning iridescent colors. Most of the great figures of the scientific revolution were up to their eyeballs in what we'd now label occultism; Johannes Kepler, while he was working out the laws of planetary motion, paid the rent by casting horoscopes, and his astrological work is valued just as highly by astrologers as his astronomical work is by astronomers. <br><br>SMJ, funny! I'd say John of Patmos was a pretty good example in the Roman world, though his really very accurate prediction of the fall of the Roman Empire has been misunderstood for centuries now as a prediction of the end of the world, due to the symbolic language he had to use to dodge Roman censorship. <br><br>Rita, that's a huge question, and would require at least a post of its own, since "middle class" and "democracy" mean very different things in different countries!

I can easily imagine Ben Franklin using that phrase, with the double entendre very much in mind...<br><br>CJ, thanks for the tip. <br><br>Paula, standard practice in the social sciences when Tainter wrote, and today as well, is to require any theory to propose a causative mechanism -- N happens because X, Y, and Z make it happen. Spengler and Toynbee weren't writing from within that same set of expectations; Toynbee offers some intriguing but not really quantifiable suggestions about causative mechanisms, and Spengler dismisses the question entirely. What Tainter failed to grasp, I think, is that you can describe what happens, and predict what will happen, without knowing why it happens. People bred plants and animals for millennia before the discovery of genetics, and forged steel for centuries before anybody figured out why iron treated in just this way is much harder and stronger; in the same way, Spengler had a very clear understanding of what happens as civilizations go through their life cycle, and the fact that he doesn't propose a causative model doesn't make his insights less useful.<br><br><a href=#c6715223642493055276 title="comment permalink">7/5/13, 2:56 PM</a><br><br>

You get today's gold star. "Whig history" is a term that was much used when I was taking courses in the history of science in the early 1990s -- there were a bunch of young radicals at that time who were trying to talk about the historically contingent nature of science, and who were being yelled down by the majority, for whom science proceeded the way it did because it was true, and that's that. You can probably guess the side I favored. <br><br>Joseph, thank you. <br><br>Thomas, yes, I remember the Hodgkins' Law episodes; I don't recall what I thought of them when I first saw them -- I was four when the original series premiered, and six when it went off the air -- but the reruns were a fixture of my childhood, and I recall finding the faux-Romans et al. even more implausible than the series as a whole, which is saying something. <br><br>Roger, you're quite correct, of course -- you're going to have a spectacular real estate crash in the next few years. If you have a chance, pick up a copy of John Kenneth Galbraith's "The Great Crash 1929" and see how many of the slogans used to justify the 1929 stock market bubble get recycled in your housing bubble; it makes a great party game. While you're at it, get every cent you have out of real estate, now; if you own a house, sell it and stash the proceeds, then buy it back or upgrade to a nicer place once the market bottoms out two years or so after the plunge begins. You'll be glad you did. <br><br>That is to say, the laws of economics may not be as exact as those of physics, but speculative bubbles and busts are an exception to that rule -- once a bubble gets under way, it's going to end in a crash, and if you stay out of the market during the period of its lunacy and step back in when everyone else has bailed out, you will do very, very well.

Honestly, the concept of a rational person is just a simplification of reality. Should anyone meet one, please point them out to me. Blind Freddy could see that it is unsupported by real life and yet the economists still insist that it is the case! Still, it is unspoken that the models are flawed and the economic models continue to wield power for a while yet in the real world. I no longer use the share market as what chance has an individual got against high frequency traders…<br><br>Haha! Economics as a field of study tends to avoid history as to do so would be their undoing. Much better for them to propose that “this time it will be different” as the professionals retain their grants and/or positions. It reminds me of the two philosophers in the Hitchers guide to the galaxy that were advised to argue with each other endlessly about the meaning of life to enjoy a lucrative feed-trough!<br><br>Did you see that we now have a new (old) Prime Minister only a couple of months out from the September election? What an awesome strategy, bring him back for the election as he was one of the most popular leaders in recent decades, yet employ a different Prime Minister to do the hard yards during the rest of the time. Just guessing, but it smells of good cop / bad cop to me, could be wrong...<br><br>My gut feel - and I could be wrong - was that he burnt out after a couple of years in the job, but is being wheeled out for the election as he is reasonably fresh after a stint on the back bench. No judgement here from me as I couldn't do that job as the demands of it would do my head in.<br><br>The things that I like now are of the everyday sort of variety. Today, I scored several large chunks of a rhubarb crown that had been part of a local ladies grandfathers plant. I was truly touched by this gift and it has now been planted out in good soil and will be well tended. How good is stewed rhubarb? Yum.<br><br>Also, another batch of stewed quinces are happily bubbling away in the wood oven right now. Biscuits were cooked earlier and then Pizza later. Hmm, wood oven!<br><br>In another 6 days, I'll be 3 weeks out from the winter solstice and - please don't take this as gloating - I haven't had to use the generator this year to top up the batteries. All being well, it truly has been a 100% solar powered year. It has taken four years of tinkering, hard graft, alterations and mucking around to get to this stage too. All it says to me is that there is no time like the present to get cracking. What did they say "carpe diem!"? Anyway, all this stuff just takes such a long time that there really is no time like the present. How Cuba got through its special period is beyond me.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c38304445006750597 title="comment permalink">7/6/13, 3:50 AM</a><br><br>

We'd quickly get into mentally partitioning observations to hide the energy losses that compensate for energy gains elsewhere, so that we could adequately demonstrate "creation of energy." You see precisely this kind of behavior in some of the "alternate energy" fields, e.g. "zero-point" energy or the many classes of perpetual motion machines.<br><br>Economics posits that wealth can be created, which is patent nonsense. Wealth can only be moved around, just like energy. But since it is axiomatic for most economists that wealth can be created, they get into mentally partitioning observations to hide the wealth losses that compensate for wealth gains elsewhere.<br><br>That seems to be how we've justified this whole non-sustainable, global scale extractive resource mess we're in. Cutting a forest for paper, or topping a mountain for coal "creates wealth." All of the compensating wealth losses are partitioned off into economic "externalities" that are waved away with the trash.<br><br>It's also at least part of the reason economists never see the bubbles coming. You'd think that if you or I or Roger can see it coming, all those Nobel-prize-winning economists would see it, too -- they'd just see it a lot more clearly that we laypeople do. Yes, the crash dynamics are complex, and I don't expect them to predict the crash to the dollar and the minute. But its seems that every crash -- every single crash -- is a total, jaw-dropping, head-scratching surprise for economists.<br><br>Bah.<br><br><a href=#c4287631406280492592 title="comment permalink">7/6/13, 8:27 AM</a><br><br>

I am pleased to be reading this discussion about the “age of memory” rapprochement of rationalism and religion. For one thing, like Twilight, I see it happening around me--not in interfaith discussions, as Twilight mentions, but because I hang out with some biologists and ecologists who live in this mental space where science, ethics and theology converge. <br><br>In addition it mirrors how I tend to think about these things, but also provides a wonderful intellectual edifice and rationale, which I appreciate. I’m not sure I’m up to reading Spengler, but I like the explanation of his thought and the way that is combined with evolutionary biology to back up the thesis.<br><br>Recently I read a very interesting book, “The Moral Nature of the Universe,” by a cosmologist and a theologian that comes at this same topic from a very different perspective. It is very much a discussion of ethical philosophy of the sort posited by JMG some posts ago, but also makes an argument that bridges the claims of hard science and doctrinaire religion to posit that one is not complete without the other. <br><br>Too bad about The Oil Drum. I have always found it very useful and educational, articles, comments and news roundups included. Where will one learn about these things now? Resilience could pick up some of the slack. I have hopes for the site, myself, as it matures in its new format.<br><br>OK, now back outside to collect and plant some native seeds that require warm and cold stratification before they’ll come up next spring. :)<br><br><a href=#c4918248745163936705 title="comment permalink">7/6/13, 11:08 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you for explaining it in more detail. I think I've been engaged in a personal Second Religiosity for many years. My chemical training didn't succeed in wiping out my interest in the non-rational aspects of life. Your comment regarding the Ethical Culture movement reminded me that almost 30 years ago, when I first moved to St. Louis, I occasionally attended the services of the Ethical Society of St. Louis, the Ethical Culture movement's local organization. The society has a beautiful sanctuary and offered various classes and seminars as well as the weekly services. I was the guest speaker one Sunday in 2001, speaking on My Journey to Simplicity. Though I did not formally take up Ethical Culture, I am glad that the Ethical Society of St. Louis offered a place for me to explore what it means to live ethically without needing to postulate the Christian God I had grown up with but had lost faith in. Ethical Culture was a good bridge to Zen practice and to Druidry, the two practices of the Second Religiosity that I am engaged in now.<br><br><a href=#c884615103478326462 title="comment permalink">7/6/13, 6:10 PM</a><br><br>

The irony wasn't lost on me that we were using the Archdruid Report as an aid to keep us awake so that we could burn our way across the states.<br><br>Incidentally reading to another person is a lovely thing to do yet something I hadn't done in quite a while. I had forgotten its charms. The Archdruid Report stretched my reading-aloud skills to their limit - inflection, diction, pronunciation of words I was not familiar with, delivery... it was both a challenge and a lot of fun. I highly recommend it to your other readers should they find themselves with a willing audience.<br><br>On another note... in the comment section @Willian Yeates brought up the question of keeping musical instrument string manufacturing alive during the long descent. I did a little googling... in the past strings have been made with horse hair, silk, plant fibers, wire made from different types of metal and of course gut (mostly sheep and cow). <br><br>Here's a very interesting article about how to make gut strings by a man who is alive and well and currently making gut strings using historical techniques:<br><br>http://gamutmusic.squarespace.com/making-gut-stings/<br><br>But here's the predicament; it seems to me from this article that making gut strings is a really big undertaking. It's not a case of making your own beer in your basement. It's not something you can do in your spare time. It's a full time job. Specialization like this is only possible when there's a certain degree of order or stability within a community.<br><br>So the question is how do we ensure the survival of skills such as gut string manufacturing if there isn't enough stability within a society to practice such a trade?<br><br>Perhaps the best we can do is to write such knowledge down and hope that someday circumstances will allow for these skills to be rediscovered and practiced again. <br><br>Alas it seems to me that a certain amount of reinventing the wheel will be unavoidable. And some stuff's gonna get lost for ever.<br><br>Kinda bummed by that realisation.<br><br><br><br> <br><br><br><br><a href=#c4424302795511466125 title="comment permalink">7/7/13, 3:51 AM</a><br><br>

For instance, perhaps energy from a solar thermal factory could power the construction of solar panels. In that case, the process could go on forever, as long as you get more energy than it takes to make another unit of renewable intake... Does that make sense? If it's renewable, and it can grow exponentially, resource limits are just time limits. I don't think it's possible physically though: the initial energy and resource inputs are too large to be met over solar's life (or wind's). So the "renewables" aren't really renewable, although they can be a bridge to a de-industrial future. that was a little realization.<br><br>But the analysis that this post and many others in this series deals with are not really about resource limits; that is the particular form that our current civilization's growth bubble has centered around; but the understanding of cycles of history that you are describing doesn't have specifically to do with the energy source: the limit on civilization is really in the psychological and social organization that puts that energy to use. This particular post shows the pattern: our civilization has grown from the foundation of a limited energy source. But the problem has really turned out to be, our civilization's ability to adjust to those limits. And as you've fruitfully described, that ability is mitigated by social organizational structures that are not all that fluid and adaptable. <br><br>It turns out that the Peak Oil limit is really a limit on our culture's ability to adjust to that diminishing foundation. It makes me sad, to see people so frozen in this present moment. It will be a painful learning process, even for the next 100 or 150 years, and even less.

The TOS episodes involving cultural morphism (e.g. The Roman episode JMG cites, or "The Omega Glory") were fairly cheesy, and as an aspiring fiction writer, I wonder about such topics: if the cultural morphism episodes in Star Trek, and other sci-fi, had been more thoughtfully done, maybe the American population today would have a better grasp of the concept!<br>@ Marx Marvelous (love the pseudonym), total agreement.

I can't stop myself from mentioning that for about 3 years, I just assumed JMG had a deep, slow, Stentorian voice, based on the content of his articles. The necessary patience for a historical perspective, of course, implies a slow deep voice. For about 3 years I mentally read the Archdruid Report articles with the voice of Treebeard from the Lord of the Rings movies (performance by John Rhys-Davies making an extra effort to be slow and powerful). I mean, Druid, voice of a tree, y'know, how could I not?? <br><br>No offense meant to JMG whatsoever, but... then I heard him on a podcast for the first time. His voice simply isn't like that. Nothing wrong with JMG's voice, mind you, he actually sounds like the real-life voice of my favorite uncle.

In short, in some circumstances they could be used as incredibly powerful batteries in effect transferring energy from places with lots of sun or wind where they were manufactured to places where there is not so much.<br><br>Chris G: “But the analysis that this post and many others in this series deals with are not really about resource limits; that is the particular form that our current civilization's growth bubble has centered around; but the understanding of cycles of history that you are describing doesn't have specifically to do with the energy source: the limit on civilization is really in the psychological and social organization that puts that energy to use.”<br><br>Exactly! This is something that puzzled me for years as I found that in civilization after civilization at crucial points in their long, stepwise collapse (A Greerian collapse?) glaringly obvious opportunities to salvage things arose, but were never, never effectively acted on. <br><br>It was almost as if the collapse was deliberate and actively worked for by all levels in society. For example, there were lots of areas in Europe (i.e. England) that should have been able to survive the collapse of Rome and organize themselves into prosperous, powerful nations – they didn’t.<br><br>It was only when I realized that collapse is always primarily a social phenomenon that it all made sense.

However I have one disagreement concerning what Chris G said: "the initial energy and resource inputs are too large to be met over solar's life (or wind's). So the renewables aren't really renewable, although they can be a bridge to a de-industrial future." <br><br>The above statement is a generalisation that is not correct. One way to sort out this question is the use of the energy profit ratio, also known as the Energy return on energy invested (EREOI). <br><br>Much studies have been carried out over the years for numerous sources of energy. See the oildrum for references. <br><br>As expected the highest ratios are to be found for fossil fuel energy, 80 for coal, 50 or so for natural gas and 30 for oil, although for deep sea oil the ratio drops to 10. For renewable energy the ratios vary, wind 50, solar PV 10, solar thermal 20, hydro-elecric 70. I am quoting from memory so be lenient. <br><br>So in effect the ratios for fossil fuel are very high (but dropping) whilst the ratios for renewable are high for some low for others. Now because these ratios are difficult to compute accurately and whose values may change with time, one must be careful in using them. Nevertheless they are useful as rules of thumb and what they are saying to us is that whilst the ratios of renewable energies are NOT as high as those of fossil fuels they most probably are high enough to sustain a cultured, sophisticated and human civilisation over time. This is what counts. Now let us all get going and set up this civilisation.<br><br><a href=#c2969079943377156375 title="comment permalink">7/9/13, 4:18 AM</a><br><br>

My gut feel is that no one really knows how this stuff operates in a particular site until it is placed there. It is pretty scary for anyone who is basing their hopes and dreams on the various bits and pieces. Dreams of the current industrial society powered by renewables is completely laughable to me. On the other hand, it is however really lovely to look at the solar power statistics between this year and compare them to previous years (small really is beautiful). I will write an article on it and publish the graphs as they tell a fascinating tale of adaption to a particular location. Every day here, I keep learning new things about the land.

Boy, you're not kidding "bah".<br><br>JMG, you say we could have a long conversation about the giddy irrationalities of conventional economics. "Giddy irrationalities". Good way to put it. I would agree. This theory may not get a lot of traction in scholarly circles but I think that garden variety silly arsedness explains a lot of human behaviour and human history.<br><br>However, there may be another problem. And I hate to say this. But it's been observed that you can maybe guess at who an economist works for by what he or she says. <br><br>So, according to this view, they talk the employer's "book". Some examples: If the economist works for a real estate industry association then it's all happy talk about housing prices. If the economist is a "labour" economist on the payroll of an auto union then they talk a lot about the need for legislation and public policies that line up with labour union agendas. If the economist is on the payroll of a "right wing" think tank then, you know, the economist's talk is all about tax cuts and de-regulation. Or maybe the opposite if the economist works for a "progressive" think tank. Of course it's all justified by this economic theory or that economic theory. <br><br>I can see why this would be the case outside the cloistered world of universities and colleges. The employer pays the economist's salary and so calls the tune. And the economist sings it. <br><br>But here's an unworthy thought: what about the academic world? Are academic economists objective and dispassionate researchers? Are they unsullied by the grubby worries of the outside world? <br><br>Or do business and political and ideological interests cloud economics as a field of study? Do factional loyalties colour economists' views? What about ethnic or religious affiliation? Are allegedly objective studies seen through the lens of these various concerns? It's been said that different economists can look at the same data and come to widely varying conclusions. Why is this? Is it because of bona fide differences in opinion as to how economies work? Or are there other factors? <br><br>People are emotional and self-interested and clannish by nature and so am I. So far be it from me to point an accusing finger as to other people's character. I'm just asking the question because economists seem to have a lot of say in public policy. Like whether to regulate derivative products or not. Don't get me wrong, there are such things as legitimately competing interests and they should have their say. But maybe public officials ought to keep economists' biases in mind.<br><br><a href=#c2713712767749720750 title="comment permalink">7/10/13, 8:10 AM</a><br><br>

The theory of evolution by natural selection is perfectly logical, but that doesn't make the outcome of that project predictable -- it's impossible to know in advance, for example, when and where beneficial mutations will take place, and competition between different species boils down to an immense number of separate encounters between individuals, in which chance plays its usual immense role. Thus there's a lot of evolutionary change that could have gone in other directions -- consider what would have happened, for example, if an asteroid hadn't taken out the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous. <br><br>Bob, thank you!<br><br>Stream, that'd be Walter Miller, not Chip Delaney.

I'm not sure what the wire is: I think the less expensive strings are wound with aluminum, and it has the advantage that it doesn't corrode quickly. Silver is (I think) the "old-school" way of doing it, but it will corrode. Copper could probably be used, but it wouldn't last long -- it would corrode too quickly. You might be able to use gold, but it would be stupidly expensive, and being as heavy as it is (thus lowering the pitch), you'd probably have to tighten the strings until they snapped to get the pitch. Or draw the gold so finely that it wouldn't work.<br><br>You can look inside a piano to see how the winding works. In the upper register, you'll see plain steel wire. In the lower register, you'll see great, fat spiral-wound strings, and the windings get thicker the lower the pitch drops. Piano strings all have a steel core, rather than nylon or gut.<br><br><a href=#c8552107600256875526 title="comment permalink">7/10/13, 7:31 PM</a><br><br>

Among other things, it tells the future. Let's grant that it actually does exactly that. So if it works, it will bring good news, and bad news. But no one wants to hear bad news. In particular, if you are the emperor, and you ask your astrologers whether you will live long and have a prosperous reign, and the actual prediction is, "No, you're going to go mad, your empire will fall apart, and you will end on a gibbet," you stand to lose more than just your fee.<br><br>So you fudge the answer. You obfuscate and ramble. You figure out some way to say, "Oh, emperor, it shall be just as you have said." Of course, you have to convince the other astrologers that you aren't just blowing smoke, so you come up with a whole new set of axioms and observations and theories and whatnot to hold up your prediction.<br><br>Two direct consequences: your science of astrology has now made a bad prediction, and it has enshrined this badness in a bad (and obscure) methodology. It isn't long before all the astrologers have adjusted their practices to those of the Imperial Astrologer, and the whole science goes down the toilet. Even though we started with the assumption that it works just as it claimed.<br><br>Personally, I think there's a lesson in this for all the sciences. Since funding has become such an issue, no science is free of graft and the need to please those who fund it. As things stand, I think they are all headed for the toilet.<br><br><a href=#c1966850880462523727 title="comment permalink">7/10/13, 7:43 PM</a><br><br>
