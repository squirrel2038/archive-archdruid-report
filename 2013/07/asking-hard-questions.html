There are nights, now and then, when I sit up late with a glass of bourbon and look back over the long strange trip that’s unfolded over the last thirty years or so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When a substantial majority of Americans straight across the political landscape convinced themselves in the early 1980s that mouthing feel-good slogans and clinging to extravagant lifestyles over the short term made more sense than facing up to the hard choices that might have given our grandchildren a livable future, that choice kickstarted a flight into fantasy that continues to this day.
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the seven years that I’ve been writing and posting essays here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>, in turn, a tolerably good sample of the resulting fantasies have been dumped on my electronic doorstep by readers who were incensed by my lack of interest in playing along. There’s a certain amusement value in reviewing that sample, but a retrospective glance that way has another advantage: the common threads that unite the fantasies in question form a pattern of central importance to the theme that this sequence of posts is trying to explore. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Back in 2006, when I made my first posts suggesting that the future waiting for us on the far side of Hubbert’s peak was a long, ragged descent punctuated by crises, there were three common ways of dismissing that prediction. The first insisted that once the price of petroleum got near $100 a barrel, the sheer cost of fueling the industrial economy would trigger the economic crisis to end all economic crises and bring civilization crashing down at once. The second insisted that once that same price threshold was met, any number of exciting new renewable energy technologies would finally become profitable, resulting in a green-energy boom and a shiny future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The third insisted that once that price threshold was met, the law of supply and demand would flood the market with petroleum, force prices back down, and allow the march of economic growth to continue merrily on its way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A case could be made that those were reasonable hypotheses at the time. Still, the price of oil went soaring past $100 a barrel over the next few years, and none of those predictions panned out. We did have a whopping economic crisis in 2008, but emergency actions on the part of central banks kept the global economy from unraveling; a variety of renewable energy technologies got launched onto the market, but it took massive government subsidies to make any of them profitable, and all of them together provide only a very small fraction of our total energy use; and, of course, as prices rose, a certain amount previously uneconomical oil did find its way to market, but production remains locked into a plateau and the price remains stubbornly high.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That is to say, the perfect storms weren’t, the game-changing events didn’t, and a great many prophets ended up taking a total loss on their predictive investments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>It’s the aftermath, though, that matters. By and large, the people who were making these claims didn’t stop, look around, and say, “Hmm, clearly I got something wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Is there another way of thinking about the implications of peak oil that makes more sense of the data?” Instead, they found other arguments to back the same claims, or simply kept repeating them at higher volume. For a while there, you could go visit certain peak oil bloggers every January and read the same predictions of imminent economic doom that appeared there the year before, and then go to another set of peak oil bloggers and read equally recycled predictions that this would be the breakthrough year for some green energy source or other, and in neither case was there any sign that any of them had learned a thing from all the times those same predictions had failed before. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Nor were they alone—far from it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When I think about the number of arguments that have been posted here over the last seven years, in an effort to defend the claim that the Long Descent can’t possibly happen, it’s enough to make my head spin, even without benefit of bourbon. I’ve fielded patronizing lectures from believers in UFOs, New Age channelers, and the fake-Mayan 2012 prophecy, airily insisting that once the space brothers land, the New Age dawns, or what have you, we’ll all discover that ecological limits and the laws of thermodynamics are illusions created by lower states of consciousness. Likewise, I’ve received any number of feverish pronouncements that asteroids, solar flares, methane burps from the sea floor or, really, just about anything you can imagine short of titanic space walruses with photon flippers, are going to wipe out humanity in the next few years or decades and make the whole issue moot. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s been a wild ride, really.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ve been labeled dogmatic and intolerant for pointing out to proponents of zero point energy, abiotic oil, and similar exercises in wishful thinking that insisting that a completely unproven theory will inevitably save us may not be the most sensible strategy in a time of crisis. I’ve been dismissed as closed-minded by believers in artificial intelligence, fusion power, and an assortment of other technological will-o’-the-wisps for asking why promises of imminent sucess that have been repeated word for word every few years since the 1950s still ought to be considered credible today <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I’ve been accused of being a stooge for the powers of evil for questioning claims that Bush—er, make that Clinton—uh, well, let’s try Dubya—um, okay, then, Obama, is going to suspend the constitution, impose a totalitarian police state and start herding us all into camps, and let’s not even talk about the number of people who’ve gotten irate with me when I failed to be impressed by their insistence that the Rapture will happen before we run out of oil. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Not one of these claims is new, any more than the claims of imminent economic collapse, green-energy breakthroughs, or oceans of petroleum just waiting to be drilled. Most of them have been recycled over and over again, some for over a century—the New Age, for example, was originally slated to arrive in 1879, and in fact the most popular alternative spirituality magazine in 1890s Britain was titled <i>The New Age</i>—and the few that have only been through a few seasons’ worth of reruns follow familiar patterns and thus fail in equally familiar ways. If the point of making predictions in the first place has anything to do with anticipating the future we’re actually likely to get, these claims have flopped resoundingly, and yet they remain wildly popular. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course there are good reasons why they should be popular. All the claims about the future I’ve listed are, in practical terms, incentives to inaction and evasions of responsibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If rising oil prices are guaranteed to bring on a rush of new green energy options, then we don’t have to change our lifestyles, because pretty soon we’ll be able to power them on sun or wind or what have you; if rising oil prices are guaranteed to bring on a rush of new petroleum sources, well, then we don’t need to change our lifestyles, either, and we can make an extra donation to the Sierra Club or something to assuage any lingering ecological guilt we might have. The same goes for any of the other new technologies that are supposedly going to provide us with, ahem, limitless energy sometime very soon—and you’ll notice that in every case, supplying us with all that energy is someone else’s job. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
On the other hand, if the global economy is sure to go down in flames in the next few years, or runaway climate change is going to kill us all, or some future president is finally going to man up, impose a police state and march us off to death camps, it’s not our fault, and there’s nothing we can do that matters anyway, so we might as well just keep on living our comfortable lifestyles while they’re still here, right? It may be impolite to say this, but it needs to be said: any belief about the future that encourages people to sit on their backsides and do nothing but consume scarce resources, when there’s a huge amount that could be done to make the future a better place and a grave shortage of people doing it, is a luxury this age of the world can’t afford. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, I’d like to cycle back to the way that failed predictions are recycled, because it leads straight to the heart of an unrecognized dimension of the predicament of our time. Since the future can’t be known in advance, attempts to predict it have to rely on secondhand evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One proven way to collect useful evidence concerning the validity of a prediction is to ask what happened in the past when somebody else made that same prediction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Another way is to look for situations in the past that are comparable to the one the prediction discusses, in order to see what happened then. A prediction that fails either one of these tests usually needs to be put out to pasture; one that fails both—that has been made repeatedly in the past and failed every time, and that doesn’t account for the way that comparable situations have turned out—ought to be sent to the glue factory instead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s in this light that the arguments used to defend repeatedly failed predictions can be understood. I’ve discussed these arguments at some length in recent posts:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the endlessly repeated claim that <a href=../../2013/06/a-question-of-values.html>it’s different this time</a>, the refusal to think about <a href=../../2013/06/imperfect-storms.html>the implications of well-documented sources of negative feedback</a>, the insistence that <a href=../../2013/07/a-peculiar-absence-of-bellybones.html>a prediction must be true if no one’s proved that it’s impossible</a>, and so on. All of them are rhetorical gimmicks meant to stonewall the kind of assessment I’ve just outlined. Put another way, they’re attempts to shield repeatedly failed predictions from the normal and healthy consequences of failure. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Think about that for a bit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>From the time that our distant ancestors ventured out onto the East African savannas and started to push the boundaries of their nervous systems in ways for which millions of years of treetop living did little to prepare them, their survival and success have been a function of their ability to come up with mental models of the world that more or less correspond to reality where it counts. If there were ever australopithecines that couldn’t do the sort of basic reality testing that allows food to be distinguished from inedible objects, and predators from harmless animals, they didn’t leave any descendants. Since then, as hominids and then humans developed more and more elaborate mental models of the world, the hard-won ability to test those models against the plain facts of experience with more and more precision has been central to our achievement. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the modern West, we’ve inherited two of the great intellectual revolutions our species has managed—the creation of logic and formal mathematics in ancient Greece, and the creation of experimental science in early modern Europe—and both of those revolutions are all about reality testing. Logic is a system for making sure that mental models make sense on their own terms, and don’t stray into fallacy or contradiction; experimental science is a system for checking some mental models, those that deal with the quantifiable behavior of matter and energy, against the facts on the ground. Neither system is foolproof, but then neither is anything else human, and if both of them survive the decline and fall of our present civilization, there’s every reason to hope that future civilizations will come up with ways to fill in some of their blind spots, and add those to the slowly accumulating body of effective technique that provides one of the very few long-term dynamics to history. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It remains true, though, that all the many methods of reality testing we’ve evolved down through the millennia, from the most basic integration of sense inputs hardwired into the human brain right on up to the subtleties of propositional logic and the experimental method, share one central flaw. None of them will work if their messages are ignored—and that’s what’s going on right now, as a vast majority of people across the modern industrial world scramble to find reasons to cling to a range of popular but failed predictions about the future, and do their level best to ignore the evidence that a rather more unpopular set of predictions about the future is coming true around them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Look around, dear reader, and you’ll see a civilization in decline, struggling ineffectually with the ecological overshoot, the social disintegration, the institutional paralysis, and the accelerating decay of infrastructure that are part and parcel of the normal process by which civilizations die. This is what the decline and fall of a civilization looks like in its early-to-middle stages—and it’s also what I’ve been talking about, very often in so many words, since not long after this blog got under way seven years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Back then, as I’ve already mentioned, it was reasonable to propose that something else might happen, that we’d get the fast crash or the green-energy breakthrough or all the new petroleum that the law of supply and demand was supposed to provide us, but none of those things happened. (Of course, neither did the mass landing of UFOs or any of the other more colorful fantasies, but then that was never really in question.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s time to recognize that the repetition of emotionally appealing but failed predictions is not a helpful response to the crisis of our time, and in fact has done a great deal to back us into the corner we’re now in. What was Ronald Reagan’s airy twaddle about “morning in America,” after all, but another emotionally appealing failed prophecy of the kind I’ve just been discussing? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus I’d like to suggest that from now on, any claim about the future needs to be confronted up front by the two hard questions proposed above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What happened at other times when people made the same prediction, or one that’s closely akin to it? What happened in other situations that are comparable to the one the prediction attempts to address?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Any prediction that claims to be about a future we might actually encounter should be able to face these two questions without resorting to the kind of rhetorical evasions noted above. Any prediction that has to hide behind those evasions, in turn, needs to be recognized as being irrelevant to any future we might actually encounter. My own predictions, by the way, stand or fall by the same rule, and I encourage my readers to ask those questions of each prediction I make, and answer them through their own research. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yes, I’m aware that those two questions pack an explosive punch that makes dynamite look weak. It’s embarrassingly common in contemporary life for theories to be embraced because of their emotional appeal, and then defended with every rhetorical trick in the book against any inconvenient contact with unsympathetic facts. As suggested in last week’s post, that’s a common feature of civilizations toward the end of their rationalist period, when abstract reason gets pushed to the point of absurdity and then well beyond it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Fantasies about the shape of the future aren’t uncommon at such times, but I don’t know of another civilization in all of recorded history that has put as much energy as ours into creating and defending abstract theories about the shape of the future. With any luck, the civilizations that come after ours will learn from our mistakes, and direct their last and most overblown abstractions in directions that will do less harm. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the meantime, those of us who are interested in talking about the kinds of future we might actually encounter might find it useful to give up the standard modern habit of choosing a vision of the future because it’s emotionally appealing, demanding that the world fulfill whatever dream we happen to have, and filling our minds with defensive gimmicks to keep from hearing when the world says “no.” That requires a willingness to ask the questions I mentioned above, and to accept the answers, even when they aren’t what we’d like them to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More generally, it requires a willingness to approach the universe of our experience from a standpoint that’s as stunningly unfashionable these days as it is necessary—a standpoint of humility. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What would it mean if, instead of trying to impose an emotionally appealing narrative on the future, and shouting down any data that conflicts with it, we were to approach the universe of our experience with enough humility to listen to the narratives the universe itself offers us?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s basically what I’ve been trying to suggest here all along, after all. That’s the point to my repeated references to history, because history is our species’ accumulated body of knowledge of the way human affairs unfold over time, and approaching that body of knowledge with humility and a willingness to listen to the stories it tells is a proven way to catch hints about the shape of the future as it unfolds. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s also the point to my equally frequent references to ecology, because history is simply one subset of the behavior of living things over time—the subset that deals with human organisms—and also because ecological factors have played a huge and all too often unrecognized role in the rise and fall of human societies. Whether humans are smarter than yeast is less important than the fact, and of course it is a fact, that humans, yeast, and all other living things are subject to the same ecological laws and thus inevitably experience similar processes over time. Attentive listening to the stories that history tells, and the even richer body of stories that nature tells, is the one reliable way we’ve got to figure out what those processes are before they clobber us over the head. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style='font-family: Times; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>That act of humility, finally, may be the best ticket out of the confusion that the collective imagination of our time has created around itself, the proliferation of abstractions divorced from reality that makes it so hard to see the future looming up ahead of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By turning our attention to what actually happens in the world around us, and asking the hard but necessary questions about our preferred notions concerning that world and its future, we might just be able to extract ourselves far enough from that confusion to begin to grapple with the challenges of our time. In the process, we’ll have to confront once again the issues with which this series of posts started out—the religious dimension of peak oil and the end of the industrial age. We’ll proceed with that discussion next week. </span></div>

I realized I'm most comfortable in both contradictory extreme. The reality for me is probably we'll find enough fossil fuels to cause global havoc of some sort, and there's no "activism" except to adapt, and no "denial" except to ignore facts (and speculation) you can't change.<br><br>But once I get past the grim reality that I can't really affect the direction of human civilization, it does make me curious, what sort of "other consciousness" exists in the world besides humans, and what's it thinking about, and that pulls me back to adaptation.<br><br>So if you're looking at religion next week, my thought is that religion is about "awareness of subtle things", and finding ritual structures that remind us of what we can't see, and then just sort of paying attention.<br><br>And I guess I feel some reassurance at the "catabolic collapse" idea, that change happens fast, and then slow, so you don't have to "predict the fast", just know it will come and be preared enough to survive it, and then you have the slow time to adapt. <br><br>And lastly thinking, its easy to judge Americans for listening to Reagan 40 years ago, but I still wonder if an authoritarian Jimmy Carter, with religious cult, perhaps "warriors for energy austerity" would have defunded the computer revolution as too expensive, and we'd be going back to morse-code telegraphs, and who knows what else?<br><br>So I accept that politicians are required to look forward and tell people what they want to hear. It's fantasy to be sure, but I don't know if fear is enough to win a future. Fundamentalism falls for that, and we always know why they're wrong, or do we?<br><br><br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c8727272451116804576 title="comment permalink">7/10/13, 11:17 PM</a><br><br>

Something that would tackle some issues but wouldn't be a magic trick to solve all.<br><br>So I was wondering if you heard about Modern Money Theory which claims that with fiat money systems we are having nowadays (the government has a monopoly in issuing the currency) government deficits don't matter (a.k.a. are not inflationary) as long as we are not near full employment. An important if. The interesting idea that they attach to it is that we could easily have a Job Guarantee program, usually proposed in a form where the government works as an Employer of Last Resort and offers a meaningful job to anyone willing to work. It would solve the unemployment issue in a direct way instead of indirect (with the central bank targeting some interest rate and inflation). It would be countercyclical as in good economic times people would move in to higher paid jobs in the private sector (the salary of the jobs in the JG program should remain the same), while offering jobs when economic times are rough as they are now.<br><br>Now this theory is not based on some wishful future, they just describe how our present monetary system works. Fiat money is accepted (nowadays) as the government requires taxes paid in its currency. The government however, as it issues it doesn't need to collect taxes first, to be able to spend it.<br><br>Yes, they do work in the framework of stimulating economic growth, but as I see it, it doesn't have to be. They accept real limits, but claim that our present monetary limits are completely self-imposed, not to say used as a means to get to a certain policy: dismantling the welfare state. <br><a href=url rel=nofollow>http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2013/01/07/social-security-rerun/</a><br>. If less energy and resources are available, and economic progress is no longer there, then all the money in the world won't save us. I see it as a better version of well-fare, at best dampening the long descent. At worst giving more chances to prepare for it (although you always claim this chance was lost in the 70's.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c129831020761982846 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 1:49 AM</a><br><br>

I have thought for several years this is a useful model to identify where our society is going awry. <br><br>In combat the idea is to go through this cycle faster than the other guy until you have him on the ropes, his decisions become increasingly irrelevant to the situation and finally you place yourself in a position to defeat him.<br><br>I guess in industrial civilization's case the other side is nature (I still scratch my head though and wonder why we treat the only world we live in as if it was something to be defeated...)and the rules (thermodynamics and ecology for example) by which she works. <br><br>I think as a society we are generally okay at observing things (at least in some fields), but when it comes to orientating ourselves to the situation we bring in our various ideologies which influence our decisions and subsequent actions.<br><br>The net result is that our actions become more and more inappropriate to the situation that we find ourselves in. The logical consequence being, as you argue, that much of what could be salvaged won't be.<br><br>This plays out in domestic domestic politics here in Australia, and I presume it is the same most everywhere else.

The thing that has always most troubled me about the predicament you outline is the lack of psychological "payoff" for achieving some clarity about our delusions. As you say, people rarely thank you for showing them that there is no brighter future. I suppose there's something to be said for the feeling of satisfaction one can achieve through shaking off one's comforting, but misleading illusions - but it has to compete with feelings of anxiety, uncertainty, helplessness and the irresistible temptation to take refuge once again for respite. <br><br>To give an example: to be in nature has long been for me healing, humbling, inspiring and spiritually rejuvenating. But nature is also deeply wounded, and when I see that woundedness, (whether I acknowledge my contribution to that or not) I feel my spirituality also wounded - and I am cut off from a joy that is crucial to my humanness. I know there is a resolution to this - to find a spiritual synthesis where this grief and joy can coexist and commingle (instead of my current dishonest toggling back and forth between the two). But that is a very hard answer to your very hard questions. I read your blog and its commentariot because green wizardry is one of the few places I think I'll find aid in my struggle to find joy and satisfaction in the honest contemplation and experience of our loss of that brighter future.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c7010346469248485791 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 4:40 AM</a><br><br>

Your are bringing together pieces of fact-digging knowledge and intuitive consciousness that many of us have (or sensed), but that few could previously fit together into a whole narrative picture.<br><br>This being said, as an amused observer of various group of people following one delusion or another (from an omnipotent god to “solar panels will save our energy future !”), I’m finding myself growingly exposed to a strange mental dichotomy. The comforting feeling of having (finally) found a community of people who happen to share a real will to discuss the road forward rationally. Yet at the same time, the realization that few of our human peers are willing to start thinking or even listening to these arguments, which naturally tend to nurture in me a condescending feeling of “if only they knew”… <br><br>Which attitude is something I’ve seen regularly in any of the pious followers of the utopia “du jour”.<br><br>Have you run into this kind of “introspective doubts” related to how close, the small group of people actively trying to grasp and discuss our future on rational grounds, are to say “the end-of-the-civilization doomsayer” club (in their own respective isolation from what passes for “general knowledge”) ? <br><br>Thanks for your work !<br><br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c3859338556244023469 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 6:04 AM</a><br><br>

The prediction has been advanced literally thousands of times over the course of more than two-thousand years (including predictions of this sort advanced by Jews prior to the era of Jesus of Nazareth) without having come to pass.<br><br>It is when one also applies the second criterion you propose to test the basic validity of this class of predictions that the situation becomes much more complicated. The second criterion involves looking “for situations in the past that are comparable to the one the prediction discusses, in order to see what happened then.”<br><br>The fact is that, with regard to predictions concerning the Messiah’s return (or initial advent) in glory, none that proposed this return to occur prior to 1947 is in fact comparable to any that propose his return to occur after 1947. It was in that year, of course, that the modern nation of Israel was founded. It is obvious from predictive biblical passages in Daniel Chapter 9, Zechariah Chapter 12, and elsewhere that the preexistence of a regathered Jewish state after a lengthy period of exile and diaspora is a necessary precondition for the predicted Messianic return even to be possible.<br><br>In other words, when inquiring into the prima facie validity of predictions concerning the future based on traditional Judeo-Christian apocalypticism, one is in fact dealing with two classes of predictions that are entirely distinct from the standpoint of your two validity criteria, because of the crucial factor of the absence versus presence of the state of Israel. As such, in light of your validity criteria, the failure of nearly 2000 years of predictions of Messianic return implies virtually nothing with regard to predictions of a similar (but also crucially different) sort being advanced today. Thus, the application of your second validity criterion to this case cancels out apparent risibility and easy dismissibility that seems to result when applying the first criterion alone.<br><br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c5509382135586836521 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 6:24 AM</a><br><br>

I so appreciate this blog for routing out the hidden questions and ass-umptions that run steady below the surface of our cultural conversations.<br><br>For many, it seems that the point of these tenuous threads is to maintain comfort and avoid mitigating actions. For me, it's the opposite; the question that runs underneath all these mental explorations is what can I do about it? What are the most useful responses I can make, not only to what I know and learn, but also toward that which I can't possibly know? What are my true gifts and how do I express them in service to the Ongoing? So many of the memes seem to provide excuses for inaction; "do-nothing" has even been suggested as adaptive behavior, and that just grates against my gumption something fierce.<br><br>I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do something, but the challenge lies in determining exactly what-something. Leave the country, build a boat, practice ascension, practice my aim, collect pairs of animals?<br>Our minds can be so bright, and yet so sharply blinded, it would be far too simple to decide on something way too specific. <br><br>So I've begun to think of response-able actions in broader categories. To me it appears that a critical crisis-funnel will happen around the food supply. Would it be wise then, to design a brilliant permaculture food-forest in every imaginable detail? Only if I wanted to avoid doing something effective. <br><br>Instead, I tell myself that as long as I'm involved in building soil fertility and concentrating genetic diversity (seed-saving) every growing season, then that will somehow become the field of opportunity where something can open up. Don't try to create an outcome as much as a context within which good outcomes may arrive.<br><br>Other collapse-blogs have dismissed all potential agricultural impulses as useless in the face of eco-enforced nomadism. I find this position as useless as NTE, even if it were true, because there's nothing I can do in this life about it. I simply have to do something, and squat doesn't count.<br><br>I'm beginning to think adaptive behavior can't be anything but general, that there is an ecological succession to effective responses. Thinking too much about tumbling down the catabolic stairs can put me too far into the future to accurately frame my today. At some point, I need to allow Intuition to kick-in as well, all while shushing its loud cousin, Emotionality.<br><br>Thanks again, JMG!<br><br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c5926698760148706357 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 6:30 AM</a><br><br>

I'm seeing the same issue in microcosm on my little "homestead" – I can insist that my theories are correct, or I can look and see what's actually happening; the latter is the only way that works. I wonder if we are the most abstract/theoretical society because so many of our citizens have been "freed" of the need to address basic survival issues, and have forgotten that they are being supported by a vast hierarchy of functions done by someone else.

One of my favorite quotes is from Rudyard Kipling: "Gardens are not made/ by crying out 'how beautiful' and sitting in the shade." <br><br>On the other hand, having some sort of idea, even vision (?) about how one would like things to be at some future point (based on, one hopes, one's experience and knowledge of reality, history, etc., and willingness to learn from those persons more experienced) can be useful. Tomatoes are a wonderful fruit. It would be nice to have some homegrown ones since they are the best. Therefore I will attempt to grow tomatoes, even though it may not work out--hornworms, viruses, weather and so on; and, tomatoes are more easily grown in some places than others, which fact must be heeded and factored in. Environmental limitations indeed! (I remain hopeful that my tomato plants, now flowering, will be pollinated, will set fruit that will eventually ripen, so I can eat them, particularly since I don't buy tomatoes at the grocery store.)<br><br>Re humility: I see humility as a process and practice, hopefully leading to a general state and approach toward "the universe and everything," not as an act. This is something of a semantic quibble, since you amply discuss your point.<br><br>Looking forward to the next post!<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c2852423574850064303 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 7:06 AM</a><br><br>

Certainly, there will be followings and many people like to join groups for answers, but much like we all face our individual and eventual death we are forced by circumstances to make many small decisions on a daily basis that forge our course forward. We need to lead ourselves and not wait for others to point out what to do. Awareness is the first step, and writers such as yourself are forcing all of us to think more about these issues and season our awareness.<br><br>Of course, this is a self-selecting audience and probably not typical.

I almost imagine that you were up late with your glass of bourbon, reflecting upon your own past as well as the historical past. Perhaps you realized there was quite a bit you dearly missed about the past whether it was the strength and energy of your youth, the social and environmental activism of the Vietnam War era or maybe a collection of more personal thoughts? Perhaps, as a seer such as yourself so often does, you were thinking of a miserable future that could be lightened by shortwave radio, guitar string making and a revival of rational thought and logical discussion in politics and social matters? Overall, I really enjoyed this week’s post. <br>“With any luck, the civilizations that come after ours will learn from our mistakes, and direct their last and most overblown abstractions in directions that will do less harm.”<br> “Attentive listening to the stories that history tells, and the even richer body of stories that nature tells, is the one reliable way we’ve got to figure out what those processes are before they clobber us over the head.”<br> Although I despise the oversimplification of being placed in a box or some “ism” of sorts, I myself would probably be labeled under neo-primitivism. You may already know where this is going, but as a student of history I myself am always perplexed by the culture of biases present in History itself. We have so much more information about the past 50 years than the past 200, and exponentially less about the past 1000, but exponentially more than the past 10,000, but certainly an order of magnitude more than the past 100,000 years. With our current biases of the “civilized”, the complex and petty nostalgias for great ages of learning and knowledge (which created the subject in the first place), why is it that we take the lessons of the past 10,000 years as being more important than the past 100,000. [I am biased myself, because my life has been drastically improved by just the idea of attempting to eat like humans did in the past 100,000 years rather than in the past 10,000. (Which I discovered through science ironically)] <br> However, what is astounding to me though is that you would think it is proper and necessary for humanity to retain logic, mathematics and experimental science. Sure, these things can provide material conveniences and temporary reprieves from the harsh forces of Mother Nature. Does humanity “need” them to survive, live enjoyable lives or maintain some civilized notion of decency and dignity? I think the answer is no, In fact, I think the opposite could be argued quite well, that mathematics and science led us on a path to destroy things we once held sacred, taboo or full of evil spirits. Rationalism through ecology, biochemistry and evolutionary biology in my opinion and ironically so, showed us the magical reasoning of holding our life support systems sacred was not such a silly idea after all. Poor scientific reasoning and “rational economic decisions” end up being used as a justification for cutting our own throats.

There is no reason to think we can effectively control or effect the macro-scale decisions that humanity as a whole makes. I think it is more appropriate to look at these macro-earth scale problems as no more than an exotic type of weather. Paleolithic tribes were at complete mercy of the weather just as we are to the brewing storms of anthropogenic climate change, wars, political unrest and marginalization by scarce resources. The one common element in these two disparate but morphologically similar histories is that individual action to adapt to these storms is what really matters. You told Tom at the top of the comments that you weren’t sure that there was a way to talk to people about these problems. I think you, John Michael Greer, lead by example as is one of the best ways to communicate these problems to people. Think of the reader who is enamored by the thought of the Treebearded voiced wizard bearded leader of druids who despite his intelligence chooses the enlightened life as a simple rural folk. It was a survival expert named Cody Lundin ( a true fire sorcerer, skilled with a bow drill :D) who inspired me with his example of simpler living. Having the most powerful eyes of the animal kingdom (except for some birds and deep sea creatures), sometimes humans need to see their lives cemented before them in order to comfortable make changes. Do not doubt the power of yourself to lead by example Mr.Greer, no doubt I have been inspired by yours.<br> <br><br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c7227868076096987895 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 7:10 AM</a><br><br>

And yeah, this is exactly how fall and decline looks like, when experienced from inside perspective. Most pedantically documented fall of civilization is death of classical antiquity. Fall of palace cultures during Bronze Age Collapse may have been even bigger convulsion, but we just don't know much about it. We are following roughly same cultural delusions and trends of disintegration that pushed Mediterranean civilization peaking in Roman Empire into the grave. <br><br>As Robin Lane Fox showed to his readers in "Pagans and Christians", religious worldview of classical world was still alive and kicking during fourth century. Christianity was just new, heavy-hitting contender for championship belt, not guaranteed winner. But during fifth and sixth centuries AD classical way to see world didn't match up with real world around anymore - that was true key to victory of Christianity, as you brilliantly showed to your readers in pamphlet about Saint Augustine. <br><br>Currently Western world adheres strictly to globalist, conformist and feminist ideology conjured up by intelligentsia among Baby Boomer generation, after they repelled dominant intellectual trends of pre-war West. Discontinuity of intellectual trends after war is actually quite hilarious in its deep self-deception; especially with Left, whose pre-war intellectuals were deeply committed to selective breeding of human race before nightmare horrors of extermination camps by black brand of Socialism.<br><br>I believe this current religious-ideological cult, born from delusions of Baby Boomer generation, has absolutely zero survival prospects in Long Descent you are describing. It denies too much from too many and rigs rules of the Game too much. This resentment against current orthodoxy manifests many ways among younger generations, but nowhere as blatantly as in so called Manosphere. Brilliant writers of that movement, mainly from Generation X, are blaspheming against sacred doctrines of current West. As I belong to that generation myself, I understand their anger and frustration, even if I do not share their zeal and rage.<br><br>My point is, current religious-political mindset of the West is going to crash and burn, because it can survive only in conditions of peace and plenty. Signs of cultural decay, atomization of society and detachment from reality at system level have been in the air for a long time now. World shall not end, but this current moral landscape will die off, because it is not fit to survive much longer.<br><br>I believed earlier that old school religiousness is only option strong enough to replace current globalist/leftoid-feminist ideology as it withers away... That future shall belong to leaders like Santorum in Western sphere of Christendom and conservative Elders of faith in the East. Muslim world is already turning into theocratic model of rule natural for their culture, and no political meddling by merchant banksters of West is going to chance that trend; Egyptian incursion by West shall fail like all other incursions lately.<br><br>Your blog has made me wonder inevitability of this outcome I had lined out in my mind; maybe there are other exit options available for European civilization ( aka Christendom) during this current fall of civilization. Maybe spiritual revival of European culture and rebirth of much-needed cultural bonds is possible without usurpation by most fundamental forms of old school faith. As I am mostly pragmatic in my opinions towards spirituality, that would be great relief personally. So, I am waiting with great interest your posts about religion and and peak oil... Religion is always, always heart of civilization, even if it's true believers would call it ideology instead... And these secular religions have already failed us, what we are experiencing from inside point-of-view is great convulsions of already dying system.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c7607302133052563556 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 7:19 AM</a><br><br>

Not zero point energy etc. I'm curious about what kind of McLuhanesque spectrum of effects might emerge out of our current technology and digital media. Just as print gave us a changes in perception along with new inventions, our digital media might do something similar.

Specifically I'm thinking of the electric grid. I'm imagining an eventual permanent black out from deferred maintenance. Although the lead up to a final grid failure would undoubtedly see falling standards of living,it seems to me the final loss of power would lead to a situation on the ground that could reasonably be described as a total collapse for those effected. Is the point only that it wont happen to everyone all at once? Or do you just see it as a larger step on our way to a new equilibrium? If that is the case it may just be a matter of semantics, one mans large step down is another's collapse.<br><br> In any event, the recent set of posts have been a breath of fresh, rational, air for the peak oil blogosphere.

During part of the discussion Dan expounded on how he brings up medical care (he called it health care) with his students. Dan's presentations center on having his students consider what he calls policy options for providing medical care to the general population. In Dan's view it is politicians who, by considering these policy options, determine what sort of and how much insurance to provide to the general public and how to pay for it and who then develop and pass legislation accordingly. I made some comments along the line that I didn't think policy would have much of a chance to address the multitude of issues surrounding health care at a time when the resources to address this and other issues are shrinking rather than expanding. However I forgot the most obvious objection: the idea that politicians should be leading the effort in the first place, rather than respond to what people have decided and acted on themselves. You've pointed out in past posts how women, for instance, changed their views about themselves and their place before legislation responded to their new view of themselves. Going by the lessons of history, it might have been better for legislators to avoid addressing medical care while the public is still divided on the matter, rather than enact the mess of Obamacare as its policy option and then watch as everyone from Obama on down tries to wriggle out from under its collapsing edifice.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c6125389832213645937 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 7:55 AM</a><br><br>

I wanted to reflect on the "new" American dream. I do not write as clearly as you do but I did a blog on my trip at www.bikewriter.net that tackled what I perceived as similar issues. I too would localize the "failure of the revolution" so to speak as the happier magical thinking imbued in Morning in America.

It's a wonderful work, dense but very interesting and accessible. She very calmly walks the reader through how different tribes and sects and societies shaped their stories of god or gods in the context of their history. This leaves a very clear impression of how a particular religious belief could take root as a reaction or adaptation to particular social, economic or political circumstances. It's helped me understand religious beliefs that have baffled me for years, because previously I was just looking at the belief and trying to understand it based on its philosophical content alone. Context is so important in the history of ideas. <br><br>You could apply the same approach to a "Brief History of Progress" (a book I could definitely see you writing and would be thrilled to read). For example, seen through the lens of resource constraints, the Reagan revolution does seem nuts, and very frustrating. But understood in the context of historical forces - right wing reaction to the Carter years, the continuing Cold War dynamic, political expediency, capitalism's need for growth, popular commitment to the city on the hill myth, etc, etc, etc, it all seems kind of inevitable that there would be such a reaction. Just as individually we are prisoners to the momentum of our minds, collectively we really are prisoners to all these historical forces.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c1765345423099381872 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 8:32 AM</a><br><br>

Excellent article, thanks. <br><br>Anyway, I expect that the difficulty with your prediction quality tests will be the definition of "same prediction" with respect to "what happened in the past when somebody else made that same prediction", and the definition of "situations in the past that are comparable" with respect to "look for situations in the past that are comparable to the one the prediction discusses, in order to see what happened then".<br><br>Additionally, regarding the first, context is important. A prediction of "God will destroy the major cities of XXXX empire with giant fireballs due to [insert your favorite reason to rain hellfire on humanity here]", to a modern observer, would most probably seems ludicrous during Roman times (even though it no doubt was predicted many times), but, not so far fetched once the era of thermonuclear devices was entered. <br><br>On the rhetorical trick of "it's different this time", what makes the rejection of this claim valid, IYO? Some times it really *is* different this time (or so advocates of decline might claim). A quick example is, we really *will* face limits to per capita energy use, when this has been increasing for hundreds of years, or we actually will face food production limits at some point, although yields have been increased massively during the 20th century.

The Dark Mountain Project, for instance, is approaching the issue from the perspective of art and story, which acts at a more unconscious level, and can be very effective. In fact, this was a fairly common approach for environmentalism in the 60s and 70s (e.g. films like Soylent Green or Silent Running).

Perhaps most of them: we'll never know, because they pass (mostly) unmarked, with a very few spectacular failures preserved as an object lesson in impossibility.<br><br>There is a very deep issue of values here: what is it to be human?<br><br>I've used this word "accomplished," which contains a value judgement. I could equivalently have used the expression "disturbed the balance of nature," which contains an opposed value judgement.<br><br>If we look at humans purely as animals in an ecological niche, the long-term stable solution is ... well, long-term and stable. It means we don't innovate much, if at all, any more than bears or butterflies do. We don't disturb the balance of nature, nor do we "accomplish." We just exist.<br><br>I don't know that it's in our nature to live that way. We'll have to evolve into a somewhat different species to do this. That's not impossible: at the personal level, each of us develops from embryo to adult, replacing virtually all of our material components over a lifetime, yet memory holds together a continuity that allows me to say that I am "me" for the better part of a century. In the same way, a "cultural memory" (history, mythology) could provide a continuity that would relate modern humans -- innovative, nature-disturbing, full of hubris -- with whatever post-modern species replaces us.<br><br>But I don't see how a modern human could thrive or even survive in that far-away future society. They'd kill us, lock us up, or be utterly destroyed by us. We're thistles and bindweed -- they're mosses and forests.<br><br>All of which seems to me to imply that we're going to be stuck with boom-and-bust empire building for the foreseeable future.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c4489251259973125553 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 9:34 AM</a><br><br>

Let me say that you are a voice of reason in a supposedly rational world, which behaves as irrationally as I can think.<br>Let me offer you some comments from a small European Country, Portugal, stuck in the middle of the "Euro crisis". There are two basic positions regarding the "solution" to the excess debt that Portugal has (public and private debt):<br>1. Austerity: the State needs to reduce its debt levels in order to grow again;<br>2. Growth: Keynesian measures to enable us to grow again.<br>Both sides fight ferociously, and are unable to see that they are actually defending the same thing: growth!<br>You will also like to hear that in 2006/2007 the biggest importers of Energy and Oil in Europe were the PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain), the exact countries where the financial crisis has hit the hardest.<br>Also, we have noticed a decline in public services due to lack of money, such as not enough money for gas for the police to drive their cars (!) and an increase in theft and crime. It is no wonder that small communities, especially in rural areas, are beggining to organize themselves, but everyone is still in shock and hoping things will just go back to the way they were, even thought it is clear it won't happen.<br>So, looking forward, the great problem I see is that the current attempts to centralize power in the EU will meet head on with the weakness of the local State and small communities, due to the smaller tax ammounts it is able to collect. You can see this happening right now in Portugal and Spain, where local councils are essentially broke. This is a recipe for centralization of power and authoritarianism. One thing we hear a lot right now is that elections don't provide "stability", and we need to postpone them, due to the "markets'" demands. Read Reuters news today about Portugal and you'll see that I'm not joking. This is generating great resentment towards Brussels, and nationalisms and fascist ideas are slowly returning (see France, Greece). <br>As for answers, I have none, but I look forward to continue reading your thoughts on the blog.<br>Pedro, Portugal<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c3240736509684063479 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 9:36 AM</a><br><br>

Salamanders live in a little kettle-pond lake. Clearly the sensible thing to do is to stay there and thrive and mate and die in the relative safety of the pond. And so they do. But a few salamanders are clearly not sensible. They wander off from the pond. It turns out it would have been much, much safer to stay in the pond and almost all of them die upon the predator-infested deserts. But a few, with little but absurd luck to distinguish them, make it to other kettle ponds and their descendants settle there and thrive and mate and die. And a few restless ones wander off almost always to die. But THEY are the reason there are salamanders - a hundred thousand years and a million years after that first kettle pond has reverted to dust.<br><br>For a human and the culture they are delivered into, I suspect that it is normal to accept the waters you are given, since they are usually safe and tested.

Allow me to thank you for all your great work. I've been following your blog for years (almost as long as the Oil Drum may it RIP).

Its also fun that all these come from a man who proclaims to be a Druid. <br><br>So enough of the flattery. I hope its worked its magic. Now for the rough stuff: Do we need to hear about the religious dimension of peak oil and the end of industrial age? Your analysis of the dominant civic religion that leads to denial has not been been sufficient? As for those who don't hold to the dogma of unending material growth, won't those of us so inclined (and who also survive) just work out an appropriate world view, ethical system, and means to propagate these i.e. a religion appropriate to the circumstances? <br><br>More pressing issues are: how will the decline will unfold, what parts of the edifice will go next, how quickly, and in what order. I believe that Dimitry Orlov has done an adequate job of outlining the main stages of collapse; its the specifics and timing that matter. The more specific you are; however, the more likely you are to be wrong. Making predictions is a tricky game!<br><br>There is nothing purely academic about this. I have to give guidance to my young children. What education and occupations are most likely to help them best. Watch your step Druid!

Looking back the argument translates into 'I want meaning so I'll presume that God exists to create it.' But the emotional force of the quest of a young person for meaning made it impossible to see the irrationality.

I do not agree, however, that MMT models the way our monetary system works. The vast majority of the money in our system was issued not by the Federal Government but by the Federal Reserve. That money, while created out of thin air, is not put into circulation freely but is loaned into existence. It therefore comes at a price, and so is not really a fiat currency in the sense understood by MMT.<br><br>That the recent financial crisis was not managed through a jobs program but rather by loans and guarantees to banks is telling. Assume, for example, that the initial $700 billion was distributed to the population at large -- with the stipulation that it be used to pay off all debts before being used for any other purpose -- rather than being given directly to the banks. The money would have ended up in the banking system anyway, and so the "liquidity crisis" that the banks were supposedly facing would have been alleviated in either case. The difference, of course, is equity versus debt. If the money had been distributed to the population, it would have improved their equity situation. Supplying it to the banks in hopes they would lend it out is exactly the reverse: it is a mechanism to further indebt those who take out the loans. Why would a government do this to its own people?<br><br>This tells me that it is not the government that is calling the shots. After all, there is no real reason that the government cannot act as the employer of last resort and meet its payroll with fiat currency in the MMT sense. But it doesn't. Why not?<br><br>It also tells me that in the present scheme of things, the wage-price spiral is not the only possible cause of inflation. Technically, inflation is a monetary phenomenon, but here I'm referring to "inflation" in the more general sense that a typical paycheck just doesn't go as far as it used to. This kind of "inflation" can also result from money being syphoned off (for example, by the financial sector) to unproductive uses, so that it is no longer available for personal consumption, investment, or provision of government services.<br><br>It will be interesting to see whether the control of the monetary supply by the banking system will result in this kind of "inflation".

That's very common -- in a time of crisis and disintegration, emblems of central authority can have a very powerful emotional role even when the authority itself has long since evaporated. <br><br>Divelly, as I was just saying to RogerCO, that's par for the course in an age of decline. As the effective power of government to get much of anything done goes away, ritual gestures such as declaring martial law help people convince themselves that everything isn't falling to bits, and so such gestures are always popular. <br><br>Cam, it sounds as though nature is going through the Boyd cycle a lot more quickly and accurately than we are at this point! <br><br>RogerCO, all this is standard. The middle classes, which have the education and access to media to make their dissent audible, are increasingly terrified of losing their privileged place in the world, and so their dissent is becoming increasingly abstract and ineffectual. The dissent that matters is down among the working poor, and that doesn't take the form of protest marches or activism; as Toynbee points out, it's a matter of a spreading but silent crisis of legitimacy that finally leaves the system hollowed out and ready to collapse. <br><br>Andy, I'll be addressing that as we proceed. Yes, it's a challenge. <br><br>James, thank you. No, I'm hardly going to be giving up now -- it's becoming increasingly clear that the Long Descent is what we're going to get, and so it's time to get to work dealing with that reality. <br><br>Bilaal, as I've said here many times, I've never lived outside the United States and so don't claim to be able to discuss what's going on elsewhere with any cogency. Of course things are different in China -- that's a different civilization, though one that's proven very adept at borrowing the technologies invented by ours (as we did with theirs a few hundred years back), and is following its own curve of rise and fall, not ours. I always encourage people in other parts of the world who want a less US-centric vision of things to get to work and provide one themselves -- the last thing you need, after all, is one more clueless American trying to tell you what's going on. <br><br>Ventriloquist, and no other civilization ever had to contend with Khloe Kardashian, either!<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c882217935847597280 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 3:19 PM</a><br><br>

I'll be talking about what we have to offer as this discussion proceeds. <br><br>Thijs, of course it's always different this time -- just not different enough to justify the claim that it's different this time in any practical sense.

I see your scrying crystal is bringing in hints of next week's post!<br><br>Nestorian, your faith is of course your business. Still, I'd remind you of the millions of other Christians who have been led by spiritual pride in their own interpretation of scripture to ignore Jesus' positive statements that no one but the Father knows the timing of the Second Coming, and that it will be unheralded, "like a thief in the night." The acceptance of radical uncertainty to which Jesus called his followers, by teaching them to live in the awareness that judgment might come upon them at any moment, is very hard for the human ego to bear -- thus the flight to certainty that drives all attempts to fix a date, however approximate, for the Parousia. Thus I'd encourage you and all my Christian readers to reflect seriously before claiming even the most tentative knowledge of something that, according to Jesus, not even he knows. <br><br>Allan, sure, if you look for a reason to think that it's different this time, you can find one! Systems theory teaches, however, that a difference in scale does not equal a difference in kind, thus the mere fact that the civilization falling this time around happens to have some degree of vague control over most of the world doesn't mean that its fall will follow a different trajectory.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c1025604812642117435 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 3:35 PM</a><br><br>

Since what I'm proposing doesn't have mass appeal, or access to lots of money and resources, or any of the other things that can build a movement, it's going to be necessary to start from the most basic level -- that of the individual making his or her own choices -- and let things grow organically from there. <br><br>Robert, yes, I'm familiar with the neoprimitivist argument, as I'm sure you know. The difference between that ideology and what I'm proposing is of course a difference in values, and thus not something that can be settled in objective terms. I see logic, the scientific method, and many of the things that unfold from those as good things, and you seemingly don't -- though I'd be curious to know how much of that assessment is reflected in your lifestyle.

What happens is that service becomes irregular; you get brownouts and blackouts, and then power comes back on for a while; after a few years, you have power for a few hours a day, maybe, as rolling blackouts become regular events, and poor neighborhoods get cut off entirely; the number of neighborhoods with no power gradually increases, until finally it's only the rich, the government and the military that have any electricity at all. Given that process, unfolding over a period of several years, most people will figure out ways to adapt, and some will start generating small amounts of electricity on their own. Thus there's no "cliff" at all, just a ragged downward movement with intervals of stabilization mixed with periods of localized crisis -- that is to say, decline, the way it happens in the real world. <br><br>SLClaire, the reason that politicians didn't wait for the people to make up their minds is that the people are making up their minds in a way that's profoundly unwelcome to the medical industry -- the number of patient visits per year to alternative health care practitioners is already larger than the number of patient visits to mainstream practitioners, and growing. Obamacare is an attempt to deal with the fact that a growing number of people don't want mainstream medicine, and an even larger number can't afford it, by forcing them to pay for it anyway. Yes, it's going to be a real mess. <br><br>El Gaucho, thank you. I don't mind being the target of spluttering tirades -- it's a source of amusement, really, to see just how furious and irrelevant they get. <br><br>Unknown Jay, I remember when those studies first started coming out -- they made a very nice match with the earlier research on cognitive dissonance. Thanks for the link!<br><br>AlaBikeDr, that must have been a wonderful trip, and far more interesting than a golfing retirement!<br><br>Rita, funny!

I think about what the best options might be for my children and myself. I find that logic is incredibly useful as a tool in life in attempting to make decisions that align with my values and the reality of decline. It helps me when I'm annoyed by shleping water to the chicken in the heat and the stinkyness to know that logically, learning how to raise my own chickens is a good step in relocalizing my food systems and will, in a small way, lead to food security in my own region. <br><br>Logic isn't enough though, and it's not all I've got. As a Druid, a big part of my spirituality is honoring the Earth Mother. When I'm laboriously hauling chicken tractors to new pastures or weeding the garden in the heat and the mosquitos I fall back on my connection to the earth to support me. I don't do this stuff just because it's good for me, I do it because it's good for other species as well and because it is an offering to my Goddess.<br><br>It's really important for me to have a larger vision of the usefulness of my actions, other than an attempt to make the oil decline less bumpy. I think we all need to think about meaning in our lives and how we create that meaning so that we can create a vision that aligns with reality.<br><br>I don't think that green energy or zero point energy or any other nifty thing is going to save us from having to live much more thrifty lives. I see my parents struggling with how to retire, my family was forced into bankruptcy because of the burst housing bubble. This stuff has hit home in real, painful, ways. But knowing that I live my live aligned with my values the best I can brings me peace. When I am kept up at night wondering what sort of denuded world I'm going to leave to my children I fall back on my spirituality. <br><br>I think that so often we see religion connected to a lack of logic that we've become used to the idea that religious ideals can't have logic applied to them. In my experience, religion and logic can and do go together and enrich each other in real and meaningful ways.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c4223011090698446154 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 4:13 PM</a><br><br>

I'll consider it. I wouldn't say, though, that we're prisoners to historical forces -- there are always pressures, but they're always complex and contested, and history is full of situations in which people went and did something completely out of left field. The pressure of history is like wind -- if you know how to hoist a sail, you can get it to take you unexpected places. <br><br>Rakesprogress, well, there's no shortage of those coming down the pipe, so we may get there. <br><br>JP, with me it was the end of the appropriate tech era that did it. <br><br>Robo, couldn't have said it better myself. ;-)<br><br>Steve, thank you for the link. Yes, Goethe's a good teacher here. <br><br>Realguy, it's been a long time since I posted my <a href=../../2009/02/deindustrial-reading-list.html rel=nofollow>deindustrial reading list</a>, hasn't it? I'll do some thinking, and consider a future post on what a good bookshelf for the Long Descent might be. <br><br>John, the point you're missing is that collapse isn't a lifetime away. It's happening right now. For the people who are losing their jobs and their homes to economic contraction, and will never get either one of them back, the industrial world is ending. As each year gives way to the next, more people will experience that, and even those who are still employed and housed will have to get by with fewer options, a collapsing infrastructure, and all the other consequences of slow collapse. Look around you -- this is what a collapsing society looks like; imagine it getting worse, and worse, and worse, at the same relatively slow pace, year after year from now on, with local and regional crises spicing things up here and there, and you've got a fair image of your future. <br><br>Matthew, good. Of course there's always the question of finding the best equivalents. As for "it's different this time," that's also a claim that needs to face up to the two questions I've suggested. It's a phrase that gets used very, very often; how well has it worked as a means of prediction? <br><br>Lee, artificial intelligence, like fusion power, is one of those revolutions that's been twenty years in the future since before I was born. Try to point this out to believers in either one, and you'll get exactly the same reaction you got; nonetheless, they're shoveling smoke. As for comparable predictions, earlier claims about how soon artificial intelligence research would reach whatever milestone happens to be popular are a good place to start.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c3092808744194177208 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 4:28 PM</a><br><br>

I'd point out that most human societies have been much more stable, and much less prone to booms and busts, than ours; as I discussed some years ago, American society is the equivalent of a weed species, and can expect to be outcompeted in the normal course of succession by a future society better suited to deal with more restricted resource use. <br><br>Pedro, thanks for the update! When the bureaucrats in Brussels start to insist that elections not be held because it would be inconvenient for the market, it's becoming hard to miss what the EU is actually all about. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, marvelous -- thank you for the heads up!<br><br>Jon, thanks for the link. I'm waiting to see how many poor and working class towns and neighborhoods that got leveled by Sandy never get rebuilt at all -- my guess is that there'll be quite a few. <br><br>Andy, nearly all salmon return to spawn to the streams where they were hatched. A very small minority of each species of salmon don't -- they find some other stream, which is how salmon expand their range, and how they repopulated newly ice-free river systems at the end of the last ice age. So, yes, it's a parable that works. <br><br>Agent, I write about what I want to write about, and right now, that's the religious dimension of the end of the age of oil. I've written at quite some length about the other issues you've named, and will write about them again, but to my mind, the way that progress has been turned into a surrogate religion, and the need to find new ways of thinking about history and destiny now that progress is over, is a major issue and needs discussion. <br><br>Orc, granted -- but it's important to start with reason, or at least to check your feelings against the yardstick of logic and science, rather than clinging to some emotionally compelling belief about the future even when it's repeatedly disproved. <br><br>Ganv, well put.

I have been wandering around fairly stunned reflecting on my previous smug certainty that each new Kunstler post was the herald of the Apocalypse, or that the Steve Keene and Nicole Voss have cracked the code and proved that we will inevitably plunge into an endless economic depression.<br><br>There will be clearly be a messy and protracted period of change (varying by location and time) which will involve the human population becoming much smaller via combinations of famine, disease, war and demographic transition (e.g. Japan)). No doubt many technologies that we take for granted will become luxuries and then eventually myths.<br><br>I expect rising sea levels and increased frequency of extreme weather to contribute to the chaos while also acknowledging that over much longer time frames negative feedback loops have been shown to counteract these effects.<br><br>This leaves me with a dilemma: this society is not going to progress indefinitely, and things will possibly get messy where I live, but it may also be possible to continue living like I do for the rest of my life - changing may be ethical but what does that really mean: is it unethical for yeast to consume sugar? Maybe the wise move is to try and learn some new skills while also doubling down on this foolish credit driven unsustainable lifestyle and gambling that I can get out with some free-hold land before the s hits the f.....<br><br>Similarly, since 99% of species eventually become extinct, looking at the big picture, why should I care particularly about extinction of the panda or Maui's dolphin other than the fact that I find them beautiful creatures: a very arbitrary judgement that denies the long tern biological reality of extinction. <br><br>I guess my point is that the inertia you describe as a response to the religions of progress and apocalypse could easily be generated by acceptance of a Spenglerian decline: of course the response will be mediated by individual and group psychology: some Christians respond to the coming Rapture by desperately trying to convert people and save their souls while others smugly gloat at the coming suffering of the unbelievers.<br><br>I am sure that adopting a religious/spiritual practice would be a way to make useful sense of the Spenglerian dilemma as well as sensible for many other reasons and I look forward to the next post. Seems that to construct a useful world view we need to think about what our obligations are as humans to ourselves, each other and to the future, decide what we value and why: basic ethical theory and the justification of a system of thought seem like they could be on the agenda.<br><br>Thanks again.<br><br><br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c1304956476719821148 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 4:57 PM</a><br><br>

My diet is neither complex nor rewarding by modern standards and pleasure isn’t a big part of eating. It’s a bit ascetic in a way, because once you cast away modern foods, you can enjoy your simple diet high in fat and protein without comparing it too donuts, ice cream and any number of modern franken-foods. My health has been mind-bendingly better after exploring primitive cultures and lifestyles and their dietary practice. I have also incorporated into fitness, exercise and my values. I value relationships, knowledge and personal improvement more than money or other more visceral goals. I love to spend time outdoors and simplify my life fishing, hiking and kayaking as much as I can. It has turned my life from depressing, sad with soulless values on money and status into rewarding, exciting and happy life based upon more “human” values.<br><br>The inherent hippocracy of Neo-primivitism, is that it is impossible to really reinvent the hunter gather lifestyle as most ecosystems were compromised by agriculture long ago. Of course some hunter gather cultures still exist on some of the most marginal lands on earth. Hunter gatherers even went through a rise and fall phase as the migration of bands of homo erectus out of Africa began to hunt and burn away megafauna ecosystems, ending with anatomically modern humans like the Maori, killing the last Moa in New Zealand.

You don’t have to convince people to believe everything you believe. In the same way that it’s not what you say but what you do, it’s not what others believe but how they act. That is, people don’t have to accept every aspect of JMG’s narrative to do what we want them to do: consume less, prepare themselves and their children / family / community for a lower-energy future, etc. etc. Focus on the practical, be an example / resource for others but avoid preaching at all costs.<br><br>--Do not express things in certainties, put them as questions. Remind yourself that the long descent is a theory (or it’s a hypothesis I suppose), probably as good as any we have, but talking about it as inevitable or established fact can put people off. Instead of declaring that ‘Progress is over’, how about ‘Have you considered that progress may not go on forever?’, and so on. Don’t try to convince anybody that you know the future, just encourage them to question their assumptions and work it out for themselves. <br><br>Many people are ready to listen, but many more are not, and for these it probably doesn’t matter what you say or how you say it so don’t bang your head against a wall, focus your energies elsewhere.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c493779496068984307 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 8:47 PM</a><br><br>

In my experience, people do focus on the good bits and try to block out the bad bits. Even though a stair-step decline is effective collapse for each group that falls off at each step, I'm sure most people would try to think positively, that they and their descendants will at least be on each step down or maybe even maintain the standard of living that they equate with quality of living. I think that, for most people in developed nations, and increasing numbers of people in developing nations, the idea of a simpler life lived within the limits of the planet is not particularly appealing (though it is to me). Also, the longer collapse takes the longer people can continue to believe that <i>someone will think of something</i> and make it all better. For as long as that belief persists, it would seem to make sense to carry on <i>as normal</i>, as much as one is able to.<br><br>So I wonder if the idea of a long decline is as likely to instil a sense of not having to change behaviours as the idea of near term human extinction is. The idea of a fairly rapid (decades) decline to a very different world seems more likely to instil that idea of change. Of course, only one of these projections on the future will turn out to be real (or maybe some modification of one of them) but this is more a question of which projection, or narrative, will get the most bang for the buck?<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c8438143581713215042 title="comment permalink">7/11/13, 10:55 PM</a><br><br>

You're grappling with the moral issues, which are crucial. One thing, though -- your chances of continuing to live the life you're living right now for decades to come are fairly small; things don't have to fall apart completely overnight to decline far and fast over the course of a lifetime, or even a decade or two. <br><br>Robert, nah, that's the wrong question. Logic and the scientific method are worth saving, to my mind, for the same reason that an ecosystem is worth saving: they're the product of intricate interactions among natural systems -- human beings and their cultures are also natural systems -- and have beauty and meaning in their own right. The fact that they can also be extremely useful for clearing away shoddy thinking, learning about the world, and providing practical benefits is lagniappe. (By the way, I think the word you want is "hypocrisy;" "hippocracy" would be government by horses.) <br><br>Richard, true enough. <br><br>Leo, no argument -- my focus on whole systems is simply a way to avoid overemphasis on any of their parts. As for capitalism, to my mind the problem there is the huge mismatch between theory and practice -- which of course is also the problem with communism. <br><br>Bill, okay, you got me. What's the play? <br><br>Rcg1950, as I commented in <a href=../../2011/09/clarkes-fallacy.html rel=nofollow>post a while back</a>, it's ironic that the kind of thinking you're talking about is termed "magical thinking," in that no self-respecting sorcerer would ever be caught engaging in such nonsense!<br><br>Bob, a lot of people thought the same thing about young men in Europe in the 1920s. You'll notice what followed. <br><br>KL, thank you! <br><br>Joseph, ah, I see the misunderstanding. I wasn't clear on what you were referring to in terms of "boom and bust" -- and the rise and fall of most civilizations tends to be more sedate than that phrase might suggest. America being what it is, its rise was steep and its fall will likely be at least as steep; the broader arc of industrial civilization is slower, though in its own way as spectacular; compare them to the rise and fall of Chinese dynasties, say, and it's less boom and bust and more, as the saying has it, the tramp of mailed boots marching up a stairway, followed by the whisper of silk slippers descending it.

In personal interactions, I rarely bring up the subject unless the other person mentions it first, or shows a readiness to discuss it. Here on my blog, and in my books, it's necessary to be definite to the point of becoming confrontational, as I've learned that anything less forceful gets redefined by the listeners in terms of whatever more popular mythology they prefer -- but in person, that doesn't work. <br><br>Wiseman, I'll consider that. The problem is that people want it all one way or all the other -- either it's got to be wonderful, or we all get devoured by zombies or something.

We've been more or less at that plateau since the oil crisis of 1973 was resolved. The upward trend of prices is caused by demand continuing to rise even as production remains more or less constant (far more constant than it was before the 1973 crisis). It is for this reason I tend to see the 1973 crisis as the economic peak of oil, and the point where we passed peak production relative to demand.<br><br>The way I make sense of it is that oil discovery peaked in the 1960's and as discovery was starting to go down, the reality that oil is a finite resource sank in, resulting in oil producers deciding that maybe pumping oil out as fast as they could was not so smart after all. This lead to the more or less stable production we have seen since. Additionally oil as political power was brought to bear in 1973, and this again counselled conservation rather than pumping as fast as demand required (the pre-73 model). Of course reserves went on to peak in 1981-1892, but they would have peaked earlier without the 1973 crisis.<br><br>So from my perspective, from a supply over demand perspective I think I was born a few years after we hit the most important peak of all.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c1806743552812540637 title="comment permalink">7/12/13, 12:27 AM</a><br><br>

If we go to Mars, it will not provide riches for the Earth. Living on Mars will be extremely difficult. The only thing of true value that Mars will produce is Martians.

(Not to pick just on Kunstler; obviously, as you state, it's an ultra-common viewpoint.) Likewise, when I read emotion-driven online comments like "We're living in a police state now!!" I have to roll my eyes. First sign you're not living in a police state? When you can express your view that you're living in a police state (or otherwise criticize your government) without any fear whatsoever of punishment.<br><br>Considering we just <i>had</i> a few years ago a real-world example of how governments and society deal with the onset of a truly major crisis--the financial collapse of 2008, which, no matter how much smoke and how many mirrors have gone into creating a recovery period, did not mark the end of the world as we know it--it amazes me that people still think we're going to wake up one morning and find ourselves in an apocalyptic horror film.

I think that past behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour. So what happened when prior civilizations decayed and collapsed? <br><br>The way I see it, the big kahuna of civilizational decline for us in the western world was the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Documentary sources from that era are pretty sketchy. So much lost in the sands of time.<br><br>But look at the modern map of Europe. What I see, at least in the form of national boundaries, are shadows of pre Roman ethnic and tribal identity. Iberian, Celt, Latin, Greek, German and even some pre Indo European ie Basque areas of Spain and Tuscany in Italy. Speaking of Italy, what I see in the regional boundaries - for example Lazio, Tuscany, Umbria - are the pre Roman tribal territories there too.<br><br>I think this applies to some extent to the USA. I know what people are saying: it's different. And, no doubt, in a multitude of ways, it is. <br><br>But let's have a peek at what bedevils the US. You have down there, to borrow a phrase, two nations warring in the bosom of a single state. The antagonists on either side of the Mason Dixon Line despise one another, American politics reconfigured a generation ago to reflect that most basic division. <br><br>Institutional paralysis? You bet, but IMO it isn't inherent in the design of the institutions. Someone said that political affiliation is the new ethnicity. OK, but in my estimation, North vs South ethnic identity is at the root of your political affiliation. And at the root of the USA's rancourous politics.<br><br>Where am I going with this? Mainly that these two old societies and the line that divides them geographically will provide the template for the successor states to the USA just like the old tribes did for post-Roman Europe. American civilizational decline, like that of the western Roman Empire, will be accompanied by political fracture. And the North/South boundary will be the main fracture line. The coming political configuration had its seeds planted by the settlers that founded the two American nations. And these seeds were nurtured by centuries of animosities that still play themselves out with increasing intensity in American politics. <br><br>You had one dust up in the 1860s over secession. Maybe history doesn't repeat exactly but, I think as Mark Twain said, it sure does rhyme. Another thing, it's not like you can't all get along. It's more like you all don't want to. <br><br>Oh, wait, there's demographic change? Increasing Hispanization of the Old South? Demographic doom for one side? I wouldn't bet on it. The United States is an assimilationist machine and the founder effect a powerful one. Or rather you have TWO assimilationist machines. One based in the states and identity of the Old Confederacy. And it's not at all that obvious to me as an outsider that Hispanics are a natural constituency of a "progressive" Democratic party. <br><br>When, not if, the split happens and the trumpets sound and the new national flags are saluted, I wonder what will be the prevailing mood? Triumphalism? Relief? Regret? <br><br>I wonder if there's an event horizon past which there is no way but down into the black hole of dissolution. What was the event horizon for the Roman Empire, the 410 AD sack of Rome? 476 AD? I wonder if people at the time were aware of it. Or maybe it was visible only in retrospect. The sack by Alaric in 410 must have been a shock though. Eight centuries since something like it. Imagine swaggering Nazi conquerors on the streets of London ie nine centuries since the last time in 1066. <br><br>I read somewhere that the Roman Senate continued to meet until the year 603 AD. I wonder what that last meeting was like. What did they talk about? Were they aware that it would be the last? Can you imagine the last meeting of the US Senate? <br><br>Will the USA continue to exist a thousand years from now? Will it be in some geographically truncated form?

Such comments stink of magic to me."<br><br>It would work if a country was self sufficient in all its goods, services and/or energy. But is your country? How is that balance of trade going?<br><br>The reason behind the federal reserves recent announcement that, they are considering reducing or abandoning quantitative easing is that they fear inflation. It is a real concern as your country imports a bucket load of energy and it is asking other countries to accept those fiat tokens. Not to forget the goods and services it imports too?<br><br>Before saying it is different this time because, blah, blah, blah, I recommend that you check your facts on the ground as this theory has been attempted before historically and it didn't end up well.

Keeping fear alive helps us remember all the skills needed and stories of goddesses, gods, hidden and visible helped weave the story of remembrance. Perhaps that is the reason dooms day predictions have remained popular, they enliven fear for memories sake. But our time and need for memories or gods and the stories are changing and to survive now is to forget as much as to remember. Forget fear, and shame and blame. Remember the moment now so you can be in the moment when change is demanded. Releasing those layers of tangled and garbled memory changes everything and eases one to see what is going on outside minus ghostly inner projections obscuring the what is now.

I think they might actually flourish when adapting to a world where that model is increasingly inappropriate.<br><br>Judging from previous collapses – Social Progress, not so much.<br><br>So I just don’t think you can say that “Progress” will start, stop or anything else, because to calculate whether it was or not would require putting together some kind of a combination of all the possible areas of progress.

It's not hard and people get it.

Hours of work expected. Difficulty of finding long term employment. Such and such you know is facing retrenchment. etc. etc.<br>- quality of produced goods. What more needs be said on the matter?<br>- quality of relationships and connections within the community?<br>- the cost of energy. Isn't this rising all over the shop? How much did you last pay for litre / gallon of petrol (gas I think you call it)?<br><br>It's not hard, just avoid the big future predictions which are unverifiable and you can then shoot anyone down.

The designs used before the 1960s made it possible for a chassis to go hot if there was a short. This can kill. (It will be a long time before I dare apply power even to the Comanche. Initial smoke test is perhaps best done by using a variac - sez a radio bud - dialing up the rms line-cord-mains-plug potential very slowly from 0 V to 120 V, looking for trouble at each step.) <br><br>(2) Most people find it impossible to erect a horizontal ant high above the soil. If horiztal ant is close to soil (2 m, 3 m, 5 m), you beam much of your signal straight up, and so you are liable to do poorly in transcontinental or transoceanic. It turns out a solution (which I have yet to implement, even for the poor DX-300) is to hang a vertical ant. <br><br>There is some discussion of this, and of other not-obvious ant points, in an obscure old book, Robert M. Myers's <i>Practical Antennas for the Radio Amateur</i> (Milford, CT: SCELBI Publications, 1979). <br><br>Myers can usefully be used not only along with the big fat ARRL current ant book but ALSO with a slim, clever, ARRL book, Al Broddon's <i>Low Profile Amateur Radio: Operating a Ham Station from Almost Anywhere</i> (2006 or 2009). <br><br>(3) What is lacking in the best-receiver-of-all-time, the R-390A (<a href=http://www.r-390a.net/ rel=nofollow>r-390a.net</a>)?

Inter-ethnic American difference/animosity is also only one factor. There are others. You've got the problem of sheer size and by that I mean a continent-sized country, country-sized states and a really big population. Arguably too big administratively to govern from one national capitol. <br><br>Also, with energy getting more and more expensive, transportation will become a problem. If you buy into the idea that a country is a free trade zone within its own boundaries then you have to wonder whether changing trade patterns within the US (because of the cost of transport) will by itself carve up the country into separate trade zones. I would imagine that this will be a North America wide process. <br><br>Then there's basic scarcity. North of your border you have a country where people think they can sit militarily defence-less with a treasure chest of resources on what is arguably the world's richest land area and remain unmolested. Oodles of fresh water, good farm-land, wide open spaces. This in a world of 7 billion aggressive, resource hungry people. The present owners think they have no enemies but I suspect that the wait to find out otherwise won't be a long one. Amazing how people don't learn the lessons of history even when the events in question are plentiful and recent. Anyway, I think that the re-configuration of boundaries will extend northwards. <br><br>Regarding the lessons of history, I've read that post Roman Europeans withdrew into their castles and for a millenium fought for their lives against invading Magyar, Moor, Turk and Viking. And against each another. I've read that, after the 2nd millennium BC collapse of civilization in the eastern Mediterranean, trade dried up, people abandoned coastal cities (trade being the cities' raison d'etre) and fled to inland hilltop forts. Biblical narratives talk about movement of people like the exodus from Egypt. But out of this mayhem came new ethnicities - Jews being one. <br><br>Where I'm going with this is to make two points. The re-drawing of borders won't be pretty (migrations, attendant massacres, land grabs galore) and new peoples will come out of the wreck of the old civilization, the old ethnicities at least in part forming the basis. <br><br>Up north you've had for centuries French vs English, East vs West, the mutual disdain resulting in resource squabbles, fractious debates on constitutional arrangements, referenda on secession and not only that boring stuff but bombings, kidnappings, murder and the imposition of martial law. Small potatoes in a world of much bigger troubles but maybe a small taste of what's to come.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c8819631656320955376 title="comment permalink">7/13/13, 10:26 AM</a><br><br>

Myself, I'm delighted to see how much traction the very unpopular ideas I'm discussing have gotten already. <br><br>Dwig, that's a workable typology. I'll be dividing things up a little differently in the posts ahead, but abstract models aren't true, merely useful, and thus can be exchanged with other abstract models where that's more helpful. <br><br>Phil, I'm not surprised to hear it. The wealthy and powerful in Britain have got to know that when the US goes down, their goose is not merely cooked, it's incinerated to white ash -- thus the cheerleading for US empire that pops up so often in the British press. <br><br>Stephen, no problem. I'll be discussing that in more detail in next week's post. <br><br>Joseph, granted, and that's also something I'll be discussing shortly. <br><br>Cherokee, thank you. Unfortunately the obfuscation continues at top volume. You might have a look at Resilience.org, where this post got the usual flurry of foam-flecked denunciations, all of which sedulously avoided any reference to the point of the post -- the way that recycling repeatedly failed predictions has helped to gut the peak oil movement. Sometimes it's a long road to walk...<br><br>Toomas, surface-mount can be done fairly easily if you're willing to invest in a bit of hardware, but you're right that it's far from the best option. This is one of the reasons I encourage people to look for boatanchor rigs like your Heathkits -- taking all appropriate safety measures, of course! -- or simply learning to homebrew their own rigs, focusing on QRP (low power) technologies, which are going to be much more viable than legal-limit gear as power starts becoming expensive and intermittent. <br><br>Roger, I'd encourage you to find and read some good histories of the collapse of the Roman world and the Dark Ages -- the process was much more complex, and had a lot of regional variations. That said, your broader point stands, especially about Canada -- there are a number of countries that have come to rely so completely on US muscle to guarantee their security that they're going to be facing a world of hurt when the US empire comes apart, and Canada's the poster child. Either our northern neighbors are going to have to bite the bullet and accept some very bitter transformations, or they're going to become someone else's property in short order.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c6039832737740009387 title="comment permalink">7/13/13, 11:34 AM</a><br><br>

Isn't this real world inflation? It may not form part of the official statistical definition, but give someone an indicator and they will attempt to game it!

This is a feel good thing only (perhaps also a vote buying thing too)? Those loose US lending practices have been reported on here and I gave a link to an article on them a few weeks back.

It is his account of a lifetime's worth of study of how we form judgements and make decisions. In a chapter in which he demolishes the idea that finance managers have any ability to predict how stocks will perform, he mentions the concept of "hedgehog" thinking and "fox" thinking. <br><br>Hedgehogs have a set world view and believe "one big thing," which they are very defensive of and inhibits them from incorporating other or new evidence. (As in conspiracy theories, for example?) This could be an example of people who refuse to consider the reality of the long descent. Apocalypse,the rapture, and space walruses after all, are each one big thing. :)<br><br>Foxes, "are complex thinkers. They don't believe that one big thing drives the march of history." Rather they understand that there are multifarious forces, elements, players, which can produce unpredictable outcomes.

The resource issues are always there in one form or another: external stressors. Influenza viruses, pneumonia bacteria, a bad winter, a thin harvest, a rainy day. The human body in its prime experiences all these things and simply shakes them off. But the human body in its infancy or senescence cannot resist these stressors, and dies.<br><br>That's not to say that a massive trauma composed of all these stressors (and more) at once can't bring down an individual. But most old people succumb to pneumonia, which is everywhere and doesn't bother the rest of us.<br><br>I think this is at the root of the locked horns between the technology optimists and the doomers: they are both right, and they are both wrong. The critical question is: where is our current global civilization, or any subcivilization (like US Americanism) on the senescence scale?<br><br>If the US were in its prime empire-building days, all the hardships of global warming, peak oil, etc., would be speed bumps. Taken together, they <i>might</i> be enough to kill us, anyway. But we would adapt rapidly, creatively, and even enthusiastically to each of these hardships, and come out the far end with a nation strong and proud. In this scenario, the technology optimists are right, the doomers are wrong. All we need is a shot of technological antibiotic to get us through the worst night of fever, and we'll be fine.<br><br>If the US is, in fact, in its senescence, the problem is that all the technology in the world won't save us. We don't have the adaptive resilience to make proper use of it. In this scenario, the doomers are right, and the technology optimists are wrong. Every shot of technological antibiotic only weakens us further, and at best puts off the imminent and inevitable by a very short while.<br><br>It's a somewhat extreme comparison in that individual death describes a rapid phase change from living to dead, while (most) civilizations linger long past their point of collapse. But the point is that something like peak oil can be either a minor speed bump or a killer, depending on the general state of the civilization experiencing it.<br><br>Would you concur?<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c527608432601474460 title="comment permalink">7/14/13, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>

I really do. Like I have said earlier, I am mostly pragmatic with my opinions. Main thesis of my thinking is not easy to translate into foreign language, me being no poetical philosopher even in my own language, but I give it a try:<br><br>Problems are mounting right now in this shared world of ours. Things are escalating. There has been MANY moments when powers-behind-the-throne could have hit the brake pedal and offer their subjects peaceful, if materially poor path to the future. That 70's environmental movement was one of them, at least if you believe JMG. I have decided to trust him in this, even if my own knowledge about that time is limited to being small toddler. <br><br>Second moment was during early phase of current financial crisis, 2007-8. Iceland, being early victim, did what states should have done. They defaulted and continued their national existence being poorer in assets and money, but their system of government and rule by law totally intact.<br><br>Rest of the world chose otherwise. USA, EU and rising tigers of the East all chose way of smoke-and-mirrors. They try to conjure us out from what is basically resource limitations crisis by bunch of magic tricks. As side result, media, politics and general discourse are growing more delusional month by month.<br><br>Because nobody (except Iceland) is willing to cut losses, things are escalating out of control. Answers of MODERN morality and MODERN political systems to the crisis have been laughable and despicable at the same time. They practically try to bend reality, and hope some miracle solution to drop from the sky.. That is religious thinking for you folks. <br><br>I have some knowledge how things unfolded in Balkans during 90's. I cannot say I have any experience comparable to that of locals, and I respect their losses and suffering - impartially. But I know dimly and distantly, like foreigners always do, how purgatory of ethnic hate looks like when flames are ignited. Because our leaders have chosen road of illusions and magic tricks, forthcoming economic collapse shall lead to very unpleasant bloodshed in large parts of the modern world. It is because the fall and break-up of economic networks shall be sudden and fast, instead controlled one, thanks to current politics.<br><br>Rapes, tortures, unspeakable cruelty towards prisoners by paramilitaries, ethnic cleansing... It is coming to West, after being absent so long. I do not hope this. I do not fantasize about that. But I fear that political decisions world leaders are making right now are driving towards war. War that is going to look like that in Yugoslavia, or in failed African states... Northern Ireland is kind of "light" version showing us it can happen in the West also. War fought mainly by civilian paramilitaries and thugs in uniforms..."security" war.<br><br>I just hope very strict and uncompromising religious communities can defend themselves and maintain at the same time high level of morality during forthcoming problems. Punishing and hard morality is better choice than instincts of the beast. Only pampered Westerners have had privilege to forget this simple fact. Moral code, even fundamentalist and opressive one, protects mainly those who are weak. Strong ones, they survive anyway, feasting on those who are at their mercy... I just see no future in any these modern beliefs like feminism, which are only empty phrases when real problems start.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c6246054834475280652 title="comment permalink">7/14/13, 9:27 AM</a><br><br>

I'm of the opinion that serious conflicts between powerful states will remain few and far between while the world's militaries are oil-dependent. The one relatively clear-cut example of a resource war in recent times involving powerful states, the Iraq War, was a disaster from the perspective of securing oil reserves. The resources expended by the US and UK militaries far exceeded any resources gained by the occupation, despite the fact that the resistance was vastly inferior from a purely military perspective.<br><br>My best guess is that militaries, and the use thereof, in the late oil age will simply cause more rapid catabolic collapse to the countries trying to use them. The US is of course the best example here - spending nearly 50% of the world's total military expenditures is substantially weakening our fiscal position and accelerating the coming debt crisis.<br><br>This isn't to say that I think there won't be substantial military conflict, but I suspect it will be largely powerful states vs. non-state actors. I could easily imagine insurgencies developing in the more rural areas of the US, particularly the Rockies and Appalachians, after another economic crisis or two. Further guerrilla campaigns could develop in poor urban areas. If this were to happen, it would ramp up spending on the military and surveillance even further than present trends indicate, leading to accelerated fiscal crises.<br><br>But a successful military invasion of Australia or Canada by, say, China? I very seriously doubt that could occur in the next ~50 years. A more likely scenario would be proxy war in Africa that spirals out of control, similar to what occurred in your "How It Could Happen" series.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c7182886451934570352 title="comment permalink">7/14/13, 11:34 AM</a><br><br>

Portions of New Jersey, having reconstructed after Sandy to a sufficient degree to be eager to invite tourists, have been running an ad campaign that includes a cheerful chorus singing: "We're stronger than the storrrrrrrm, stronger than the storm..."<br><br>The first time my wife and I heard this, I blurted out, "You idiots, don't taunt the storm!" And my wife -- who is as strict a rationalist and atheist as you will ever meet -- immediately agreed with me.<br><br>The challenge is explaining why "taunting the storm" (or, hubris in general) is a bad idea. For her and me it has nothing to do with believing that some angry sentient storm or storm-deity or astral karma computer might hear the boast and retaliate (which is why my wife's rational atheist sensibilities were not in opposition). The reasons it's a bad idea are far more varied and subtle than that, but are based on real-world causality and consequences, including unnecessarily raising future expectations (so as to have raised the stakes before the fact, thus increasing the emotional damage, in the event the future does not go as hoped for), and distorting future decision making by declaring an obvious untruth or at best equivocated truth (obviously, we are not actually stronger than a storm in many important respects) as a guiding principle.<br><br>Is it simply too hard to explain this? Must the architects of future spiritual systems in troubled times eventually throw up their hands and tell the world, "It's because Zan-Dee the jealous Hurricane Goddess will smite you," just like in ancient Greek myths?<br><br>I hope there's a better alternative.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c1488319972681483434 title="comment permalink">7/14/13, 12:39 PM</a><br><br>

There's always a hint, or more than a hint, that some people would be quite happy to see the defeat of those and similar ideas. No doubt they'll deny it but I never thought so many people longed for the Long Descent to bring them back to some imaginary golden age of the traditional family, strong moral fibre and strong men. <br><br>I realized it reminds me of Gibbons who blamed the fall of Rome on moral decay, I think. It's the idea that people, well men, got soft and pampered in the easy times and so couldn't compete with those tough barbarians. A nice simple story of the strong feasting on the weak 19th century Darwinian style. Then the Long Descent serves as a redemption story where humanity gets back to being morally strong and virtuous again having cleansed out all the weaklings and put women back in their proper place. I guess that might become a popular story in future, especially among those who imagine themselves to be among the strong. Ironic that these strong men have to rely on the collapse of our civilization to defeat us weaklings.

It seemed worth trying one more approach -- however Lovecraftian it might seem! <br><br>Russell, a good case can be made that we're coming up on a global conflict of some form, but unless the people in charge are unusually dense even by the standards of politicians, I don't expect to see nuclear weapons used more than peripherally, for reasons discussed in <a href=../../2012/11/deterrence-in-age-of-decline.html rel=nofollow>an earlier post</a>. That said, I hope I'm right...<br><br>Eremon, many thanks! I've got a contract for a novel based on the "How It Could Happen" series, so this sort of info is extremely helpful. <br><br>Onething, I disagree. Many of the people who claimed knowledge of the imminence of the Parousia over the last two thousand years had other ways of making sense of the verses Nestorian cited -- for example, it was once very common to assume that the return of the Jews to Israel would happen in the course of the Last Days, rather than as a precondition for them. Those interpretations are by no means prima facie absurd, and many of the scriptural arguments used to justify earlier dates for the Second Coming were extremely thorough and subtle -- they just happened to be wrong. Still, the temptation to go around shouting "Lo, here" and "Lo, there" is a powerful one. <br><br>Zach, excellent. <br><br>Adrian, my immediate response, of course, is to ask, what's the third category? Druids are like that...<br><br>Repent, thanks for the link!<br><br>Joseph, I'm going to offer slightly different names for your two modes of decline, for the sake of clarity. The first is ecological overshoot -- the process by which human activities in the biosphere run up against hard limits to resource availability, on the one hand, and capacity to absorb wastes, on the other. The second is imperial senescence, the process by which empires run their wealth pumps too hard for too long, and bankrupt themselves and their subject nations. Here in the US, we're getting clobbered by both of those at once, but they're separate processes, even though both of them have the same overall effect of weakening a society so that its ability to respond to normal crises breaks down. <br><br>That said, it's not true that the US could have brushed aside peak oil or global warming in its prime empire-building days, because its prime depended on access to the abundant resources (including oil) and ample capacity of the biosphere to absorb wastes (including CO2) that it had at that time. Peak oil and climate change aren't external factors that just happen to be hitting us now; they're feedback loops generated by our own activities, in exactly the same way as the processes of imperial decline and fall. Thus it's important to see them as part of the whole system of decline, not as externals impacting a system declining for other reasons.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c1422350312396409513 title="comment permalink">7/14/13, 4:59 PM</a><br><br>

It's still recovering from the housing bubble that set off the financial recession back in '06 or '07, although it is true that there's a lot of investment money going into buying up houses, depending on the specific market. It seems to be dying down now, though. If you want to keep a good watch on the US economy, I can recommend http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/ , he's all charts and relatively little comment. Some government, some private. He does have decent commentary on the jobs situation as well.<br><br>People falling off the unemployment rolls is a significant problem, but it's not the whole story. Yes, there's a recovery in progress. It's a slow grind. Sometimes I think that it's being controlled as much by demand destruction for petroleum as anything else.<br><br>@Adrian AF.

It is good to have equal relations inside your own community. About feminism... I have seen many so called feminist activists fighting over some semantics how university professors should adress them, and over stuff like that. It is like they are fighting overtly zealous purity campaign inside hermetically sealed community, which is already altruistic, equal and safe for them. People who actually work where women have worse position... They as a norm do not adhere to feminist narrative. To humanist narrative, yes. <br><br>To me it seems that many "sacred cows" of Western intelligentsia have metamorphosed during last decades into something they were not supposed to be... They are like decadent and cartoon versions of noble ideas from earlier times.<br><br>Feminism is by no means only one of these, but it´s decay from movement for equality and justice to this supremacist idiocy confined strictly to those already affluent and privileged (universities, colleges, middle class whites)is just so obvious anyone outside those circles... It serves as good example of wider trend, nothing more. <br><br>And JMG, I have to confess I am little confused what should be right path onwards... I have many strictly religious relatives, their church communities are doing amazing job helping each other, and I just feel they are calling me back home... Me and my circle around, we are just so disappointed how this sosio-political system to which we belong is totally unable to make even small corrective movements. It is not like everyone should have same opinions, but contraction of economy should be obvious to adherents of all political creeds... Some scaling down is unavoidable, but our leaders just accelerate speed. "Let´s print some money, it helped last time around! 0r it didn't, but let's try it anyway."... Similarity to Soviet bloc, when their political class chose to close their eyes to lethargic and shrinking economy after Russian oil revenues dropped during 70's is so obvious... And again, I have seen what kind of damage that inactivity did to lives of peasant class... What should be our safe haven, if not strong community, adhering to ancestral faith..?<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c8003664321355424239 title="comment permalink">7/14/13, 11:16 PM</a><br><br>

It often gets used as a justification for all sort of odd behaviours so I'm not sure it actually means what its original definition was. <br><br>As a suggestion, I'd probably avoid using it.<br><br>Perhaps you are speaking about gender roles in society? Historically they were much more diverse prior to the industrial revolution. They became very narrow at this point in history. People often use this recent history as a guide to gender roles, but I believe this to be a very poor guide.<br><br>If you look at the birds and animals in the forest, it is only the very young that get any support. This is probably indicative of the needs of a sustainable society. Yes, their lives can be rough, but I don’t see domination as a central core problem in male / female relationships in those birds and animals. <br><br>The meme of domination by males in society is probably a reflection of (anger? resentment?) due to the loss of land (read territory) that has been accelerating since the industrial revolution as inequality in wealth rises and access to land is reduced. It is a wealth pump after all.<br><br>Essentially, the industrial revolution has had a subtext of destroying previous cultures and replacing them with new cultures.

Well, it looks like I may be starting my own rocky ride to join their ranks.<br><br>I happen to be a physician in a small private practice, only 4-5 years into my profession as a rehab medicine doc; I'd often patted myself on the back for having made a bold and savvy career change when I started medical school at age 40. I'm 54 now, and my decision isn't looking so good anymore.<br><br>Lately, I've seen insurance companies increasingly deny authorization for admission to inpatient physical rehabilitation after stroke, joint-replacements, spinal-cord injury, critical illness, etc... These patients are being frequently shunted to nursing homes instead. Of course the hospital wants the rehab unit full for financial reasons, but this year, our average inpatient census has been below the break-even point. And even when we get an admission authorized, it is no longer sufficient for the patient to have rehabilitation needs and achievable rehab goals, I have to document that the pateint has medical needs that CANNOT be safely met in a nursing home. If I don't state such, the admission won't be authorized. This requirement is imposed, and not intrinsically necessary for us to rehab a patient, so the truth needs to be teased and stretched, otherwise: no admission. I have little doubt these statements will turn around and bite down the line. Recently the hospital CEO called our rehab nurse manager (!) to ask why our census has been so low. We're being monitored. The hospital does not need the rehab unit. Many inpatient rehab units across the US (22% of them in the midwest) have closed, basically for financial resaons. <br><br>The situation for outpatient care is worse. This year CMS (the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services) reduced re-imbursements for the electrical procedures I frequently perform to diagnose nerve injury or disease. The reductions amount to a 50-65% decrease from my previous reimbursements. These reduced rates have been adopted by ALL insurers, and apply to all physicians who perform these procedures. Since regular office visits already reimburse poorly, my clinic has long depended on the electrodiagnostic procedures as the main source of income. Now my take-home pay is 50% down, and every month is a cliff-hanger. Then there is the sequester, docking our medicare reimbursements by 2.5%, increased rates of claim-closure by the state-administered Workers Comp administrators, and increased rates of patient defaults on their portion of their medical bills (in June, this one item amounted to a $1600 hit for me).<br><br>From my perspective, Obamacare is a pirate ship on the horizon. The currently uninsured will get Medicaid; but my clinic can only accept a small percentage of our caseload as Medicaid patients because reimbursements don't even cover overhead. We can't take any more. Many current medicaid patients will end up on one of the Obamacare “bronze” plans that require 40% copays. Even the “silver” plans require 30% copays, and I'm under no illusions that those will ever be collected. If you and your readers want to know about Obamacare, the most comprehensive decription I've seen is this (27 pages)<br><br>http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/02/05/obamacare-a-deception/<br><br>Just the other day, I learned of yet another vulture circling over my inpatient income: (Medicare proposal to cut inpatient physician reimbursements, 2-3 pages).<br><br>http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottgottlieb/2013/06/28/doctors-will-have-to-take-a-pay-cut-under-obamacare/<br><br>[Continued because of char. count limits....]<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c845963481810650224 title="comment permalink">7/15/13, 2:35 AM</a><br><br>

I have medical student loan debt, credit card debt, debt to relatives. My wife and in-laws are certain things will turn around; my wife says that when our 3 year old starts kindergarden, she'll get a job--- that's 2 years out. My father-in-law insists “they” won't let doctors starve, and asks, “where will they send the patients for electrodiagnostics, there are hardly any doctors who do what you do, ...the hospital IS BOUND TO HIRE YOU AND SUBSIDIZE YOU...”. My medical director is an incorrigable optomist, mentioning how may crises have come and gone over the decades, and how this too shall pass...<br><br>I feel like the hand-writing is on the wall for my specialty. I know there are some comfortable positions still out there, but I have a gut feeling that to move to a better rehab doc position would amount to climbing the rigging of a sinking ship. So I'm endeavoring to prepare lifeboat professions for myself. As a 54-year-old, a sole-bread-winner with 9 and 3 year-old kids, I'm sweating bricks. I'm attempting to retrieve and repurpose my previous electrical engineering career into an electrical power engineering career for the utilities. So I'm preparing to take the engineering licensing exam this fall. I have 4 months to bone up on 2 years of curriculum I completed over 30 years ago. <br><br>But the electrical engineering profession has long been notorious for defacto age-descrimination, labor shortage or not. So I'm working on a blue-collar option: substation electrician, or perhaps meter technician (again for the utilities). These involve apprenticeships, and I'm not sure how competitive I'll be. But I do plan on obtaining a commercial drivers license which is mandatory for a substation apprenticeship... BTW, I'm really open to any suggestions....<br><br>One last thing: JMG, I have stopped working on my entry to your contest (I'd started a white-paper on detecting and measuring radioactivity and radionuclides with homebrew technology).

I'm ready to experience some humility. Although the discovery of your blog is recent for me, I've long read about the topics expressed here.<br><br>What strikes me the most about the way you approach the subject, is the level headed outlook. It's a gradual let down, with scary possibilities out in the dark future, unpredictable occurrences in the present, and a slow decay as the sprawl of our culture looses it's intended value.<br><br>It appears to me, that this is the great fallacy before me; that everything we've built has inherent value beyond what we need as consumers. <br><br>I'm a young man of thirty, but my perception of this illusion has always been attuned. I've always contemplated why we build what we build. The one theme that's always stood out to me, is how much decay has always been apparent from the start. The incredible amount of misplaced resources, under utilized structures, and misused land.<br><br>To offer an example: In the 80s, my mother would always take me to a Pizza Hut at the end of a huge parking lot. I would ask her "Why is this gigantic space always empty?" She always replied that it would be used one day. Yet to this day, it remains 90% unused.<br> <br>Everyone I know thinks growth will continue unabated. It's basically blasphemy to deny it. The people I've encountered always approach the problem as if it were a problem of intellect. Perseverance has become a matter of sub-doing mother nature, and everyone I debate assumes it's a lack of determination on my part. That I don't get it, because we've always been able to out-think our limitations.<br><br>I noticed you live in the Appalachians. I grew up there. As a young teenager, I helped my step-father do plumbing jobs. Wealthy people seem to think the best places to build are on the ridge line, with a nice big hot tub on the deck, however that's not the case. I've helped re-plumb many houses that froze the same night they lost power. Hundreds of second homes that use huge amounts of energy just to keep them from withering away. That's blasphemy to me. Those homes are seen as the pinnacles of American achievement. My jealousy must be overcoming me, that's all.<br><br>We have way too many testaments to wealth now, and pitifully few examples of productive developments. I'm terribly afraid, and feeling more humiliated by the day, that our current arrangement is untenable. My friends suggest that my poor background has slanted my outlook. They are right, in the sense that I didn't understand what was possible financially.<br> <br>Poverty granted me something in turn, though: The understanding that there are times when all I'll have to work with is what's at hand. That I can't count on elaborate systems to fulfill immediate needs. It makes me invaluable to them as a problem solver. <br><br>Although I'm not as versed and educated as you, your readers, or the thousands of people who debate these topics, my intuition has always proven reliable for me. That's been reinforced over the years by my friends and family. <br>My call is to them. <br><br>Yet I'm always led back to the question of energy when I think about our future, which seems very abstract and laughable to them. It's left me in a frustrated holding pattern while I attempt to understand all the incredible forces which dictate our ability to thrive. On top of that, any idea I come up with to circumvent some of the outside influences is regarded as regressive.<br><br>None of them would dare regress, for fear of being humiliated. So far as I can see, we're regressing anyways. There's no longer an ore mine in our town, which cost our state several million to clean up forty years later, or any significant source of agriculture. Oh wait, I forgot, we're the Christmas Tree capital of the world. Those should taste good.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c5263667088884264076 title="comment permalink">7/15/13, 6:34 AM</a><br><br>

If returning to ancestral religious traditions works for you, then by all means do so. Here in the US, religious pluralism <i>is</i> our ancestral tradition -- despite the efforts of Johnny-come-lately fundamentalists to obscure that very well documented fact -- and, as a member of a minority faith, I have very good reason to uphold the values and traditions involved!<br><br>Apprentice, you're in a very tough corner, no question. Health care is one of several institutionalized industries in the US that are facing collapse in the near term -- the higher education industry is another -- because the arrangements that shelter them from the direct discipline of the market have allowed them to continue growing while the society that supports them is well into contraction. My working guess is that the crisis will play out over the next decade or so. In your place I'd look at getting qualified for general practice -- once the dust settles, there will be a lot less of the extreme specialization that currently shapes the medical field, but people will still need basic health care -- and at least a basic background in one or two of the popular alternative health care modalities wouldn't be a bad move, either. <br><br>Even so, you're looking at a major crunch over the next decade or so. As long as your family remains committed to the fantasy of endless growth, there won't be much you can do in advance -- I've seen way too many marriages blow up because one partner woke up to the realities we're facing and pushed too hard when the other partner was still clinging to the dream of endless betterment -- but it might be helpful for you to get used mentally to the likelihood that you will have to declare bankruptcy and lose your home -- that way at least one of you will be able to function if it happens. Once your wife discovers how tight the job market is, and sees the ongoing contraction first hand, she may have an easier time grasping the necessities. Other than that, I don't know that there's much more that I can say. <br><br>Juhana and Ursachi, thanks for the links!<br><br>Dismantler, all I can say is "hang in there." Having grown up in poverty is a major advantage -- you got the chance early on to learn lessons I had to pick up much later! -- and that may help you see what's unfolding in time to dodge some of the worst of it, where people you know who cling to the illusion of prosperity will be blindsided. It's hard living among people who just don't get it, but worth remembering that the illusion won't last forever.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c1936515196983889287 title="comment permalink">7/15/13, 8:11 AM</a><br><br>

I'm a retired software developer who will turn 70 in the next couple of weeks, and I spend a chunk of free time (which is all I have - free time) checking economic stats and working my way through some of the public economists statements. That is, charts and graphs, and trying to figure out whether what they're saying has any relevance.<br><br>My comment re the housing market is that you can't prove anything in the aftermath of a bubble until the situation stabilizes - and it hasn't stabilized in the US housing market yet. Housing prices are still below pre-bubble levels, so they've got a ways to go up before the market stabilizes. <br><br>I grant you, it isn't exactly easy to tell that the housing price stats are irrelevant from outside without a deep knowledge of what's going on in the US economy.

I'm much more interested in the US situation than the world situation; this is, after all, where I live. Here in the US, aggregate demand is down and so are imports.

Ho boy!! did that ever anger both the engineer and the ecologists on my graduate committee. Tantamount to blasphemy. But what I showed was the life and death process of organizations looked the same as individuals and groups of individuals under ecological processes. I'm guessing the same would apply to civilizations-- a higher order of organization.<br><br>Thank you for your novel thoughts and your voice on these topics.

A two-parent household got $600.<br> <br>The problem with this is, of course, that $300 is not enough to make much difference to anyone's equity situation. At the time, it seemed more like a bone thrown to the masses to keep them from realizing that other actions being taken by the Bush administration fell largely into the screw-the-little-guy-and-further-enrich-the-already-obscenely-wealthy category.<br><br>We could do some math on the $700 billion bailout to see the vast difference between cookies and crumbs. There are about 110 million households in the US. Had the $700 billion been divided up among them, that would have come to more than $6000 per household -- more than ten times the $300 giveaway assuming two-parent households! Now THAT'S the kind of bread that can make a difference in a household's equity position, especially in the near term. <br><br>Assuming that the money came with the stipulation that it had to be used to pay down debts, the money would have found its way to the banks anyway. The difference is that a few million families would have been able to keep their homes and those with little or no debt would get a windfall, which might be very good for sales of those flat-screen TVs that you mentioned. And the banks' "assets" would be reduced by $700 billion.<br><br>But that's not the way things went. The other difference is that the "assets" of the financial system would have been reduced by a commensurate amount, so there was no way this was going to happen.<br><br>And, of course, the $700 billion was just the beginning.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c8062490968472205548 title="comment permalink">7/15/13, 1:44 PM</a><br><br>

But such a switch would require that I complete a new residency, an onerous undertaking in its own right, one that appears more daunting to me than trying to break back in to electrical engineering. At least in the planned Obamacare setup, primary care docs get some financial reward they don't currently get. But the "productivity" demands even now are grinding, and many primary care docs now need to touch-type their patient notes while they're with the patient. This trend is increasing, and I would need to learn to touch-type; some docs I know are retiring early because they don't want to founder, failing at the new work-skills that the deprofessionalization of medicine is demanding of us. One of the reasons I chose rehab medicince to begin with is that I could take the time I need to evaluate my patients. Every day I receive grateful comments from my patients that there is finally some real insight as to their problems (pain often), and I frequently make difficult diagnoses because I have time to analyze, and not just pattern-recognize, their issues. I'm frankly afraid that I would fail the current productivity requirements in a new primary care residency.<br><br>Just the same, I recognize that might well end up as my only option.<br><br>A colleague of mine learned accupuncture thinking it would represent a useful diversification as you suggested, by she finds that her patients can't get insurance coverage for accupuncture treatments, and so she doesn't use it.<br><br>I have developed a little knowldge of herbal medicine, and have used it only on the several patients who have asked for such care. My malpractice insurance doesn't cover alternative medicine, so doing much of that now is risky.<br><br>Really my biggest barrier to getting my financial situation under control is my family. I would sell our house and move into a mobile home or a trailer in a heart beat. My wife (and in-laws) just won't hear of it. Her attitude is that I'm a doctor for crying out loud, but a worry-wart, and that I should just handle uncertainty and stress with more equanimity, dictate faster, be less fastidious, and be proactive with getting up to speed with touch typing. I am drawing the line on not using our 401K to cover living expenses, at least not without an exit plan that includes dumping the house ASAP. I'm afraid that may become the flash-point in our marriage.<br><br>I would like to avoid bankrupcy; my credit rating is outstanding, and these credit scores are incresingly being used in employment screening. The substation electrician apprenticeship I'm looking at specifies "financial responsibility" as a necessary qualification. I hope a short-sale of the house can be arranged when push comes to shove.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c5649175881074675389 title="comment permalink">7/15/13, 5:40 PM</a><br><br>

Try doing what we're doing here and I'll tell you I don't see much support for choice.

I learned karate for many years not because I wanted to learn how to fight, but because I wanted to learn how to avoid fights. It sounds counter intuitive, but there is a logic to it. If you fear others then I strongly recommend this course of action as it is empowering.<br><br>The truth is, violence cuts across all socio economic boundaries and violence against women (which I abhor) is no more or less prevalent in our society than it was historically.<br><br>I don't believe the meme that male / female rolls are in conflict or that domination is a factor in the majority of circumstances. Such memes only serve the purpose of dividing the community.

Drop the idea of gender (women are just the particular scapegoat that the manosphere has chosen at this point in history) and you have nothing but a very old and time-worn idea of what I call the Atomic Man, the man who is self-contained, indivisible, and indestructable. They call him a red-pill taking Bull Alpha. This icon is absolutely a product of an affluent, resource-rich society; only under these conditions can the fantasy that one can "not need anyone else" be widely entertained. As our affluence fades, so will these ideas. In a resource-poor world, the interdependence of everyone on everyone is obvious. Only the delusional would attempt to believe otherwise. These ideas are resurgent now as yet another attempt to cling onto the past and deny the present and future realities. <br><br>Dudes, you or your sons (presumably being raised by their mothers to whom you have not spoken in 5 years and for whom you provide no support, in true Red Pill style) are gonna live in a world where you live or die by your relationships with other people. Live just to serve yourself, try to work Game with all around you, and you'll starve, get banished, or hanged soon enough.

It's like cancer treatment: not something you want to do prophylactically, but if you need to do it, the sooner you diagnose the problem and get it going, the better.<br><br>Bankruptcy is primarily about unsecured debt, e.g. credit card debt. If granted under Chapter 7, all the credit card debt is simply discharged. Poof. Cards are cancelled and cleared.<br><br>Bankruptcy will provide certain protections of long-term assets, such as equity in your primary residence and your 401K. However, it does not discharge your secured debts, such as a mortgage, though it does protect against foreclosure by the bank while you restructure your finances. You still need to continue to pay the mortgage, or you will eventually lose the house.<br><br>Bankruptcy does not apply at all to federally-insured student debt: so far as I can tell, there's no way out of that short of dying. Doesn't that just figure.<br><br>So if you've kept your unsecured (credit card) debt low, and the problem is that you're up the eyeballs in student loans and can't afford your secured (mortgage) debts, then bankruptcy isn't likely to be a sensible option, anyway.<br><br>If you've been meeting your normal expenses with credit card debt, however, you'll definitely want to shed some misconceptions about bankruptcy. Since it sounds like there's already family pressure to tap your 401K for living expenses, and your "credit rating" is sky-high (meaning that the banks have marked you as a sucker for credit), I'm guessing your cards are all floating near their maximum limits....<br><br>I'd recommend is that you invest a few hundred dollars in preliminary legal advice on bankruptcy, and do a little online research. Asking questions about bankruptcy doesn't mean you need to declare it.<br><br>Think of it as a financial colonoscopy. If they find nothing, the peace-of-mind will be well worth the small investment.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c6167925995366420917 title="comment permalink">7/16/13, 6:46 AM</a><br><br>

The Electrician's Union is pretty strong and its members can get secure jobs with decent pay and benefits. Being a substation electrician won't compare to your current occupation in status, but it's useful work and probably not too stressful. One downside is that the work is more cut and dried; you won't be your own boss or have much opportunity to exercise professional judgment.<br><br>When I received my BA in the midst of a much earlier economic downturn, I saw a lot of people with post-graduate degrees scrambling for a handful of jobs with lousy pay and prospects in their fields. I decided I didn't have the drive to succeed in that cutthroat environment. I went for a certificate in a skilled trade that was growing. I obtained it quickly and cheaply in a community college. My parents were not pleased. <br><br>That route to work isn't so quick or cheap as it used to be, but training that leads to a unionized job in an industry that isn't too cyclical (e.g., not construction) is still more likely to provide secure and decent livelihood than most professional degrees.

For me though, no mass movement can ever be defined by the beliefs or behaviours of any self appointed spokesperson like Germaine Greer. Anyway, I can’t imagine a mass movement without its share of backstabbing and general nastiness. There’s no reason why feminism would be any different since whatever it’s about, it’s made up of people. My point though was that the Manosphere has a problem with all of its varieties.

If your patients appreciate the work you do, though, I wonder if you can do what a small but growing number of physicians are doing -- start your own clinic on a cash-only basis, cheap, and provide the services you know how to provide to people who can pay a modest fee directly to you, without having to mess with insurance, etc. As for your family, if I had a dollar for everyone I know who's in that situation, I could buy takeout pizza for the readership of this blog!

Thanks for the clarification. You're quite right, of course -- and it's worth noting that the sort of warrior societies that a lot of privileged middle class men glorify these days are one and all societies in which loyalty and the willing acceptance of social bonds and duties are considered essential virtues, and in which the kind of men you've described would be considered despicable -- and disposable. <br><br>Joseph, yes, the British Empire. It was in deep trouble at the end of the 18th century, and survived and thrived because it got another cash cow -- India -- to milk dry. There are other cases of the same sort. If a faltering empire can find some new source of wealth to feed into its wealth pump, it can often recover; if it can't, it's toast. <br><br>Michael, it varies from case to case. Some societies facing steep economic contraction dissolve into ethnic and class warfare, others don't. The Zimmerman/Martin thing, though, is only noteworthy because it got so much media -- things of that kind, usually with police in Zimmerman's place, happen every day in America, and have happened every day in America for a very long time.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c5135928522743255665 title="comment permalink">7/16/13, 10:02 PM</a><br><br>

Most writers there are marketing worldview where men shoul free themselves from traditional restraints of family, duty and breadwinning and indulge themselves in individualistic search of personal goals, free from constraints of tradition.<br><br>If you remove term "men" and replace it with "women" from that description, you describe current feminist ideology quite accurately.<br><br>There are brilliant writers in Manosphere and feminist literature alike; they both have nothing to offer but hedonistic message of "me first!" behind enertaining writings.<br><br>Current Western zeitgeist of individualism and search for personal happiness is hedonistic to it's very core. Persons, women or men, who want to mazimize their personal freedom of choice always want other groups of people around them to act within constraints of societal contract. They want freedom for their interest group of choice and restrictions for other interest groups. There is no such thing as common good in Western society; all that is left is zero-sum-game where different groups are fighting over spoils of former exponential growth. <br><br>Most Asiatic state machineries I have encountered are thoroughly corrupt, but people living under their yoke have families, clans and patronage networks to shield them in hard times. There exists two parallel systems of dependance: one is official state, which is mainly one big racketeering syndicate with coercive power, other is informal network of personal connections. Inside that informal network nobody can have too many individualistic thoughts, or network just unravels around him/her. Network's attitude is naturally conformist, and too much freedom, differing thoughts and individualism tears it apart.<br><br>In the West, and in Nordic countries especially, people have practically abandonded these informal communities and depent on government to direct services and largesse towards them. People form likeminded pressure groups, which try politically steer public opinion and political machinery to hand out tax money to their direction. All communication is between official state and different pressure groups, non-official group-to-group communication and decision making is nonexistent. Movement of decision-making is vertical, not horizontal. This "wellfare state" system has worked very well in past, but now tax base is shrinking, and I believe it is shrinking to foreseeable future. First time in decades people in West have to rely again in their informal patronage networks to survive. Problem is, all this individualism has teared those networks to minuscule cells of two to ten peoples... In contrast, Central Asian patron-client networks can cover up to couple of hundred persons... There are lot of opportunities there to made, even if you have to be ready to pay price also, by conforming to common attitudes and contibuting favors to other members under same umbrella.<br><br>All I say is contraction in West is going to be harder than it needs to be, because our ruling class and their dependants are both fixated on this state machinery way of things, and it is not going to work in the future anymore. Feminism, men's right movement, environmentalism, liberalism, political conservatism, multiculturalism...they will all fail, because they do not see strength of grassroots communities, but rely on state power and decrees. They try to coerce people to cooperating, and that road shall fail. To have cooperative will, people have to share common identity. Bombardment for this state ideology is practically constant in the West, especially here in Nordic states, and you have to spend prolonged periods of time outside Western influence sphere to understand how constant this indoctrination really is. <br><br>I cannot feel strong sympathy for people propagating this current and already failed state of things, even if I personally have nothing against them. That is poetic justice for me.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c3329780630878446123 title="comment permalink">7/17/13, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>

But I don't see how their inaction disproves the theory itself. The Job Guarantee program is something that fiat money allows you to do, not something you have to do with fiat money. <br><br>Inflation in the 70's was mostly due to the rising costs of oil (I thought) and I haven't read any MMT source claiming that inflation is only monetary. Rather the opposite: http://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2011/05/30/what-actually-causes-inflation/<br><br>@Chris<br><br>You are right. If the federal reserve issues the money or the government it doesn't make a difference. It is just a matter of choice to "separate" it. <br><br>Other then that, MMT says that everyone's spending must be somebody's income and vice versa. And yes if a government keeps on printing money beyond full employment inflation and currency devaluation will probably happen.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c1645223004159917903 title="comment permalink">7/18/13, 9:32 AM</a><br><br>

I'm surprised that more people don't see it the same way. <br><br>The people who wrote down the creation texts in Genesis don't have a problem with a heliocentric planetary system or evolutionary theory. Theological challenges within Judaism usually come from historical events, not scientific discoveries.<br><br>The reason for this, I believe, is that classical and Orthodox Judaism consider differing interpretations of a text in light of each other, not aiming to arrive at a single authoritative interpretation. For at least the fifteen hundred years since the Mishnah was written, rabbis have employed allegory, numerical symbolism, stories from ordinary life, and a variety of other approaches besides literalism to extract as much meaning as possible from each Biblical passage. The names of Talmudic rabbis were recorded along with their comments, and the majority and dissenting opinions were noted rather like an appellate court decision.<br><br>When a minority opinion is recorded without labeling it as heretical error, it leaves open the possibility that people can continue to disagree without being wrong.<br><br><a href=asking-hard-questions.html#c7818221412419655027 title="comment permalink">7/20/13, 3:37 PM</a><br><br>
