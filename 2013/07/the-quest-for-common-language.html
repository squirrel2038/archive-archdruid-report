It was probably inevitable that my comment last week about the pseudoconservative crusade against Darwinian evolution in today’s America would attract more attention, and generate more heat, than anything else in the post. Some of my readers abroad expressed their surprise that the subject was even worth mentioning any more, and it’s true that most religious people elsewhere on the planet, even those who revere the same Bible our American creationists insist on treating as a geology textbook, got over the misunderstandings that drive the creationist crusade a long time ago.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
While it’s primarily an American issue, though, I’d like to ask the indulgence of my readers elsewhere in the world, and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>also of American readers who habitually duck under the nearest couch whenever creationists and evolutionists start shouting past each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a major hot-button issue in the tangled relationship between science and religion, the quarrel over evolution highlights the way that this relationship has gotten messed up, and thus will have to be sorted out as the civil religion of progress comes unraveled and its believers have to find some new basis for their lives. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mind you, I also have a personal stake in it. It so happens that I’m a religious person who accepts the validity of Darwin’s theory of evolution. That’s not despite my religion—quite the contrary, it’s part of my religion—and so I’m going to break one of my own rules and talk a little bit about Druidry here. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The traditions of modern Druidry, the faith I follow, actually embraced biological evolution even before Darwin provided a convincing explanation for it. Here’s part of a ritual dialogue from the writings of Edward Williams (1747-1826), one of the major figures of the early Druid Revival: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="margin-left: 35.45pt">
“Q. Where art thou now, and how camest thou to where thou art?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="margin-left: 35.45pt">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="margin-left: 35.45pt">
“A. I am in the little world, whither I came, having traversed the circle of Abred, and now I am a man at its termination and extreme limits.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="margin-left: 35.45pt">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="margin-left: 35.45pt">
“Q. What wert thou before thou didst become a man in the circle of Abred?”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="margin-left: 35.45pt">
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal style="margin-left: 35.45pt">
“A. I was in Annwn the least possible that was capable of life, and the nearest possible to absolute death, and I came in every form, and through every form capable of a body and life, to the state of man along the circle of Abred.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Like most 18th-century rituals, this one goes on for a good long while, but the passage just cited is enough to give the flavor and some of the core ideas. Abred is the realm of incarnate existence, and includes “every form capable of a body and life,” from what used to be called “infusoria” (single-celled organisms, nowadays) all the way up the scale of biological complexity and diversity, through every kind of plant and animal, including you and me. What the dialogue is saying is that we all, every one of us, embody all these experiences in ourselves. When Taliesin in his great song of triumph said “I have been all things previously,” this is what we believe he was talking about. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are at least two ways in which all this can be taken. It might be referring to the long biological process that gave rise to each of us, and left our bodies and minds full of traces of our kinship with all other living things. It might also be referring to the transmigration of souls, which was a teaching of the ancient Druids and is fairly common in the modern tradition as well: the belief that there is a center of consciousness that survives the death of one body to be reborn in another, and that each such center of consciousness, by the time it first inhabits a human body, has been through all these other forms, slowly developing the complexity that will make it capable of reflective thought and wisdom. You’ll find plenty of Druids on either side of this divide; what you won’t find—at least I’ve yet to encounter one—are Druids who insist that the existence of a soul is somehow contradicted by the evolution of the body. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Yet you can’t bring up the idea of evolution in today’s America without being beseiged by claims that Darwinian evolution is inherently atheistic. Creationists insist on this notion just as loudly as atheists do, which is really rather odd, considering that it’s nonsense. By this I don’t simply mean that an eccentric minority faith such as Druidry manages to combine belief in evolution with belief in gods; I mean that the supposed incompatibility between evolution and the existence of one or more gods rests on the failure of religious people to take the first principles of their own faiths seriously. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Let’s cover some basics first. First of all, Darwin’s theory of natural selection may be a theory, but evolution is a fact. Living things change over time to adapt to changing environments; we’ve got a billion years of fossil evidence to show that, and the thing is happening right now—in the emergence of the Eastern coyote, the explosive radiation of cichlid fishes in East Africa, and many other examples. The theory attempts to explain why this observed reality happens. A great deal of creationist rhetoric garbles this distinction, and tries to insist that uncertainties in the explanation are proof that the thing being explained doesn’t exist, which is bad logic. The theory, furthermore, has proven itself solidly in practice—it does a solid job of explaining things for which competing theories have to resort to ad hoc handwaving—and it forms the beating heart of today’s life sciences, very much including ecology. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Second, the narratives of the Book of Genesis, if taken literally, fail to match known facts about the origins and history of the Earth and the living things on it. Creationists have argued that the narratives are true anyway, but their attempts to prove this convince only themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s been shown beyond reasonable doubt, for example, that the Earth came into being long before 4004 BCE, that animals and plants didn’t evolve in the order given in the first chapter of Genesis, that no flood large enough to put an ark on Mount Ararat happened during the chronological window the Bible allows for the Noah story, and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was worth suggesting back in the day that the narratives of the Book of Genesis might be<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>literally true, but that hypothesis failed to fit the data, and insisting that the facts must be wrong if they contradict a cherished theory is not a useful habit. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Third, the value of the Bible—or of any other scripture—does not depend on whether it makes a good geology textbook, any more than the value of a geology textbook depends on whether it addresses the salvation of the soul. I don’t know of any religion in which faith and practice center on notions of how the Earth came into existence and got its current stock of living things. Certainly the historic creeds of Christianity don’t even consider the issue worth mentioning. The belief that God created the world does not require believing any particular claim about how that happened; nor does it say in the Bible that the Bible has to be taken literally, or that it deals with questions of geology or paleontology at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What’s happened here, as I’ve suggested in previous posts, is that a great many devout Christians in America have been suckered into playing a mug’s game. They’ve put an immense amount of energy into something that does their religion no good, and plays straight into the hands of their opponents. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s a mug’s game, to begin with, because the central strategy that creationists have been using since well before Darwin’s time guarantees that they will always lose. It’s what historians of science call the “God of the gaps” strategy—the attempt to find breaks in the evolutionary process that scientists haven’t yet filled with an explanation, and then to insist that only God can fill them. Back in Darwin’s own time, the usual argument was that there weren’t any transitional forms between one species and another; in response to the resulting talk about “missing links,” paleontologists spent the next century and a half digging up transitional forms, so that nowadays there are plenty of evolutionary lineages—horses, whales, and human beings among them—where every species is an obvious transition between the one before it and the one after. As those gaps got filled in, critics of evolution retreated to another set, and another, and another; these days, they’ve retreated all the way to fine details of protein structure, and when that gap gets filled in, it’ll be on to the next defeat. The process is reliable enough that I’ve come to suspect that biologists keep an eye on the latest creationist claims when deciding what corner of evolutionary theory gets intensively researched next. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, there’s a much deeper sense in which it’s a mug’s game, and explaining that deeper sense is going to require attention to some of the basic presuppositions of religious thought. To keep things in suitably general terms, we’ll talk here about what philosophers call classical theism, defined as the belief that the universe was created out of nothing by a unique, perfect, eternal, omnipotent and omniscient being. (There’s more to classical theism than that—you can find the details in any good survey of philosophy of religion—but these are the details that matter for our present purposes.) I’ve argued elsewhere that classical theism isn’t the best explanation of human religious experience, but we’ll let that go for now; it corresponds closely to the beliefs of most American creationists, and it so happens that arguments that apply to classical theism here can be applied equally well to nearly all other theist beliefs. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of the terms in the definition just given, the one that gets misused most often these days is “eternal.” That word doesn’t mean “lasting for a very long time,” as when we say that a bad movie lasts for an eternity; it doesn’t even mean “lasting for all of time.” What it means instead is “existing outside of time.” (Connoisseurs of exact diction will want to know that something that lasts for a very long time is diuturnal, and something that lasts for all of time is sempiternal.) Eternal beings, if such there be, would experience any two moments in time the way you and I experience two points on a tabletop—distinct but simultaneously present. It’s only beings who exist in time who have to encounter those two moments sequentially, or as we like to say, “one at a time.” </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s why, for example, the endless arguments about whether divine providence contradicts human free will are barking up the wrong stump. Eternal beings wouldn’t have to foresee the future—they would simply see it, because to them, it’s not in the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>An omniscient eternal being can know exactly what you’ll do in 2025, not because you lack free will, but because there you are, doing it right out in plain sight, as well as being born, dying, and doing everything else in between. An eternal being could also see what you’re doing in 2025 and respond to it in 2013, or at any other point in time from the Big Bang to whatever final destiny might be waiting for the universe billions of years from now. All this used to be a commonplace of philosophy through the end of the Middle Ages, and it’s no compliment to modern thought that a concept every undergraduate knew inside and out in 1200 has been forgotten even by people who think they believe in eternal beings. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course believers in classical theism and its equivalents don’t just believe in eternal beings in general.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They believe in one, unique, perfect, eternal, omnipotent and omniscient being who created the universe and everything in it out of nothing. Set aside for the moment whether you are or aren’t one of those believers, and think through the consequences of the belief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If it’s true, then everything in the universe without exception is there either because that being deliberately put it there, or because he created beings with free will in the full knowledge that they would put it there. Everything that wasn’t done by one of those created beings, in turn, is a direct manifestation of the divine will.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Gravity and genetics,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>photosynthesis and continental drift, the origin of life from complex carbon compounds and the long evolutionary journey since then: grant the presuppositions of classical theism, and these are, and can only be, how beings in time perceive the workings of the eternally creative will of God. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus it’s a waste of time to go scrambling around the machinery of the cosmos, looking for scratches left by a divine monkeywrench on the gears and shafts. That’s what the “God of the gaps” strategy does in practice; without ever quite noticing it, it accepts the purely mechanistic vision of the universe that’s promoted by atheists, and then tries to prove that God tinkers with the machinery from time to time. Accept the principles of classical theism and you’ve given up any imaginable excuse for doing that, since a perfect, omniscient, and omnipotent deity leaves no scratches and doesn’t need to tinker. It’s not even a matter of winding up the gears of the cosmos and letting them run from there, in the fashion of the “clockmaker God” of the 18th century Deists; to an eternal divine being, all of time is present simultaneously, every atom is doing exactly and only what it was put there to do, and what looks like machinery to the atheist can only be, to the believer in classical theism or its equivalents, the action of the divine will in eternity acting upon the world in time. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Such a universe, please note, doesn’t differ from the universe of modern science in any objectively testable way, and this is as it should be. The universe of matter and energy is what it is, and modern science is the best toolkit our species has yet discovered for figuring out how it works. The purpose of theology isn’t to bicker with science over questions that science is much better prepared to address, but to relate the material universe studied by science to questions of ultimate concern—of value, meaning and purpose—which science can’t and shouldn’t address and are instead the proper sphere of religion. To return to a point I tried to raise in <a href=../../2013/06/a-question-of-values.html>one of last month’s posts</a>, not everything that matters to human beings can be settled by an objective assessment of fact; there are times, many of them, that you have to decide on some other basis which of several different narratives you choose to trust.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Step beyond questions of fact, that is, and you’re in the territory of faith—a label that properly includes the atheist’s belief in a purely material cosmos just as much as it does the classical theist’s belief in a created cosmos made by an infinite and eternal god, the traditional polytheist’s belief in a living cosmos shaped by many divine powers, and so on, since none of these basic presuppositions about the cosmos can be proven or disproven.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How do people decide between these competing visions, then?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As noted in the post just mentioned, when that choice is made honestly, it’s made on the basis of values. Values are always individual, and always relative to a particular person in a particular context.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>They are not a function of the intellect, but of the heart and will—or to use a old and highly unfashionable word, of character. Different sets of presuppositions about the cosmos speak to different senses of what values matter; which is to say that they speak to different people, in different situations. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This, of course, is what a great many religions have been saying all along. In most of the religions of the west, and many of those from other parts of the world, faith is a central theme, and faith is not a matter of passing some kind of multiple choice test; it’s not a matter of the intellect at all; rather, it’s the commitment of the whole self to a way of seeing the cosmos that can be neither proved nor disproved rationally, but has to be accepted or rejected on its own terms. To accept any such vision of the nature of existence is to define one’s identity and relationship to the whole cosmos; to refuse to accept any such vision is also to define these things, in a different way; and in a certain sense, you don’t make that choice—you
<i>are</i> that choice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Rephrase what I’ve just said in the language of salvation and grace, and you’ve got one of the core concepts of Christianity; phrase it in other terms, and you’ve got an important element of many other religions, Druidry among them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s important not to ignore the sweeping differences among these different visions of the nature of existence—these different faiths, to use a far from meaningless idiom. Still, there’s a common theme shared by many of them, which is the insight that human beings are born and come to awareness in a cosmos with its own distinctive order, an order that we didn’t make or choose, and one that imposes firm limits on what we can and should do with our lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Different faiths understand that experience of universal order in radically different ways—call it dharma or the Tao, the will of God or the laws of Great Nature, or what have you—but the choice is the same in every case:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>you can apprehend the order of the cosmos in love and awe, and accept your place in it, even when that conflicts with the cravings of your ego, or you can put your ego and its cravings at the center of your world and insist that the order of the cosmos doesn’t matter if it gets in the way of what you think you want.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s a very old choice: which will you have, the love of power or the power of love?</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What makes this particularly important just now is that we’re all facing that choice today with unusual intensity, in relation to part of the order of the cosmos that not all religions have studied as carefully as they might. Yes, that’s the order of the biosphere, the fabric of natural laws and cycles that keep all of us alive. It’s a teaching of Druidry that this manifestation of the order of things is of the highest importance to humanity, and not just because human beings have messed with that order in remarkably brainless ways over the last three hundred years or so. Your individual actions toward the biosphere are an expression of the divide just sketched out. Do you recognize that the living Earth has its own order, that this order imposes certain hard constraints on what human beings can or should try to do, and do you embrace that order and accept those constraints in your own life for the greater good of the living Earth and all that lives upon her? Or do you shrug it off, or go through the motions of fashionable eco-piety, and hop into your SUV lifestyle and slam the pedal to the metal? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Science can’t answer that question, because science isn’t about values. (When people start claiming otherwise, what’s normally happened is that they’ve smuggled in a set of values from some religion or other—most commonly the civil religion of progress.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Science can tell us how fast we’re depleting the world’s finite oil supplies, and how quickly the signs of unwelcome ecological change are showing up around us; it can predict how soon this or that or the other resource is going to run short, and how rapidly the global climate will start to cost us in blood; it can even tell us what actions might help make the future less miserable than it will otherwise be, and which ones will add to the misery—but it can’t motivate people to choose the better of these, to decide to change their lives for the benefit of the living Earth rather than saying with a shrug, “I’m sure they’ll think of something” or “I’ll be dead before it happens” or “We’re all going to be extinct soon, so it doesn’t matter,” and walking away.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s why I’ve been talking at such length about the end of the civil religion of progress here, and why I’ll be going into more detail about the religious landscape of the deindustrial world as we proceed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Religion is the dimension of human culture that deals most directly with values, and values are the ultimate source of all human motivation. It’s for this reason that I feel it’s crucial to find a common language that will bridge the gap between religions and the environmental sciences, to get science and religion both to settle down on their own sides of the border that should properly separate them—and to show that there’s a path beyond the misguided struggle between them. We’ll talk more about that path next week. </div>

IMO here are the top reasons why evolution generates such conflict with traditional Christianity or Islam.<br><br>1. Abrahamic religions usually draw their power from a single book or at most two-three books, it's a great source of strength for a religion that primarily relies on conversion because you don't want to carry a hundred books in your bag when traveling from one place to another. But it's also a big weakness as it makes your religion less flexible to change. In contrast eastern religions (would be incorrect to call them religion) have grown organically on the land in which they are practiced and are usually a mix of hundreds of different practices and cultures, there is no 'one' scripture which holds primacy and it's not that difficult to find scriptures which contradict each other completely. So what you get are traditions that are very flexible in the face of change, to give an example from my country, if you told a creationist that they came from Monkeys they would not be amused, but if you told a devout Hindu that humans came from Monkeys they'd be completely at ease with the notion because one of our gods is a monkey, in fact almost every other animal form is revered here.<br><br>You can also find thousands of mythological stories which can be adapted to fit modern day technology.<br><br>2. Christianity has a history of persecuting scientists and they drew a line in the sand very early on, so it's not surprising that people in science decided to go after the church with all their strength.<br><br>3. The intellectual traditions of Christianity and Islam cannot exist outside the framework of the religion, here it's possible to be a monk and not worship even once, all you'd have to do is drape a cloth, renounce your possessions and live a life of hardship trying to serve the poor.<br><br>This makes it difficult to reconcile liberal ideas with religious faith. As a result young people tend to drop out of the scene altogether instead of getting absorbed in a separate branch.<br><br><a href=#c5878862958547843246 title="comment permalink">7/24/13, 10:35 PM</a><br><br>

Ok, maybe this praise puts me in the 'sycophantic follower' category (as discussed over on the comments at Resilience) - but credit where it's due I say - and it is due.<br><br>For my own part I have called myself an atheist for the best part of 20 years, with sincere forays into zen buddhist schools of thought. By and large that isn't so remarkable over here in the UK as others have commented. God or Christianity or the whole evolutionary debate just doesn't figure over here. However I have watched the birth of Dawkins' 'brights' and his new Science religiosity with some dismay (from an initial deep respect for the man for at least questioning some deep taboo subjects like 'what's so special about belief'). I have a scientific background myself and so his thinking found fertile ground in my mind for a while...<br><br>However, thanks to certain Archdruid my thinking has been broadened beyond such simplistic world views and also helped me realise that deep down there was an intrinsic tension in me - it turns out I'm not an atheist at all - the boy I was at 8 years old could have told me that (he did love the natural world so). But the difficulty in this is like in politics - it's easy to know what you are against (even if you don't really know why - those values again), but it's not always so easy to know what you are <i>for.</i> My sincere thanks go to you for helping people like me realise their values again - now that's what I call magic! ;)<br><br>Matt<br><br><a href=#c8079825863344497106 title="comment permalink">7/24/13, 10:47 PM</a><br><br>

I also gave her links to a Christian paleontologist and expert on radiometric dating. Luckily they have not tried this creationist teaching experiment again as far as I know.

There is zero evidence that such things exist and their existence would require a complete rewriting of the laws of physics as we understand them today. Something that given the aforementioned complete lack of evidence for their existence compared to the mountains of confirmatory evidence backing up those laws is totally unjustified. <br><br>2) As you mentioned, there is the fact of evolution and the theory of evolution. When we talk about acceptance of evolution, both things are equally important and there is no religion that accepts the latter. None. The theory of evolution explains the fact of evolution with the interplay between mutation, selection, genetic drift and migration. Of these, genetic drift has been severely underrepresented not only in most popular account of evolutionary theory but also in schools, which has lead to many people thinking there is no contradiction between religion and evolutionary theory, but is in fact a key reason why they cannot be reconciled without making some huge and completely unjustified assumptions. There is plenty of evidence that neutral, non-adaptive or even maladaptive evolutionary changes through genetic drift have played a major role in shaping life on this planet as it currently exists and in particular the lineages of large-bodied organism with low effective population sizes (such as ours). This means you can reconcile the existence of a God with the theory of evolution (which is, I repeat once again, backed up by very large body of evidence) in three ways: 1) God created the universe and had the trajectory of every particle in it predetermined so that it ended up with the current life forms we have, 2) he constantly intervened inserting mutations into genomes, 3) he is a deistic God who set things in motion and then stopped paying attention in which case there is no reason for us to pay any attention to his existence either. 1) and 2) are pure creationism, just not of the YEC kind, in addition 1) has certain theological implications I don't think religious people will be happy with themselves, and, finally, as usual, there is zero evidence to suggest we should take them seriously. So why do?<br><br>Also:<br><br><i>Such a universe, please note, doesn’t differ from the universe of modern science in any objectively testable way</i><br><br>Then why add all the stuff about Gods to the explanation when it's not only not needed and not backed up by evidence but only complicates things further?<br><br><i>Science can’t answer that question, because science isn’t about values. (When people start claiming otherwise, what’s normally happened is that they’ve smuggled in a set of values from some religion or other—most commonly the civil religion of progress.)</i><br><br>Not true at all. The main driver of human behavior is inclusive fitness maximization, as it for all other organisms. From that extremely selfish, evolutionary point of view it is a disaster for the species to engage in its current self-destructive behavior - if the species goes extinct, everyone's inclusive fitness is maximally minimized. There isn't anything about values here, it's about simple Darwinian survival.<br><br><a href=#c6164868231187348305 title="comment permalink">7/24/13, 10:49 PM</a><br><br>

The package is called <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism rel=nofollow>Dispensationalism</a>, and it's all contained in the Scofield Reference Bible.

There would be no need to for it to snap it's fingers and create something because it wouldn't need to, it would perceive time so completely different than the way human beings do that there would literally be no way the human mind, with it's focus on linear time, could understand what that would be like, excepting the occasional LSD trip of course. That said, this post dovetails with my own philosophy on such matters. I once told another Christian friend that if I get to the pearly gates and St. Peter insists that I answer the question of how old the world actually is, 6,000 o5 4.5 Billion, I will then begin to sweat a little...until then, I think I will bank on the afterlife as being whatever it turns out to be, even if that is nothing.

Science can fill in many gaps and help us understand our surroundings better. But we do need to come to terms with the question of what our place in this universe is and it seems that we did not exactly make a lot of progress there lately, judging by the state of the planet we're living on. I refer to myself often as an atheist, but I deeply feel for the land around me and I get very sad by what I perceive our species is doing to it. This is not exactly something that can be addressed solely or even mainly by science, which can explain this or that but not create "sense" in the deeper meaning. And I have to agree with you, it's not it's job. Hence, we lost view of the "spiritual" or "philosophical" development over the all-to-easy science equals progress. I would very much enjoy more discussions along those lines between people of different faiths, including atheists and agnostics.

I grew up in a staunchly post-Vatican II Roman Catholic home, and was thus taught and conditioned to ridicule Young Earth Creationism, and dismiss it as not worth taking seriously.<br><br>My journey into the Nestorian Church was based, among other things, on taking the concept of Christian Tradition with the utmost seriousness. One of the things that Tradition handed down among virtually all Christian thinkers up to the 18th century was an almost monolithic consensus that the earth is young. Some, notably Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, maintained that the creation story in Genesis I in particular could be interpreted allegorically, but even such thinkers - and they were in the minority, as the majority of pre-18th century thinkers across all Christian traditions were staunch literalists concerning all the early chapters of Genesis - took the young age of earth and cosmos for granted.<br><br>Since, as I say, I take Tradition with the utmost seriousness, I was impelled by this state of affairs to set aside my inherited prejudice and ridicule against those Christians (and Jews and Muslims also) who reject evolution and affirm the young earth, and investigate the matter seriously with an open mind. I conducted this investigation over an extended period beginning in 2007, carefully and extensively reading many books by Young Earth Creationists and their opponents in the process.

Thus, if evolution is true, it is every bit as much a “miracle” as is any widely disbelieved violation of the standard laws of science reported in the Judeo-Christian scriptures.<br><br>3) In general, and across many scientific fields, evolution is not a conclusion derived logically (either inductively or deductively) from a massive set of premises in the form of empirical scientific facts. Rather, evolution is a preconceived framework of interpretation that is imposed on the evidence, in such a manner that its imposition is impervious to empirical falsification. Evolutionary science is thus a fundamentally question-begging enterprise across the board. Subscribing to evolution therefore is every bit as much an act of religious belief as is belief in the Judeo-Christian framework of interpreting the scientific data in these various fields.<br><br>4) One prominent example to illustrate the question-begging and faith-driven character of evolutionary science is the following: Virtually all the alleged “transitional fossils” have been disproven as such, so that gradualistic neo-Darwinism was abandoned by its leading exponents during the 1970s and 80s, and replaced by the so-called “Punctuated Equilibrium” school of Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge (with Oscar Schindewolf and Richard Goldschmidt serving as much-reviled pioneers of this way of thinking in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, as the absence of transitional forms became increasingly clear to leading biological specialists). The purpose of this shift away from classical Darwinian and neo-Darwinian gradualism was to accommodate the evolutionary belief system to the glaring and increasingly embarrassing absence of the primary line of evidence for it. <br><br>5) Ancient world history, as it has been conventionally believed and taught since the 19th century, is based on competing interpretations of the very fragmentary evidence we have of Egyptian dynastic history. These competing interpretations all share in common that they unwarrantably extend the rise of the first dynasty of Mena into the distant past way beyond 2100 BC or so (the Flood of Noah having taken place around 2350 BC). In point of fact, the very fragmentary extant evidence of Egyptian history is in fact entirely amenable to a temporally compressed interpretation in conformity with the biblical timeline.<br><br>In sum, there is no need for anyone who rejects evolution, and who affirms the literal historical accuracy of the Bible, including the early chapters of Genesis, to feel embarrassed or intellectually inferior. Those with an open mind who invest the requisite amount of time carrying out the necessary research can discover for themselves the intellectual robustness of the Young Earth Creationist case, and the corresponding intellectual flimsiness of the case for evolution.<br><br><a href=#c3460428035854486569 title="comment permalink">7/25/13, 5:21 AM</a><br><br>

The translation is a little lacking in poetry, but reading the bible in this way is most useful and instructive since it emphasizes our sacred duty to care for the earth.<br><br>2. An amazing vision of an eternity-centered, earth-centered religion can be found in <i>The Biggest Estate on Earth: How Aborigines Made Australia,</i> by Bill Gammage (recommended to me by Chris @Cherokee Organics). Gammage's account of "the Dreaming," the faith that governed the indigenous people's management of the land that we call Australia is revelatory and extremely germane to this discussion. <br><br>This faith includes the concepts of the eternal and transubstantiation of souls discussed here, which in turn led to an implemented ethic of caring for the land that was radically ecological (as seems only right by my lights).<br><br>3. I've just started <i>A World Full of Gods,</i> but haven't gotten far enough to comment yet.<br><br>4.

And for explaining terms like “eternal.” Can you believe throughout the West we’ve been having these lengthy debates, discussions, and on and on, without even agreeing on basic definitions of terms?<br><br>In one of the comments last week you wrote: “….nothing in the Bible or the historic creeds of Christianity rules out biological evolution. If that's how God chose to create humanity, I think He showed excellent taste in selecting an elegant method. The notion that Christianity has to reject a scientific theory that has no bearing on any of the core issues of Christian faith is, I would argue, a sign of just how deeply Christianity has been hijacked into the service of the myth of progress -- in this case as one of its canned opponents.”<br><br>I couldn’t agree more. I don’t understand why it is so rare to find an explanation like this. You said it, E.F. Schumacher said it, I’m sure many others have said it. I myself came up with it on my own before encountering either of your writings. I fancied myself writing about it until I encountered Schumacher’s lengthy discussion in A Guide for the Perplexed. If an amateur like myself can reach that conclusion unaided, it must not be that wild of an idea.<br><br>There is no conflict between evolution and creation. There is only, in Schumacher’s terms, a conflict between EvolutionISM and CreationISM. But what are those? I realize these are some kind of manifestations of the Religion of Progress, but I wonder why the hyped up conflict at all? In my mind, there is no conflict. I speculate it has something to do with the media treatment. The way this discussion, ahem, “debate” is portrayed reminds me of nothing more than two scared kids in the schoolyard surrounded by a circle of troublemakers chanting, “Fight! Fight! Fight!” <br><br>Every newspaper article and television special cashes in on the attention whenever the “sworn enemies” of the “Biggest Rivalry in the Modern World” come to an arena near you. I’m surprised that they don’t go on tour each year!<br><br>Yes, there are the few who treat the Bible as a geology textbook and those who read The Origin of Species as a sacred scripture. Yet the lack of reasonable discussion in between astounds me. Frankly, I don’t think most people would consider this issue if it weren’t hyped so much!

It's what I wish had existed 35 years ago when I was attending a Lutheran college and studying chemistry. The college claimed to take a values-based approach to the study of knowledge but in practice that reduced to taking two courses in the religion department. It would have been so easy for the religion and the science professors to talk with each other and work out an understanding similar to the one you produced, and I would have found it highly beneficial. You will likely not be surprised to learn that the college is no closer to doing this now than it was then.<br><br>Tyler August and JMG: that comment thread inspired me to try something along the same lines. In my case it was using the word "gods" in place of the word "energies" in the invocation to Spirit Below which was the point I was then at in learning the Sphere of Protection. I'd used "energies" rather than "gods" because I considered myself an agnostic, maybe verging on atheist, at any rate not at all sure what the concept of god meant and not having had any sort of experience that might suggest its application. Let's just say that the effect of using "gods" was immediate. I'm still finding my way into this for me unfamiliar experience, but I can say that it doesn't conflict with my citizen science practice in any way and it adds to the richness of life.<br><br><a href=#c4406706016228307714 title="comment permalink">7/25/13, 10:12 AM</a><br><br>

I give credit to our host for sorting the wheat from the chaff, but it gladdens my heart to see that it's not all chaff. <br><br>@wiseman<br>I disagree with your point 2; science has very much overplayed the martyr card against the Catholic Church. If Galileo hadn't called the Pope an idiot in public (the Simplicio in his dialogue practically quotes Urban VIII at points) he would never have been censured. Bruno was executed for his heretical theological positions, and as far as I know, his scientific work played only a small role in his trial. Contemporary Jesuit astronomers were able to continue discussing the Copernican model, and likely would have had the Church reconcile itself to a sun-centered cosmology much sooner if it hadn't been for those two. <br>The "history of persecuting scientists" is largely, if not entirely, myth. <br>I think I know why the New Atheist movement so stridently spreads misconceptions about the history of science, but for a movement that claims to be founded on verifiable truths, it is incredibly disheartening. <br><br>@JMG. Thank you, of course I shall do just that. <br>And worry not, you won't have to moderate me on this issue; it would take a mighty thundering of trumpets and direct burning-bush command (which really doesn't fit into my world-view!) for me to be disrespectful enough to attempt to proselytize on this list.<br><br><a href=#c8631305457663338131 title="comment permalink">7/25/13, 10:30 AM</a><br><br>

Hard for me to add much more than, "preach it, Brother Archdruid!" but I will try.<br><br>As a young teenager, having had my "get saved / come to Jesus" experience and being formed in a fairly Fundamentalist church(1), the Creationist/Evolution debate loomed large in my mind for a while. Until I finally had the insight that, if God Who is Truth was the author of both Scripture and the cosmos, He surely would not be contradicting Himself.<br><br>Therefore, any apparent contradictions meant that either we were misunderstanding the theology or we didn't understand the natural order quite as well as we thought we did (or some mixture of both). God, however, was not confused on the topic. :)<br><br>I then ceased to worry about it. Crisis of faith averted. Years later, I learned that this was precisely what Aquinas taught(2), and as you note, was considered commonplace, beginner's study, by the medievals. I admit, this angered me -- why the (deleted) wasn't I taught this and left on my own to figure it out?! But that's another story.<br><br><i>"Science can’t answer that question, because science isn’t about values. (When people start claiming otherwise, what’s normally happened is that they’ve smuggled in a set of values from some religion or other—most commonly the civil religion of progress.)"</i><br><br>Thank you! I want to highlight this point. Since my insight, I have tried to share with those who have ears to hear (both my fellow Christians and those outside that faith who don't understand what the fuss is about) that it isn't the theory of evolution as a description of the created order that is the problem, but the smuggled values of a competing religion brought in under cover of "Science™!" It's not actual science that I object to -- it's the bad philosophy and bad religion masquerading as science that I have a problem with.<br><br>I don't think I've made much of a dent so far.<br><br>I hate to mention it(3), but there is a frustrating death of good science material for the Christian homeschooler. The Apologia books (Jay Wile) are the 800-lb gorilla on that block, and they exemplify the problems you outline. (The physics text isn't so bad, but the rest... well, I grit my teeth and rant a lot when using them.) Problem is, I've just plain been intimidated by the effort to start evaluation of secular texts and vet them for smuggled philosophy, and I really don't want to write my own,(3) so we're enduring it. <br><br>Still, I can't help but wonder how well a Thomistic high school science series would do.<br><br>peace,<br>Zach<br><br>(1) I am using "Fundamentalist" in the technical, not the pejorative, sense.<br><br>(2) Not comparing myself with the Angelic Doctor, of course, simply because I had the good grace to stumble upon one of his points on my own.

Good books are being replaced with simple essays from which kids are expected to glean facts and arguments, while would-be reformers obsess over test scores. Scoring well on standardized tests has become the purpose of much of our schooling, when the skills that matter - critical thinking, problem solving, the ability to listen to and try to understand those with other goals or perspectives, and make hard choices with limited information, among others - are not easily measured, and therefore largely cast aside.<br><br>Granted, there's plenty to debate about what role public schools should play in teaching students to decide things based on their values. Still, discerning when to use which faculty (logic and science or faith and values) is a skill that most children pick up (clumsily) by example from pop culture, when more nuanced discussion would probably benefit them more.<br><br>The broader discussion of the complementary nature of religion and science is important, and I'm looking forward to your contribution. <br><br>In the meantime:<br><br>"Do you recognize that the living Earth has its own order, that this order imposes certain hard constraints on what human beings can or should try to do, and do you embrace that order and accept those constraints in your own life for the greater good of the living Earth and all that lives upon her? Or do you shrug it off, or go through the motions of fashionable eco-piety, and hop into your SUV lifestyle and slam the pedal to the metal?"<br><br>On this binary, if I'm honest, I take a middle approach. In some ways it's not a viable option for me to accept as many constraints as other people do, but I certainly wouldn't say that I've got the pedal to the metal. It's a matter of constant reevaluation and guiding my efforts where I can make a difference in my own life without beating myself up for things which I haven't done yet.

At some point, maybe in a day or two, I hope you will accord me the opportunity to respond to what some other posters are saying in response to mine. For the moment, though, I offer just a couple of thoughts in response to your own reply:<br><br>A) While I appreciate – very much so - the fact that you personally accord the creationists the respect of not being stupid, most evolutionists do not. This is a prejudice that I myself shared for many decades, but it is one that needs to be dispelled. In point of fact, there are young earth creationist writers in the fields of biology, geology, molecular biology, chemistry and physics (including in those areas relevant for assessing the validity of radiometric dating methods), astronomy, ancient history, climatology, and other relevant areas of science who are fully credentialed experts in their respective fields. <br>Additionally, prominent academic evolutionists who engaged in public debates with creationists during the 1970s and 80s on some 300 to 400 documented occasions had a very hard time of it. By the evolutionists’ own account, they lost almost all of these debates – sometimes rather badly - and thus eventually stopped engaging in them. This is, to my mind, a great pity.<br><br><a href=#c1707011172039023632 title="comment permalink">7/25/13, 2:45 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c7178845217601559069></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/12451689362536912674 rel=nofollow>Nestorian</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>B) Permit me to make some remarks on what I understand the relevance and outcome of Ilya Prigogine’s project to have been (I might remark parenthetically that he was undoubtedly not a stupid man either). As a general matter, evolutionist responses to the claim that the principle of evolution and the second law of thermodynamics contradict one another make the point that there often exists an amount of active energy - in particular locations, at particular times - that is more than sufficient to bring about order and complexity from chaos and simplicity in a spontaneous and random fashion at that time and place. In other words, while increasing entropy is cosmically inviolate, there are temporary local exceptions where entropy can spontaneously and randomly decrease such that evolutionary developments take place in that locale (with the Second Law not being violated because the increase in entropy outside the locale in question that is associated with the evolutionary development is greater than the temporary, evolution-inducing decrease within). <br>The problem with these sorts of responses is that providing an energy source on a local basis to initiate random increases in order and complexity is indeed necessary to reverse entropy on a temporary and local basis, but it is not sufficient. If the action of random energy alone were sufficient to reverse entropy on a local and temporary basis, then there would be every reason to expect that enough years (millions, say) of sunlight energy incident on a disheveled pile of bricks could do the work of spontaneously ordering and complexifying the bricks into a building, through a local and temporary trumping of entropy by the physical principle of evolution. <br>But in order for complexity and order to result from chaos and simplicity via the action of ambiently available energy, the action of the energy on the potentially evolving contents of the locale must satisfy two additional conditions: 1) The energy must do work in accordance with a code or algorithm that provides the proper basis for operating in a structuring and ordering way, and for reversing the normal tendency for random energy to simply disperse, dissipate, and degrade; and 2) the energy must carry out its work by means of some kind of physical energy transfer mechanism present in the local environment that is able to direct the work of that energy in accordance with that code or algorithm.<br>What Ilya Prigogine effectively tried to do is to use sophisticated mathematical and physical modeling to show that it is theoretically possible for temporary local regions of concentrated ambient energy to spontaneously cause evolution even in the absence of either of the two additional conditions I have stipulated. That is, he tried to show that ambient random energy is theoretically capable of spontaneously and randomly increasing local order and complexity without either 1) an ordering code or algorithma, or 2) a locally present energy transfer mechanism that directs the energy to work in accordance with the code. To the extent that Prigogine’s models succeed in demonstrating such a theoretical possibility, they do so with as much (or as little) force for the ambient-sunlight-spontaneously-evolving-bricks-into-a-building-over-millions-of-years scenario as they do for any scenario of relevance for evolution as it supposedly unfolded over the eons (such as the scenario involving the spontaneous evolution of the first life form from inanimate matter).<br><br><a href=#c7178845217601559069 title="comment permalink">7/25/13, 2:56 PM</a><br><br>

In order to make the journey up the circles of Abred from cyanophyte to fully self-aware, sentient being, it's necessary, as the triad has it, "to know all things, to do all things, and to suffer all things." That means <i>all</i> things; each of us has been the hungry wolf and the deer it brings down and tears to pieces, and -- well, you can fill in the blanks yourself; the same principle applies on the human level as well. There's more to the Druid teaching than that, of course, but that's the short version. <br><br>Rhisiart, you're not the first person who's recommended Campbell's work to me.

Your suggestion -- that the gap that matters is in the source of the raw information from which natural selection selects -- is at least interesting, and deserves as much attention as any other hypothesis.

A nice diverse range of spiritual leanings on display (we even have our own Fundamentalist Atheist! Thanks for joing in, Georgi) and some good personal experience narratives. It's triggered a few more thoughts:<br><br>Re god: for quite a while, I focused my agnostic investigations on the question of the existence and possible nature of God. For me, a breakthrough came a few years ago, when I realized that, for my own spiritual journey, that wasn't the most important question. <br><br>Given our situation, in a world we're continually learning more about, it really does come down to my/our values. (I'll disagree a bit with JMG that "Values are always individual" -- perhaps to a hermit, but for those of us constantly engaged with families, communities, and societies, individual values are always affected by and affecting the web of relationships we find ourselves in. You could fold that under "... a particular context", but I think it's important enough to recognize explicitly.)<br><br>On evolution: like many scientific disciplines, evolution (the theory) has suffered from the materialist-reductionist orthodoxy imposed on it for the last century or so. It's not surprising to me that many people looking for meaning in the world have rejected the cramped, mechanistic view that has resulted. Fortunately, again like other scientific disciplines, it's gradually developing into a more nuanced and creative endeavor. (For a readable overview of some of this, Elisabet Sahtouris' "Earthdance" is worth a read.)<br><br>Speaking of the orthodoxy: I recently learned a fascinating term: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia rel=nofollow>synesthesia</a>. The Wikipedia article gives a good overview, and includes the following: <br>"Research into synesthesia proceeded briskly in several countries, but due to the difficulties in measuring subjective experiences and the rise of behaviorism, which made the study of any subjective experience taboo, synesthesia faded into scientific oblivion between 1930 and 1980." If anyone doubts that scientific disciplines can be subject to the same kind of rigid orthodoxies that bedevil, say, religions, this should dispel it. Fortunately, science has inbuilt mechanisms that provide ways to break out of such traps (see for example "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"). I'm beginning to think that the same is true of spiritual communities; perhaps Creationism will go the way of Behaviorism.<br><br><a href=#c2622900490133027995 title="comment permalink">7/25/13, 4:08 PM</a><br><br>

Suppose the laws of physics describe at the bottom level, every interaction in the universe just in the way that you imagine. What do you think those interactions mean? The patterns of interactions between neurons in your brain have a meaning in terms of cognition, beyond being describable by the biochemical laws that govern neuronal interaction - it's a qualitatively different kind of thing. The laws of physics describe the electrical interactions on the chips inside your computer very well - and the software that runs on them not at all. The software is an emergent system that "lives in" the pattern of interactions at the lower level.<br><br>Do you suppose that the interaction between components of the universe that are not neurons, have no analogous meaning? What do you suppose it is that "lives in" the pattern of atomic interactions across the universe? Nothing? That's not a testable idea, and hence is not in the domain of science. It's a matter of faith to state that there is no such meaning, just as it's a matter of faith to believe (or to imagine, if there's a difference) that there is. <br><br>In the druid terminology, I think your difficulty is in confounding the planes.<br><br>John Michael, thanks again for your inspiring work.

The challenge in talking across religious boundaries is finding those common themes, without trying to obscure the very real differences in how they're understood and enacted. <br><br>Nestorian, my take on Prigogine is a bit different. What he's proposing as a general law is that the flow of energy through an open system tends to increase the complexity of that system. That only works with open systems -- that is, systems that are subsets of a larger, wholly entropic system, and receive energy from a more highly concentrated source and release it in turn to a less concentrated sink in that larger system. Within those limits, his theory does a very good job of predicting what actually happens -- notaby in the field of ecology, which is where most of my scientific training was, but in other fields as well. (Ironically, the Prigogine theory explains, among many other things, Parkinson's Law!) <br><br>The bricks-into-buildings analogy is a poor one, in that it presupposes that the object being considered is an artifact rather than a natural phenomenon; I'd suggest, rather, that you consider the way that a devastated area recovers ecologically, proceeding from a very low level of ecological integration to the tightly integrated climax community. Nobody has to go through the future forest planting trees at just the right distances, etc.; the flow of energy through the open system, interacting with available resources, does the thing very nicely. <br><br>But we could probably argue this one back and forth until three weeks after the end of time, so I think it's probably best to draw a line under it here. <br><br>Matthew, that's a standard tactic of the current crowd of dogmatic atheists when they're faced with religions that aren't identical to their favorite caricature of Christianity. I lost count a long time ago of the number of times I've seen some atheist insisting to a Druid or a member of some other minority religion that the believer doesn't know what he or she is talking about, because by definition all religions blah blah blah. <br><br>Iuval, within the framework of classical theism, remember, the being in question <i>made</i> relativistic spacetime, and it and everything in it only exists by that being's deliberate choice. Could such a being make other beings who possessed free will? Well, the concept of omnipotence makes it hard to insist otherwise! <br><br>GreenEngineer, denying what obviously exists isn't faith, it's psychosis. Unfortunately there are far too many traditions that have lost track of the difference, and it's past time to clear that up. <br><br>Ohyes, I didn't get your earlier post -- Blogger eats comments sometimes. <br><br>Dwig, synesthesia is a great example.

Eternal beings wouldn’t have to foresee the future—they would simply see it, because to them, it’s not in the future. An omniscient eternal being can know exactly what you’ll do in 2025, not because you lack free will, but because there you are, doing it right out in plain sight, as well as being born, dying, and doing everything else in between. An eternal being could also see what you’re doing in 2025 and respond to it in 2013, or at any other point in time from the Big Bang to whatever final destiny might be waiting for the universe billions of years from now. All this used to be a commonplace of philosophy through the end of the Middle Ages, and it’s no compliment to modern thought that a concept every undergraduate knew inside and out in 1200 has been forgotten even by people who think they believe in eternal beings.”<br><br>(quoting in length for easy reference, apologize for using valuable comment space)<br><br>Whereas man’s free-will is saved, the free-will of our omniscience (God) is lost. For Him (or in His consciousness, assuming He got one) the future is the past, i.e. cannot be changed. He becomes a passive observer of humanity. And if He is an active being, he will be a frustrated one because his “activeness” cannot change anything in the order of things, or if He has consciousness, He “cannot change His mind” – in contrast, humans have free-will and can feel as an active agent - even though in the eyes of the omniscient we may look stupid thinking like this (well, as the logic goes!)<br><br>I think the postulation of a passive omniscience who created everything goes better with Buddhism than with Christianity. Buddhism doesn’t argue against a creator, but only that the subject matter is irrelevant theologically/spiritually. The central thesis of Buddhism is Nothingless. There is no meaning relegated to any omniscience of final appeal. Personal enlightenment of Nothingless is the spiritual route. The postulation of a passive omniscience does not seem to contradict Buddhist belief but goes directly against the belief system of the big three Monotheism in which the meaning of life is given by a loving or wrathful (or sometimes loving sometimes wrathful) God who plays the central role in our spiritual life.<br><br><a href=#c5354857500596265573 title="comment permalink">7/25/13, 9:56 PM</a><br><br>

There is a continuous tension, or struggle, between group values and individual values that eventually results in some sort of happy medium that maximizes overall welfare and survival. <br><br>Thus, successful values have a biological and evolutionary basis that, over time, become couched as religious values, and are most often taught as the revealed truth of some god or guru or space alien or whatever. Another way to state this is that religion has an evolutionary survival value component. Therefore, I must take exception to your assertion that science can have nothing to say about values.<br><br>Unfortunately, all the established religions I am aware of, including the civil religion of Progress, were formed when the earth and its resources seemed limitless.

Creationists may have no reason to engage in “proof” along scientific terms, but science itself is perhaps fooling itself when it deals with unknowables. The assumption is that creation occurred along some timeline in the past. But this “timeline” is merely a construct of our relatively feeble (or at least limited) minds. Perhaps the continuum of “reality” and consciousness/ life truly is without beginning in any linear sense. Now I understand that “string theory” and the like grapples with some 11 dimensions or so (perhaps a set of work-arounds à la Ptolemy?...); anyway, last I heard the questions were piling up much faster than answers. And that seems to be the trend: Science is a tool that opens up the mysteries of Nature/ the Cosmos. It’s essentially an exercise in humility – or, if you’re stubborn and you believe the “answer” is just over the horizon, hubris. <br>So, okay… but if Georgi et al lack some evidence to be conclusive, it is not logically sound for Nestorian et al to jump to the conclusion of “God”. Of course, anyone can jump to God anytime they like, but don’t suggest that it’s science! As a concept, God is a construct for our minds to paper over the unanswerable questions. As an actuality, God is sheer mystery…<br>Similarly, one can jump to the “Big Bang” and evolution, but don’t suggest that settles the matter… because it’ll always leave countless other questions un-answered. For example, neither one actually precludes the existence of God, even if it were to discredit the Bible as scientific text book.<br>Science refuses to paper over those unanswerable questions, but the questions don’t disappear, they multiply. So fractured and specialized is the leading edge of science in all fields, it becomes questionable what practical value the science itself holds beyond that of an essentially religious one of chasing the unknowables.<br><br>Now that I sit down to this, I realise I could go on and on, but I’ll leave it at that for now…<br><br>Cheers!<br><br><br><a href=#c7092638845746921221 title="comment permalink">7/26/13, 5:12 AM</a><br><br>

But perhaps we can continue our discussion privately and offline.<br><br><br>One other common misconception I would like to correct is that the modern fundamentalist insistence on the recency of creation and the generally literal character of the early chapters of Genesis is something new in Western cultural history. What is new is only the firm insistence on these beliefs in the face of the strident attacks on them with the rise of Modernity, not the beliefs themselves. There was no need to spend a lot of time and energy vigorously debating the youth of the earth, and the essential historical accuracy of the Genesis creation account and associated genealogies, with opponents in premodern times, given the broad consensus that prevailed concerning these matters in the premodern West. <br><br><br>(This consensus, by the way, includes none other than the illustrious scientists Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, both of whom developed their own exact world chronologies and dates of creation as one of the many premodern alternatives to Ussher’s. Many other of the early pioneers of science were fervent, non-evolutionistic Christians as well.)<br><br>Even early Christian writers of an allegorical bent (most notably Origen) did not generally reject the literal historicity of the early parts of the Bible, but merely insisted that the text contained further layers of meaning IN ADDITION to the literal. (By the way, the Nestorian Church has historically rejected multiply-layered allegorical modes of biblical interpretation that gained currency in Roman Catholicism and even more so in Eastern Orthodoxy. The Nestorian tradition has insisted instead on a generally univocal, rigorously historico-grammatical construal of the text – much as classical Protestantism was to do when it arose much later in Christian history.)<br><br>Further, here is a brief note to Robert Mathieson: The Nestorian Church is culturally Semitic (specificall,y Aramaic or Assyrian), not Greek. As such, the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament, with its distinct chronology that extends Ussher’s, Newton’s, Kepler’s, etc., by about 1000 years, would not have carried great weight with them, nor does it today. Instead, their early “in house” translation of the Old Testament was the Peshitta, translated directly from Hebrew into Syriac (i.e., Aramaic).<br><br>Lastly, I myself subscribe to the view that the Orthodox Jews have the exact chronology of the earth and cosmos correct. Their chronology, which is reflected in their official calendar dating system, is about 200 years shorter than Ussher’s, for reasons that I cannot fully recall offhand. But it has to do with ambiguities surrounding how some key Old Testament events were recorded. I side with the Jews on this one, as I trust them to have a more intimate knowledge of the culturally contextual factors that shape the interpretation of these ambiguities than gentile outsiders.<br><br><a href=#c477032640328488130 title="comment permalink">7/26/13, 5:14 AM</a><br><br>

I think it's because (as you pointed out endlessly here) it's very hard to all of us to direct a critical eye to something we are deeply invested in emotionally (most times since early childhood). I try to exercise that constantly and I ask myself of everything I discuss about: who benefits the most out of this particular conclusion to an argument, and how?<br><br>This has nothing to do with faith, gods or the worth of a faithful, and it's actually very problematic when any belief system tells you: you shouldn't question this too much, you're starting to sound like a .

As a trained engineer, and son of an engineer, I think this faith is related to the mindset and values instilled in me by my father, rest his soul. <br><br>I still hold that the ecological problems we face can be overcome with the insights available to us with science and meditation, clean nuclear power has come to my attention as a possibility (see Thorium - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium-based_nuclear_power), once the stigma of previous catastrophes is overcome (not a small problem). My faith in progress, however, is not based in specific scientific breakthroughs, but in the ability of the human intellect to apprehend reality and modify it through careful application of power.<br><br>As an ideal, it seems far-fetched in some ways, but I think that societal change away from bloody-minded capitalism would help with the pathfinding through the dense jungle of misguided dogma. There are directions available to us.<br><br>Corruption, institutionalism, the submission of our values to authority stand in our way, but the natural world shows us the correct path always.<br><br>I live in Ireland, and the beauty and wisdom of nature is so obvious to me here, I despair when I encounter a disregard for the simple values. All you need to do is go into the woods here, all the trails are marked with signs that say 'leave it as you found it'. <br><br>An appreciation of the the unknown is inherent in my own view of science - all breakthroughs so far have initially been met with derision - science to me is not the accepted teachings, it is the essence of the unknown and it's relationship to the inquiring mind.<br><br>'The quest for a common language' - what a great title, it is this quest for commonality with our fellow beings that drives so much of human activity, but despair and loneliness do not have to prevail, for me it is about hope and faith. As a wise man once said 'you can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you might find, you get what you need!'<br><br><br><br><a href=#c1207918895858953621 title="comment permalink">7/26/13, 7:44 AM</a><br><br>

A being who knows the past poses no problem for free will. But a being who knows all the future does. Whether it knows it by computing the solution to the classical equations of motion or the schrodinger equation, or by just seeing it from outside spacetime, it takes away the essential part of free will, namely that it could have gone another way, it wasn't deterministic (or just random either). The chaos theory answer is not satisfactory for me (that it is practically impossible to compute the solution to these equations, even for an omniscient being), because things are still deterministic. The quantum measurement solution comes closer to satisfying. While it demolishes determinism, it still does not offer a theory of how choice happens. The only glimmer of hope I have found for free will is a theory that has a built in asymmetry between past and future, such that certain regions of spacetime do not exist (or at least do not exist with a Lorentzian metric) until a choice, or measurement is made. If I were to use theological language I would say that these are regions where divinity or endless possibility resides and that creation (choice/measurement) consists of making the boundary between those regions and our spacetime move somehow. I know this sounds like philosophy, but I am trying to use mathematical physics (so e.g. the boundary between our spacetime and the divine realm is a surface where one or more of the eigenvalues of the spacetime metric goes to zero) and hopefully predict some non-trivial consequences that can be experimentally verified.<br><br>As far as evolution, it is in a peculiar state where so far no non-trivial predictions have been made that were verified experimentally about macro-evolution/speciation. This is essential for the scientific method. I think this should be pursued by scientists, to actually observe speciation events. Their excuse so far has been that it takes too long, or that all speciation is is reproductive isolation.<br><br><a href=#c7831939298981922826 title="comment permalink">7/26/13, 8:50 AM</a><br><br>

Some people I know can read Genesis and be comfortable with it being a poetic myth, teaching certain insights about humanity's developing ego or love of knowledge or relationship to nature or other interpretations. In other words they can use it as a signpost toward some greater truth, without needing to take it literally. And then other people read Genesis and can only take it literally, as history or geology, either holding tightly to it or rejecting it as a belief system, a set of factual propositions or firm concepts that have to be reacted to and agreed with or not. <br><br>I think one's basic temperament is an important part of where you sit on this spectrum, in particular how much fear fuels your basic outlook on the world, as well as what types of religious or spiritual teachers you listen to. <br><br>For sure religion will become more important again as a way of organizing our response to reality, as times get harder and more uncertain. But if we face that future with a lot of fear (which seems likely) then we're going to see religion infused with more fundamentalism/literalism, which could serve to divide us up into smaller tribes/groups with competing ideas rather than uniting us around common values.

A "passive omniscience" of the kind you've described doesn't correspond to the deity proposed by classical theism, since that deity created the universe and everything in it, and is active in it at every moment -- which is hardly a passive stance toward the cosmos, wouldn't you say?<br><br>Wiseman, no argument there. I'm simply wondering about the specifics of failure in this particular case. <br><br>Shark, true enough. <br><br>Cromberg, I'd say rather that all our current religions have been drastically distorted by three hundred years of previously unimaginable abundance. Most of them still have traces of an earlier time in which poverty was accepted as a normal and even a beneficial state, to note only one adaptation to a world of scarcity. It'll be interesting to see whether any of them can reclaim that heritage, or whether they'll be replaced by new faiths that have learned the old lessons for themselves. <br><br>Miles, understand who's using or misusing which words and you've just dodged a good three-quarters of all human confusion. Yes, it's a hard slog!<br><br>Bill, nah, if I'd hired somebody to play Nestorian's role I'd have found someone with a less interesting religious background. As for the bricks, granted -- I like the chicken metaphor a bit better, though, since it's a perfect example of an open system a la Prigogine, in which the flow of energy through a system creates increased complexity over time. <br><br>Kyoto, of course science has its limits, and has been trying to pretend otherwise in recent years. That's standard for this stage of the historical cycle. I'll be talking about that shortly. <br><br>Nestorian, thank you. Of course people before about 1700 were all convinced of a young earth; outside of India and Mesoamerica, where the concept of deep time emerged early on, nobody anywhere imagined that the world could be more than a few thousands or tens of thousands of years old. To my mind, the discovery of deep time was one of the great intellectual adventures of the modern world, and it's one of the things that I hope will be saved from the wreck of the industrial world; obviously you'd disagree with that, I know.<br><br>Atilio, sshh! You'll scare my readers. ;-)<br><br>Sgage, that's certainly been my perception all along. <br><br>Orc, excellent! The problem of evil can certainly be solved, it just requires a ruthless indifference to what you've sensibly described as a sense of entitlement. Given a lot of the rhetoric that's clustered around Western religions in recent centuries, though, that indifference has been fairly rare.<br><br>Chris, I appreciate your willingness to describe your belief in progress as a faith. It is, of course, in the full religious sense of that word. If that's the faith that speaks to you, by all means pursue it; I think you're doomed to disappointment -- over thorium reactors, but more generally over the belief in the omnipotence of the human intellect -- but if that's the path you need to walk, that's the path you need to walk.<br><br><a href=#c5916090618365177067 title="comment permalink">7/26/13, 12:06 PM</a><br><br>

Predestination always struck me as a bit of a blunt instrument when talking about the interaction between an eternal being and a world in time, but it's one way of trying to get a finite mind around an infinite issue! As for the Ediacaran and Vendian faunas, er, given the extremely fragmentary nature of late Archean fossil deposits, that we've got as much to go on as we do is little short of a miracle -- a point that Darwin discussed in a different context in <i>The Origin of Species</i>. <br><br>Robert, thanks for the link! <br><br>Iuval, it seems to me that you've neglected the solution that classical theism proposes, which is that of an observer outside of time, capable of perceiving all of time simultaneously, who is also the creator of time and everything in it. The various quantum and relativistic solutions don't apply to a being who created every last quark! As for evolution, I'm not sure why nobody's made such predictions; the two cases I cited -- the emergence of the Eastern coyote, and the explosive radiation of cichlid fishes in the lakes of East Africa -- could easily justify specific predictions, though it would probably take a couple of centuries to see how things come out. <br><br>Steve, that reminds me of those eerie late 19th century experiments that found that the human body loses a small but measurable amount of weight at the moment of death...<br><br>Yupped, well, an age of unparalleled abundance also managed to pup quite a bit of hardcore fundamentalism, so I'm not sure how much more we have to fear about an age of hardship. <br><br>GreenEngineer, I'll be talking about that in an upcoming post. The short form is that it's not actually that hard to figure out what we can know and what we can't. Taking a position on faith about something that can be known by observation and experiment is a shaky decision, and taking a position that contradicts what can be known by observation and experiment is normally a very bad idea. There are, however, issues that can't be settled by observation and experiment, where any decision at all must be made on the basis of values instead. Do gods exist? That can't be answered yes-or-no on the basis of any evidence available to us, and yet sweeping consequences unfold from any possible answer. Those are the issues in which faith, guided by values and character, is the only option there is.

The professor had describe a particular system of divination practiced by the Naskapi Indians called scapulamancy. The scapula of a deer was placed in a fire, where it cracked as it heated. The cracks were thought to form a map-- a message from the deer spirits, presumably-- which the people could follow to find more deer. The result is that the hunters followed the map, and found the deer.<br><br>According to the professor, the effect of the divination was to randomize the Naskapi hunting pattern, thus preserving the population of deer in the area. But it occurred to me that it actually didn't matter which explanation you accepted. Was it the randomizing factor, or the message of the spirits, that allowed the hunters to regularly find game? The results are the same whichever explanation you choose! But what's not the same is your view of the world you live in, your own place in it, and the mental tools with which you can navigate it. <br><br>Of course, an agile mind would be able to move back and forth between the two, depending upon what was appropriate for each situation.<br><br><a href=#c4411740096341192764 title="comment permalink">7/26/13, 1:54 PM</a><br><br>

The best example of this is the standard issue healing. The person is either healed or stays sick. Yes, it's annoying that you are still sick, but nothing "worse" happened (except that you will now be less likely to believe in divine magic).<br><br>Do I have the faintest idea *why* it doesn't *always* work, but rather only works about 0.1% of the time? Nope. It's kind of annoying to me, however the answer is out there.<br><br>I don't know whether JMG wants to address this, but you can really, really misuse JMG's magic (is it so-called ceremonial magic, JMG? I'm not trolling, I'm just not familiar with your kind of magic except that it seems to be quite functional. And I'm not going to toy with it (my ex-girlfriend's relatives apparently had significant experience with it).<br><br>I've been arguing this point regarding free will and evil recently on other blogs. It appears to be "evil" and "free will" season.<br><br>I'm also not using so-called because I'm trying to denigrate these things, I just think that's what people call them.<br><br>I used some of Meditations on the Tarot to draw some of this together. That's a useful book if you are the kind of person to whom such a book would be useful. It was quite useful to me, but then I'm not really like the other people here in the trailer park, am I? (I listed to that song way too much in the early 1990's)<br><br>I also find the Jain cosmology model somewhat helpful.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jain_universe.JPG<br><br>Except for the fact that the area they call "Siddhalia - Abode of the Liberated Beings" is where God appears to radiate into creation (from our perspective) and the Aloka-space outside the universe is God. Since I'm a fan of the tzimtzum theory of creation.<br><br>First God created the void, an area of zero *within* God, and worked from there.<br><br>Which leads me back to the issue of creation being like a Klein Bottle.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle<br><br>What's at the top? God.<br><br>What's the boundary? God.<br><br>Don't ask me if Siddhalia is the highest octave of creation where the new universes are sung into creation. Because I don't know. I've never been there. However, if they did sing universes into creation there, the would have to get the plans from God by going into God and getting them.<br><br>However, if I was to go there, I would probably be able to only tolerate about 10 seconds, as opposed to the people who actually *lived* there and had the universe singing into creation hobby.<br><br>And I am *so* not going to try to astrally project myself there or anything (not that I *can* astsrally project...I've never tried it, and I'm not going to try to learn it either.) I've got better things to do than spontaneously combust.<br><br>And as a parting note, I would like to remind everyone that if you see a door to hell open, you don't stand around theorizing about the nature of hell, you *shut the door*. It's not like hell is *sane* and I for one like the ability to think clearly (when I've had enough sleep).<br><br>And timelessness takes time. Fortunately, we're immortal. Which is also a problem.

Really we love y’all y’know!<br><br>I am puzzled by much human behaviour, including my own, so I do not hold it against individuals or indeed societies that they construe 'the external world' in terms of any idiosyncratic 'internal cosmos' or a social version thereof [Bill’s reference to recruits from Central Casting plus his choice picked from the real world of a quantifiable model in the form of chicken &amp; egg]. I take it that such internal models [however odd] and the social forms they are nested within are often accretions of models - even personalities - acquired from others during the normal formation of us as individuals [Ghung @ the dentists in the Bible Belt with somebody and his Granny]. If there is a problem, it seems to be in the ‘self-centred’ nature of social grouping [ain’t the USA just wonderful!]. The USA has been an accretion of small groups each having a highly motivated sense of self-identity but needing to find an answer to diversity. The need for a founding script, some kind of cultural DNA, appears evident [Take your pick].<br><br>I am curious then how a few of your readers when holding on [all credit due] to accretions of more idiosyncratic interpretations of reality must quarantine information such as the following fragment from a recent study of the larger cosmos: much has followed from looking through a telescope or down a microscope or from making careful maps of what can be seen, or indeed from just counting beans.<br><i>NGC 1277, a compact lenticular galaxy located in the Perseus Cluster, hosts a black hole 17 billion times as massive as the Sun.

Yet we (or some of us, anyway) have religious/numinous experiences and experience the living earth in a numinous way. So. The only place in a deterministic universe where that could operate might be at the level of indeterminacy, where said omnipotent being could also operate without messing with the laws of physics, etc. because to do the last might be unethical according to how the omnipotent being set up the universe. Of course there could also be a category of the deterministically numinous that we haven't figured out how to apply science to. :)<br><br>Also, the problem of evil: I believe that much of what we think of as evil is natural processes occurring that happen to harm humans--tragic, awful perhaps,but not really evil. This might be the ecological view. <br><br>I think of evil as what happens when humans harm other humans and the living earth on purpose, on a sliding scale from minor to horrific--and that has something to do with free will. And if we are given free will, then I guess it's not going to be taken away when we contemplate doing or actually do something hurtful. So evil exists as a byproduct of free will in our universe. But so does love and care for others and the earth.<br><br>Looking forward to the next post and resultant comments!<br><br><a href=#c1623172627827647605 title="comment permalink">7/26/13, 3:41 PM</a><br><br>

The positivitists among both the atheists and the fundamentalists will loudly protest. But to many more it represents a very attractive way to relate to the human religious impulse in our age of technical possibilities and ecological limits. <br><br>Having lived with the ideas you describe for some time, I am thinking about where they lead. If one takes the call to 'apprehend the order of the cosmos in love and awe' and tries to expresses it in a scientific framework, you come up with something like 'a human chooses to use their complicated neural circuitry that produces positive affirmation of relationships and religious humility in the presence of the transcendent in seeking to understand the world around them. ' Not nearly as eloquent or attractive as your phrase, but it highlights the central role of the human mind in things religious. Presumably we also use our observational, logical, and quantitative skills as well when we apprehend. What seems to be happening is that some of the simplifications that the human mind has used to comprehend the world are being replaced by more accurate approximations using the tools of science. So in the past someone may have thought that their tribe was spared famine because they worshipped correctly whereas now we build irrigation systems and hope we as a species do not so damage the broader ecosystem that it stops replenishing our water supply. <br><br>One might say that 'love' and 'awe' are such approximations. I would respond that they are so deeply ingrained in us that we can not function without using these approximations so we had best place these approximations in the most harmonious relationship possible with the world as it is. Sorry if this isn't clear...the quest for a common language is long and rarely ends in easy triumph. In short, I think we are learning to understand the mental and social systems we use to implement our 'values' so that statements like 'science isn’t about values' start to be equal parts false and true. Science is developing an understanding of how humans use values to apprehend their world. But science does not allow us to transcend being human so we still must adopt some values that can accurately be called religious values for the process of living as humans. <br><br><br><a href=#c1676277998000191420 title="comment permalink">7/26/13, 5:52 PM</a><br><br>

You get tonight's gold star for noting that the explanation and the phenomenon are two different things, and a practice that works can be understood to work in many different ways. <br><br>JP, good. Life as something distinct either from nonliving matter or disembodied mind is something that's given thinkers in the Western world hiccups since the death of the Renaissance. One of the things that helped kickstart the Druid Revival was the willingness, among a handful of British eccentrics, to challenge the resulting prejudice. <br><br>Crow, that's certainly a hypothesis worth testing...<br><br>JP, hmm! That's an interesting theology, to be sure. You won't find a lot of other religions that agree with you that human beings are the only access points divinity has to the universe, admittedly! <br><br>Phil, from my own religious viewpoint, the vision of the universe presented by modern science -- a universe so vast in space and time that human pretensions are exposed as silly, and humility becomes the only appropriate stance toward the cosmos -- is profoundly moving. No, I don't get why people exclude that, either. <br><br>Marcello, good. I've been arguing this for quite some time -- science is far more vulnerable to collapse and abandonment than most people realize, and it could happen fairly quickly. I'll be talking about that shortly. <br><br>Adrian, I think it's important for everyone -- whether it's "in their league" or not -- to reflect on issues of this kind, and test their own beliefs and actions against the profound issues that are raised by any attempt to make sense of our human condition. <br><br>Ganv, what gets interesting is that "worshipping correctly" in many ancient societies includes actions that are extremely practical from an ecological standpoint. In ancient Greece and in Japan (ancient, medieval, and modern), for example, certain areas were set aside as sacred groves where no tree was to be cut and no livestock pastured. With remarkable frequency, sacred groves assigned to agricultural deities (Demeter in Greece, Inari in Japan) are in places where a good solid patch of natural vegetation will prevent erosion from getting started and damaging the fields. So there's a good deal more richness in the old traditions -- even when they're justified by purely mythic narratives -- than many people nowadays ever realize.<br><br><a href=#c7503013770682880601 title="comment permalink">7/26/13, 6:25 PM</a><br><br>

I'll be talking about that shortly.”<br><br>Yes, the loss of even what would seem to be essential techniques in smallish, isolated groups of humans seems quite common. The problem being that it may take thousands of years to perfect that technique, say, spear throwers or science, but it only takes two or three generations to lose it.<br><br>The key there is that they are isolated, but more of that later.<br><br>The other way seems to be when a great empire comes very messily apart with a huge and long-term reduction in population, as I gather Rome did. The much smaller population had so much “stuff” lying around they did not need to manufacture some items (say, concrete) for those critical two or three generations, then of course it was too late.<br><br>What I think will save science this time is that any coming collapse is likely to be slow, stepwise and very complex, as I think most of us agree. In different locations it will vary from cataclysmic to barely noticeable, or perhaps even just a great opportunity for some communities. Isolation is not going to be a factor over most of the world.<br><br>Under those circumstances, given the relentless hard-wired competition between individual humans and groups of humans, science is just too useful.

The probability of all of them mutating in a concerted fashion (or even independently) is negligible even on cosmological timescales. The naturalistic solution is that they don't all mutate.

In different locations it will vary from cataclysmic to barely noticeable, or perhaps even just a great opportunity for some communities. Isolation is not going to be a factor over most of the world.<br>Under those circumstances, given the relentless hard-wired competition between individual humans and groups of humans, science is just too useful.

Science could provide the means to produce more advanced weapons and machinery. However as we head in the descent phase resources are going to get tighter and tighter. Paying the trigger pullers and keeping the existing infrastructure at least partly going will be hard enough. The money/resources to procure newfangled weapons and technologies won't be there and therefore most likely the money to research them in first place won't be available either. Since the scientific ground that could be covered on the cheap without substantial number of specialists and expensive instrumentation has alredy been covered my best guess is that most scientists will find themselves cultivating potatoes. What happens next I have no idea, but even if the scientific method survives, and it is not a given, it will be stuck on the same grounds already covered by people like Newton or Mendel.

Coupled to this is the idea that much of what constitutes areas of knowledge not subject to empirical validation (including historical understandings) is produced by the simple psychological process of “projection” with this taking place where and when there are little to no substantial external references. However, the same psychological process produces the human ability to deal with the physical world in ways that on analysis are literally “ mind boggling”.<br>It is, also, not generally understood that it is difficult for the mind to comprehend certain aspects of reality and nonreality, without training. Being able to do so constitutes a genuine powerful learned ability. Sadly it is not taught or developed except by life experience, itself. This results in a very low capability for most people. Your call to look rigorously at the “here and now” is seriously undermined by this circumstance, though the effort is badly needed, anyway. <br>A follow on to this is my sincere opinion that the whole area of discussion that is involved with “religious belief” etc. is an utter waste of time. This is because the human concern that entails acceptance of concepts such as deities, is simply a product of the natural predilection to accept the outcome of projective thinking without critical examination. A lot of this was done in the more distant past and some correction is taking place, now. <br>There is available, through excellent research efforts, how “projection” operates as an essential element in human cerebration. The knowledge obtained clearly shows that much greater diligence needs to be exercised to avoid the positing of nonsense, as wisdom. This is very vitally connected to the derivatives, belief and faith, as well.<br><br>All the Best<br>Ben Simon <br><br><br><a href=#c2355448862202253683 title="comment permalink">7/27/13, 2:36 PM</a><br><br>

Because if there is any answer, then why must reason remain silent on the subject? Any reason for preferring one value system over another is just that - a reason. And if one chooses a value system based on intensely personal reasons that are completely incommunicable to anyone else, than how is it possible to even discuss value systems, or religions, *at all*? The fact that our host, and each commenter, feels competent to promote some value system in ways that are comprehensible, and even persuasive, to others, shows that, even if it is our heart and will that chooses a value system, they do not do so for reasons that are arbitrary or completely alien.<br><br>For instance, the hypothetical person who claims at the end of this week's essay that "they'll think of something" is quite simply wrong, as Mr. Greer has shown in considerable detail over the course of writing this blog. I have abandoned the civil religion of progress because it makes real predictions about the physical world that Mr. Greer has convinced me are wrong, wrong, wrong.<br><br>Now let's take the True Believer in the civil religion of progress who, rather than saying "I'm sure they'll think of something", accepts the evidence that progress is coming to an end and that we're moving to a deindustrial future through a slow process of catabolic collapse. They see that all that their value system says is most valuable is ending, and decide to kill themselves rather than have to live in a world that their value system says is worthless. Doubtlessly, most of you would say that that is a bad decision. I agree! But how could you convince them of it? How, given that choosing of a value system is a non-rational thing that is beyond the domain of science or logic?<br><br>Now, none of this is meant to be an argument against theism. I am given to understand that, actually, the metaphysical arguments for theism (although not Classical Theism) are much better than previous generations of atheists had imagined. Could be! I don't know; that's why I'm an agnostic. It's not any particular value system I'm objecting to; it's placing any widely-discussed area of human experience outside of access of reason - and then continuing to discuss it. While, indeed, "that whereof we cannot speak, we must remain silent", we can clearly speak *a lot* about values and religion.<br><br><a href=#c7018037416547200175 title="comment permalink">7/27/13, 3:11 PM</a><br><br>

So again, thank you for being a small voice of reason in this stupid battle. <br><br>I have often thought about the nature of subjective and objective reality, and as a scientist and a believer that Nature is as close to God as we'll ever see, the importance of the scientific method in bridging the two.<br><br>You said,<br>"Step beyond questions of fact, and you’re in the territory of faith"<br><br>I can safely assert that your studies of ecology have informed your religion, and though you made the distinction between the two realms, I wonder if that distinction is necessary or real. <br><br>The laws of nature inform my values, and inform me as to the nature of what "God" might be. The facts of behavior of social animals inform my morals, and though it's evolutionary in nature, it doesn't change the importance of empathy and friendliness to other living beings. I would say it's our greatest strength, in fact, and the origin of nature centered religion, and perhaps religion in general. The facts of psychology and neurology inform my notion of self. The laws of physics inform my notions of what the soul could be. <br>etc, etc, etc.<br>But I'm also drawn to the writings of the Taoists and Buddhists, to Thoreau and Muir, to Jesus and the Gnostics, to the modern humanists and old ethical philosophers, etc, and those inform my life as well.<br><br>It is a balancing act, to be sure, but to me, at least, there is no distinction.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines the scientific method as: "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.”<br><br>While I’m relaxed about the survival of the Scientific Method, I am very concerned about the survival of the current vast vista of scientific theory, observations and data, much of it sitting on corporate, government, NASA and other such computer systems. We don’t even require a collapse to lose vast swathes of that, just a new CEO doing a “spring clean” of “useless old data”.<br><br>If John Greer’s vision of the future turns out to be more accurate than mine (and we differ in degree not kind) much of that will be irreplaceable as Large Hadron Colliders, Mars Landers and the like will be unaffordable. If it is lost those scholars and scientists of the future will only have vague references to that irreplaceable data, as our scholars have references to Roman and Greek works long lost when the great libraries were destroyed.<br><br>If much of it survives, however, given how much has been hardly looked at as current scientists are swamped in an Amazon of raw data, those future scientists and scholars will not only have plenty to occupy themselves, but will even be able to wring the occasional entirely new discovery from it.<br><br>As I said, I have few fears for the survival of the actual technique of science, the Scientific Method. After all, science’s parents, Mathematics and Logic, came through the Roman collapse and logic anyway is far less immediately useful than science.<br><br>In fact, I suspect a good argument could be made that logic actually reached its peak in late medieval universities, where as John Michael Greer points out on occasion, “every undergraduate” had a better grasp of logic than most of today’s educated.<br><br>Given the rather shaky grasp of the Scientific Method many current scientists seem to have, I would not be surprised if in 2513, in the great university that gives the small city of Rockhampton Australia it’s reason for existence “every undergraduate” is expected to have a much better grasp of the Scientific Method, and it’s parents Mathematics and Logic, than about any current scientist, scholar or philosopher. In fact, I suspect the Twentieth and Twenty First centuries will be looked back on as being rather crude and ill-educated.<br><br>Stephen Heyer<br><br><a href=#c7744023697616050797 title="comment permalink">7/27/13, 5:37 PM</a><br><br>

Wishing to honor his politely communicated request, I did not intend to press the point any further. However, I do think that your own stated take on the issue warrants a response<br><br>The issue is by no means as simple as you are making it out to be. If you are claiming that millions of years of the sun hitting the earth brought about today's complexity because both the algorithm that encodes the ordering process, and a physical energy transfer mechanism to implement the code, were available in the temporally and locally limited negative entropic zones where evolution supposedly unfolded, you are begging the question. Those two necessary conditions are precisely what Prigogine's speculations cannot explain, for the very reason that they constitute the essence of what needs to be explained in the first place. To explain an increase in order and complexity by introducing a cause for the increase that itself embodies – in both informational and physical terms - the order and complexity to be explained explains nothing; it is an empty tautology (which is logically tantamount to a circular chain of reasoning).<br><br>If, on the other hand, you choose not to beg the question by introducing these two necessary conditions into your explanation as a sort of deus ex machine (which phrase, if you think about it, is basically a synonym for “miracle”), then you must try to account for how the ambient light of the sun could cause bricks to turn into buildings in their absence. But in the absence of both a code for providing orderly direction to the work the sunlight does, and a physical mechanism that happens to be locally available for implementing the code, the sun would no more change a pile of bricks into something ordered over millions of years than it does in a single day. <br><br>So, as I see it, in order to overcome the crux of the second law of thermodynamics, evolution either assumes that which it needs to prove, or it needs to posit the spontaneous, random increase in order and complexity as an effect for which the only informationally and physically adequate cause cancels out the the claimed nature of the effect as being essentially evolutionary – that is, as involving an increase in order and complexity relative to the algorithm and physical energy transfer mechanism that bring about the effect, in tandem with the randomly available local flux of energy. <br><br>As I understand Prigogine, he tried to avoid the logical circularity horn of this dilemma by positing elaborate physical and mathematical speculations that, in the end, lack any kind of informationally or physically adequate cause. So he is left with a supposed effect that lacks any kind of adequate cause that wouldn’t contradict the very effect to be explained.<br><br>Note, finally, that it is neither irrational to withhold assent to circular reasoning, nor is it irrational to withhold assent to speculative claims that certain effects have occurred in a spontaneous and random fashion despite the absence of any possible cause that could bring them about without contradicting the very nature of the claimed effect.<br><br>I will say no more about the matter, however, other than to invite you to continue this discussion with me privately via email. If you wish to do so, then perhaps we could ask our host to mediate a direct line of communication between us. I, for one, would find it both enjoyable and intellectually productive to do so.<br><br><br><br><a href=#c861128353366695197 title="comment permalink">7/27/13, 7:43 PM</a><br><br>

The one sense is reasoning from premises--which is the domain of logic in all its forms. This is the domain in which concepts like "true" and "false" can be applied. <br><br>The other sense is the process of choosing the premises in the first place. While this can be done intelligently or stupidly, or with a good heart or a rotten heart, in this domain "true" and "false" cannot be applied at all. What can be applied in this second domain are concepts like "good" and "bad." Now, as Greer elaborated in a previous post one of the best ways to see what premises are good or bad is to look and the consequences of the premises and see if these are good or bad. But, as helpful as this technique is, it still does not tell you how to choose what is good and bad--that comes from your values. Science can never decide this, and if you want to smuggle your values into science, well you should at least be aware in your own mind that you are cheating, which you should not do unless you have . . . ummm . . . a really good reason for doing so. <br><br>--Gaianne<br><br><a href=#c1989395846825732764 title="comment permalink">7/27/13, 8:01 PM</a><br><br>

Accepting anything other than a single idea about how the universe etc runs would feel physically threatening, hence when discussions of this type come up, people feel physically threatened and can in some cases, violently and abusively lash out (I am impressed at how well restrained commentators on this blog are on the whole).<br><br>Its a shame too. An acceptance of all kinds of different ways of being/ ways of living/ belief systems leads, in my opinion, to a much happier well for-filled life. Dogmatic isolation by contrast, merely leads (in the long run) to depression or worse.<br><br>Thanks too for clarifying the word 'eternal'. Its interesting because Thomas Aquinas specifically cites this as a source of law. (I'm a law student btw)/ I wonder how much legal jurisprudence has cottoned on the to word 'out of time' meaning eternal. not 'for all time'?<br><br><a href=#c7149093999095210696 title="comment permalink">7/27/13, 8:13 PM</a><br><br>

But in that case, any eternal beings lie outside the space-time manifold. This is easy--mathematically!--since any manifold can always be embedded in a manifold of (sufficiently) higher dimension. The catch comes when you ask whether any such embedding is real. It might be. But how would you know? <br><br>Right now cosmologists are playing with multiple universes--as a possible solution of the long neglected problem of the source of the big bang. And the universes lie in a hyperuniverse, and again, mathematically, this is easy. The problem comes when we ask what observation we might make to test if any of this is true. So far, it all seems pure (though fun) speculation. <br><br>However, before we even go down that road there is no reason whatever to think that all knowledge should fit into the frameworks of physics. Only that it should not directly contradict physics. <br><br>--Gaianne<br><br><a href=#c2417773692201744597 title="comment permalink">7/27/13, 8:18 PM</a><br><br>

As for life, vitalism's one of those awkward ideas -- very hard to defend within the framework of accepted science, very hard to avoid in practice outside it, especially if you mess with martial arts, acupuncture, etc. <br><br>Orlandu, no argument there. The difference between evolution and the ideologies that have been heaped on top of it is something that needs a lot more discussion than it's gotten. <br><br>Edward, by all means diagram it out! If it's helping you keep your mind nimble, all the better. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, very elegantly translated! Thank you. <br><br>Ben, thank you. I don't think, for what it's worth, that discussing religious belief is a waste of time, nor am I quite as sure as you are that all that's going on there is sheer projection -- well, any more than it's projection to think of gravitational acceleration in mathematical terms, when a falling rock isn't figuring out how fast it can go with a slide rule! All we have to go on, in understanding the world, are mental models that we project onto the inkblot patterns of perception; gods are one set of models that address one range of human experience, laws of gravity are another that addresses a different (and much more easily quantifiable and testable) range. <br><br>Unknown, it's one thing to talk about something, it's another thing to be able to subject it to rigorous proof. Consider two people in love. Can you turn an erotometer on them and measure the intensity of their affection for each other? No, and none of the available methods of study can touch more than a very peripheral sense of what they're experiencing -- but what they're experiencing is a familiar reality to most people, and one that can be talked about. Think back on relationships you've had and you may well recall times when the right (or wrong) word caused a dramatic change in the way the relationship went; the same is true of other nonrational aspects of human behavior, including the choice of a belief system. <br><br>Patrick, I'm not suggesting that there's a wall. I'm suggesting that there are things that can't be proved or disproved by scientific means that still matter, profoundly, to human beings. The fact that scientific knowledge can have something to say to some of those things doesn't make them testable by the scientific method -- and that's my point. <br><br>Stephen, I apologize for biting your head off. I just wish that someday, when I mention my serious concern that the scientific method and most of what goes with it could be lost completely if nobody steps up to the plate and does something to preserve it, that comment wouldn't inevitably get dismissed out of hand! <br><br>Leo, that's a possibility, but here again, it's precisely the habit of treating it as a certainty that makes me worry that the whole kit and caboodle will be lost forever, because nobody anywhere puts in the time and labor to make sure it will survive. <br><br>Tom, the conversation here is as calm and friendly as it is because I chuck trolls out the door the moment they start trolling!

You say “to questions of ultimate concern—of value, meaning and purpose—which science can’t and shouldn’t address and are instead the proper sphere of religion”<br>I would suggest that “they are the proper sphere of ethics” as the more inclusive term thereby allowing atheists to play in this important space. A surprising large chunk of this space is also susceptible to analysis by science if we chose to start experimenting on ourselves; for example to find the social conditions and values that most satisfy our needs.<br>Lastly you say “Step beyond questions of fact, that is, and you’re in the territory of faith” which I don’t see as quite true. Sir Karl Popper would, I suspect disagree rather violently, and science as she should be practiced is surely only using the best available hypothesis until it is disproved or crucially until a less complex one is suggested that fits all the known facts. Thus science often deals in opinion and usually only gets into trouble when scientists have a little too much faith in their hypothesis.<br>Thanks again for a stimulating read.<br><br><br><a href=#c7482474665640352200 title="comment permalink">7/28/13, 12:40 AM</a><br><br>

OBJECTION !<br>I hate beating on a dead horse, but I think that your response to my last comment was not quite adequate or fair. My point is that theistic belief is derived from projective thinking that has NO references except the circuitous paths of subjective ruminations. Classically, we have the familiar remark, ”If there is anything such as a “God”, by way of its definition, such should be patently obvious, but, in fact, there is literally nothing to see, hear or feel, etc.” The proposed, most massive entity in our existence is unperceivable, except as a product of our own imaginative minds. There are other similar issues, but this one is illustrative, enough. I have no objection to accepting ideas that are derived from some minimal reasonable level of perceptive veracity or that may even be obtained second hand, so to speak. <br> I think that in some distant future one of the more common critiques of present day humanity will contain the observation that it is really hard to comprehend just how incompetent our thinking efforts were because of our lack of discipline and humility and in the face of so much of what we now have as information about the human brain and its functioning. There are many other areas where the same idea applies, but, enough for now. <br><br>In all due respect and with<br> Best Regards,<br>Ben Simon <br><br><br><a href=#c9158354903292688981 title="comment permalink">7/28/13, 1:32 AM</a><br><br>

Perhaps there is also an element of my personality that is slightly disgruntled this week. <br><br>In the eyes of the law here an oak tree (or any other exotic species) - despite their worth - is not the equivalent of the eucalyptus obliqua (messmate) indigenous over-story and I will feel the full weight of the law should I implement my grand plan or attempt to manage the forest in any way shape or form. This has given me much for me to ponder. At the same time it would be nice if something - anything actually - consumed those trees as there may then be a better balanced eco-system. Oh well.<br><br>Back to the topic at hand though. With rights comes responsibilities and “dominion” to my mind implies both. My gut feel is that people focus on the former and really try to forget the latter. <br><br>To ignore the responsibility part of the equation puts people in a bind so they look for an easy way out and one such way is an interventionist God. Great, mum and/or dad is coming to clean up the mess for us! hehe!

Perhaps more seriously some of the phenomena themselves, like habitats, species, samples etc. disappear before they can be studied. Where there are long series such as medical or soil samples, or inventories of seeds or any germplasm for that matter, these are ‘gold’ for patient investigators bringing tools especially tools that go beyond anything the old microscopes or other previous methods could provide. International efforts to maintain ‘seed banks’ are ongoing but I have sad personal experience of what physically disappears when habitats that once contained the diversity are lost and when what is available is only in a very vulnerable seed bank. It is sobering to remember that for some agricultural crops much of the remaining diversity resides not in the ‘wild’ but in the diversity of ‘gene banks’ maintained ‘at cost’ by vulnerable subsistence farmers.<br> <br>The developments in mathematics that allow sophisticated, and yes, digital, handling of probability and numerical models, with the hardware itself, are vital to much of the value of the current scientific methods even when a data base is preserved and accessible on record. And, legacy data bases and physical records cost an arm &amp; leg to maintain in working condition. This soaks up real resources and ‘triage’ goes on the whole time. I hope you can continue to promote respect and a sense of priority and actually help us find means to identify and maintain ‘kernels’ of key value!<br><br>A couple of notes:<br>My recent learning experience with building a compost toilet was at a Bahai community. I had forgotten that one of their founding principles is that ‘science and religion’ are two wings of the flying bird, and I quote “religion that contradicts science or that is opposed to it is only ignorance” … or words to that effect.<br> <br>I think that ‘habitat restoration’ is in many places a worthy goal and probably confers ‘high leverage’ at lower cost as a contribution to ‘future science’.<br> <br>There is an interesting interactive educational centre in Bristol UK called an ‘Exploratory’.

That's simply incorrect. <i>Technology</i> is useful in this capacity.<br><br>Note that technological innovation dates back about as far as you care to go in history, while "science" is, in its modern form, only about five centuries old. So they obviously aren't the same thing.<br><br>"Practical" men -- the ones who are interested in empire-building, or corporate profits, for instance -- have zero interest in science. They want technology that brings them power. They don't care whether their next toy comes out of science or black magic or a deal with the Devil. Many of them could not tell the difference.<br><br>There is a kind of interesting parallel in science to what the fundamentalists have done. The fundamentalists clung to a "God of the gaps," eventually becoming dependent upon the incompleteness of science for the foundation of their faith, a foundation that is eroded with every new insight in science. Scientists, in turn, have clung to their effectiveness in spawning new technology to attract funding, including government funding, and have become almost entirely dependent upon it. Funding, in turn, is controlled by practical men, who don't want science, but technology that gives them power. That shapes science far more than any scientist wants to admit.<br><br>A simple example from physics is the relative proportion of research into the strong and weak nuclear forces. The strong force is deeply-researched. The weak force, hardly at all. Why? I'm sure there are a thousand excuses, but the simplest answer -- Occam's Razor -- is that you can't make powerful bombs by leveraging the weak force. So practical men aren't interested.<br><br>Science still has a good reputation among practical men, because its early application uncovered so much previously-unknown and readily exploitable knowledge about the world we live in. In effect, it opened a mine of unprecedented proportions, full of gold and silver and gemstones, and practical men were keen to exploit it.<br><br>But as JMG is fond of pointing out (quite correctly), <i>everything</i> is subject to the law of diminishing returns, and science is in fact declining as a cost-effective generator of practical technology. It's still fairly effective, at least in some fields, but the bloom is off the rose.<br><br>As a result, there will come a time when practical men entirely cease to fund and support science. Most corporate interests have already gone down this road. The "spending hawks" (practical men) in government have been hounding NSF and NIH funding for as long as I've been alive: anyone remember Senator WIlliam Proxmire and his "Golden Turkey" award? Now there is a full chorus of such practical men in Congress, who -- if they had their way -- would cut off all funding of science and science education throughout the country.<br><br><a href=#c2840469084395135681 title="comment permalink">7/28/13, 8:35 AM</a><br><br>

Talking past each other were one of India's top-notch human rights lawyer and a representative of the army. The lawyer expected every one to be appalled by her disclosure of the crimes committed by army personnel while the army representative's point was that the lives of our soldiers are gravely endangered by adhering strictly to human rights conventions. While I am partial to the lawyer's values, I couldn't help shake my head in despair when she insisted that problem with the discussion was that it lacked rationality. <br><br>One of the things I think we sorely need are lessons in how to argue for our values. As I see it, people are consistently confusing values for facts in every realm of life. You had mentioned that one can argue for our values not as if they are facts, but by pointing out their various consequences and by seeing if they are consistent with other values that we hold, as well as the world of facts. <br><br>What needs to be understood here is that any argument for values is necessarily speculative. Our source for data on consequences of values is history. But no event in history can be ascribed to a single cause with any certitude. Since any historical event can be seen as the consequence of multiple causes, any analysis of the consequences of values will carry the corresponding uncertainty. Not everyone thinks that the one and only cause for the holocaust was German anti-semitism. <br><br>The best that one could do is argue for our values and leave it at that - aware that our arguments are never water-tight, success in convincing others isn't guaranteed and that we are taking risks in the service of a good cause.<br><br>If you agree, maybe you would considering developing this further as a full post with all the insights from history that you normally bring to the topics you discuss and maybe you can call it "the laws of values."<br><br><a href=#c882567859859651941 title="comment permalink">7/28/13, 8:52 AM</a><br><br>

I believe not and therefore one can call either one of them parent or child.

I have friends who throw a birthday party for the world every October 23rd, and they'd probably welcome a reason to throw a second party in the spring!"<br><br>I've had time to check the sources now. The calculation of the exact date of creation is worked out, in this tradition, from the complicated method used in those churches to determine the date of Easter from one year to the next (according to the Julian calendar). <br><br>This method works from two repeating chronological cycles, one (19 years long, the Metonic cycle of the moon) specifying the dates of the full moons from one year to the next, the other (28 years long) specifying the weekday of any given date in a year. These two cycles are used in tandem to calculate the date of Easter for any given year. They yield an elegant and beautiful set of mathematical tables, though not a particularly accurate one in terms of the actual astronomy. <br><br>These two cycles return to their common starting point every 532 (= 19 x 28) years. Working backwards from the current position of these cycles, you can determine the starting point of the current 532-year cycle, which is in March, 1941. <br><br>Going back in time in increments of 532 years, you have the starting point of an earlier cycle in March of 5508 BCE, which meshes very well with the date of creation that can be worked out from the chronological data of the Greek Old Testament (the Septuagint).<br><br>At this point, theological considerations take over from chronological ones. The chronological cycles are (it is claimed) properly reckoned only from the fourth day of creation, when according to Genesis the sun and the moon were created, not from the first day of creation. Also, it is posited that the moon was created in its perfection, that is, as a full moon, on that date, and that the date in question was the first day of the heavenly year, that is, the Spring Equinox. By convention, the Spring Equinox is always pegged to March 21, which is always a Saturday in the first year of every 532-year cycle. <br><br>So if the fourth day of creation began at sundown on March 21, 5508 BCE, the first day began at sundown on Wednesday, March 18. (All days in these Eastern Christian calendars begin at sundown, as they do in the Jewish calendar.)<br><br>So let your creation-parties begin at sundown on March 18 or March 21 (or both dates) each year! <br><br>And when you have the first one, please lift a glass in memory of the ancient Pagan scholars in Alexandia who worked out these fascinating mathematical cycles for their own purposes so long ago, hardly anticipating that they would later be adopted and adapted by the Pope of Alexandria for Christian use.<br><br><a href=#c3008640568457061843 title="comment permalink">7/28/13, 12:50 PM</a><br><br>

Other readers may find it has little bearing on their interests. (Nestorian, we can continue privately, if you wish.)<br><br>There are two extant version of the first five books of the Old Testament in the Hebrew language, which for convenience are called the "Jewish" and the "Samaritan" version. Both versions are equally Israelite in their origins, but each version has been altered over the centuries from the time of ancient Israel down to the dates of the oldest manuscripts we now have. <br><br>In the case of the Jewish Hebrew text, we can come rather close to proving that some of these alterations were deliberate, made in the interest of keeping certain (High-)Priestly secrets of Temple practice from becoming common knowledge -- or in a very few cases, possibly in order to confute to Christian polemics. (The British scholar Margaret Barker has done good scholarly work on this, but she deals only with individual passages, and does not treat the question comprehensively.) <br><br>The same is almost certainly true of the Samaritan Hebrew text, but scholars have not yet paid much attention to it in this context. <br><br>These two versions of the same text in Hebrew differ very greatly from one another in the chronology of the Patriarchs in Genesis, and they differ in systematic ways that can hardly be the result of mere scribal errors, but are deliberate changes in the text. <br><br>As it happens the Syriac Peshitta does not entirely agree in the chronology with either of these two versions, though it is much closer to the Jewish version than to the Samaritan. And the Septuagint (Old Greek) version differs quite sharply from all three of them. But the Septuagint, too, goes back to rather early texts in Hebrew, which were translated into Greek by Jewish scholars in Alexandria BCE (and therefore are older than the Dead Sea Scrolls).<br><br>And here are the actual totals: from the Creation of the World to the birth of Abraham is reckoned as 1948 years in the Jewish Hebrew text, as 1953 years in the Syriac Peshitta, as 2249 years in the Samaritan Hebrew, and as 3414 years in the Greek Septuagint. This illustrates how great the differences are between these four ancient versions.<br><br>So these things are not so simple or so clear-cut as one might wish.

First, that argument at best is a endorsement of agnosticism ( those "Atheists" tend to be agnostics that think that absence of proof is proof of absence :/ ), second, the Occam Razor is a heuristic to not lose time with convoluted theories when you haven't disproved the simple ones and not a granter of truthfulness ( just think what kind of absurd that line of argument would lead if you tried to prove that pizzas were not baked by humans just because you never saw the guy that makes your pizzas preparing and baking one ... ), third, even in Christianity there are currents that believe that God did not create our Universe, thus not being in anyway responsible for whatever happens here ( say, like the Cathars and Bogolimists ), making any argument about why a good God allows our world evils a moot point ... and this inside the punching bag they are suposedely beating to pulp, not even talking about Druidism or any other non-Christian flavored faith.

So , I kind of feel that I have some latitude to speak about what a common language between what we call nowadays Religion and Science ... <br><br>To start, I think that most people, including the scientists, has a serious misunderstanding about what Science is. Science is simply the Scientific method applied to our world: the rest of the package is simply results of it. If you want to have Science in the future, you NEED to keep using the scientific method, because otherwise you are simply keeping collections of old facts, not differently of those medieval breviaries or those religiously copied Aristotelic nonsenses about the velocity of free falling bodies that anyone could disprove by simply dropping two balls out of a balcony, and this regardless of the correctness of your original facts.<br><br>The problem with keeping the scientific method, especially in harsh and empoverished times, is that it's usage implies both a widespread strong belief in the equality of all the observers ( that is, a observation is worth exactly the same no matter who does it ) and a social climate that allows that anyone can challenge anyone claims on a subject ( no "Magister dixit" ). That BTW makes that the usage of the scientific method is the weak link on keeping our science in the medium terms, because I really can't see that the next centuries will be cozy with any pretense of belief in the equal dignity and value of all human beings ... while even the worst tyrants like to have a choice collection of "wisdom of the ancients" books and pet "mages" even if only for bragging rights ...<br><br>Anyway, I do see a common thread between Science ( the scientific method ) and the core of a lot of religions, that the the individual and unescapable duty you need to have with being truthful to yourself and the others around you ( the old " You will not lie" ) . This is probably more a moral item, but all the religions I know preach that you have a duty to not lie to both the divinities and to your fellow man, and you can't have any science without that compromise with what you observed. That is probably from where I would start for the next post if was Mr Greer, anyway ...<br><br><a href=#c6774501237494354672 title="comment permalink">7/28/13, 1:55 PM</a><br><br>

One of the problems is that the type of science we have today is not born of the mystery and so it overlooks the magic of it all. It's also a flat perspective. I fancy getting back into the sciences. This Nicholas Tesla guy seemed to have tapped in the mystery. What if Saturn had the capacity to refuel Earth - how would people feel about that assuming a scientific explanation? Would they go oh yea more science that stands to reason I suppose? Or would they go 'What the frick that's too far out to be accidental"? But most indigenous people had this sense of awe science to an extent has deprived us of the wonder of the creation.

But that seems to me to be very different from religious faith, which most followers seem not to treat as mere speculation. Nonetheless, this is a very interesting series and I'm glad to learn more about how religion has worked in the past and how it may inform our society going into a very uncertain future.<br><br>About preserving science, I'm fairly optimistic that an understanding of the scientific method will be preserved into the future. I think you're right that we will lose vast quantities of electronic data and information printed only on high-acid paper, but there really is quite a bit that is printed on more durable substances. For example, most universities require all their master's theses and Ph. D. dissertations to be on cotton paper, with an estimated survival time of several centuries. Even my rather poorly regarded university has books that, if rediscovered centuries from now, may be intact and could help future civilizations to rediscover science.<br><br>I think the rather decentralized nature of modern knowledge may be an advantage we have over the ancients. If Ogg the Barbarian sacks DC in the Pillage of 2117 and torches the Library of Congress, we will lose some information but, proportionally, nowhere near as much as was lost when the Great Library of Alexandria was destroyed. The number of science texts printed on durable paper probably numbers in the millions, at least a few of which are bound to survive one way or another. And, of course, even basic science provides substantial benefits, so cultures that retain science-based advances like the radio, small-scale electric power generation, and ecology are likely to outcompete those that don't.<br><br>Not that it isn't worth it to do whatever we can to the survival of the scientific method and other critical knowledge; quite the opposite. And, since the future is unlikely to contain any space probes or particle accelerators, any information lost about distant astronomical objects and particle physics will be lost forever. But there are good reasons to believe that the basics of the scientific method will survive all but the most extreme collapse scenarios.<br><br><a href=#c1087648532762643987 title="comment permalink">7/28/13, 6:08 PM</a><br><br>

That's simply incorrect. Technology is useful in this capacity.”<br><br>I was sort of working towards that direction too.<br><br>Specifically, I’ve noticed that the scientists and people with a science degree I know of, first, second and third hand, usually seem to use about the following method.<br><br>1. Experiment – pretty reasonable grasp of this and right on for the Scientific Method.<br><br>2. Measurement – grasp of this varies a lot more but perhaps passable Scientific Method.<br><br>3. Check to see that results fall within the current scientific paradigm and within the goals of whatever organization is funding them. This is done because if too far outside they won’t get through peer review, will have their funding stopped, and anyway, probably have an error somewhere.<br><br>Ok, let’s review the Oxford English Dictionary definition of the Scientific Method again: "a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.”<br><br>Not only is that last step not in it, it is about the opposite of the Scientific Method!<br><br>Yet! Yet! I think you’ll find that nearly all of our present science and technology was developed using similar methods.

And it is simply very hard (I would argue impossible) to envision a personal god who does not only let evolution passively happen with all its pain, starvation, being eaten alive, being born with genetic defects, etc, but indeed deliberately created the universe to be like that having a kind expression on their (metaphorical) face while they are watching creation unfold or, as you would have it, look across the frozen jelly that is all of existence past and future from their timeless perspective. Worshiping nature is one thing, but when you must consider a personal god to be worthy of reverence the problem of evil hits you right in the face.<br><br><i>Step beyond questions of fact, that is, and you’re in the territory of faith—a label that properly includes the atheist’s belief in a purely material cosmos just as much as it does the classical theist’s belief in a created cosmos made by an infinite and eternal god...</i><br><br>This is really, really odd. In what sense is a purely material versus supernatural cosmos not a question of fact? If the cosmos can be explained in purely physical terms then we can decide that question of fact by invoking the principle of parsimony: the living/supernatural part is superfluous to requirements. And the fun thing is, pace this post, the criteria used by the scientist (or the empiricist/atheist/rationalist/whatever), like parsimony, are not actually based on faith but on confidence that they work because they do, in fact, demonstrably work to figure things out where religious faith doesn't. What is more, all members of humanity except a small minority that is commonly considered to be clinically insane agrees on the same criteria for determining truth in all cases where their religious or ideological beliefs are not at stake.<br><br>When they need to figure out where their lost keys are, how to find the way to the market or what causes that weird sound, virtually everybody behaves like a metaphysical materialist: when they find the key on the kitchen table they hypothesize that they just left it lying there because imagining that it was taken there by invisible goblins is superfluous to requirements. Thus the rationalist/atheist stance is actually not one of many equally faith based positions but instead the one stance that all of humanity happily agrees on when it really matters and/or when personal faith is not at stake - only then the religious go ahead an arbitrarily fence certain areas off where the same approach is not allowed to enter, while the rationalist applies it to everything. It is not about faith versus different faith but about intellectual consistency versus special pleading.<br><br>Another issue is that not everybody might be willing to agree that "faith" is the right word to describe the choice of values. As I would understand the word faith it means merely "believing things that you have no good reason to believe", whereas values are, well, values and not beliefs. And yes, obviously values are subjective, and obviously science isn't about values. But it certainly does not follow that religion (of all things!) has anything useful to say about them either. I would argue that our values need to come from taking human nature and our personal interests into account and then negotiating a social contract with each other. But if I were to think that we could derive values from somewhere else I would very much prefer to ask a moral philosopher. In contrast to a priest they might actually be qualified to say something interesting on the matter.<br><br><a href=#c4405504758132907494 title="comment permalink">7/28/13, 7:27 PM</a><br><br>

Both battles were very bloody but key turning points that determined the outcome of intense, costly wars.<br><br>However, the former battle is largely forgotten because ultimately, the dynastic dispute between two branches of the same royal family over who would rule had no significant impact on the general course of English history. Sometimes methinks it is like the former, both sides as rival sects of the dying Religion of Progress, faltering and ultimately doomed to insignificance. Moreover whether the Earth was created by God one morning 5000 years ago or accreted from space dust over some 5 Billion years (or manufactured in Magrathea) really has almost no practical bearing on daily life.<br><br>In contrast, the outcome of the latter ultimately had a most significant impact on the course of World history, which would have been vastly different had Armistead's Brigade crested the ridge. Like in that struggle, I percieve a much deeper issue at stake that might explain the intransigence. Creationism is an integral part of Christian Fundamentalist thought. Should their social attitudes and definite worldview, which has a number of specific social aims, such as the elimination of abortion and contraception and subjugation of women, become ascendant, we can plausibly look forward to a future in a brutally repressive theocracy. Whereas, the militant atheists at least offer the real prospect of a more open and tolerant society, despite the real danger of hoisting the banner of scientific rationalism which has, in the past, unsuccessfully tried to use reason to deduce morals. One tragic result was the Terror of the French Revolution, and another result was, through Hegel, both Nazism and Communism, neither of which are palatable sociopolitical systems.<br><br>So, I suppose only history will ever know if this ultimately a dispute of middling insignificance, or profoundly world-defining argument about humanity.<br><br><a href=#c4123838880708147384 title="comment permalink">7/28/13, 9:13 PM</a><br><br>

I'll be discussing that as we proceed. <br><br>Chad, either that or God got tired of Einstein telling him what he could and couldn't do. ;-)<br><br>Ben, not so. Like most rationalist critics of religion, you're leaving out the entire field of religious experience, which goes far beyond pure rumination, and most likely is the central reason why we have religions at all. More on this shortly. <br><br>Marlow, thank you!<br><br>Cherokee, well, opening cans of worms seems to be one of my specialties these days. As for the concept of dominion, good -- it's too rarely remembered these days that that term implies a great deal of noblesse oblige. <br><br>Phil, I'm less concerned with data and far more concerned with the scientific method.

The Gormenghast metaphor is delightful -- there are a few towers that still soar, but by and large, that's the fate of every religion -- it's born in the white-hot fire of spiritual experience, and dies in the calm mutterings of theologians musing over what somebody might have experienced a long time ago. <br><br>Shrama, I'll consider it, but I'm not at all sure anything I say will have much influence over the current fashion for wallowing in moral self-righteousness! As for bacteria, excellent -- they're diuturnal, since as far as we know they didn't come into existence until the Archean eon, and will go out of existence at some point before the last bits of the biosphere get vaporized in the Sun's first helium flash a couple of billion years from now.<br><br><a href=#c4913451275947730705 title="comment permalink">7/29/13, 5:20 AM</a><br><br>

As for the next post, wait and see!<br><br>Onething, remember the difference between science and technology. If people remember that the technology once existed, but have lost the method that enabled those things to be discovered, it doesn't matter how much they want the technology, it's probably out of reach. <br><br>Paul, er, "Saturn refueling the Earth"? Just what we need -- more hydrocarbons to burn, so we can destabilize the climate even further. What a great idea! :-(<br><br>Grebulocities, I don't share your confidence. The scientific method is extremely vulnerable -- a couple of generations of neglect, and you've got to hope a book survives somewhere and the right people get around to reading it someday!<br><br>Stephen, I'll be discussing that in an upcoming post. Clearly I need to put some time into talking about why I think the scientific method is vulnerable to being lost just now, and what might be done about it. <br><br>Alex, a nice bit of canned atheist polemic -- and charmingly ethnocentric, too! As I'm sure you're quite aware, most human societies have, and many still do, accept the possibility that events in the material world are caused by other-than-human intelligences, and people in those societies manage to find their keys about as often as you do. Thus your argument amounts to insisting that since our culture has a prejudice against the existence of other-than-human intelligences, that we ought to apply that prejudice across the board, in the service of that consistency that, as Emerson pointed out, is the hobgoblin of little minds. <br><br>More broadly, though, your argument is an exercise in question-begging backed by self-referential definitions. The thesis of most religions is that the kind of causality you're willing to accept is inadequate to deal with important aspects of human existence and experience. That's the point at issue, and making an argument that presupposes the point you're trying to prove is not going to impress anyone who doesn't already agree with you. <br><br>Renaissance, good. I see it as more like Towton, since both sides in the current struggle are fading powers at this point.

For starters, though, I thoroughly reject all speculations concerning the origins of biblical texts that are grounded Higher Biblical Criticism. As such, I cannot subscribe to the idea that there are Priestly redactions to the genealogies in the Jewish Hebrew text that were inserted prior to the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, as I do not believe there were post-exilic Priestly redactions of any kind to any of the Old Testament documents. <br><br>I am not familiar with Margaret Barker’s work in particular. However, I have found in general that the arguments advanced by the Higher Critics about the historical origins of the various biblical texts are highly speculative, very scant in their citation of actual historical evidence in support of their conclusions, over-hastily dismissive if not completely silent about historical and linguistic evidence that tends to undermine their conclusions, and tendentiously antisupernatural in their basic presuppositional framework. <br><br>Perhaps I do not do Barker’s work justice by applying this prejudice to her work, though; I welcome further instruction on the point. It sounds from what you say like she may be talking about redactions that happened after the death of Jesus of Nazareth, perhaps at the Council of Jamnia in 70 a.d. or so. That is a different kettle of fish from Wellhausen Hypothesis-based speculations concerning redactions prior to the birth of Jesus of Nazareth. If you would like to communicate about this with me privately, please contact our host, and he can supply you with my email address.<br><br>The Septuagint cannot be correct for mathematical reasons: In its chronology, several of Noah’s forebears would have survived the Flood by quite a few years if the lifespan the Septuagint ascribes to them is correct. Yet the biblical flood accounts make it clear that the only survivors globally of the flood were Noah, his wife, Noah’s three sons, and their respective wives. For this reason alone, the Eastern Orthodox Church has put itself in a very problematic position by making the Septuagint its officially authoritative version of the Old Testament (just as the Roman Catholic Church, for different reasons, has caused itself considerable embarrassment by making Jerome’s Vulgate Latin translation its officially authoritative version).<br><br>It is interesting in this regard to note that the Jerusalem Hebrew version has dated the antediluvian genealogies such that Methuselah, the longest-lived of the antediluvian patriarchs at 969 years, and Noah’s great-grandfather (if I remember correctly), died in the year before the Flood. All the other antediluvian patriarchs (with the exception of Enoch, who was assumed bodily into heaven) had died quite some time before then.<br><br>Among the Peshitta, the Samaritan Hebrew, and the Jewish Hebrew, I trust the Jewish Hebrew as reliable and authoritative, mainly because Jesus of Nazareth did so also. Regarding the Peshitta, mistakes in translation do happen, just as they did in the Septuagint and Jerome’s Latin Vulgate. Often in the history of biblical translations (both ancient and modern), such “mistakes” are really tendentious distortions, but I am inclined to think that they really are innocent, and thus real mistakes, in the case of the Peshitta.<br><br><br><a href=#c6982469184535193680 title="comment permalink">7/29/13, 7:26 AM</a><br><br>

It isn't that some specific useful technologies that were discovered using science will not survive, nor is it that all books laying out the scientific method will be destroyed (the vast majority may be, but it is probable that a few will make it here or there). Even given surviving technologies and texts, our descendents may well not understand science in any depth - instead, successful techniques may crystallize into dogmatic shells of their former selves, with little or no general understanding of how science works.<br><br>One thing I'm struck by is that students in our schools are taught in their science classes that the scientific method is a series of well-defined steps, beginning with a hypothesis and ending with an experimental confirmation or refutation of that hypothesis. Of course, there is no such thing as a "cookbook" scientific method as laid out by those textbooks; any observation that is repeatable and verifiable by other scientists can be added to the corpus of scientific knowledge. Richard Feynman once described the scientific method as simply a form of extreme honesty, where "the first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that." <br><br>The problem may be that it is very difficult to convey how to apply this sort of rigorous honesty, where scientists are skeptical of their own findings and must defend their own results to their own criticism before releasing them, where they must then survive a wave of criticism from peers. Self-criticism may be very difficult to get people to perform adequately - it is often lacking even in scientists. The next step, the peer review process, then lets a good many poorly-established results through to general publication. Amid a prolonged decline, science could easily devolve into people making various claims with nobody clear about how or why to be skeptical of their own finds. Three generations later, science is dead in practice even if a few science texts survive.<br><br>I'm looking forward to your future post about the risks to the survival of science and how we can increase its chances. Your writing is consistently among the best I have ever read at clearing away the cobwebs of unexamined assumptions that I have accumulated in the process of growing up at the peak of empire.<br><br><a href=#c2108285921081463499 title="comment permalink">7/30/13, 12:37 AM</a><br><br>

This argument is almost always advanced in a discussion of creationism, as a justification for why something like the eye can't possibly have evolved: it's "irreducibly complex."

To pick another example of this phenomenon, from your country-- In The Future Eaters, Tim Flannery talked about an aboriginal group who stayed away from a particular area because it was thought to be inhabited by a malevolent spirit. The result was, essentially, a wildlife refuge, and it allowed a particular species (a wombat?) to survive. Later, the tribe was Christianized, and they asked a priest to exorcise the demon. The result was that the wombats (or whatever it is) were now being hunted to extinction in the region.<br><br>I'm reminded, here, also, of David Abram's suggestion that the role of shamans in indigenous societies was very much concerned with the relationship between the human and the more than human world-- that shamans were working ecologists. I think that's right, but I also want to caution against saying that magical or religious practices are "really" about land management. On the one hand, it's possible to view the thing through the blind lens of natural selection-- practices which tend to preserve a viable human habitat are preserved over the long run. <br><br>But on the other hand, lived religious experience isn't about sitting down and thinking "Now how can we get our descendants to not hunt the wombats to death?" People probably did experience the demon; people experience demons fairly regularly. (Meanwhile, if such things have an existence independent of the minds of people who encounter them, I don't think it's impossible that it saw its role as being the protector of the wombats!) And I've seen it happen where well-meaning modern people notice the ecological (or whatever other) role of religion/myth in the past, and so assume that all we have to do is make up some myths of our own. But the results are inevitably hollow and meaningless, because real religions can't be engineered that way.<br><br>So this is a rambling way of saying that I want to take note of the ecological function of magical or religious practices, but I don't want to assume that those practices can be <i>reduced</i> to that ecological function.

That God arbitrarily defined what "good" is, or what a soul is made of. <br><br>It's not that God is a product of the universe, either. If God is not existence itself and the source of everything subsequent, then it isn't God. If the universe exists prior to God, then that is where we need to be looking. That is the mystery.<br><br>You start with something (God exists) and work from there. What goodness is arises from this basic fact - God exists. Things like the good, and how souls learn wisdom, are due to the basic fabric of what things are. It isn't arbitrary. <br><br>Existence is the ultimate good, the bedrock of all. There is a difference between the name or concept of a thing, and the thing itself. God's goodness is a product of his existence, from the nature of existence. <br>As well, God has awareness. God creates/splits off out of Itself other awarenesses. From this we see that the definition of evil is to impinge on another being's free will, their thriving. This is done through deception or violence. Jesus accused some people of being the spiritual descendents of an evil being, calling him a liar and murderer. Those two things are how evil is perpetrated. Violence or its threat impinges on the existence of others, and their existence is their basic treasure. Murder isn’t wrong because God said so, but because your existence is not mine to exploit, and because existence is good, decreasing someone’s existence is not good.<br><br>To deceive is to perpetrate that which isn't so, isn't true. We can see that is not in alignment with God who is reality and is therefore truth. So lying isn't wrong because God said so, but because it is a distortion of reality. Thus it isn't possible to ask whether God could have made lying good. <br>Likewise, when someone prefaced a comment to Jesus by saying "Good Rabbi..." Jesus interrupted him and said, "Why do you call me good? There is only one good being, and that is God." It doesn't mean that you or I or Jesus aren't pretty good, but that God is goodness itself, the very meaning of the word.<br>But rather than feel disappointed that God didn’t decree everything by some whimsical choice, it is really much better when the utter and profound goodness of God is understood, that goodness is woven into the fabric of the universe. I do love this God with all my heart and it grieves me to see his character slandered by certain dogmas. It is not God’s style at all to defend himself (reality needs no defense) but I defend him.<br><br><br><a href=#c7447145540500040910 title="comment permalink">7/30/13, 11:42 AM</a><br><br>

JMG has commented in the past that cosmological theory has gone beyond the observable and testable. <br><br>I don't know. If Science runs out of chunks of resources to do really big science, I suppose it could end up looking that way. <br><br>Relearning Science available up to the end of 19thC, indeed Einstein and subsequent quantum theory, should be possible on limted resources given any continuing interest. Biochemistry, cell biology and modern genetics, for example, probably could be out of reach because of their dependence on a network of technologies. I really don't know about anything that needs advanced computation. <br><br>A lot of these latter 'frontier' results would need a lot of revisiting if they were going to make any sense to a very different and de-industrialising society / culture.

The trick is that frame of mind; it’s really a meditative exercise.<br><br>Basically, you have to convince yourself that you have never read that section before and even more difficult, put aside the explanation, the vision, of that event that has been programmed into you since you were a child, not just by the churches, but even more by secular society.<br><br>Not an easy thing – but if you can, both intellectually rewarding and really cool fun.<br><br>It also really helps if you have a fair idea of the societies and technologies of the time and can imagine yourself in those societies.<br><br>As one quick example: b) Exod 33.22, Hebrew &amp; LXX:<br>'And while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by; [23] then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back; but my face shall not be seen.'<br><br>Written by a person of the time, why on earth would they consider a cleft in the rock (a slit trench in our terms) safe, ex that is, flat shooting, long range weapons or non-shielded radiation sources.<br><br>But remember, this is just for fun, just an intellectual amusement! We can never know what actually happened.<br><br>And, of course, the religious folk have a rather simple and for all I know correct interpretation of this.<br><br>As an introduction to this technique I’d suggest reading John Carroll’s “The Existential Jesus”. Don’t worry, this is not a religious book, but rather what you would expect from a Professor of Sociology at La Trobe University in Melbourne with degrees in mathematics, economics and sociology who’s work focuses on culture, and its crucial role in the human search for meaning.<br><br>Stephen Heyer<br><br><br><a href=#c7096459315836183260 title="comment permalink">7/30/13, 6:43 PM</a><br><br>

One possibility is that the signature of the spacetime metric is changed in these other parts. This is precisely what I am looking at. For example, those other parts could have a euclidian metric instead of the familiar (at least to physicists) lorentzian one, which differentiates time from space. In a euclidian manifold there is no meaning to motion or anything else having to do with time. The euclidian world is unchanging. There are other possibilities where the nature of time changes in the other parts (e.g. the metric becomes complex, as in a+bi).<br><br>Dear JMG, I am not trying to fit God into a Procrustean bed (or imitate St Anselm), but am motivated by such concepts in my research. Also by such concepts as platonic forms, and consciousness being a mediator between two different signature realms of spacetime. Apparently so are Penrose and Ellis. Who knows what the consequences of signature changing surfaces are and if they really exist. Perhaps not much can be said about the other (divine?) side of the hypothetical surfaces, but maybe some measureable predictions can be gleaned on this side.<br><br>Dear Nestorian, I share your dislike of some of Prigogine's thinking though he did come up with some useful stuff. I am also very interested in the deeper foundations of the second law of thermodynamics and don't think it is necessarilly fundamental (and may be indeed contradicted in certain regions of spacetime, though there is no experimental reason to believe this at this point). But I don't think that evolution contradicts it. There are self-organizing, non-biological systems that decrease entropy locally, increase it globally, and follow Prigogine's minimum entropy production. I haven't studied them in detail though.<br><br><br><a href=#c4513540747770488858 title="comment permalink">7/30/13, 7:19 PM</a><br><br>

Deep diving.<br><br>I also have trouble understanding the notion of evil and Satan. Something that I learned and that has resonated with me over time is that we are here for Life to experience itself. I imagine that since all the good and bad exists, it must exist for a purpose. The same way that each of us has been the hungry wolf and the deer it hunts and eats, whether or not we acknowledge that both exist within us, I sense the same must be true in the transpersonal. Why would above be any different from below, could it be? I don't really know, this is just what has stuck with me the longest. It doesn't mean I have to like it when my or my community's life is visited by death, destruction or disease; perhaps there is a way for me to alter my reality to some or other extent; and ultimately where I find greatest meaning is in submitting to what is and operating from there. Those three thoughts get challenged as being inconsistent all the time by people who think I'm flaky or just making stuff up, but to me they seem perfectly consistent and compatible.<br><br>Whenever I see either/or statements, as often happens when discussing science/reason and religion/faith (funny how these things can get conflated), I want to rearrange them to read this and that, then look for the how. It's considered very subjective and hasn't been very fashionable, but it's entertaining and sometimes expansive.<br><br><a href=#c4434357384538503497 title="comment permalink">7/31/13, 7:13 AM</a><br><br>

Especially when claiming that science and religion must be separate to function properly. To a degree this makes sense especially when doing one's direct work. But to say science stops short of the ability to place value to it's determination and that this is soley the work of religion is not true to a functional order. A scientist must do some work toward value judgements for the very reason they have upset the traditional role of religion. <br><br>Further, humans all function from a psychological system<br>of inner checks and balances where one half of the system never functions properly with the exclusion of the other. Even the intellectual centers cannot function without the inclusion of the emotional centers. Entanglement is being realized as the norm. Though it is valuable to create environments and procedures that symbolically represent as sterile an environment as possible, those are for specific non-normal instances such as experiments, but results must always be tried by real life at some point. In natural action things behave differently than artificial seclusion, so we should hesitate and deliberate when it comes to deciding what common theme will serve us best in areas of science since that is due reevaluation as well as religion. Much of our work as I understand it is in undoing sterile religious or spiritual programming as well as scientific or material programming which has created such horrific imbalance and neurosis in combination with wall upon wall of guarded distraction and denial. In effect we have a lot of work to do and apparently little time or collective will to do it from and in. <br><br><br>Excellent start here though.<br><br><a href=#c2038592603408086420 title="comment permalink">7/31/13, 7:30 PM</a><br><br>

The first is merely a conclusion that could conceivably change while the latter are approaches to producing conclusions.
