The continual recycling of repeatedly failed predictions in the peak oil community, the theme of last week’s post here, is anything but unique these days. Open a copy of today’s newspaper (or the online equivalent), and it’s a safe bet that you’ll find at least one op-ed piece calling enthusiastically for the adoption of some political, military, or economic policy that’s failed every single time it’s been tried. It’s hard, in fact, to think of any broadly accepted policy in any dimension of public life today that can’t be accurately described in those terms. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Arnold Toynbee, whose sprawling study of historical cycles is among the constellations by which this blog navigates, pointed out quite some time ago that this process of self-inflicted failure is one of the standard ways that civilizations write their own obituaries. In his formulation, societies thrive so long as the creative minority that leads them can keep on coming up with new responses to the challenges the world throws their way—a process that normally requires the regular replacement of the society’s leadership from below, so that new leaders with new ideas can rise to the top. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When that process of replacement breaks down, and the few people who still rise into the ruling class from lower down the pyramid are selected for their willingness to go along with the status quo rather than for their commitment to new ideas that work, what was once a creative minority degenerates into a dominant minority, which rules by coercion because it can no longer inspire by example. You can tell that this has happened to your society when every crisis gets met with the same stereotyped set of responses, even when those responses clearly don’t work. That happens because dominant minorities identify themselves with certain policies, and with the social roles and narratives that go with those policies, and it takes much more than mere failure to shake those obsessions loose.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The resulting one-track thinking can go very far indeed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ideology of the Roman Empire, for example, copied the theological vision of Roman Pagan religion and projected it onto the world of politics. Roman Pagans saw the universe as a place of chaotic powers that had to be subjected to the benevolent rule of a cosmic paterfamilias by way of Jove’s thunderbolts. Roman social thought understood history in the same way, as a process by which an original state of chaos was bashed into obedience by Rome’s legions and subjected to the benevolent rule of the emperor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For much of Rome’s imperial history, that model even made a certain amount of sense, as substantial parts of the Mediterranean world that had been repeatedly ravaged by wars beforehand experienced an age of relative peace and prosperity under Roman rule. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The problem was simply that this way of dealing with problems had little relevance to the pressures that gutted the Roman Empire in its final years, and trying to apply it anyway very quickly turned into a massive source of problems in its own right. The endless expansion of the Roman military required by increasingly drastic attempts to hammer the world into obedience imposed crippling tax burdens across Roman society, driving whole economic sectors into bankruptcy, and the government responded to this by passing laws requiring every man to practice the same profession as his father, whether he could afford to do so or not. Across the dying empire, whenever one extension of centralized imperial authority turned into a costly flop, some even more drastic act of centralization was the only thinkable option, until finally the whole system fell to pieces. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Modern industrial civilization, especially but not only in its American expression, is well on its way to this same destination by a slightly different road. Across the board, in politics, in economics, in energy policy, in any other field you care to name, the enthusiastic pursuit of repeatedly failed policies has become one of the leitmotifs of contemporary life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’d like to focus on one of those briefly, partly because it’s a classic example of the kind, partly because it shows with rare clarity the thinking that underlies the whole phenomenon. The example I have in mind is the ongoing quest for fusion power. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Scientists in the US and something like a dozen other countries have been busy at that quest since the 1950s. In the process, they’ve discovered something well worth knowing about fusion power:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>if it can be done at all, on any scale smaller than a star—and the jury’s still out on that one—it can’t be done at a price that any nation on Earth can possibly afford.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The dream of limitless cheap fusion power that filled the pages of gosh-wow newspaper articles and science fiction stories in the 1950s and 1960s is thus as dead as a sack full of doornails. Has this stopped the continuing flow of billions of dollars of grant money into round after futile round of gargantuan fusion-power projects? Surely you jest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus fusion researchers are stuck in the same self-defeating loop as those peak oil mavens who repeat the same failed prediction for the umpteenth time in a row, in the serene conviction that this time it’ll come true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They’re approaching the situation in a way that prevents them from learning from their mistakes, no matter how many times the baseball bat of failure whacks them upside the head. In the case of the fusion scientists, what drives that loop is evident enough:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the civil religion of progress and, in particular, the historical mythology at the core of that religion. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Fusion researchers by and large see themselves as figures standing at the cutting edge of one important branch of techological progress. Given their training, their history, and the cultural pressures that surround them and define their work, it’s all but impossible for them to do anything else. That’s what has them boxed into a dead end with no easy exits, because the way progress is conceptualized in contemporary culture is fatally out of step with the facts on the ground. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Progress, as the word literally means, is continued forward motion in one direction. To believers in the civil religion of progress, that’s the shape of history:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>whatever it is that matters—moral improvement, technological prowess, economic expansion, or what have you—marches invincibly onward over time, and any setbacks in the present will inevitably be overcome in the future, just as equivalent setbacks in the past were overcome by later generations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>To join the marching legions of progress, according to the myth, is to enlist on the side of history’s winners and to help the inevitable victory come about just that little bit sooner, just as to oppose progress is to fight valiantly in a misguided cause and lose. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the myth that guides contemporary industrial society, just as the myth of Jupiter clobbering the Titans and imposing the rule of law on a fractious cosmos was the myth that guided Roman society. In the broadest sense, whether any given change is “progressive” or “regressive” has to be settled by good old-fashioned politics, since changes don’t arrive with these labels branded on their backsides. Once a group of people have committed themselves to the claim that a change they’re trying to bring about is progressive, though, they’re trapped; no matter what happens, the only action the myth allows them to consider is that of slogging gamely onwards under the conviction that the obstacles will inevitably give way if they just keep at it. Thus the fusion research community is stuck perpetually pushing on a door marked PULL and wondering why it won’t open. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Of course fusion researchers also have deeply pragmatic reasons for their refusal to learn the lessons of repeated failure. Careers, reputations, and million-dollar grants depend on keeping up the pretense that further investment in fusion research has any chance of producing something more than a collection of vastly overpriced laboratory curiosities, and the field of physics is so specialized these days that shutting down fusion research programs would leave most fusion researchers with few marketable job skills relevant to anything this side of flipping burgers. Thus the charade goes on, funded by granting agencies just as committed to that particular corner of the myth of progress as the researchers whose salaries they pay, and continuing to swallow vast amounts of money, resources, and intellectual talent that might accomplish quite a bit if they could be applied to some less futile task. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The fusion research community, in effect, is being held hostage by the myth of progress. I’ve come to think that a great deal of contemporary science is caught in the same bind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By and large, the research programs that get funding and prestige are those that carry forward existing agendas, and the law of diminishing returns—which applies to scientific research as it does to all other human activities—means that the longer an existing agenda has been pursued, the fewer useful discoveries are likely to be made by pursuing it further.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet the myth of progress has no place for the law of diminishing returns; in terms of the myth, every step along the forward march of progress must lead to another step, and that to another still.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is why, to glance briefly at another example, efforts to craft a unified field theory out of Einsteinian relativity and quantum physics still get ample funding today, despite a century of total failure, while scores of research projects that might actually yield results go unfunded. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It does no good to science, in other words, to be imprisoned within the myth of endless linear progress. I’ve wondered more than once what modern science would look like if some philosophical equivalent of a SWAT team were to kick down the doors of the temple of Progress and liberate the hostages held inside. My best guess is that, freed from the myth, science would look like a tree, rather than a road leading into infinite distance:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>rooted in mathematics and logic, supported by the strong trunk of the scientific method, extending branches, twigs and leaves in all directions, some of which would thrive while others would inevitably fail. Its leaves would spread out to catch as many of the rays of the light of truth as the finite nature of the tree allowed, but if one branch—the one called “fusion research,” let’s say—strayed into a lightless zone, the tree of science would direct its resources elsewhere and let that branch turn into a dry stick. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Eventually, the whole tree would reach its maximum growth, and after a lifespan of some centuries or millennia more, it would weaken, fail, and die, leaving its remains as a nurse log to nurture a new generation of intellectual saplings. That’s the way that Greek logic unfolded over time, and modern science started out its existence as one of the saplings nurtured on classical logic’s vast fallen trunk. More generally, that’s history’s way with human intellectual, cultural, and artistic systems of all kinds, and only the blinders imposed by the myth of progress make it impossible for most people in today’s industrial world to see science in the same terms. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That same logic is not restricted to science, either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If some force of philosophers packing high-caliber syllogisms and fallacy-piercing ammunition ever does go charging through the door of the temple of Progress, quite a few people may be startled by the identity of some of the hostages who are led out blinking into light and freedom. It’s not just the sciences that are tied up and blindfolded there; nearly all the Western world’s religions share the same fate. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s important here to recognize that the myth of progress provides two potential roles for those who buy into its preconceptions. As noted earlier in this post, they can join the winning side and enlist in the marching legions of progress, or they can join the losing side, struggle against progress, and heroically fail. Both those roles are necessary for the enactment of the myth, and the raw power of popular culture can be measured in the ease with which nearly every religious tradition in the Western world, including those whose traditions are radically opposed to either one, have been pushed into one role or the other. The major division is of course that between liberal and conservative denominations; the former have by and large been reduced to the role of cheerleaders for progress, while the latter have by and large been assigned the corresponding role as cannon fodder for the side that’s destined to lose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The interplay between the two sides of the religious spectrum has been made rather more complex by the spectacularly self-defeating behavior of most North American denominations following the Second World War. In those years, a series of wildly popular books—John A.T. Robinson’s
<i>Honest to God</i>, Pierre Berton’s <i>The Comfortable Pew</i>, and others of the same kind—argued in effect that, in order to be properly progressive, Christian churches ought to surrender their historic beliefs, practices, and commitments, and accept whatever diminished role they might be permitted by the mainstream of liberal secular society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some of these books, such as Robinson’s, were written by churchmen; others, such as Berton’s, were not, but all of them were eagerly received by liberal churches across the English-speaking world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The case of <i>The Comfortable Pew</i> is particularly intriguing, as the Anglican Church of Canada hired a well-known Canadian atheist to write a book about what was wrong with their church and what they should do about it, and then gamely took his advice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Other denominations were not quite so forthright in expressing a death wish, but the results were broadly similar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Across the board, liberal churches reworked seminary programs to imitate secular liberal arts degrees, abandoned instruction in religious practice, took up the most radical forms of scriptural criticism, and redefined their clergy as amateur social service providers and progressive activists with a sideline in rites of passage. Since most people who go to churches or synagogues are there to practice their religion, not to provide their clergy with an admiring audience for political monologues and lessons in fashionable agnosticism, this shift was promptly followed a steep plunge in the number of people who attended services in all the liberal denominations. Here again, the logic of progress made it all but impossible for church leaders to learn the lesson taught by failure, and most liberal denominations have remained in a death spiral ever since. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, conservative denominations were busy demonstrating that the opposite of one bad idea is usually another bad idea. Panicked by the global expansion of Communism—you rarely heard that latter word in American public discourse in the 1950s and 1960s without the adjective “godless” tacked on its front end—and the sweeping social changes triggered by postwar prosperity, the leaders of the conservative denominations moved as eagerly as their liberal counterparts to embrace the role that the myth of progress offered them. Along with William F. Buckley and the other architects of postwar American pseudoconservatism, they redefined themselves in opposition to the progressive agenda of their time, and never seemed to notice that they were so busy standing against this, that, and the other that most of them forgot to stand for anything at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The social pressure to conform to stereotypes and resist progress in every sense drove the weirdest dimension of late 20th century American Christian pseudoconservatism, the holy war against Darwinian evolution. Nowhere in the Bible does it say that the luminous poetry of the first chapter of Genesis must be treated as a geology textbook, nor is a literal reading of Genesis mandated by any of the historic creeds of the Christian churches. Nonetheless “Thou shalt not evolve” got turned into an ersatz Eleventh Commandment, and devout Christians exercised their ingenuity to the utmost to find ways to ignore the immense and steadily expanding body of evidence from geology, molecular biology, paleontology, and genetics that backed Darwin’s great synthesis. That and such sideshows as the effort to insist on the historical reality of the Noah’s ark story, despite conclusive geological evidence disproving it, crippled the efforts of conservative Christians to reach outside their existing audience.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The conservative denominations never quite managed to discard their historic beliefs, practices and commitments with the same enthusiasm shown by their liberal counterparts, preferring to maintain them in mummified form while political activism took center stage; still, the result was much the same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Today, the spokespersons for conservative religious denominations in America speak and act as though reinstating the mores and politics that America had in the late 1940s has become the be-all and end-all of their religion. In response, a growing number of former parishioners of conservative denominations have withdrawn into the rapidly growing Home Church movement, in which families meet in living rooms with their neighbors to pray and study the Bible together. If that trend accelerates, as it appears to be doing, today’s conservative megachurches may soon turn into cavernous spaces visited once a week by a handful of retirees, just like the once-bustling liberal churches across the road. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style='font-family: Times; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: "Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode"; mso-fareast-language: #00FF; mso-font-kerning: .5pt'>The hijacking of religious institutions by the competing civil religion of progress has thus turned out to be a disaster on both sides of the political divide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The distortions imposed on religion, once it was taken hostage by the myth of progress, thus correspond closely to the distortions imposed on science during its own imprisonment by the same myth. As the civil religion of progress begins to lose its grip on the collective imagination of our time, in turn, both science and religion thus will have to undergo a difficult process of reappraisal, in which many of the mistaken commitments of recent decades will need to be renegotiated or simply abandoned. Harrowing as that process may be, it may just have an unexpected benefit—a negotiated truce in the pointless struggle between science and religion, or even a creative rapprochement between these two distinct and complementary ways of relating to the universe. I’ll discuss these possibilities in next week’s post. </span></div>

I am wondering if the myth of progress prevents people from considering the possibility that a mistake has been made, or a commitment to a dead end path has been made, and being able to go back and take another path. This might be the case with trying to quantize gravity. Perhaps the converse is another path to try (I am trying!). It might also be the case with the industrial revolution. Perhaps it was a mistake and we should try something else that considers the benefits of a healthy community, creative work that connects people to each other and nature, and healthy ecosystems, not just efficiency and comfort.

I would like to add some thoughts with regard to industry. <br><br>The July 2013 issue of the journal Hydrocarbon Processing published an article entitled, “The future of automation is now”. The authors (Clark and Turk) define three phases of technological evolution in the Chemical Process Industries in a sketch “Process Industry Drivers”. I don’t think that I can include graphics on this blog, so I will try to put it into words:<br><br>• Phase I (1950s) – we invent new chemicals (think of the word “Plastics” in the movie “The Graduate”).<br>• Phase II (1970s) – the industry develops new processes for making the newly invented chemicals.<br>• Phase III (1990s to now) – we make those processes more efficient.<br><br>The process industries are highly dependent on the availability of oil, not so much as a fuel, but as a feedstock. Were the supply of oil to falter then the concept of progress will probably move toward a fourth phase, “Improvisation”. We would have to learn how to run our facilities with erratic supplies of feedstock, an unreliable supply of spare parts and poorly trained employees.<br><br>This would mean that progress in an industrial context actually goes into reverse. Concepts that are baked into our way of thinking such as Economies of Scale, Just-in-Time management and Global Operations would actually be detrimental in Phase IV.<br><br><br><a href=#c7367803446680700513 title="comment permalink">7/17/13, 11:44 PM</a><br><br>

To me it is an issue of engineering maybe nearly impossible engineering but still engineering. A hydrogen bomb is an example of a man made fusion energy device but one that requires an atom bomb (fission bomb) in order to get the temperatures and pressures high enough (that shows how extreme the conditions are). One thing to keep in mind is that advances in engineering often lie dormant until the right matching technology is developed. As pasttense mentioned human heavier than air flight required centuries for success. The development of internal combustion engines and advances in materials and manufacturing were catalysts for the last step in that history. Similarly, fusion may be developed due to other technologies that are coming of age. I know of one early stage company that is attempting to develop a smallish fusion reactor by leveraging the recent advances in high speed electronics and feedback and control systems. These independent technologies were not online a decade or two ago.<br><br><a href=#c2309383607734179412 title="comment permalink">7/17/13, 11:48 PM</a><br><br>

For instance one of my friends told me some years back: "Modernity knows no major dysfunctions, only minor ones which are fully expected". I am still flabbergasted by this statement because it means that believers in modernity/progress can never be convinced that any dysfunction may prove to be unresolvable by our civilisation. They can always come up with clever arguments why this particular problem will soon be over. Hence the belief is unfalsifiable, pure faith at work! <br><br>You have described how Christianity in the US conformed itself to the roles assigned to it by progress. Do you think that something similar happened in other major religions and if so can you give examples?<br><br>Finally, I noted that the religion of progress comes along with a fairly rabid materialistic world view where for instance the very existence of intuition is denied. As this religion weakens, what kind of world view do you think may emerge and what role do you envision for such non rational phenomena as intuition in such a new world view?<br><br>Regards<br><br><a href=#c8442651282080161146 title="comment permalink">7/18/13, 2:44 AM</a><br><br>

I wrote at more length about this <a href=http://anubisbard.blogspot.com/2013/07/an-evolutionary-parable-and-age-of.html rel=nofollow>on my own blog</a> but this is the crux of it:<br><br>The problem is not that we lack solutions for living upon the earth. The problem is that most of these solutions are incompatible with our cosmology of Progress. Let me reiterate that. We have solutions, but because these solutions are - for lack of a better word - heretical - they cannot be enacted (or for the most part, even discussed). The idea that we should be intentionally applying our considerable creative and technical energies toward building a future that is slower, poorer, and less shiny than today's is so unthinkable that people mostly refuse to think it.<br><br>For example, we can easily avoid climate change calamity if we are willing to leave $4 trillion dollars worth of fossil fuel in the ground, bankrupting some of the largest, most powerful economic interests on earth, and bringing the engines of economic growth to a shuddering halt. We could move past non-renewable resources if we took only what systems can regenerate and forewent the rest. We can feed all our people if we reigned in population, discarded the worst of modern agribusiness and transitioned to a more productive, less wasteful, more labor-intensive steady-state food system. We could put an end to our continuous economic crises if we abandoned the fiction of global economic growth and created an economy that could smoothly function with contraction. After all, such changes are going to be imposed on us eventually whether we like it or not. <br><br><br><a href=#c6960408719849188948 title="comment permalink">7/18/13, 3:51 AM</a><br><br>

He calls the dominant religion, ‘Growth’, as in economic growth. You refer somewhat more broadly to the religion of ‘Progress. The themes seem intertwined.<br> <br>For me the adjustments to religion / social hierarchy that were so characteristic of the 19thC in the face of the explosion of industrial progress and the scrabble for discoveries, including those of science &amp; technology, was the start of a retreat of the bigger denominations, i.e. decline of those having a big political role not just in the ‘English speaking world’ but within the broader Western culture. Also, religions within a range of affected cultures, not just those of the West, seem to have changed their role. For example, secular ideology appears to have dominated collapsed Empires not only in Europe but also in the Near East; thus Turkey, previously the core of the Ottoman Empire could be another case. (I leave out the Far East as beyond my scope).<br><br>Traditional religion certainly has recently played a much smaller part in Western Europe. I think you have previously expressed interest in coming religious revivals, Regarding that theme, I witnessed the strong religious revival starting in Poland in the early 1980s, being an expression there of resurgent ‘national identity’; and I gather that Russia has seen something similar more recently. Resurgence of religion in the Middle East and in the ancient civilisation of Iran (the latter was never part of the Ottoman Empire) could be significant.<br><br>Incidentally I have returned from a few days ‘course’ helping build a ‘compost toilet’ adjacent to a ‘faith centred’ minority community in UK’s North Pennine. When cycling home last week I passed successively a small isolated 12thC church and two ‘Stately Homes’ open to the public. One of the houses became connected with the early 20thC ‘socialist’ British Labour Party via a maverick aristocrat landowner; the other was built by an industrialist as a futuristic late 19thC mansion having prototype electric lights and micro-hydro. He had been instrumental over a few decades in replacing cannons on warships with hydraulically managed rifles capable of lobbing a well-aimed ton of explosive projectile more than 10 miles.<br><br>The first old house, where I drank two pots of tea, displays a wonderful ‘blow-up’ photo of the early Labour Party. The crowd of beards and bustle dresses were all seated on that same lawn. They must have arrived by the now defunct railway, though I guess there might have been some bicycles. As I passed the second house, I reflected on the role of the British industrialist. He was a major contributor to the arms races that ‘ended’ if that is the word, in 1946. He sold warships to a number of navies but was chiefly famed for his help in the build up of the Japanese Imperial Navy who could then whack the Russians at the penultimate pre-1914 demo at the battle of Tsushima (1905).<br> <br>As a footnote, the little 12thC church perched on a rock sill a few miles north of Hadrian’s Wall had an adjacent village for many centuries, but the village was dismantled in the early 19thC after the population was wiped out by cholera brought by a returning sailor. (Message: compost toilets should be carefully designed?). I also found it interesting that the intellectual founder in the 1940s of Britain’s ‘welfare state’, later ennobled as Lord Beveridge, is buried with his wife modestly in this remote graveyard. <br><br>Cycle rides indeed!

The closest I can come to are two writers I esteem, Hans Kung and John Dominic Crossan. <br><br>But even they do not seem a close fit. <br><br>Both of them denounce Emperor Constantine's rapprochement between Church and Empire (a rapprochement which, they and I would suggest, continues in its sterile, empty course today, with Washington in place of the Roman Capitol). Yet both issue the denunciation without attacking doctrinal fundamentals, as defined in the Nicene and Apostolic Creeds ("Rose again on the third day", "One baptism for the forgiveness of sins"). <br><br>(b) On the other hand, neither does Catholicism closely fit your characterization of religious conservatism. You write, "Today, the spokespersons for conservative religious denominations in America speak and act as though reinstating the mores and politics that America had in the late 1940s has become the be-all and end-all of their religion." <br><br>There is here only a modest degree of fit. <br><br>A conservative Catholic wing does decry abortion (this is right of them) and same-sex marriage (here I think their ground is shakier), and keeps judiciously silent on American militarism (here their work is scandalously poor). In this sense, it is true, a conservative USA Catholic wing is defending 1940s mores. <br><br>This conservative wing is represented on the Web by many of the laity posting in the "Catholic Answers" forum, and I think is represented in USA television broadcasting by EWTN. A good European book author from the conservative wing is Josemaria Escriva, the founder of Opus Dei. <br><br>Here again, I say, there appears to be only a modest fit with your characterization of ecclesial conservatism.<br><br>The socially conservative Catholics will deny that the defence of 1940s mores is what you term "the be-all and end-all of their religion". Conservative Catholics will insist as loudly as anyone that their be-all and end-all is eucharistic. It is centrally so, for them as for less stridently conservative Catholics, in the Mass. It is vicariously so, for them as for less stridently conservative Catholics, in eucharistic adoration at the reserved Sacrament, in prayer undertaken not at the reserved Sacrament (as when one prays at home), and in secular works of mercy. <br><br>All segments of the Catholic spectrum, from the fans of Kung and Crossan on the left to the members of Opus Dei on the right, agree on the need to incarnate a eucharistic theology in social action. (Someone has usefully written, "For the Catholic mind, truth is incarnate.") Most American Catholics these days accordingly pay at least a kind of lip service to the ideals of 1930s-to-1980s New Yorker Dorothy Day, in some possibly lukewarm way feeling that here is an individual who has managed to live her faith. <br><br>Disagreements there are, but they occur, sometimes noisily between right wing and left wing, within a wide framework of agreemnt that this week's ADR essay fails to sketch. <br><br>Indeed one might a little sternly remark that anyone stepping outside the wide common agreed framework, rejecting portions of the Creed or the Catechism, is by definition stepping outside Catholicism. <br><br>Perhaps you can comment further on Catholicism at some stage, whether this week or later? <br><br>I wonder, also, if American Judaism fits into your characterization of contemporary religion, or whether the same difficulties arise in its case as I am respectfully suggesting arise for Catholicism? <br><br><br>Sincerely, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>www punkt metascientia punkt com <br>Toomas punkt Karmo at gmail punkt com <br><br><br><a href=#c2118075731782650388 title="comment permalink">7/18/13, 8:46 AM</a><br><br>

He failed at a couple of points, however, to think laterally. <br><br>A good science fiction story could start with a time traveller's returning to Victorian Britain for one second, placing onto Babbage's desk a postcard containing one sentence: "Try not gears and base-10 numerical notation but telegraph relays and base-2 numerical notation." <br><br>In the story I am envisaging, the sentence is sufficient inducement for Babbage to redesign his Analytical Engine. His Engine now becomes a huge rack of relays, powered by batteries of wet cells. The delicate relay reeds are kept clean by enclosing the whole assemblage in a barn-like room, with steam engines running intake and exhaust fans against door-sized filters of fine-weave linen. <br><br>Readout is now through compass needles over coils. <br><br>Input is, as in Babbage's own design, through punched cards. <br><br>As Babbage progresses, he achieves the insight of the 1940s machine designers (von Neumann?), namely, that his "store" (I think that in his own, base-10, design, the store held only data) could actually hold not data alone but also machine instructions. <br><br>In contemporary language, we would put this by saying that "The microcode is made to live right in the RAM." <br><br>Her Majesty's Government, seeing the industrial, and even the military-diplomatic, implications of Babbage's work, fund him generously (as they did in actual Victorian Britain). <br><br>By 1914 or so, Britain is the world's leading power in computation, with Babbage indeed dead, but his legacy carried forward by others. <br><br>This is as it was in the actual world, with (e.g.) binary-computer pioneer Aiken at Harvard in actuality discovering one of six Difference Engines constructed by Babbage's son Henry Prevost Babbage (1824–1918). <br><br>Those pesky compass-needle readouts are in the counterfactual 1914-or-so scenario replaced with register-by-register banks of incandescent bulbs. And there are rudimentary hardcopy printers. <br><br>The task of programming is eased with the construction of symbolic assemblers, so that programmers need no longer write microcode at their desks. <br><br>There are even whispers, in the corridors of 1914 power at the Royal Society and in Whitehall, that the emerging cathode-grid-plate "thermionic valve", now becoming useful in wireless telegraphy, may soon replace the telegraph relay, making Babbage's machine architecture run faster. It is in those same corridors additionally whispered that "compilers" might some day manufacture huge slabs of microcode out of terse input paragraphs written not in assembler but in "high-level languages". <br><br>With Britain's preeminence in engineering duly cemented through an early, decisive, lead in the design and deployment of computing machinery, Kaiser Wilhelm pursues a properly circumspect diplomacy. World War I never does break out. The twentieth century is accordingly a century of what Churchill was pleased to call, in addressing the House on 1940-06-18, "sunlit uplands". <br><br><br>Rather wickedly, <br>having lately finished <br>an excellent post-breakfast cuppa, <br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br>(anglophile Estonian near Toronto) <br>www punkt metascientia punkt com<br>Toomas dot Karmo at gmail punkt com<br><br><a href=#c7820455254101743170 title="comment permalink">7/18/13, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

Historical empires of Egypt, Greece, China, Rome, Aztec, and Maya empires (just to name a few) all had a fairly localized geological area where their influence was felt both during their prosperous times as well as their fall. E.g. the ancestors of the Mayans or other aboriginal American tribes did not feel any effect of the Roman empire's ruling or fall. However, the current empire, even if the power center is in the USA, has a rather global effect on the entire planet. This is something that technological progress did achieve (shrinking the world via communication and travel) which makes a significant difference from previous empire cycles.<br><br>As far as my limited historical knowledge goes, previous empires that have fallen did not give rise to a new empire on the same place. Instead, new empires came about independently from the fall of previous ones. So what worries me is the fall of this empire might have a global devastating effect, which breaks the cycle and no new empire will anywhere on Earth.<br><br>Do you have any comment on this aspect, or you think this is irrelevant to think about at this point ?<br><br><br><a href=#c5521863481849973597 title="comment permalink">7/18/13, 10:17 AM</a><br><br>

The medical system is becoming increasingly unaffordable, and more people don't want to participate in it, so... We'll make them! <br><br>This is probably rehashing something that's been said here over and over, but I really think most people don't want to think about the end of progress because it means that we have to figure out how to preserve the things we like about the last 3 centuries, instead of just relying on the God of Star Trek to do it. And while that sounds like a simple enough statement, you pretty quickly enter some thorny ground.<br><br>So for instance, I'm pretty attached to the past century's achievements in the areas of gender and sexuality, as are many people. But when I think about how to preserve them in a nonindustrial world-- in a world, in other words, where significantly less energy per capita is available all round, and most of the energy available comes from human muscle-- it requires admitting a few uncomfortable things. First it requires actually looking at gender roles in nonindustrial societies from around the world. According to which of the two big versions of the myth of progress you believe in, if we look far back enough, we should be able to find either a Goddess-worshiping egalitarian paradise or a Hobbesian nightmare. Instead, while those two kind of sort of turn up occasionally if you squint the right way, things are really much more complicated. Societies which are constrained by energy limits, and in which population replacement is an immediate concern, have had to allocate their human resources accordingly. <br><br>In order to figure out how they do what, you sort of have to put yourself in their shoes. Say you had a population of 50 men and 50 women, with a natural resource base x depleting at rate y, and a certain number of neighbors at least some of whom are hostile. You need to allocate your humans in such a way that you can preserve your population in the face of war, disease, and the hazards of daily life without overshooting the carrying capacity of the land. So you can allocate all your women to war and all your men to motherhood. How does that affect things? Okay, now try it the other way around. How about now? Once you figure out an arrangement that allows you to not go extinct in the current environment, only then can you start thinking about how to make people happy. How do you do that? Here, you can start looking at the solutions that actual societies have come up with. In all my reading, the two most common solutions in nonindustrial societies seem to be 1. maintaining separate spheres of authority and 2. maintaining a transgender or third/fourth gender option.<br><br>Now, at this point, you've already had to look through the eyes of people who didn't do things the way that your culture does, and to try to sympathize with them, and that is something that no one in America seems capable of doing. Now it gets even harder, because you have to come up with ways of handling an issue that are workable but that are different from those laid down by the God of Star Trek. This seems to be nearly impossible for many people. In the Star Trek universe, all the women are called "sir" and you can replicate anything you'd like for dinner. Real life has a way of being messier, and real life solutions always carry problems, drawbacks and unintended consequences. In my experience most people, if you try to talk to them about this sort of thing, will point to the problems with the real-life solutions, refuse to see the people of the past who have come up with those solutions as anything but monsters for not following contemporary political dogmas, and insist that it's got to be their way or nothing. Unfortunately, that leads me to think it's probably going to be nothing. <br><br><br><a href=#c2233463898072115230 title="comment permalink">7/18/13, 10:41 AM</a><br><br>

I carry mine openly, which is legal in this state!<br><br>Jen, well, as I said to Tom, it was a figure of speech; no known explosive is powerful enough to open a closed mind. <br><br>Justin, you know that when you play rock music backwards, you supposedly summon the devil; when you play country music backwards, you get your wife back, your truck back, your dog back, etc. Do you know what happens when you sing "Kum Ba Ya" backwards? You get your congregation back...<br><br>Richard, quite possibly!<br><br>Toomas, the liberal Catholics I know are more likely to read Matthew Fox than Hans Kung, and as Justin pointed out, they're playing Britney Spears music at services, which is enough to curdle anyone's digestion. The Catholic term for the liberal end of what I was discussing is Modernism, and from what I hear, despite repeated papal censures, it's still deeply entrenched at a lot of Jesuit universities here in the States. The conservatives -- well, those that haven't gone schismatic and Tridentine -- are the ones denouncing the liberals as CINOs ("Catholics in name only") and insisting that anybody to the left of them ought to be driven out of the church. Same song, different words -- and I understand, from talking to my Jewish friends, that the same dynamic has taken place between Reform (on the left) and Orthodox (on the right) congregations, with Conservative (confusingly, in the middle) not really sure which way to hop. <br><br>Stanley, I suggest you go back and reread what I wrote, because you've completely misstated it. My point was not that fusion is impossible but that at this point, even if it works, it's too expensive to serve as a workable power source.

I don't think the scientific method is the only valid way to understand the world, but perhaps being "unscientific" is similar to being "anti-progress" in most people's minds. Perhaps Steiner coined the term "spiritual science" as a marketing gimmick. He did not seem to have been aware of the concept of experimental controls and ways of dealing with experimental bias (such as the double blind protocol).

I know you will disagree but the inner circle all agrees on that. It is the one branch of science which has by far the highest percentage of atheists. This is no accident. Darwin himself said Christianity was a religion that no decent person would want to be true (or was it Voltaire?) and that if true it would consign his beloved father and grandfather to hell. (I would lay the fault of modern atheism at the feet of western Christianity, but I digress.) <br>Humans require an origins teaching, and this is why Dawkins said Darwinian evolution allowed him to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. <br>Now, mind you, life unfolded slowly from the simple to the complex, and we can call that evolution. But those in charge of the theory at academia have never waited for a plausible explanation and have thus jumped from one absurdity to another, and this is partly the usual hubris but also they really needed to have a system that works with matter only, with no will or mind or intent.<br><br>I have not yet figured out what you believe about such things, but I have at least got some partial opinions from you on that. So the crux of the problem for me is the insistence that evolution was absolutely undirected and without purpose. Only an atheist needs that, it is an unproven and metaphysical stance that they had no right to teach my children as fact, and if you do believe that consciousness, mind or divinity is part of the universe or the source of the universe, then it is really quite unlikely to be true.<br><br><a href=#c5812550752774974167 title="comment permalink">7/18/13, 12:55 PM</a><br><br>

Likewise, although I have never believed it likely that life exists apart from God, I read very thoroughly this controversy, not with creationism in which I am uninterested, but the arguments of those against Darwinism, mostly Intelligent Design. Not only is the evidence in favor of it not increasing, it is decreasing. The more we learn of, for example, molecular biology, the less likely unguided and random processes and mutations appear to be adequate explanations. I read the literature on as detailed a level as I can find, and believe me, the devil is definitely in the details. I've just spent two chapters reading about protein folds. I guess the reason I have taken issue here is that no matter how much the proponents insist that the evidence is overwhelming and only idiots would fail to agree, it simply isn't so. The arguments against neoDarwinism are absolutely compelling to me, there are several classes of them, they are intricately scientific, and take no position at all on the god issue, although of course many authors are religious. And furthermore, I have never seen even one good refutation of their points, although it is often claimed that such refutations have taken place!<br><br>I, for one, would really like to know how life unfolded. You mentioned once that it might have been done by committee, and I tend to agree. Jeremy Narby in the Cosmic Serpent wonders if DNA is actually a life form, an entity, with an agenda to evolve itself. <br><br>I don't for a moment think that the Intelligent Design community would behave any better if they had the upper hand - that's the human character flaw I mentioned - but the understanding of the unfolding of life as it currently stands is a kind of substitute religion and you know how religious people don't like to examine their dogmas in detail? Whereas the intelligent design scientists are using detail to slowly back them into a corner. <br><br>You heard it from me first!<br><br><a href=#c4256399549084266867 title="comment permalink">7/18/13, 1:14 PM</a><br><br>

The German word <i>wissenschaft</i> covers much more territory than the English word science -- pretty much any organized body of knowledge can be <i>ein wissenschaft</i>, whether or not it makes use of the scientific method. Steiner's work has quite a bit of value in its own right, but you're right, of course, that it's not scientific in the strict sense of the English word. <br><br>Onething, I'm aware that Neodarwinism has been used as ammunition by atheists, but it's hardly fair to insist that this makes it inherently atheistic, any more than the fact that some Satanists enjoy playing volleyball makes volleyball Satanic. The only question that Darwinism or any other scientific theory can answer is "how," and that leaves such other questions as "why" and "who" wide open. No scientific theory, insofar as it remains scientific, can prove or disprove a claim about the purpose of evolution, or of anything else -- again, those are not questions science addresses, and those who try to make science address such issues (as of course pop atheists such as Richard Dawkins do) are engaging in an abuse of science. <br><br>I'm not a molecular biologist, and so I take my cues from those who are -- and those with whom I've discussed these issues assure me that the supposed biochemical disproofs of Darwinian evolution are invalid. They may be wrong, to be sure, but the logic of Darwinian evolution makes powerful sense to me, and those arguments against it that I do have the knowledge to critique (for example, arguments by design that focus on ecological relationships) are remarkable for their logical shoddiness, so I tend to trust the biologists here. <br><br>Finally, I want to return to the issue I raised in the post -- nothing in the Bible or the historic creeds of Christianity rules out biological evolution. If that's how God chose to create humanity, I think He showed excellent taste in selecting an elegant method. The notion that Christianity has to reject a scientific theory that has no bearing on any of the core issues of Christian faith is, I would argue, a sign of just how deeply Christianity has been hijacked into the service of the myth of progress -- in this case as one of its canned opponents. <br><br>K-dog, thanks for the link.

At first, I enjoyed the services, which contained a broad variety of diverse views and opinions. But the past few years, I can see some of the same problems in the Unitarian-Universalist denomination that occurred with the evangelicals. Just as the conservative Christians try to work in politics to bring about conformity to their interpretation of what is biblically correct, liberal religionists are doing the same to bring about conformity to their interpretation of what is politically correct. It’s exactly like your comment on liberal churches that “redefined their clergy as amateur social service providers and progressive activists with a sideline in rites of passage.” Some UU’s have even gone from calling themselves a liberal religion to a progressive religion, and at both the local and national level seem to be falling over themselves reorganizing in order to ride the shirttails of progressive politics and attract what is thought to be the rising tide of progressive faith among the young people of today. They are stepping on some toes among their members while doing so, and I wonder whether they truly will be able to attract all of these Generation XYZ, Millennials, and such, in numbers great enough to replace the aging membership of Hippy-Boomers/Silent Generation that makes up the present day UU majority. They are pushing politics as much as the conservative churches are, and often are just as self-righteous about it too. Both groups are trying to use politics to force their version of utopia upon society, whether it’s for progression toward a Christian America or a New Progressive America. <br><br>Sometimes I wonder why I attend church at all. I don’t even consider myself religious, but just interested in formulating a philosophy of life that is based on “what is”. Perhaps the literalist authority that is so often present in American religion has poisoned me toward the word “religion”, along with “worship”, “god” etc. I look forward to your future posts, and hope that I can gain a different, useful way of looking at religion. <br><br>By the way, I heard on the radio while typing this that Detroit, the home of industrial progress, has declared bankruptcy. <br><br><br><a href=#c7621959108945375007 title="comment permalink">7/18/13, 3:49 PM</a><br><br>

If Christianization occurs, then we may see a recurrence of all of these happenings. Christianity, when it is powerless, speaks in such innocuous love &amp; light terms.

Which illustrates a rather important detail that you skipped over in your analysis.<br><br>This detail is that the actual goal of the enterprise changes, but without acknowledging the change.<br><br>There was a time when the goal of science was to figure things out and write about it. Then it became merely to write (publish or perish). Now, it is mostly about securing funding for writing.<br><br>Traditional fusion research is very good for securing funding. It's well-studied: there aren't a lot of surprises, and regardless of how it turns out, you'll get a publishable paper and a good chance at the next round of funding. That it is a dead-end research is endlessly debatable, but irrelevant to the actual <i>function</i> of the research, which is to secure the next round of research funding.<br><br>I'm currently watching my son- and daughter-in-law go through this shift of emphasis. They're about a year into their first tenure-track positions, and they immediately found themselves managing a small business: funding, personnel, managing, ordering, politicking and cutting deals. Research? Nah -- that's something their grad students do. The lucky stiffs.<br><br>Politics is much the same. The biggest part of freshman orientation for new senators, I've read, is about securing funding for the next election campaign. It isn't greatly in error to say that the job of a Senator is to remain a Senator: nothing more nor less. As jobs go, it pays well, and its benefits are second to none.<br><br>Perhaps this hollowing-out of enterprises into shells that maintain the form but lack the substance of what they once were, is the essence of social senescence.

I have noticed a third which I will call the NWO or New World Order narrative. In this view the craziness of the world has an underlying cause and is orchestrated by a shadowy group of the worlds elite. The purpose is to either enslave or wipe out most of us lesser folks by about 2030 or so unless we rise up and fight back. Interestingly they pick a similar date for this to culminate as some of the NTE people use for the date when our NTE time runs out (~2030). These people also pick up on many of the same things that others view as just the collapse of our civilization, they just put a conspiracy theory spin on it. Of course climate change is just a hoax perpetrated by the elite to further enslave us. I guess this narrative serves the same purpose as the other two, it gives people the space to avoid confronting the real issues.<br><br><a href=#c9174212380019089570 title="comment permalink">7/18/13, 9:45 PM</a><br><br>

I can see it's possible to characterise economic-growth/BAU types as 'dinosaurs' and that 'good planning in the progressive sense means thinking based on a realistic understanding of the limits of ecological capacity to absorb pollution and provide resources'. It would mean splitting economic progress off from moral and scientific progress and encouraging people to see conventional economics as an evolutionary dead end. One difficulty is that those who have serious decision-making power in the current arrangement are exactly those who depend on the current economic arrangements.<br><br>If the narrative that has gripped most people so firmly can be used as an entry point to begin thinking within the 'Limits to growth' framework, that might help people make some less disastrous decisions. I can see that there's a danger that cognitive dissonance would lead them to ignore/forget what they would prefer not to see, but harnessing this to ideas about reality-testing and scientific enquiry is potentially powerful, since most people in the progressive side want to see themselves as realistic, scientitic and so on. Wondering if you see other hazards attending the gambit of using the story of moral and scientific progress to help people come to terms with the age of limits?<br><br><a href=#c2114690655921781748 title="comment permalink">7/19/13, 2:19 AM</a><br><br>

For what it is worth though, as a biological scientist albeit not an evolutionary biologist, I support your general conclusions. Forgive a longish quote summarising a publication in this week’s <i>Science</i>. I hope it gives general readers a flavour of the scientific method as the science tries to account for the natural world. <br><br>Adaptation is a wonderful thing. Borrowing a more poetic note; given conditions, 'design' is perhaps an emergent property of the days of our vanity, given time and chance under the sun?<br><br><b> Playing the Tape of Life</b><br><i>Should the tape of life be replayed, would it produce the same music? Many influential evolutionary biologists, notably Stephen J. Gould, have argued that the answer is “no.” However, patterns of convergence among different species filling similar niches all over the world have argued that the answer is neither so simple nor perhaps so negative. Classic cases of convergence, such as marsupials on the Australian continent or cichlids across the African rift lakes, have demonstrated that similar ecological pressures can result in species with similar ecological traits. Such classic examples, however, do not allow for the influence of niche filling based purely on chance. Mahler et al. (p. 292) take advantage of the well-studied species clades of Caribbean anoles to examine patterns of adaptation and niche filling across species and islands. Across-islands convergence on a few distinct adaptive peaks (or niches) has driven diversification of species. Anomalies from these ecotypes are only found on the largest, most diverse islands. Thus, ecological niches powerfully shape species and convergence on particular forms is an inherent component of adaptation. Thus, it seems that the tape of life might play the same music, despite being produced by different instruments.</i><br><br><a href=#c5493317502622425411 title="comment permalink">7/19/13, 3:21 AM</a><br><br>

I know that Detroit as metaphor is not exactly an original thought (every other comment on news stories about Detroit's bankruptcy are using Detroit as a metaphoric example). <br><br>But how do people doubt theories like the long descent when we have Detroit as a real-life example of how long descents operate? Detroit has been in decline longer than I've been alive, and I'm 42, and yet nearly three-quarters of a million people still live within the city limits and, as unpleasant as most of their lives may be, they still function in a city that has municipal services, as limited as they are. And I know they're horribly limited -- 58 minutes on average for the police to respond to a call -- but the point is that the descent is long, and these services don't go away overnight, as some people seem to think they do or will. Many decades after the start of Detroit being used as the classic example of U.S. post-industrial decay, the city -- evidently even after bankruptcy -- offers municipal services to its residents.<br><br>The other point I don't see written about as much is that, while the city of Detroit has been in its agonizing but slow-motion descent, the suburbs around Detroit function more or less as well as any other U.S. metro area. The Detroit airport, in nearby Romulus, is a major airline hub and completed a sparkling-new international terminal several years ago. I chuckle at the thought of international passengers connecting through Detroit for the first time, expecting post-industrial decay, and emerging in a well-run and modern terminal.<br><br>Michigan has higher unemployment than nearly all other states, but Detroit's suburbs are by and large the same sprawling, middle-class places you see anywhere built in the U.S. after World War II. In short: they are aesthetically awful, full of chain stores, and car-dependent, but for now they work fine for what they are.<br><br>My point in all that is, issues of race and Americans' disregard and cruelty toward the lives of other Americans' aside for a moment, regional Detroit, the Detroit <i>metro area</i>, may be instructive as an example of a long descent. Namely: that even as certain areas reach troughs of decline, other areas around them (just a few miles away) are much higher up on the ladder of decline, and these two situations can coexist quite functionally (if not happily) for quite some time. The lack of uniformity of decline is striking to me (and, again, I know how issues of racism and corruption and overspending created this situation, but I'm looking at the reality of this lack of uniformity in societal decline rather than rehashing its causes).<br><br>Google Street View (perhaps the most underrated piece of desktop technology there is) is your guide to seeing the reality in the city of Detroit. Merely drop the little orange guy nearly anywhere in the city, and you can see, in HD, what several decades of long descent can do to a place.<br><br>Gah, I am off-topic for this week's post, but I hope you'll put me through anyway.<br><br><a href=#c1371219339618948511 title="comment permalink">7/19/13, 9:05 AM</a><br><br>

The generation of genetic novelty is a feature, not a bug -- genes are adapted in a great many elegant ways to produce a steady stream of new combinations, and new genetic and epigenetic expressions. Those variations then become the raw material on which natural selection works. <br><br>As for evolution being inherently atheistic, that's like claiming that meteorology is atheistic because God doesn't independently manufacture each individual cloud to cause rain to fall on the just and the unjust -- it's an unjustifiable and completely unnecessary confusion between means and ends. I'm beginning to wonder if I need to research and write a book on the theology of evolution, just to clear up some of the shoddy logic being used by both sides of the debate. <br><br>Wiseman, I think that Western schooling exists for the purpose of paying the salaries of school administrators and government bureaucrats.

Many thanks for the quote.<br><br>John, if you assume that evolution presupposes a mechanical universe and unilinear time, yes, you can them extract mechanism and a simplistic sense of time out of it! What I'm trying to say is that these presuppositions are not necessary to evolutionary theory -- nor, crucially, is progress in any sense implied by that theory. Adaptation is not perpetual improvement. <br><br>Take the basic concepts of evolutionary theory -- gradually increasing genetic and epigenetic diversity, on the one hand, and selective pressures from the environment, on the other -- and put them in a universe that isn't wholly mechanistic or limited to Newtonian time. In such a universe -- which may well be more like ours than the universe of mechanism -- evolution still functions in the same way; the unfolding of diversity and the nature of the selective pressures may not be quite the same as in a mechanistic universe, but the process still works. <br><br>Adrian, thanks for the facts and figures!<br><br><a href=#c527900193020950811 title="comment permalink">7/19/13, 9:22 AM</a><br><br>

Seems to be bad form though to question whether it was the Fed, at least in part, responsible for the mess in the first place. <br><br>A question: shouldn't monetary policy such as that prescribed by Greenspan and Bernanke act as a bridge from "here" to "there"? We know where "here" is ie where things are at now. <br><br>"Here", where we're at, is an economically ruined continent littered with the financial carcasses of businesses and families and entire cities. How did we get "here"? You can massage numbers and statistics and craft narratives to comply with a particular ideological world view to explain this on-going year-by-year deterioration. Or to claim this is just an aspect of on-going change and eventual, upward economic "progress". Or maybe to claim that there is no deterioration, that things are just hunky-dory, that things have never been better. People are, after all, subject to what some call "landscape amnesia". Never mind landscape amnesia, the young 'uns weren't around to see their grandfathers troop off, lunch-pails in hand, to the factory gates. <br><br>But I've seen the decades long deterioration. There are people that would suggest offshoring as one important explanation and I would in large part agree. The justifiers and explainers and re-writers of history don't fool me. They say offshoring and de-industrialization is a canard. Sorry, I'm not buying it. <br><br>So how could loose monetary policy act as a bridge to get us over some temporary economic difficulty? Let's say that it could act as a stimulant to get under-utilized factory capacity back up and running and hiring laid off workers. But what if the factories no longer exist - at least in North America? If the intent for expansionary monetary policy is to stimulate demand and get people back to work, thereby stimulating more demand, there have to be work-places to go back to. The problem is that those work-places are now in places like China and there's scant evidence that they're coming back or that monetary policy is somehow going to fill the gap left by their departure. <br><br>And so, instead of being an economic restorative, each monetary expansion inflicts a new asset bubble (maybe this time a bond bubble) and in the fullness of time a new bust and another calamity. You have events in the real world and the real economy - offshoring from the US in this case - that have as their reasonably expected consequence a decline in American living standards. What else would you expect? <br><br>Back to my question. We know where "here" is. But what is the intended destination for these repeated bouts of expansionary monetary policy? I would submit that aside from some nebulous idea of "growth" there is no real plan. Have you heard of one? I haven't. Just open the money spigots and hope for the best. The - ahem - "free market" will somehow take care of it. The "free market", the theoreticians tell us, will self-adjust. Sure it does, I've seen it. Forgive my insolence, far be it from me to question the great and the powerful, but when the "free market" jumps off a cliff does it count as a "self adjustment"?<br><br><a href=#c108523324681647711 title="comment permalink">7/19/13, 11:02 AM</a><br><br>

He wrote two works on the matter. "Against the Manicheans" and "The Literal Meaning of Genesis." In short Augustine did not claim that Genesis was a scientific account of creation. Augustine, like Aquinas, did not think that one could even establish the creation of the world on scientific grounds. Instead, creation can only be believed as a matter of faith.

Re the two sides not listening to one another, that is so, and yet I think that side which is debunking neoDarwinism listens better because one, they simply have to in order to marshal their arguments, and two, they have slightly differing motivations. For someone who believes in God, evolutionary theory is an irritant, but not a real threat to their worldview. However for those like our friend Georgi, it is essential. <br>The religious, on the other hand, have their faith and irrational belief system invested elsewhere. It is incredibly difficult to get them to examine that. But for the atheists who I maintain are the real leaders in this dogma because it is a substitute religion, their human tendency toward irrational beliefs are invested in evolution theory, and this detracts greatly from it as a neutral science.<br><br>As to this cute sentence,<br><br>"In other words, if you believe in God or gods, it seems reasonable to suggest maybe they weren't totally neutral to the development of these little critters romping all over their handiwork."<br><br>That is a humorous way of stating why I think there is an atheistic divide in evolutionary theory. The real insiders teach it in such a way that God has nothing to do with it, which I consider almost a logical impossibility.<br>Either it is random and unassisted or it ain't. If there was a setup, that's a different ball game.<br><br>If we're in the setup ballgame, the problem then is that we have not yet found a mechanism to account for how evolution happens.<br><br>Georgi,<br><br>The neutral theory is one of several. But upon closer scrutiny, which has been accelerating since the 70's, none of the proposed mechanisms holds up.<br><br>Re your reply to JMG, you are only correct if I am right that as you see it, evolution theory precludes God. What JMG is saying (I think) is that life can evolve through genetic changes in a Darwinian fashion, and it does not conflict with the idea that God/gods created the world/universe and had something to do with getting life going.<br><br>Phil Harris:<br><br>I like your quote because it is a great example of assuming one's conclusions.

Nowhere in the Bible does it say that the luminous poetry of the first chapter of Genesis must be treated as a geology textbook, nor is a literal reading of Genesis mandated by any of the historic creeds of the Christian churches. Nonetheless “Thou shalt not evolve” got turned into an ersatz Eleventh Commandment, and devout Christians exercised their ingenuity to the utmost to find ways to ignore the immense and steadily expanding body of evidence from geology, molecular biology, paleontology, and genetics that backed Darwin’s great synthesis. That and such sideshows as the effort to insist on the historical reality of the Noah’s ark story, despite conclusive geological evidence disproving it, crippled the efforts of conservative Christians to reach outside their existing audience.[/i]<br><br>Hello JMG,<br><br>I find the above to be a popular caricature of conservative Christian belief rather than a fair and accurate assessment. For one thing, it's amazing how many people don't even know such a thing as an "Old Earth Creationist" exists, or similarly that there exists Christians who believe the Bible teaches a local rather than global Flood (the former is consistent with modern science while the latter is not).<br><br>Biblical literalism and faithfulness to God's word has little to do with superficial readings of modern English translations, and much more to do with putting effort into understanding the language and context in which the traditions of scripture formed and were preserved. To suggest that a "literal" reading of Genesis and modern science are somehow mutually exclusive is likely a misunderstanding of what literal interpretation means. I do agree, however, that a literal and faithful reading of the Bible tends to exclude the possibility of Darwinian evolution.<br><br>Which leads to the other problem here, which is the dogmatic assertion that science has increasingly supported Darwinian evolutionary theory, and the assertion that anyone who disagrees with it is clinging to faith and ignoring the scientific evidence. There are many scientists who have immersed themselves in their respective fields and have decided that the amassing scientific evidence UNDERMINES Darwinian evolutionary theory rather than supports it. They have also produced research showing how the scientific evidence positively supports Biblical creationism.<br><br>As the late Lynn Margulis (nonreligious biologist) said,<br><br>[i]I was taught over and over again that the accumulation of random mutations led to evolutionary change - led to new species. I believed it until I looked for evidence.[/i] <br><br>Of course, there is room for reasonable debate and ongoing learning (as Paul said, "test everything and hold fast to what is good"), but my experience is that conservative Christians are primarily the ones pushing for dialogue and debate while "liberal" Christians and non-Christian evolutionists are the ones who refuse to even consider the possibility that their perspectives on the origin and development of life are fundamentally flawed.<br><br>It is true that Bible is not a scientific textbook and it wasn't intended to be one. For that matter, it's not a historical treatise either. But that doesn't mean the Bible cannot contain A LOT of historical and scientific truths, which are also inextricably linked to its philosophical and theological purpose. At the end of the day, the historical, prophetic and scientific reliability of Biblical texts reinforces the primary and unique theological message of the Christian faith - that God has been active in revealing his redemptive truths all throughout human history, to the point where God himself became a human being.<br><br><a href=#c7462581512961853192 title="comment permalink">7/19/13, 4:13 PM</a><br><br>

That is a great starting point for a dozen doctoral dissertations in American Studies, Religious Studies, Science Studies, and History. But you need some 'respectable' academic jargon. Maybe post-progressive studies. I like 'post-exponential studies' myself, but that is too mathematical to catch on.<br><br>The observation that both the fundamentalist (conservative) and the modernist (liberal) branches of protestant Christianity have gotten caught in dead-end ideologies is an obvious but not often stated truth. The saying goes: 'The fundamentalists believe things that can't possibly be true and the modernists believe things that can't be passed on to the next generation.' There are many voices and institutions out there claiming to be leading an orthodox protestant movement that avoids the Fundamentalist's errors, but they seem in practice to simply advocate a carefully edited version of traditional protestant teaching that is as conservative as possible while not yet being clearly falsified. If they happen to follow your advice and check what happened to the previous generations who tried that approach, they would quickly realize that their teachings will almost inevitably be falsified in short order. <br><br>Every new generation of modernists seems to split into those who abandon Christianity entirely and a few who turn to the ritual of Catholic or maybe Episcopal worship or who switch to fundamentalism. <br><br>In their reaction against the hierarchy and mysticism of the Roman Catholic church, Protestants seem to have become inextricably committed to a God that is rationally knowable from his interactions in the world and from the biblical texts. But without the mystical, protestant belief has become increasingly falsified by the failure of rational inquiry to provide evidence for their God. <br><br><br><a href=#c2354625524678033347 title="comment permalink">7/19/13, 7:43 PM</a><br><br>

Still, quoting Lynn Margulis out of context in a way that radically distorts her meaning -- you do know, I trust, that what she went on to propose was something just as far from creationism as Darwinian theory is -- is exactly the kind of dubious stunt that makes people outside the creationist fold roll their eyes and go looking for something less dodgy. <br><br>KL, I'll certainly consider it. <br><br>Ganv, I like "postprogressive studies"! Thank you also for applying the "what happened last time?" rule -- you're quite correct, of course, that efforts to ground religious faith in a "God of the gaps," who can be credited with anything science hasn't quite explained yet, is a losing game. I think of the creationists particularly here: there was a long time when the lack of the "missing link" was a core theme in creationist literature, until prehuman hominids were well and truly documented; embryology was another happy hunting ground, until that got thoroughly explained; now it's protein folds -- and when that gets explained, it'll be something else. It's a mug's game, this habit of argument by nitpicking, because it impresses nobody but its practitioners, and keeps the devotees of progress with opponents over whom they can triumph without too much effort.<br><br><a href=#c5882073268208916810 title="comment permalink">7/19/13, 8:12 PM</a><br><br>

There are many foundations/corporations that fund research, like NSF, DoD/E, Monsanto, etc., and none exist in a vacuum. Aside from a spiel on the general resarch plan, methods, you also have to point out broader impacts from this research. The funding agency then has a checklist of what they want to see in a proposal. The funding agency is filled with people - people with their own biases and views of the world.

Cholera was a real problem here in the late 19th century as the night carts used to dump their deposits directly into the Yarra and Maribyrnong Rivers. The Asians as a comparison used to collect these in pottery jars with lids and then compost them and use them as fertilisers. Very clever and far more observant than people of European backgrounds. <br><br>I used to live in a house that was built in the 1890's and it had an old granite cobblestone lane-way that the night-carts used to use. The toilet was a little brick shed at the very back of the property. The hand made clay sewerage pipes eventually ran underneath those lane-ways and digging on the property was a fascinating look into the past.<br><br>I don't think a well designed and maintained compost heap would spread cholera. The problem would have been that someone who was infected did an unmentionable act directly into a waterway that was used for drinking purposes or watering edible leafy plants. Many people historically drank fermented drinks rather than fresh water because of this problem, without even realising what the source of the problem was. <br><br>The last month or so has brought over 250mm (10 inches) of rain here and I was thinking about this particular problem in relation to the chooks here who have an enclosed run with a deep litter (mulch) system. This afternoon, I replaced about half a cubic metre of material in their run, not because it smelled, but because my gut feel said that it had reached critical mass. I aerate the entire run, every day by turning it over by hand with a fork and the chooks look healthy, but I don't really know the long term risks of this system. <br><br>I don't think that germ theory would survive more than one or two generations after any sort of collapse, although it would be nice if it did.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c1589814941069993653 title="comment permalink">7/20/13, 2:47 AM</a><br><br>

It is a delusion. To live within your means is within my understanding and it is scary as it takes away all of the things that I use as a buffer should something go wrong here – as it inevitably does from time to time. It has not escaped my attention that the fuel loads are building up in the forest here and wildfires seem to cycle in this forest on a 40 year basis. The Aboriginals would never have allowed the forest to get into this current state.<br><br>It is sad really because as time passes, opportunities slip away.<br><br>After the recent historically unprecedented warm, sunny period in July here, some of the fruit trees started to set buds as the soil temperature raised. Almonds, hazelnuts and plums are the main offenders. <br><br>Now however, it is 2 degrees Celsius outside and there was even a little bit of snow this morning (sleet really, although it is an event for us!).

I'm determined this year to go into summer with full water reserves. Apparently there will be some sun on Wednesday through Friday. <br><br>Also, of note here recently is that a local who does not have a single eucalypt tree on their property and which is also completely fenced off from the local wildlife has taken umbrage at my forest management practices and raised these concerns with the local council.

I'm aware that there's a small minority of conservative Christians who are into old-earth Creationism and local diluvialism, and I would encourage people of any faith to try to understand the original context of their scriptures.[/i]<br><br>Yes I have noticed that, but that seems to be the fault of public laziness, misinformation and media deception rather than any shortcomings on the historical, scientific, etc. arguments in favor of Biblical reliability. This applies to Christians, such as YECs who fail to research OEC and consider its merits, as well as non-Christians who are generally unaware OECs exist. How many times have you ever seen a popular media outlet present the OEC view of Genesis rather than the "a day is a day" and we have been around for "a few thousand years" view? The latter is simply given MUCH more attention in both evangelical churches and secular settings where the Bible is being critiqued. <br><br>It's even worse in terms of historical reliability, because people generally treat history as boring and too "speculative" or "subjective" to matter anyway. There are way too many Christians who have absolutely no legitimate response to the questions, "why should I trust the Gospels' accounts" or "what historical evidence do we have for Jesus' Resurrection?" However, that evidence does exist and the Christian faith is served by making it wider knowledge rather than ignoring it and pretending like Biblical theology is not heavily dependent on ACTUAL historical realities. <br><br><i>"If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith" -1 Corinthians 15:13-14</i><br><br><br>[i]Still, quoting Lynn Margulis out of context in a way that radically distorts her meaning -- you do know, I trust, that what she went on to propose was something just as far from creationism as Darwinian theory is -- is exactly the kind of dubious stunt that makes people outside the creationist fold roll their eyes and go looking for something less dodgy.[/i]<br><br>You're right, that was a bad way to quote on my part. I certainly wasn't trying to imply Margulism endorsed Creationism! The point I was trying to make is that many experts in the field, religious or nonreligious, have recognized that Darwinian evolutionary theory is far from being set in stone and that there are many lines of evidence that cast doubt on traditional explanations of the theory. The general public, otoh, treats the theory as being something just as well-established as Einstein's theory of general relativity, for ex, when nothing could be further from the truth. They haven't objectively and honestly approached the evidence. And when it comes to the theory of Biblical Creationism, they haven't even bothered to figure out what it is and what it predicts.<br><br>...<br><br><a href=#c1263468555799932324 title="comment permalink">7/20/13, 6:42 AM</a><br><br>

But you original article seemed to simply <i>assume</i> the evolutionary paradigm cannot be reasonably questioned and then went on to make a larger point about conservative Christians and their "crusade" against evolution, as if anyone challenging the scientific theory is acting from blind faith rather than from reasoning, logic and the evidence. No where does the Bible teach the former, and quite a few places it teaches the latter. Only the rise of modernism, which you rightfully critique, has also given rise to this artificial distinction between philosophy/religion on the one hand and logical, rational, empirical fields of knowledge on the other. What we call the <br>"scientific method" arose out of the European Reformation not despite the prevalence of Biblical revelation and theological assessment, but <i>because</i> those things were finally allowed to flourish.<br><br><a href=#c8501907286433545297 title="comment permalink">7/20/13, 6:42 AM</a><br><br>

Please write that book! It is desperately needed, and I would have written it myself years ago if I had a deep enough background in theology.<br><br>As for the religious changes in the past few decades, I have seen both sides. I'm on the X/Millennial border and I grew up in a conservative denomination. I had a front-row seat as it shifted from being about practicing Christianity to participating in politics. I also watched them get more and more dogmatic and hardline in the literal interpretation, and lose membership accordingly. I left myself when I was 15 during the middle of a sermon in which the pastor claimed women were literally the property of their husband or eldest male relative, and should behave accordingly. I couldn't deal with that.<br><br>OTOH, those faiths are very good at walking their talk in some ways. When each of my parents died, someone from the church showed up at our door with a hot meal every night for a month and the pastor stopped by three times a week to make sure we were okay.<br><br>Then I discovered UU as a young adult. I know it's already been mentioned, but I did not find it vapid then. I went a service a couple of years ago, and it's changed, but it was a good haven for socially liberal folks at the time, albeit one lacking much of a theological core. They became more and more about politics during the time I was there and less about any sort of fundamental values.<br><br>UU likes to talk about progressive policies and so forth, but they don't like to follow through on them. I finally left when I was unemployed and about to lose my house and they asked me to resign my membership because I couldn't "financially contribute" to the church.<br><br>By the time I left each of these denominations, there were down to retirees and the stalwart middle-class families with kids.<br><br>On another note, a few people have mentioned Catholicism. I may be Pagan, but I married into a large Catholic family, and I can vouch for the fact that Catholic churches cover the map and can fall into either side of this divide. You almost have to go to a monastery to find true Catholicism being practiced anymore.<br><br><a href=#c7700749512413269370 title="comment permalink">7/20/13, 6:55 AM</a><br><br>

I actually quoted your installation of a proprietary system handling ‘grey water’ as well as sewage that also uses worms as part of the digestion system IIRC.<br> <br>There are a number of issues regarding parasites and pathogens. The key safety feature as you know of course is to not to allow contamination of water supplies by either animal or human fecal wastes. This covers a range of possible contaminants, but seems especially important in the case of waterborne cholera. Cholera carriers are relatively rare these days in most countries, but I found interesting stuff just now when I googled key words - cholera water persistence growth abstract. In particular there is a website for waterbornepathogens.org and I learned that suspect water if it is properly filtered first can be further cleaned of cholera. One study in Africa put drinking water in plastic bottles and stored it on the roof in sunlight to reduce the risk. That seems like a useful tip if all else fails.<br><br>The site I was working on took care to establish a ring of surface drainage that could deal with rain. The toilet was already sited away from the known routes of local flash floods in order to keep water away from the compost – though your 10 inches of rain would be very exceptional in British conditions and would overwhelm most of our sewage systems. As a country we have seen more frequent flooding these last years from several inches of sudden rain, and the subsequent clean up of the dispersed sewage has been a big issue. The clean water main distribution grids however have been pretty resilient in villages and towns. Private rural water supplies will have been another matter.<br><br>The finished compost at our site was not going to be used for vegetable gardens especially where uncooked greens will be gathered. Incidentally, I understand that China has long had a social taboo on eating uncooked vegetation. Similarly, where pigs have access to human waste, pork will always need a good cooking! I remember your system for your house seemed particularly safe. I guess the chooks need to be protected from contamination from the human system; otherwise they could become a potential ‘feedback’ loop.

Nobody has ever sat down and written a set of rules which scientists should follow, and there isn't an unwritten set of rules either, except for the something vague requirement that proper epistemological practices should be applied. <br><br>God was not taken out of the picture a priori - modern science evolved from natural philosophy which in turn developed from medieval philosophy. There is no need to go into details into what the focus of the latter was, and the vast majority of people who took part in the development of modern science between the Middle Ages and the 19th century were religious and God prominently featured in their understanding of the universe. He got taken out of the picture gradually, when it became apparent that first, no deity is needed as an explanation for anything, and second, almost nothing of what the holy books say about the world around us is true.

So if God created the universe and directs its design, who created and designed God? If natural law appeared in an explosive instant, what bigger natural laws lead to this incident? Physicist actually do address that question but still you always run into the next level of creation. There is no way to avoid the "turtles all the way down" paradox. Adding God to the equations does not simplify them or "explain" anything at a fundamental level. Neither does subtracting it. Even if, as I sometimes suspect, every attribute of the cosmos could be logically derived from the starting premise of 1+1=10 (i.e. the equations ARE reality...), you have not explained where that one fundamental "truth" came from. And of course if you do have an eternal universe extending infinitely back in time with no beginning, have you ever really tried to comprehend THAT? An infinite past? Which of course is not possible with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, infinite time means infinite entropy hence zero order, zero free energy, no scientists and no phenomena for them to study if they did exist. So now you invoke some principle to siphon off the excess entropy... somehow. to somewhere, forever... turtles, turtles, turtles...<br><br>So it can be amusing to see how much emotional and intellectual effort is expended on arguing about what to name the topmost turtle in the infinite stack. <br><br><br><a href=#c3629598699402341369 title="comment permalink">7/21/13, 5:33 AM</a><br><br>

I'd argue on this basis among others, that the human mind is incapable of knowing the truth about the cosmos in any real sense; all we have are makeshift models, drawing on the limited resources provided us by biological and cultural evolution, that more or less match the observed behavior of the cosmos. <br><br>Causality is such a model.

One of its flaws is exactly the infinite regress of turtles that it can't avoid -- if everything is caused by something else, then there has to be some cause for the First Cause, right? I'd suggest, though, that this is simply a bug in some of our mental software -- which is why acausal systems of thought (e.g., Taoist science) don't consider it an issue. <br><br>Matthew, it's remarkably simplistic and ahistorical, not to mention an object lesson in the contemporary bad habit of assuming that a spectrum consists only of its two opposite ends. Most other civilizations had an equally cavalier attitude toward issues of place -- consider the Roman soldiers from all over the Empire buried near Hadrian's Wall on what's now the English-Scottish border, or for that matter the Vikings, who were perfectly willing to settle down anywhere they could hack out a foothold. There have been human cultures at every imaginable point along the line between the deeply-rooted indigenous model and the cosmopolitan "where there is money, there is my home" model, and trying to shoehorn that wild diversity into yet another rigid binary -- for the purpose, inevitably, of insisting that we're unique among the world's societies -- is, well, the sort of thing I'd expect to see in <i>Yes Magazine</i>.<br><br><a href=#c7508275938677508711 title="comment permalink">7/21/13, 12:17 PM</a><br><br>

The claim is not, 'Everything is caused by something else,' but rather 'Everything that comes into existence is caused to come into existence by something else.' Conjoined with the minor premise, 'The universe came into existence,' it follows that the universe was caused to come into existence by something else. Further argumentation that whatever caused the universe to come into existence is a supernatural entity is, of course, required, but such argumentation has been provided by the foremost defender of this line of theistic proof, William Lane Craig.

A theory of evolution that only explains adaptation would more aptly be termed a theory of adaptation. A theory is a finite set of logical assertions or meta-assertions. A theory is a conceptual machine. A universe that conforms to a theory is a mechanical universe. In Newton’s day it was supposed that the universe is deterministic. Thus an explanation of how life could arise in such a universe was required, and the Theory of Evolution was the response. Its supposed <i>mechanisms</i> are random mutation, selection, and inheritance. However, it is now supposed that the universe is only probabilistically-mechanical. In a deterministic world life must be built-in. In a probabilistic world, life should be at least likely, which the mechanisms of evolution don’t seem to provide convincingly. In the multiverse interpretation of quantum mechanics, anything that can happen will happen, and we just happen to find ourselves in a universe in which life (and ourselves) happens, which then begs the question, what are “we”. The multiverse explanation seems more like a pedagogical trick than an explanation.<br><br>“Gradually increasing genetic and epigenetic diversity, on the one hand, and selective pressures from the environment, on the other” is more observation and surmise than theory. Gradually increasing diversity is surmised from the so-called fossil record. Selection is the observation that some things survive longer than others combined with a vague notion that something is being selected for, “fitness”, that can only be defined in a circular manner. More of this kind of thinking can be found at http://www.natureinstitute.org/. Gradually increasing diversity really does seem like a type of progress. Going from simple chemicals to complex multicellular organisms with intellects seems like progress. The Theory of Evolution is a mechanistic explanation for this progress.<br><br>It seems untrue that the universe conforms to a finitely prescribed set of rules. Theories may be useful but are not truth. The Theory of Evolution may be useful. I think it is a waste of time, an attempt by people to cling to the remnants of the old Newtonian point of view. A major problem with it seems to be the moral lessons people tend to extract from it, such as survival of the fittest, and the imperative that mankind must continue to evolve into some sort of transhuman cybernetic organism, thus calling for our extinction as mere squishy biological animals. I do not respond favorably to calls for my extinction. <br><br>There is an interesting article that discusses such notions at resilience.org: http://www.resilience.org/stories/2013-07-19/bioeconomics-the-hidden-megascience “Bioeconomics, The Hidden Megascience”<br><br><a href=#c3834628970536532263 title="comment permalink">7/21/13, 3:24 PM</a><br><br>

Our conceptual tools are indeed useful -- I'd argue, in fact, that our brains are very well adapted to produce useful conceptual tools -- but it's a mistake to treat those tools as real existences, as real (say) as the experiences that we sort out using those tools. Thus we can talk about diminishing energy supplies while being aware that "energy" is an abstraction, a mental summary of a lot of different fragments of experience, that we happen to find useful to sort that experience into meaningful forms. <br><br>Chris, yes, I'm familiar with the claim -- I studied the cosmological proof at some length while working on my book "A World Full of Gods." I was speaking off the cuff. Mind you, I find the cosmological argument a very weak reed -- it assumes that the culturally determined habits of thought of one corner of humanity (in this case, the notion of causality) can tell us something about the fundamental nature of existence, which seems very dubious to me. <br><br>Ben, many thanks! <br><br>Zed, and here I would have expected you to call it Zardoz!<br><br>John, okay, that was less than clear from your earlier comment. From my point of view, describing the intersection of variation and selection as "observation and surmise rather than theory" misses the boat completely; all any theory is or can be is a surmise that relates to certain repeated observations. Thus you're quite correct that theories are useful but not true, but that's equally the case with any idea, including those that you prefer! <br><br>As for the conflation of evolution with progress, though, there I think you're completely missing the point. Yes, evolution has been distorted into a theory of progress, but it's hardly fair to insist that the distortion <i>is</i> the theory. A gradual trend toward increased diversity over time isn't progress, it's simply one of the things that happens reliably in an open system, as Prigogine pointed out a while back. You'll notice that blue-green algae haven't exactly been superseded by later life forms -- they're still very much around, and probably will be long after every multicellular organism is long gone. Thus it's not evolution that's calling for your extinction, just true believers in the gospel of progress who have twisted the theory of evolution in support of their faith.<br><br><a href=#c6573149099456118300 title="comment permalink">7/21/13, 3:56 PM</a><br><br>

Given their training, their history, and the cultural pressures that surround them and define their work, it’s all but impossible for them to do anything else.

My rejection is not of evolution as in life unfolding over time, but rather a rejection of neoDarwinian and even post Darwinian theories of which none are adequate.<br><br>A couple of the postDarwinian theories are beginning to look at the scope of the problem and think in terms of how to make core changes in life forms. None of them even touch the origin of life.<br><br>I was not confused by the Lynn Margulis quote because I know who she is. I can provide many similar quotes, some of them truly astonishing, such as denying randomness and attributing cognitive processes to organisms as they respond to environmental pressure. Yet I would be careful to mention that every one of them remains dedicated to explaining evolution via purely undirected means. The interesting thing about reading such quotes (being careful to understand them in context) is that they show how these academics in evolutionary research often find nearly everything thus far proposed as thoroughly inadequate - and thus they propose their own hopeful suggestions.<br><br>The public, and that includes the educated public, are given a sanitized view. It kind of reminds me of the sanitized view I was given of the early church. When I found that the bedrock of my church was not 2000 years old but about 1600-1700 years old, and that it was deliberately carved out of a morass, that really opened my eyes. <br><br>No, Bill, intelligent design is falsifiable. What would be needed is a convincing method by which an undirected process could produce life, and new life forms.<br><br>"Personally, I feel that an intelligence that could create a self-designing, self-assembling universe in an instant and then leave it to take its own course according to natural law is vastly more impressive than an intelligence that would need to be constantly tinkering and steering. "<br><br>That is known as frontloading, and is quite a favorite theory among many intelligent design folk!<br><br>Here's what seems odd to me, not for an atheist but for anyone else who posits any kind of God/source/consciousness as a fundament of the universe - why would you expect there to be no residual clues as to the intelligence at the bottom of things? To say that a universe that has arisen out of consciousness should and ought to look in every way as if that were not the case, that it should look as if it were a chemical/mechanical universe...why???<br><br>How is that logical? Don't intelligent entities do intelligent things, and aren't the instantiations of their efforts pretty obviously not reachable by random processes?<br><br>You stated the turtle paradox quite well. It is useless to then ask what created God. In that case, God is not God, but just another thing in the stack of caused items. Either its turtles all the way down, or there is something else. And I partly agree with JMG that our minds can't quite grasp this. I know mine can't. The wave of my mind breaks repeatedly against this rock. But the answer to this koan is to realize that although one can't conceive of how such a thing can be, yet it must be, that there is something which exists uncaused. Eastern philosophy calls it "real" with everything else being unreal, in the sense that everything else is composed of parts that arise and fall and come together and dissolve. <br><br>I do not think the answer to this koan is to reject causality, at least in this sphere of reality we find ourselves in. Without the consistency and predictability of nature we'd go insane. The purpose of being able to think causally is to realize the paradox, and solve the koan.<br><br>But I'm not the kind of monotheist you talk about in your book, JMG.

As for evolution, I may just do a post on that soon -- it's a divagation, but potentially a useful one. <br><br>Paul, I'm not saying that anyone is nuts. What I'm saying is that fusion research has already proven that, whether or not a fusion reactor can be built, it can't be built at a price that anybody, anywhere, can afford. That being the case, why are we continuing to pour billions of dollars down what amounts to a high-tech rathole? The pervasive pressure of the mythology of progress, I suggest, is the most parsimonious explanation. <br><br>Onething, I quite understand that you're not a classical monotheist -- though I appreciate the reminder, and also your attention to the difference! My problem with the Margulis quote was that it was basically being used as a proof text -- a habit that's just as unproductive in science as it is in theology. As to your broader question, though, are you familiar with Prigogine's equations? He showed that the flow of energy through an open system produces a consistent trend toward increasing levels of complexity in that system, as long as the energy flow continues. I see that as the general law of which the emergence of life is a specific example. More on this shortly, though. <br><br>Wiseman, in America, it's anything but settled.

The current limits are set by the priorities of our society.

Instead we waste most of ours on completely useless activities and consumption. If we had our priorities right, it would have been quite a different picture.

America's a weird place, and the notion that it ought to be some kind of template for the rest of the world may just be the most thorougly disproved idea of our time. <br><br>Cherokee, and both of them kept a lot of people employed for a good long time, too! <br><br>Bill, the irony here is that the Druid Revival traditions were talking enthusiastically about the religious dimensions of evolution before Darwin's time. As the head of a Druid order that traces its lineage straight back to those eccentric Welshmen and their equally odd English friends and co-conspirators, I don't really have the option of lying low -- so it's full speed ahead and Blue Meanies watch out! <br><br>As for the evolution of gods, good! I'm recalling Gene Wolfe's proof of the existence of at least one god, which is somewhere in his "Shadow of the Torturer" series; it runs something like this. Either the universe had a beginning or it didn't. If it had a beginning, something had to begin it. If it didn't have a beginning, it's existed since infinite time, and given infinite time, the probability that at least one being would have attained to godhood approximates to 1. QED! <br><br>Matthew, it takes plenty of work, and plenty of practice. It can be helpful, after reading an article, to sketch out its argument in outline form -- that can make the fallacies and distortions much clearer.<br><br><a href=#c8916670749523271078 title="comment permalink">7/22/13, 8:43 AM</a><br><br>

I wonder if the need to put up serious grandiose walls is an indicator of a failing society. It certainly says that there is a fear in that society that resources are a bit stretched (or will be shortly)? Dunno, but I'm aware of a few of them going up in various places around the world.<br><br>Fencing is on my mind because I share this farm with the wildlife and wouldn't think of fencing them out. However, this requires adaption to their activities plus I have to allow for their consumption which is sometimes in competition with mine. It is no easy task which is why most people simply fence them out.<br><br>I forgot to mention it before but your friend in Michigan has my sympathy.<br><br>By the way, how good was "Shadow of the Torturer"? Epic!<br><br>Hi Georgi,<br><br>I've got no beef with you.<br><br>I'd like to extend your thoughts somewhat though.<br><br>Quote: "The current limits are set by the priorities of our society."<br><br>From my perspective society is simply a small subset of nature so the limits are actually set by our resource base and ecosystem. Society in itself can have opinions on resource allocation, but hard limits are in practice set by nature.<br><br>Quote: "science is not one of them even though it is about the only meaningful thing that a society should invest resources in (from an evolutionary perspective)."<br><br>Just to throw a completely different perspective to you. The Aboriginals existed on this continent for somewhere between 40 and 60 millennia. They directed their energies towards managing the environment so that it provided a sustainable outcome geared towards their ends. Science did not feature in this society, but observation, myth, tradition and practice did.<br><br>On the other hand, here at the farm over the past 7 or 8 years, I've developed in parts up to 200mm of top soil. This is an amazing acceleration of the natural processes. When I arrived here, there was no top soil and only hard baked clay which was as tough as concrete. I can explain the process of how I achieved this, but in no way can I explain the science behind it. I don't believe anyone has a complete understanding of the science behind soils as they are inherently complex.<br><br>Yet, scientific studies show that repeated applications of NPK fertilisers eventually kill off both the life within and structure of the soil. At the same time as a society we continue to pursue this path in agriculture and it will be our undoing. <br><br>Science is not a good tool with which to resolve these sorts of issues. If as a society we responded to scientific studies, we would have delved further into studies such as "The limits to Growth" and taken action to alleviate the worst of the predicted outcomes.<br><br>I'm not trolling you, I'm just pointing out that there are some unpleasant facts on the ground which we are all doing our best to ignore.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=#c6513839831742614345 title="comment permalink">7/22/13, 6:24 PM</a><br><br>

They gave what I think is one of the clearest explanations of the Copenhagen interpretation of the Complementarity Principle, which they claim was Bohr's way of looking at it, and that it was Heisenberg who brought in most of the stuff about the "observer." I think it's germane to this discussion.<br><br>Bohr's view was that quantum particles simply didn't have properties like momentum and position. However, when you coupled them -- or "entangled" them in modern parlance -- with experimental apparatus designed to measure what we think momentum or position ought to look like at the particle level, the results looked <i>as if</i> the particle had momentum or position. The whole issue with complementarity is that no one has figured out any way to simultaneously measure position and momentum: the <i>measurements</i> are complementary, not the properties being measured. These classical scale properties, projected upon the individual particles, don't exist.<br><br>There are plenty of comparable quantities. "Pressure," for instance, doesn't exist at the particulate level, but as a statistical property of large numbers of particles, it is certainly a useful concept.<br><br>I think this whole "evolution versus creation" argument, to the extent it is anything but a shibboleth (and I've seen very few instances where it isn't), is the result of a bad question, like "Is an electron a particle or a wave?"

The megafaunal extinction on the continent coincides very suspiciously with their arrival. I know people like to dispute that explanation but it's the only one that really makes sense to me. So they weren't very good at managing their environment, at least in the beginning (and after that it was too late to reverse the damage as extinction is forever). <br><br>2. What happened to them not so long ago? They got almost wiped out by Europeans. And why did they do so? Because, first, the latter had sufficiently superior scientific understanding of the world around them to allow them to develop better technology and conquer them, and second, the aboriginals had no means to protect themselves against the new diseases introduced by the colonists (which is also a problem best addressed by science). <br><br>The point I am making is that investment in the accumulation of knowledge and understanding about the world around us is extremely beneficial from an evolutionary perspective, because:<br><br>1) The improved understanding of the ecosystem we're part of informs us what to do and not to do if we don't want to wreck it, with very negative consequences to our long-term evolutionary success.

Reductionism is a method of understanding something like nature by breaking it down into ever smaller and smaller parts that can be thought of as independent constituents, the sum of which make the whole. Think of a watch or machine with all the little springs and gears that make it up. There is also the assumption of classical causality where the movement of one part causes the movement of another part and so on. Quantum mechanics shows that if we push this concept to its limit and apply it to nature it eventually breaks down. As we try to isolate smaller and smaller particles they start to behave more like waves (continua versus singularities) that are spread out and entangled with other particles/waves i.e. reductionism breaks down. Interestingly causality also breaks down and events/conditions can only be assigned probabilities. For waves, representations that are related by the Fourier transform such as position and momentum representations inherently produce Heisenberg uncertainty relationships between observables such as position and momentum. All methods of inquiry have their limits including the scientific and reductionist approaches. What is amazing is that we can still get a handle on these limits and the kinds on answers that we can expect using mathematics.<br><br><a href=#c3753070017871411799 title="comment permalink">7/23/13, 1:17 PM</a><br><br>

In youth it grows vigorously toward the light, it aspires to dominate the canopy of the forest, if it's lucky. In old age it spends most of it's time just packing on more wood to hold itself up, perhaps getting more beautiful, but not much bigger. A tree knows it will die, thus makes seed. In death it becomes useful habitat for many other species. Will we be so gracious in our old age?<br><br><a href=#c5310954258897514946 title="comment permalink">7/24/13, 5:26 PM</a><br><br>

Being a North American, and having friends who are entranced by Hitchens and Dawkins, I should have seen where it was headed, but I did not. Still, it was interesting to see how you handled it, JMG. On this, as it seems with everything else, your perspective strikes me as both novel and enlightening. <br><br>On the topic of fusion research, I find it most amusing that every new reactor should work, based on the scaling regime they built the last one at. But plasmas are very cussed things, and the same scaling law never holds when you go to the next size... in other words, nature keeps moving the goal posts, and somehow we scientists have never caught on. <br><br>To Bill Pulliam, re: evolving gods, isn't that something Teilhard de Chardin was grasping at?<br><br><a href=#c7351566981568856752 title="comment permalink">7/24/13, 7:04 PM</a><br><br>

As I understand it, they are purchasing Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities using freshly conjured Federal Reserve Notes.

This is the same Robert Bussard<br><br>He gave a talk at google which in the early part of the lecture makes fun of toroidal fusion reactors, saying something like "you look up at the sky, and it's clear that fusion works, and none of them are toroidal"<br><br>He then goes on to describe his own research which had been unpublished as he was under navy contract. It's pretty simple 1st year physics really...<br><br>I think it's worth checking out his research that has somewhat of a following, known as "polywell" fusion. but the idea is to use electrical force to create the conditions for fusion by injecting and trapping electrons which are light and easy to control in a magnetic containment which then creates this enormous negative potential well, drawing nuceli together with such energy as to be abe to trigger fusion reactions. please check it out.<br><br><br>Now it's important to note that Bussard himself was extremely critical of mainstream fusion and that he talks about how they all knew that the big toroidal reactors would never work, but that the idea was to use that money for more promising technologies,... <br><br>He talks about having been a part of it and in almost exactly the same language of your post describes their situation of being essentially living off of grants in order to continue to make these baroque cathedrals, which use liquid lithium containment to capture neutrons etc....<br><br>but the science is interesting - it's also interesting because the reactors are quite small and ultimately would be far more likely to be able to be used as a replacement... and the machines, well turn them off and there is no radiation, because (at least in theory) there are no neutrons given off.<br><br>check it out -- <br><br><br><br><br><a href=#c3573561543165249905 title="comment permalink">7/27/13, 10:58 AM</a><br><br>
