The old-fashioned school districts that provided me with a convenient example in last week’s post here on <i>The Archdruid Report </i>represent a mode of politics that nobody, but nobody, talks about in today’s America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Across the whole landscape of our contemporary political life, with remarkably few exceptions, when people talk about the relationship between the political sphere and the rest of life, the political sphere they have in mind consists of existing, centralized governmental systems.
</div>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s as true of those who denounce political interference in the lives of individuals and communities, by and large, as it is of those who insist that such interference can be a very good thing. It’s as though, in the American collective imagination, the political sphere consists only of the established institutions of government, and the established—and distinctly limited—ways that individual citizens can have an influence on those institutions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The idea that citizens might create their own local political structures, for purposes they themselves choose, and run them themselves, using the tools of democratic process, has vanished completely from our national conversation. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Less than a lifetime ago, however, this was a standard way of making constructive change in America.Local school districts were only one example, though they were probably the most pervasive. Most of the time, when people in a community wanted to create some public amenity or solve some community problem, they did it by creating a local, single-purpose governmental body with an elected board and strictly limited powers of taxation to pay the bills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sewer districts, streetcar lines, public hospitals, you name it, that’s usually how they were run.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The state government had supervision over all these bodies, which was normally taken care of by—you guessed it—state boards whose members were, once again, elected by the general public. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Was it a perfect system?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Of course not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The interlocking checks and balances of board supervision and elections were no more foolproof than any other mode of democratic governance, and a certain fraction of these single-purpose local governmental bodies failed due to corruption or mismanagement. Still, a substantial majority of them do seem to have worked tolerably well, and they had a crucial advantage not shared by today’s more centralized ways of doing things:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>if something went wrong, the people who had the power to change things were also the people most directly affected.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If the management of your local sewer district turned out to be hopelessly incompetent, for example, you didn’t have to try to get a distant and uninterested state or federal bureaucracy to stir out of its accustomed slumber and do its job, nor did you have to try to find some way to convince tens of thousands of unaffected voters in distant parts of the state to cast their votes to throw somebody out of office for reasons that didn’t matter to them in the least.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The right to vote in the next sewer board election was limited to those people who were actually served by the sewer district, who paid the bills of the district with their monthly assessments, who’d had to deal with balky sewers for the last two years, and were thus qualified to judge whether a “Throw the Rascals Out” campaign was justified. Keeping control of the system in the hands of the people most directly affected by it thus served as a preventive to the serene indifference to failure that pervades so much of American government today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It might be worth proposing as a general rule, in fact, that democratic governance works best when the people directly affected by any function of government have direct control over those people who run that function of government, subject to appropriate oversight by those responsible for maintaining the public commons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the case of our imaginary sewer district, that means giving those who live within the district the sole power to choose members of the board, while placing the local board under the supervision of a state board tasked with making sure local decisions didn’t violate state public health standards and the like. In the case of the school districts described in last week’s post, it meant giving the local school boards broad powers to set policy for the schools they administered, giving citizens who lived within the school district the sole right to vote in school elections, and placing the school boards under the supervision of a state board of education that was charged with enforcing a few very broad educational standards, health and safety regulations, and so on. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As long as the roles of state and federal governments remained that of policing the commons, the system worked quite well—better, by most measures, than the failed equivalents we have today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What put paid to it was the explosive spread of government centralization after the Second World War, and this in turn was driven by the imperial tribute economy I described earlier in this series of posts:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the set of deliberately unbalanced economic arrangements by which something like a third of the world’s wealth is channeled every year to the five per cent of humanity that live in the United States. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The linchpin of local control, as it turned out, was local funding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sewer districts, school districts, and all the other little local governmental bodies received all their funding directly from the people they served, by whatever arrangements the voters in the district had accepted when the district was founded. When federal and state governments gained the power to dangle million-dollar grants in front of the various local governments, most if not all of them took the bait, and only later discovered that the power to grant or withhold funding trumps every other form of political power in our society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That was how the local single-purpose governments were stripped of their autonomy and turned into instruments of centralized government, subject to micromanagement by state and federal bureaucracies.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That process of centralization was justified in many cases by claims of efficiency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now of course when somebody starts prattling about efficiency, the question that needs to be asked is “efficient at what?” A screwdriver is highly efficient at turning screws but very inefficient as a means for pounding nails; the modern corporate economy, in much the same sense, is highly efficient at concentrating paper wealth in the hands of the already rich, and very inefficient at such other tasks as producing goods and services. It’s interesting to speculate about just what it is that centralized bureaucracies can do more efficiently than local single-purpose governmental bodies, but in retrospect, we can be certain that running schools, sewer districts, and other public goods do not belong in that category. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I discussed last week some of the reasons for thinking that today’s massively centralized American education system is much less effective at teaching children to read, write, calculate, and exercise the other basic skills essential to life in a modern society than the old-fashioned, locally managed, locally funded school districts of the not so distant past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The responses I fielded to those comments intrigued me. One typical commenter insisted that she found it “incredibly hard to believe” that educational standards in the one-room schoolhouses of yesteryear were higher than those in school districts today. Now of course it takes only a glance at the old McGuffey’s Readers, the standard reading textbooks in those one-room schoolhouses, to show that levels of reading comprehension, grammar, and vocabulary that were considered normal at every elementary school grade level in the late 19th century were vastly greater than those achieved in today’s schools; in fact, the reading ability assumed by the first pages of the 8th grade McGuffey’s is by no means common in American college classes today. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The collapse of educational standards that can be observed here, and in a hundred similar examples, has had many causes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, it’s far from irrelevant to note that a similar collapse has taken place in many other areas in which the old system of independent local governmental bodies has been replaced by micromanagement by state or federal bureaucracies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That collapse has been discussed nearly as widely in the media as the implosion of American education, and it’s ironic to note that, just as media discussions of public education’s breakdown have gone out of their way to avoid considering the role of overcentralization in driving that collapse, the media coverage of the parallel breakdown I have in mind has been just as careful to avoid touching on this same issue. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The collapse in question?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The disintegration of America’s infrastructure in recent decades. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A great many factors, to be sure, have had a part in creating the crisis in our national infrastructure, just as a great many factors have contributed to the parallel crisis in our national public education system. In both cases, though, I’d like to suggest that overcentralization has played a crucial role in both crises. There are at least three reasons why, all other things being equal, a centralized government bureaucracy will by and large be less able to provide good schools, working sewers, and other public goods than a local governmental body of the type we’ve been discussing. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
First, centralized government bureaucracies aren’t accountable for their failures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To borrow a bit of gambler’s slang, they have no skin in the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No matter how disastrous the consequences of an administrative decision made in the state or national capital, the bureaucrats who made the decision will continue to draw their pay, exercise their authority, and pursue whatever fashionable agendas they picked up in college or elsewhere, even if their actions turn out to be hopelessly counterproductive in terms of the goals their bureaucracy ostensibly exists to serve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Local single-purpose governmental bodies by and large don’t have that freedom; if the local sewer board pursues policies that fail to provide adequate sewer service to the people in the sewer district, the members of the board had better look for other jobs come the next local election. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Second, centralized government bureaucracies provide many more places for money to get lost. If you’ve got a bureaucracy at the national level—say, the federal Department of Education—another bureaucracy at each state level—say, state Departments of Education—and still another bureaucracy at the local level—say, current school districts, a good many of which have hundreds of employees filling administrative positions these days—and all of these are doing a job that used to be done by a handful of employees working for each school board, one whale of a lot of money that might otherwise go to improve schools is being siphoned off into administrative salaries and expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The same thing is true of the money that might go to repair bridges and sewer pipes; how much of that goes instead to pay for administrative staff in the federal Department of Transportation and the equivalent state and county bureaucracies?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>All this is aside from graft and corruption, which is also an issue; it’s a good general rule that the more hands money must pass through on its way to a project, the higher the likelihood that some of those hands will have sticky fingers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The third reason is subtler, and ties back into the proposal I made several weeks back, that the proper role of government is that of preserving the public commons. To make a commons work, there needs to be some system in place to monitor the state of the commons, assess how changes will impact it, and prohibit those things that will cause harm to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On a purely local level, as Elinor Ostrom showed, a self-regulating commons is easy to establish and easy to maintain, since it’s in the direct self-interest of everyone who benefits from the commons to prevent anyone else from abusing it. The local single-purpose governmental bodies discussed in this week’s post rely on that logic: if you depend on the local sewer board to provide you with sewage service, to return to our example, you have a very strong incentive not to permit the board to ignore its duties. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, for a variety of reasons, the mechanisms of local government don’t always function as they should.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s for this reason that the American political tradition long ago evolved the useful habit, already referred to, of making the decisions of local government subject to review at the state level, by way of the supervisory boards discussed earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The state boards, like the local boards they supervised, were elected by the voters, so they remained accountable for their failures. More importantly, though, was the simple fact that the officials tasked with assessing the legality and appropriateness of policies were not the same officials that were making the policies. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is a basic principle of cybernetics, by the way. If you’ve got one system carrying out a function, and another system monitoring how well the first system carries out its function, you need to make sure that the only input the second system receives from the first system is the input that allows the second system to carry out its monitoring function. Otherwise you get feedback loops that prevent the second system from doing what it’s supposed to do. That’s exactly the problem we have now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When public schools are being micromanaged by regulations drafted by federal bureaucrats, who is assessing the legality and appropriateness of those regulations? The same federal bureaucrats—and whether you analyze this by way of cybernetics, politics, or plain common sense, this is a recipe for disaster. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
These three factors—the lack of accountability endemic to centralized professional bureaucracies; the tendency for money to get lost as it works its way down through the myriad layers of a centralized system; and the unhelpful feedback loops that spring up when the policy-making and monitoring functions of government are confounded—go a long ways to explain the cascading failure of many of the basic systems that an older, more localized, and less centralized approach to government used to maintain in relatively good order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The accelerating decline of American public education and the disintegration of the national infrastructure are only two examples of this effect in practice; there are plenty of others—a great deal of what’s wrong with America’s health care system, for example, can be traced to the same process of overcentralization. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m pleased to say, though, that help is on the way. On second thought, “pleased” is probably not the right word, since the help in question will almost certainly bring about the wholesale implosion of a great many of the basic systems that provide public goods to Americans, and its arrival will have to be followed by the slow, costly, and potentially painful rebuilding of those systems from the ground up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The source of that unwelcome assistance, of course, is the twilight of America’s global empire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the absence of the torrents of unearned wealth American society currently receives from the imperial wealth pump, a great many of the centralized systems in place today—governmental, corporate, and nonprofit—will probably stop functioning altogether. Those who think they will cheer this development are invited to imagine how they will feel when their sewers stop working and nobody, anywhere, is willing or able to do anything about that fact. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the impact of America’s imperial decline echoes through the fabric of the nation, a great many of the basic systems of everyday life will need to be repaired and replaced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>One of the very few tools that might enable that to be done effectively is the system of local single-purpose governmental bodies that I’ve discussed in this post.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As municipal services become intermittent or stop altogether, schools shut down, and infrastructure collapses, people with skin in the game—local residents, that is, who want basic services enough to tax themselves at a modest rate to pay for them—could readily use the old system to pick up the pieces from imploding government bureaucracies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Equally, the same process can be used to pursue any number of public goods not currently served at all by existing governmental systems. All that’s needed is for something that used to be an integral part of American community life to be rediscovered and put back to work, before the imperial structures that replaced them finish coming apart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mind you, the system of local single-purpose government bodies is far from the only elements of an older way of community that could use being rediscovered and restored; next week we’ll talk about another. </div>

The agitation that created the EPA drew heavily on local success stories like the restoration of Lake Washington, which proved that clean water programs could be done at a reasonable cost. I'd encourage you next time to do a little more historical research, and be a little more careful with your facts!<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c880726898548790125 title="comment permalink">2/13/13, 10:01 PM</a><br><br>

I agree with almost 100% of your assessment of what's wrong with our current centralized system. You have pretty much nailed it. I'm just afraid that the evidence for what you characterize as a tolerably-working earlier system is lacking. Your example of sewerage districts is a case in point. You will recall that in 1972 Congress passed and President Nixon signed the Clean Water Act. Well, you might be to young to remember it, but I do. I also remember that, before that, our local community dumped its untreated wastewater directly into the Yazoo River.<br><br>It seems that whatever local body controlled wastewater in these parts (I was too young to know the specifics) did a reasonably decent job of getting the wastewater removed from individual outlets, but that, beyond that, it was someone else's problem.<br><br>The result, we will recall, was that virtually all surface waters in the US were dangerously polluted.

It's also likely that the nation's ability to continue the centralized control of water quality will be difficult to impossible in the future.

I'm enjoying seeing you take what a generation or two ago would have been considered good, old-fashioned common civic sense and applying it -- the irony being that it seems very radical and new!<br><br>Two Michigan examples to illustrate your point:<br><br>1. Some years ago (mid-nineties), there was a state Constitutional amendment to change the funding formula for public schools. Previously, they had been funded primarily by local millage, and the state sales tax was limited to 4%. In exchange for lowering and limiting property taxes (widely seen as too high), the state sales tax was raised to 6% and schools would receive per-pupil funding from Lansing. "Conservatives" liked it because it promised to make the state more attractive to businesses, who complained about the property tax rate, "liberals" liked it because it promised to level out funding between rich and poor districts, thereby improving the schools in poorer districts.<br><br>The one certain outcome, however, was that educational control would pass from local school boards to Lansing.<br><br>And, of course, well-off school districts are still well-off, and poor districts are still poor and struggling. Detroit Public Schools are still a basket case, while affluent outlying districts afford Olympic swimming pools and well-equipped weight training rooms reserved for the football team. (Not to mention accidentally overbuilding an extra middle school that it turned out they don't need... and yes, that's all the <i>same</i> school district I'm thinking of.)<br><br>2. The <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Gardens rel=nofollow>Herman Gardens</a> housing project in Detroit is a sad example of lost money. In the early nineties, they were a dangerous eyesore. So, HUD to the rescue! Some hundreds of millions of dollars were allocated to tear down the old apartments, house the residents until the new buildings could be constructed, and provide for job training for the displaced.<br><br>What the neutral text in the Wikipedia article "That plan subsequently failed to come to fruition" and "After over a decade of planning..." fail to convey are these stark facts: residents were removed and the buildings razed in 1996. In <b>2009</b>, the first family moved in to reconstructed housing. In between, the sign "Coming soon!" at Southfield and Joy roads weathered as nothing happened year after year. Eventually, the DOJ investigated, and discovered that those hundreds of millions of HUD dollars allocated had simply... disappeared. Shoddy record-keeping, you know. Terribly unfortunate. As far as I know, it's never been found and no one has been jailed, although some quick google-fu turns up that there have been some indictments that seem related to this in the never-ending corruption trials of former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.<br><br>peace,<br>Zach<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c3617633255567433132 title="comment permalink">2/14/13, 4:33 AM</a><br><br>

Those of us who share JMG's critique of centralized power while also holding green/liberal/progressive values have to acknowledge that it was massive federal power, not local or state authority, that provided standards for environmental protection, along with the ending of slavery and Jim Crow, child labor laws and legal equality for women, and the civil libertarian decisions of the Warren Court. Of course we pay a price for centralized power (as libertarians and conservatives point out), and of course as the empire erodes that power will crumble-- so our challenge is to hold onto these achievements even as we promote decentralized, participatory democracy. I think JMG has identified the key to meeting the challenge: a thorough understanding of and dedication to "the commons."<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c7503649458824132862 title="comment permalink">2/14/13, 4:49 AM</a><br><br>

For instance, American patriotism, or at least the idea of a national identity could be viewed as a commons that is worth preserving, another ones are the beauty of the land itself and final one could the american "competitiveness" in the world scale. These "commons" really arise thanks to a certain effort of homogenization in education (and other federal program such as EPA, or the national parks system) and are only possible with a certain level of forceful centralization that I guess is always part of the empire building process. Without it every state would pull in it own direction and that would be the end of the union (we may endlessly debate if that is actually desirable or not outcome), the end of world competitiveness, even the end of some of the States themselves as entities. The process of centralization is definitely intertwined in the process of growth to direct every cell in one common direction. I dont really see the process as undesirable in itself, it just that the process of feedback is not working properly.<br>Back to the post, How can we have local school boards (or other small scale single purpose governemental institution) that serve their local communities in the best way and reconcile it with a small federal(imperial) guideline making authority which purpose is to serve the supra-estatal commons?<br>Or is that just a fools errants that can only work for the short amount of time around the peak of that empire in particular? <br><br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c7746336300820358985 title="comment permalink">2/14/13, 5:13 AM</a><br><br>

Last night, after I shut down the computer for the night, I think I put my finger on it.<br><br>It feels like you are actually trying to "sell" decentralization,in the same way that political advocates try to "sell" whatever their cause is. You at times appear to be singing the praises of local control over the big faceless impersonal bureaucracies in a manner reminiscent of the way that corporate PR spokesmen or advocates for charter schools and private prisons campaign for "local control" to advance their own special interests (and bottom lines). Please don't jump all over me for stating this impression, because I know perfectly well that this is NOT what you are intending. However, the approach and style of recent posts can create a sense of that. Please take it as a critique of the structure of the text, not of the concepts. <br><br>The fact is (and I know you know this better than I), no one needs to "sell" decentralization or promote it in any way. It is going to happen. And the forces that resist it will fight it tooth and nail until their dying day, no matter what. And they will fail in the end, no matter what. No one needs to sell winter when autumn is already underway. And yes I understand that your core point is that you believe traditional local democratic systems are the "best" (okay, maybe too strong a word) means for maintaining functional and responsive local governance after the central control disintegrates. But the important point in this is NOT the contrast between local democratic government and modern-day massive centralized bureaucratic government. It is the contrast between local democratic government (as it was practiced in the U.S. in previous centuries) versus other forms of local control that might arise in its absence. Because we are going to have decentralized government, economy, society, religion, etc. in coming generations, NO. MATTER.

But then you will also have Jim Crow and environmental "sacrifice zones". <br><br>The kicker for me is that I don't think that we can go back to a laisse faire system with regard to environmental regulation. Even in Star's Reach Greer envisions some sort of universal church sanction against adding greehouse gases to the environment (e.g. the priestess who stands by while the blacksmith gets buried alive for having a natural gas well.) <br><br>I don't see how this sort of thing could be enforced without some sort of national standards plus some sort of method for spreading money from rich to poor constituencies, plus some sort of consistent enforcement.

Our famous Cold War contest was ostensibly between communism and capitalism or totalitarianism and democracy - but it doesn't take too much insight to notice that all of these various ideologies lost out to centralized bureaucracy.<br><br>2. I wonder what you think of domestic colonialism. That is, during the long wind-down the wealth pump, to the degree that it survives the end of empire is likely to be directed at those places still capable of generating taxes or wealth. Do you think that this will interfere with developing more locally managed commons?<br><br>3. The American ideal of freedom is sometimes expressed pithily as something along the lines of, "the freedom to wave your arm only extends to the tip of my nose." Obviously, this still leaves a lot to be negotiated. The same thing applies to defining what is a commons (as the sewers and industrial pollution comments show).

At the same time, I can also see how vastly preferable it will be to live in a place with inadequate services than a place with virtually non-existent centralized services. <br><br>I'll give an example. I live in a small suburban neighborhood on the outskirts of a couple small towns near a city of ~100k. Most places around us are served by large municipal water utilities, several of which rely on water pumped over the continental divide, held in large surface reservoirs behind ~80 year old dams, treated in industrial quantities, and piped dozens of miles. The sewer systems are equally large and unwieldy, with pipes you could drive a truck through, etc. The water and sewer utility aren't particularly corrupt or inefficient for a city that size, but there is a water storage tank that's been leaking hundreds of gallons a day for about 4 or 5 years now in one city park on a hillside. Nothing's been done to fix it.<br><br>My neighborhood has a small, special district to provide water service from three wells and a central treatment plant, which is very basic but does the job. Last month our plant manager notified the board (on which I serve) that there appeared to be a leak, as night system flows were ~2 gallons per minute above normal for winter. Within two weeks we'd identified the source and sealed it, with plans to replace the leaky valve in warmer weather. <br><br>Now, of course the city water dept. does fix leaks from time to time, especially main breaks. That said, in the absence of a large tribute economy, I'm willing to bet that my neighborhood has water service in somewhat better shape with less effort, as all of our wells, storage tank, and treatment system (not to mention our board members) are within a 5 minute walk of my house. That is not to say that there won't be problems, but the level of complexity and scale we'll encounter will not be nearly so daunting as the city with its far-flung systems and much greater complexity.<br><br>It seems that JMG is pretty much trying to say that since the large, imperfect, overly complex systems full of surplus office fauna are going away anyways in the absence of imperial tribute, it might be worth looking at ways to salvage some semblance of what we consider a civilized life using the tools of small districts since they're already lying around relatively unused. <br><br>Anyhow, I appreciate the sentiment of collapsing now and avoiding the rush that this governmental decomplexifying series points toward. It's been very interesting to think about.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c3829946929421478781 title="comment permalink">2/14/13, 8:16 AM</a><br><br>

People involved in implementing a centralized system may not have the resources to do their job properly, but that dose not mean they will cede power willingly and 'making an example', legally or even forcefully, of an occasional local authority could prove quite chilling to other considering similar initiatives. Any state, county or municipality that attempts to formally cede could face an overwhelming response from even a very considerably diminished central authority. I think it is more likely to see local initiatives occur well outside the political sphere, as in home schooling cooperatives, farmers markets, even various clubs. (Unfortunately, even these small organizations can be run with a tremendous amount of infighting, power struggles and other self destructive impulses.) Eventually, yes, we will have to figure out how to maintain ourselves at a local scale, but I think it will be an all around unpleasant transition without some level of buy in from the centralized powers-that-be.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c1358444684619862100 title="comment permalink">2/14/13, 9:01 AM</a><br><br>

But, okay, here's mine:<br><br>What about the national forests and parks?<br><br>Gary Snyder among others has argued that they amount to a restoration of the commons. I don't know if that's quite correct, considering how strictly one's ability to make use of them is-- In California, at least, you have to pay to enter a national forest, and you're not allowed to take anything out with you. And, of course, large timber companies are regularly given access and allowed to log for profit on federal and state lands.<br><br>But I worry that in the absence of federal agencies like the Forest Service the situation will get worse. I know that where I've lived in rural Oregon, the first response of many of the locals to a decentralization of control over the forests would be to rev the chainsaws and head on in... And likely their first targets would be the old growth. I say this not as a bigoted urban liberal, but as someone who has lived most of my life in rural areas-- in Douglas County, Oregon, for instance, where a local paper (run by a former county commissioner) proudly declares "This paper is printed on recycled newsprint. But because we support the forest-products industry, we would prefer it was printed on the pulp of old-growth trees."<br><br>Now, trying to think through the problem, it occurs to me that 1) Weyerhaeuser and other companies control millions of acres of land in this country, most of it stolen directly from the public, and that a broad decentralization and empowerment of local government <i>could</i> result in the redistribution of some of this; 2) The final result, after a generation or two of experience, might well be a managed commons. <br><br>But I worry that the immediate incentive is to fell every last tree. And that local hatred for the environmental movement and its association with tyrannical bureaucracy will lead to the devastation of the old forests. <br><br>It's a difficult situation, and I can't see a solution.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c2549011019180637492 title="comment permalink">2/14/13, 9:16 AM</a><br><br>

I only worked for the local school district and I went to every school in the area and taught every grade and every subject. Here are some of the differences between the schools in poorer areas and those in wealthier neighborhoods:<br><br>-The well-off schools have enough teachers, so their class sizes are 15-20 students instead of 50.<br><br>-The well-off schools are actually maintained. They don't have mold on the walls and ceilings caving in.<br><br>-The well-off schools have textbooks published in the last 20 years, and enough of them to go around.<br><br>-The well-off schools are safe; they deal with problem students and send them out. I was assaulted twice by students at some of the worse schools and not allowed to file charges. The students at the better schools aren't frequently found with weapons.<br><br>-The 'extras' are more available: one well-off school teaches five foreign languages (including Latin) and has about 10 foreign language teachers. The same school has 3 dedicated music teachers, a dance teacher, and 6 full-time art teachers. The poorer schools have one Spanish class and a waiting list to get into it. They have one part-time art and one part-time music teacher.<br><br>These are schools in the same school district, drawing off the same tax base, and yet they aren't receiving the so-called benefits of centralization.

I also thought that public ownership of at least some *infrastructure* was in order, but always as independent entities controlled by the public. (And *not* directly by the government, either local or otherwise.)<br>A closely related problem is boards that do exist are frequently appointed. An example is a planning board (related to zoning exceptions). These are elected in many states, but in mine (NJ) they are appointed by the mayor. All statewide officials are appointed by the governor, county-wide by the county executive and local by the mayor, so we vote on very few people in this state. (The governor also appoints his entire cabinet, including the Secretary of State).<br>In the private sector, it is also possible to give the public a great deal of control via what is known as a "captive corporation". The Green Bay Packers is a good example. Shares are sold only to members of some group (in this case, residents of Green Bay), and no one can own very many. There are restrictions as to how and to whom they can be sold. The result is a board of directors that would not dream of moving the team elsewhere (which was the point of the ownership structure to begin with!)<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c4331511150843365445 title="comment permalink">2/14/13, 10:25 AM</a><br><br>

I'll put it in the file for discussion in the upcoming series of posts.<br><br>John, true enough! Still, if we can recover the ability to deal with problems on a community level, dealing with our own crap may not be quite as onerous. <br><br>Hal, in the 1960s, the need for secondary sewage treatment was not widely recognized. In effect, you're criticizing the sewer boards of midcentury because they didn't anticipate and act on the values of a later time; that's a popular kind of criticism, to be sure, but I'm far from sure it's useful. Similarly, we as a society are still just beginning to grapple with the need to keep corporate power from wrecking the public commons, and sewer boards were not tasked with that job; criticizing sewer boards for not doing so in the 1960s is a bit like insisting that public health departments were a failure because they didn't reduce the unemployment rate. <br><br>Godozo, there are certainly ways for households and communities to deal with both issues. <br><br>Jeffrey, yes, that's another of the examples I had in mind!<br><br>Ruben, I've given my timeline many times: the Long Descent started in 1974 and will continue until long after all of us are dead. There you have it. <br><br>Tony, transportation is another huge issue, as most of the big infrastructure there wasn't built by local governments -- and the big governments that built it rarely thought about the long term costs of maintenance. <br><br>Glyn, I didn't want to drag in the separate issues implied by the need to find a better way to deal with human wastes -- not least because I've discussed that at length in prior posts. <br><br>Joseph, that's a valid point, of course -- the rebirth of local independent governments presupposes a rebirth of the skills of democratic process, and that in turn presupposes the end of the psychology of entitlement that afflicts so many Americans these days. <br><br>Richard, I'm not at all sure that it's fair to say that a system as complex, self-referential, and ungovernable as the US government has any single purpose at all. Still, you're right that getting ready for a long process of unraveling ought to be a high priority just now.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c5912584292922076197 title="comment permalink">2/14/13, 10:53 AM</a><br><br>

The federal government imposes only such limits as the majority of elected representatives decide are necessary to maintain the national commons, and the states and local governments take it from there. <br><br>Bill, good! I figured you'd catch that. Still, I think you're missing the point at the core of what I'm doing. Of course there's no need to "sell" relocalization; it's going to happen. What needs to be sold are the skills that could make the process much less destructive and painful than it will otherwise be -- and the best way to do that, as I see it, is to point out that there are actually some advantages to local control. <br><br>Blue Sun, exactly.

Our current centralized over funded infrastructure has allowed a built environment in terms of roads, freeways and suburbs that are not sustainable (read we can't afford to pay for them) with local resources (the 80% post-Empire pay cut we as individuals and a country will take). This means we have to do more than have local municipalities pick up the slack and the control when we lose our central planning, control and funding. There are many things we will simply have to forego. One of the biggest challenges in our de-centralized future (that's _now_ in some places) will be prioritizing what to fund at all, and in what order, from local resources. In the process we will have to discard inefficient living and working arrangements.

Let's not even talk about what percentage is innumerate and unable to follow a simple logical argument. <br><br>Bill, the logic I've proposed would justify national environmental laws, along the same lines as national public health laws -- in both cases, it's a matter of protecting the public commons. The point I was trying to make to Pasttense was more restricted -- that national environmental laws followed on successful regulation at the state and local level. (That's fairly common in the US -- most major legal shifts are pioneered in one or a few states, the way gay and lesbian marriage has been in recent years.) <br><br>Ben, no system of government is foolproof -- and if anyone came up with one that was, evolution would simply produce a better fool. Still, I wonder to what extent the resistance to closing schools is a matter of parents recognizing the advantages of smaller schools with historic connections to local communities. <br><br>Gwizard, and if they'd explored democratic process, which works, rather than falling into the currently fashionable rut of consensus methods, which don't, they might have accomplished something, too. <br><br>Owl, did you read my post? In particular, did you read the discussion of the role of central government in maintaining the public commons? It's really rather embarrassing to watch people fall back into the standard patterns of binary thinking -- in this case, the notion that the only alternative to centralized regulation is laissez-faire -- when I spent the whole post explaining the existence of an alternative...<br><br>Andy, the function of the wealth pump within US borders is complex enough that it'll probably need a post all to itself.

The question is whether a large-scale devolution of powers can be made acceptable, or even win the active support, of enough of the power centers that are around in the wake of crisis. My guess is that it's a real possibility, not least because it will allow whatever central government or governments are around then to concentrate on foreign policy and other issues central to national survival. <br><br>Steve, yes, that's an issue, and it's one that local communities need to start discussing now. Remember that the choice isn't between relocalization and the continuation of central authority; it's between relocalization carried out in an intelligent manner and relocalization that arrives in a lump, bearing a big backpack full of chaos. <br><br>Doc, in my experience, making the boards part time more often landed them in the hands of local business owners and wealthy housewives -- but things may be different where you are. Say hi to Ashland for me; if its cost of living hadn't been sky high, I might have been able to stay. <br><br>Laughing, I've seen exactly the same thing in place everywhere in the country I've been. No matter how the regulations are written, schools in rich neighborhoods get the lion's share of the wealth under the present system, just as they did when it was a matter of local school boards. <br><br>Jon, we've got volunteer fire departments all over the place here in the north central Appalachians, and quite a few other volunteer-run programs. Those of you from elsewhere might want to come visit the hill country sometime and see how it's done! ;-)<br><br>Stu, yes, it's important that the boards be elected, or they're just another set of stooges. As for captive corporations, those work -- I think also of the very successful worker-owned corporations I've dealt with from time to time. <br><br>Roger, funny! Thanks for sharing those. <br><br>Jan, no, I mean centralized. I've discussed the problems with industrial systems in previous posts; this time I'm talking specifically about the problems inherent in overcentralized governments.

Sometimes we are discussing what is bad and should be changed right now, and sometimes we are discussing what will be required in the future. I think these two perspectives get very different answers. I get the impression that JMG is trying to soften the blow of losing some of the benefits of the federal government by emphasizing the merits of more local control.<br><br>However, it seems to me that a federal government charged with preserving the national commons can't actually be that much smaller than it is now. We seem to have fairly well established that national defense, environmental protection, and civil rights are appropriately commons-protecting functions. <br><br>Education was a good example for local control (I plan to homeschool my own children), although not without its own problems (the dominant party in my state has an actual plank in their party platform denouncing the entire concept of critical thinking). But the Department of Education is a relatively tiny percentage of the Federal Government.<br><br>Additionally, it seems clear that only the federal government is powerful enough to impose commons-protecting limits on corporations of all sorts (of course, it has been failing miserably at that in a number of areas, most notably with financial corporations). I recall reading about several towns that have tried to outlaw fracking, only to be effectively steamrolled by the energy companies.<br><br>So, are you just arguing that there shouldn't be any more social security/medicare/safety net programs? I mean, it is clear that those things will not last forever, but I'm not sure what good it would do to pre-emptively abolish them. I expect for most people, to do something like that would only hasten the sort of suffering we want to try to avoid. <br><br>I found this breakdown of the federal budget: http://www.whitehouse.gov/2011-taxreceipt - but of course, the laws extend quite a bit past what the federal government actually does with its tax revenues.<br><br>So maybe I am jumping ahead, but I think I need a clearer view of what, exactly, this ought to look like.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c856583274533339527 title="comment permalink">2/14/13, 6:04 PM</a><br><br>

But I see something different than predominant failure of centralization. The first post-WWII decades were actually good for big centralized projects in the US and everywhere else. Take the Interstate Highway System - it is the basis of the empire infrastructure ever since. The problem is that its maintenance was a decreasing priority since the 80s. Similarly, other countries were rebuilt, industrialized, paved, educated by deliberate central management. What really happened since the 80s is that the central efforts became so much less deliberate. Yeah, we are entering political waters. The broad synthetic commons of The New Deal, etc had appearance of common sense not just under Dems, but under Eisenhower, Nixon as well. That all is reversed now: the Republicans rather openly push for destruction of those commons, the Dems only pretend to take some care of them. At best, this is a peculiar (but "rational") post-Hardin panic for Tragedy of Commons. More probably, this is deliberate enclosure of infrastructure and education commons. Since Thatcher said "There is no common interest", governments' efforts are increasingly directed to welfare of People - some "real" people, shareholders of the state. All others have to compete and forget about common good. Compared to relaxed education attitudes back 50 years ago (just dropping kids by school gates), parents now are just psyched over competitive education advantage for their kids. Seeking that advantage may extend to Education Department and its money working against a boy in Lincoln, Nebraska.

SF has two law enforcement agencies (city police and county sheriffs), two park systems (city and federal) and one of almost everything else: city government, school district, fire department, public library system, water system, power company and so forth. <br><br>I moved north to the next county, which has fewer people, more land, and a great many local government agencies. Multiple school districts. A county library system and several independent municipal libraries; my town's library building was donated by Andrew Carnegie. Bunches of fire departments, police departments, water/sewer agencies, recreation departments. Why not merge all of these petty fiefdoms into single countywide agencies? <br><br>Two neighboring towns consolidated their police departments a while ago, and my town recently merged its police with them in hopes of saving money. The merge was gradual, uncontroversial, and seems to be working out as planned.<br><br>Some of the sewer districts have been hit by big fines from the feds for repeatedly discharging untreated waste into the waterways. Causes of the accidents include failure of control equipment, worn out pipes, and human error. Some of the districts are much worse than others, and it's not clear whether their problems are due to lack of funds for upkeep or some other kind of mismanagement. <br><br>Our sewer district recently had a throw-the-bums-out election because the board spent a lot of money losing lawsuits while having no realistic plan for replacing our century-old pipes faster than they rupture. It's too soon to know whether the new bums will be more effective. <br><br>There's a campaign on to merge several small sewer districts in the southern part of the county. The board and some of the citizenry of at least one of these districts hotly opposes consolidation. The districts don't want to lose local control, partly because they don't want to take on each other's deferred maintenance issues and underfunded pension plans. Of course the directors don't want to lose their jobs. Proponents of merger say rates will go down; opponents predict rates will go up.<br><br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c846022144164191769 title="comment permalink">2/15/13, 3:10 AM</a><br><br>

You're raising awareness of alternative governance systems that work in a low energy environment. Makes sense, I just don't understand the heat in comments at all.<br><br>You know, the most read article I ever wrote was about human wastes. True story, you can always rely on a fart joke to keep an audience entertained! There's a lot of focus on sewerage systems this week, as if it is the only service provided. To my mind that is the easy one, garbage on the other hand is difficult, which is why I generate very little. Plus not having any garbage pickup is incentive too!<br><br>Speaking of which I treat my own human wastes here in an aerobic, worm assisted, compost pile and it isn't hard and is very low tech using no energy whatsoever (other than a bit of wind energy). I'm uncertain why everyone is so hung up on high tech treatments. Beats me. I always make visitors poke their heads into the system, not only for a bit of a laugh, but also just to show them firsthand what is possible... In an aerobic system there is virtually no smell which is much better than a composting toilet, although they are very good too. <br><br>Thinking about present circumstances from a historical perspective, the current percentage of the population working in administrative (office fauna) type roles is truly quite unprecedented. Don't you think so?<br><br>We had a dry lightning storm this side of the mountain range this afternoon and it hit a tree - not on but - very near the bottom of my property. There was quite the plume of smoke. Not good, seven fire trucks plus all of the neighbours out and about and it was eventually tracked down through inaccessible forest and put out. It actually took a few hours just to find the fire as the forest is quite tall and dense at that point. Good effort and it certainly confirmed to me that local problems can be addressed by local people. However, I am seriously over summer, please someone just take it somewhere else.<br><br>Just out of interest, was the overall condition of the waterways during the early 1970's at a point in time in which something had to be done? You can only pollute waterways for so long as they are also a source of drinking water? Also it comes to mind that shipping heavy industry off shore has the benefit of allowing for a cleaner environment at home. Dunno really, just thinking aloud.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c5543039860537365974 title="comment permalink">2/15/13, 3:37 AM</a><br><br>

The commons in question in this case are our waterways which nearly always effect many people beyond our local or state region. From a local perspective, a sewer system can seem function efficiently, but a community located downstream, drawing drinking water from the river carring the first communities effluent, would have a much different perspective. In this case, a watershed wide governance is necessary.<br><br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c5891919682594569962 title="comment permalink">2/15/13, 7:18 AM</a><br><br>

<div class="avtb a_a5e088" id=c1081952923465702913></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/03975812931172457107 rel=nofollow>Ian Stewart</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>A couple of comments caught my attention this week, and I figured my experience with local governments in my area might add something to the discussion. I come from a town called Tracy, 60 miles east of San Francisco and south of Sacramento, which has descended slightly from a peak population of about 80,000 since the recession set in. <br><br>Now, similarly to how Stu from Rutherford described New Jersey, Tracy's planning commission is appointed by the city council. They are primarily concerned with the minutiae of zoning ordinances that would otherwise bog down the elected officials and city manager, but this means that if one wants to get a full picture of the city government's decision making, one must attend both council and planning commission meetings. This has the effect of centralizing such information, since typically the only people who show up to both are one of the recently-bankrupt local newspaper's few reporters and executives of local development companies. The development companies themselves are interesting, as they are run by families who were already large landholders due to ranching, farming, etc. However, they tend to partner with firms from Sacramento, the Bay Area, or southern California to do the work of planning new subdivisions. And those subdivisions that were planned for the area in the 2000-2010 timeframe were far larger than any before; thousands of homes at a time, practically the size of the old city before it started its growth boom. The shaking-out of the smaller landholders as they developed all their land has created an effective centralization, and the remaining developers try to take advantage of that by building a larger volume of bigger houses on smaller lots.<br><br>This brings me to Bill Pulliam's distaste for "selling" the idea of decentralization and re-localization. In a town like Tracy, which probably needs the ideas the most, I'm afraid that they will have to be sold, and rather hard. Case in point, in 2000, a local attorney with some influence placed a growth-restriction ordinance on the local ballot, which imposed a hard upper limit on the number of residential growth allotments the city could issue per year. His coalition sold it successfully, albeit on the basis of maintaining a small-town lifestyle rather than any incipient concerns about energy descent or national financial stability. The city government didn't like the prospect of a slowly-growing tax base one bit, so they took it to court. As I remember it, the judge who ultimately ruled in favor of the measure a few years later also ruled that the city had, in the intervening timeframe, burned up years' worth of RGAs under the measure; and thus could permit no new residential growth for a few years afterward. Once this restriction was up, the writing was on the wall with regards to the housing bubble.<br><br>But even before that particular restriction expired, the local developers and their partner firms were in front of the public with ballot measures trying to ensure their respective developments would come first, in exchange for amenities like a swim center or a rebuilt high school. This kept a large chunk of the local electorate turned against the growth-restriction coalition and its leader, and made it much more difficult to discuss the idea that maybe all these unsustainably dense, consumption-oriented McMansion neighborhoods weren't such a good idea in the first place, hard growth limits or not.<br><br>My point here is that, when it comes time to refocus exurban local governments like Tracy, JMG's approach of elaborating the benefits of re-localization will probably be more effective than asserting the inevitability of hard limits, no matter how much truth that assertion may carry. Some places have already experienced the rhetoric of limits, and been left with a bad taste in their mouths.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c1081952923465702913 title="comment permalink">2/15/13, 7:57 PM</a><br><br>

It seems to me that Americans in general don't value education very much, and that this is the main cause of the deterioration of the educational system. Centralization may or may not have made the matter worse, but the main problem seems to be one of what the culture as a whole values. And please note that I said "education," and not "credentials." Credentials are indeed highly valued, which goes to explain why young people are willing to spend increasingly long periods of time as students, and pay (and borrow) increasingly large amounts of money in order to obtain whatever credential they see as necessary, all the while putting in less effort per unit time into their studies than young people of generations past. <br><br>In some of your previous posts, you quoted Vico as saying that civilizations move from concrete to abstract over time, and that this is one of the factors that lead to their demise. I think this may be what happened to education as well. People used to send their children to school so that the children would learn things of value. Nowadays, children are increasingly sent to school, not so that they would learn things of value, but so that they would earn a credential of value. Never mind that a high school diploma won't read, write, or compute for you! <br><br>I can no longer find the source, but I recently ran into an article that cited a disturbing fact that 55% (or maybe it was 65%) of the functionally illiterate adults lack a high school diploma. One would think it would be a lot more disturbing that the remaining 45% (or maybe it was 35%) are in possession of one!<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c5833430668732052115 title="comment permalink">2/16/13, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

If the contracting economy cannot support more residents there, then the residential units will no longer be built and existing ones will be abandoned.

I've noticed both here and in my own writing that when examples are used to illustrate principles, whatever specific example is used tends to get far more attention than the illuminated principles that are the actual focus of the writing. I'm not trying to cast stones in that observation--I've been guilty of doing it myself numerous times. Perhaps it's another symptom of the loss of critical thinking skills in our society?<br><br>Anyway, today I spent a good chunk of the morning mulling over your original post and many of the comments here while tending to chickens and cleaning buckets and the like over at one of the farms I work for. At some point, the actual principles you're arguing for snapped into place and I started to understand what you were advocating (I think, anyway!)<br><br>Going back to the focused-upon example of sewerage, it seems to me that the point some here are missing is that the local sewer board probably shouldn't have as its focus the maintenance of clean and healthy waterways. Its job is to take care of sewage. The key isn't to also give it the job of keeping waterways healthy, but having other governmental bodies that help impose restrictions that will take care of that. The sewer board's job is to take care of sewage; the water board's job--organized perhaps at the state or, ideally, regional level--is to care for the watershed. As such, the water board crafts regulations to protect the watershed, which the sewer board must then follow in carrying out its task. Both boards run on the principles you've elucidated here, both boards serve out their stated purpose, and together the two (hopefully!) create a system of dealing with sewage without polluting the waterways.<br><br>Of course, I'm just restating your own words. You wrote that, in different phrasing, right here: "In the case of our imaginary sewer district, that means giving those who live within the district the sole power to choose members of the board, while placing the local board under the supervision of a state board tasked with making sure local decisions didn’t violate state public health standards and the like."<br><br>Taking it further, a sane future would probably also bring in a Soil Health and Fertility Board, which would craft regulations encouraging or requiring the return of nutrients to the soil. Therefore, the future local sewer board might actually not at all run a complicated sewage system that we've come to see as standard today--vacating our bowels into the ocean via a labyrinthine series of toilets, pipes, and treatment plants--but might instead craft regulations and provide both education and oversight in the creation of humanure systems that serve to return human sewage to local soils while keeping it out of the waterways.<br><br>All of this could be done within the sort of local government framework you've suggested here. Just because that wasn't the form of it in the past doesn't mean the <em>principles</em> you're advocating couldn't achieve that in a future with different realities and necessities.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c119230068657735404 title="comment permalink">2/16/13, 4:38 PM</a><br><br>

I shall risk that it is not a problem to this extent.<br><br><br> I think that spirituality is one of the things that could be relocalized first, since the community building around that would help relocalize all the rest.<br>I can hardly imagine all the implications, other people like you would be much better equipped than I am to work it out.<br><br><br>This need is particularly blatant in the case of Catholicism in my homeland. The Pope's resignation may be incidental, however the institutions of Catholicism are aging here. The same is not true of some other European countries, I am thinking of Spain for example where religious practice has remained more lively.<br><br><br>One example that could be interesting is Judaïsm, where there is no big central institution. Comes with the territory I guess... And the religious food practices help keep some jobs inside the community, so they seem like a working practical framework. If we were to do like the Bene Gesserit in Frank Herbert's Dune, and design a new religion with relocalization in mind, food taboos that keep production and trade within a local scale could be a working idea.<br><br><br>One thing that is funny here is that the NeoPaganist movements are usually associated with the far right, on the same line as Satanism... I have no idea why it is like this.<br><br><br>In any case, I want to assume that we will not need spiritual taboos in order to relocalize most of our activities. I like to think that freedom is more empowering than taboo.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c899786201375160706 title="comment permalink">2/16/13, 5:01 PM</a><br><br>

To use your logic, it's part of the commons.<br><br>The evolution of the US into an imperial state was in a lot of ways like a bull becoming master of a china shop, but at the same time centralization enabled very real and important advances. I agree that a lot of decentralization is inevitable, and we need to keep these advances in mind.<br><br>School desegregation is a good example. When local preference had absolute sway, we had a lot of segregated school systems. It took not only a lot of local agitation, but also a ruling by the Supreme Court at the national level to begin ending that injustice. Sure it's not really accomplished yet and did a lot to hollow out core cities, but access to education that's not based on race is a value I for one would like to try to preserve as the radius of governance gets closer and closer to the local level. There are plenty of other examples too, where progress towards the promise of a just, fair and even healthy society required a mandate at the federal level.<br><br>Looking at desegregated schools a little closer, a process mirrored in pursuit of a lot of other important values, not only would desegregation happen everywhere at the local level, but it likely could not have happened. A single school district in Alabama, say, would have had a hard time paying to provide really equivalent schools for everyone. The State of Alabama would have had a hard time doing it for all its districts. It was only with funding from the entire nation that this would be realistic.<br><br>So yes it's inevitable that the important part of governance will get closer and closer to home, but how do we keep important values during that process? Moving to an area with more desirable governance is probably not that viable an option. Pretty much by definition, as long-distance governance gets less and less tenable, so will long-distance commuting. So the cost of moving to an area with more acceptable governance will always remain high. Of course it's not impossible, but it certainly changes the equation when one has to change jobs, change the kids' schools and one's own and family's friends to live in a place that doesn't force one race into inferior schools, doesn't force people of one race to sit in the back of the bus, doesn't permit rivers to become flammable, etc. Similarly, right now I haven't moved to an area that really works towards equality of opportunity for all regardless of their parents' wealth, that refrains from assassinating people without due process, that takes care of its sick regardless of where or whether they work, doesn't destroy its and the entire planet's environment for a little perceived convenience.<br><br>Again, this does not mean I'm among those who will fight tooth and claw to maintain the status quo. I'm just asking how to maintain the widespread availability of certain commons.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c8138899755416549277 title="comment permalink">2/16/13, 10:26 PM</a><br><br>

(you can tell I moved around a bit!)<br><br>A one room school is actually a better representation of society than schools as we see them today. Where else in society is age segregation so rigorously enforced? Not in a family unit, not in the workforce, not at university, not in a village. It just doesn't happen and no one seems to notice or even question it? A school environment is a very unlikely, artificial and unrealistic representation of society at large. Well, anyway that's my observation at least.<br><br>I was only thinking about this because I introduced 3 new 20 week old silky chooks a couple of days ago to the "chook collective" here and the interactions are fascinating to watch. Two of the older chooks have taken them under their wing (no pun intended) and are guiding them through the learning process. They had their first run in the orchard this evening and there was lots of “cheep, cheep, cheep, cheeps” of excitement.<br><br>Despite the extreme weather conditions here, life must go on.

As I pointed out to Bill, relocalization is going to happen whether anybody sells it or not, but useful responses to relocalization -- as opposed to desperately clinging to centralized forms long after they've stopped working -- does have to be sold.<br><br>Cherokee, exactly. <br><br>Isis, good. Yes, the movement toward abstraction that Vico outlined is involved here, as credentials are simply an abstract representation of education. I think, though, that one of the reasons so many people no longer value education is that what's been given to them under the name of education no longer has much value. <br><br>Doctor W, it has indeed. That's why I don't use the P-word I think you're discussing these days. <br><br>Chris, thank you!<br><br>Joel, exactly. Thank you for paying attention to the point I was trying to make! Of course there could as well be a humanure board; in <i>The Humanure Handbook</i>, Joseph Jenkins suggests that a sane society would send around a truck to every house in town once a week, say, to pump out the humanure and take it to the local composting plant, which turns out fertilizer for the farms of the region. That activity would need to be monitored, to make sure that health and safety regs were being followed, and the county Humanure Board -- elected by the citizens -- and their employees would take care of that.<br><br>Jean-Vivien, a lot of people in the Seventies used to talk about designing an ecological religion. The point they missed is a manufactured religion compares to a real, living one the way that a plastic Christmas tree compares to a real, living tree: the former may be pretty to look at, but it can't grow or reproduce itself and doesn't age well. More on this down the road a bit. <br><br>Dwig, thank you for the suggestion! I'll consider that. <br><br>Sam, now go back and read my post, noting the places where I talked about the responsibility of state or federal governments to monitor local board actions with an eye toward the public commons. It's really getting tiring to repeat the same point...<br><br>Alexander, I'll be discussing this in an upcoming post. Before grooming yourself too eagerly for the position of dictator, though, you might think about how much you would enjoy being strung up with piano wire, say, or subjected to any of the other common fates of dictators or would-be dictators. It's not a safe career track.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c3593470764217144867 title="comment permalink">2/19/13, 10:58 AM</a><br><br>

They get together usually weekly for shared lessons in certain subjects (history, I know, is one) while doing independent work at home on other subjects. They also coordinate physical activities - there's a fabulous Friday morning ice skating period at the University's ice rink - provides the U some income at an otherwise idle time, lets the children get lots of good exercise. Also, there are programs at local environment centers which while costing some, are excellent teaching and fun-outdoor times. <br><br>Or, to quote a girlfriend of mine, "Why would I WANT my children socialized the way they do in schools? Cliques, bullying, teasing, bad behavior..." She has nine children, and appreciates how homeschooling smooths out the age segregation you describe.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c3730808418310301209 title="comment permalink">2/19/13, 12:27 PM</a><br><br>

I have no idea why it is like this."<br><br>In parts of continental Europe, forms of neopaganism and reconstructionist pagan religions have been adopted by ultranationalists with racist agendas. Their idea is that the ancestral pagan religion of a particular region or nation is the true cultural expression of its people and national soul, unlike the world religions espoused by cosmopolitan foreigners. A religion doesn't have to be neopagan to be put to such political uses; there are ultranationalist Hindus in India and ultranationalist Orthodox Russians in Russia.<br><br>In the United States, these arguments don't have the same appeal. 1. The native pagan religions of this land are the tribal religions of the indigenous inhabitants, not of white people who arrived later. 2. Most Americans are descended from immigrants whose children forgot their mother tongues, moved around a lot and intermarried with immigrants from other places. They identify thenselves as Americans first. Here most neopagan groups either draw on several cultures for inspiration, or if they are focused on the culture and religion of a particular European group, accept adherents regardless of their ancestry. There are some Heathen groups that are race-based, but they are the exception even among Heathens.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c4468674555040271718 title="comment permalink">2/20/13, 1:23 AM</a><br><br>

They're far more effective for enabling vast cronyism, ensuring a double/triple standard of justice, driving out the most intelligent and capable of the population to other countries, and launching disastrous wars, with the end result ranging from a complete loss of government legitimacy to a ruined, defeated, occupied country. <br><br>It's funny to read the impressions people have of the US EPA here, when the reality is that the EPA actively tries to turn it's regulatory power under federal law over to the states. Programs such as the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (which defines what is a hazardous waste) are generally delegated to state regulatory agencies, with the EPA establishing minimum standards, providing limited funding through grants, and occasionally butting heads in court with, or taking direct regulator control in, a state that doesn't meet the requirements of the law. Typically such states either have politically powerful polluters or have come under the thrall of anti-regulation ideologies - the (puzzling to me) idea that allowing polluted water and air will attract long-term industries with associated good jobs. <br><br>The other role of the EPA is to perform emergency cleanups of (generally bankrupt) industries - socialization of the losses after the privatization of the profits, if you will. The main point is, though, that the EPA, despite it's mythical status as federal environmental super cops, actually currently operates in a fashion close to what Mr. Greer suggests should be our goal moving forward.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c1340139634989668842 title="comment permalink">2/20/13, 10:17 AM</a><br><br>

Frankly, if I had known how much better our lives would be for having made the switch we'd have done it sooner. I'm seeing now that school is canned and I would much rather she be socialized among our friends and associates and in situations that we experience already in our daily, real, not-pre-packaged lives. She still gets to see her friends, but there is a definite difference between spending time with her friends outside of school and at school.<br><br><a href=skin-in-game.html#c6012384412621085349 title="comment permalink">2/20/13, 5:21 PM</a><br><br>

Beyond that, we are active members of a church. We've had the good fortune for most of their lives to live in neighborhoods with other families having children of compatible ages. We live in an area with a high enough concentration of homeschooling families that there are several co-ops formed, where families meet together and organize classes one day a week (this helps share expertise and gives the kids a taste of the classroom -- most are not hungry for more). We're not cloistered; we walk our neighborhood, meet the neighbors, and the kids regularly work for some of our elderly neighbors - yard work, pet sitting, snow shoveling, etc.<br><br>As for activities, there is no end.
