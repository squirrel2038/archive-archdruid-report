<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s been a little more than a year since I launched the present series of posts on the end of America’s global empire and the future of democracy in the wake of this nation’s imperial age. Over the next few posts I plan on wrapping that theme up and moving on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>However traumatic the decline and fall of the American empire turns out to be, after all, it’s just one part of the broader trajectory that this blog seeks to explore, and other parts of that trajectory deserve discussion as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’d planned to have this week’s post take last week’s discussion of voluntary associations further, and talk about some of the other roles that can be filled, in a time of economic contraction and social disarray, by groups of people using the toolkit of democratic process and traditional ways of managing group activities and assets. Still, that topic is going to have to wait another week, because one of the other dimensions of the broader trajectory just mentioned is moving rapidly toward crisis. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s hard to imagine that anybody in today’s America has escaped the flurry of enthusiastic media coverage of the fracking phenomenon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, that coverage has included so much misinformation that it’s probably a good idea to recap the basics here. Hydrofracturing—“fracking” in oil industry slang—is an old trick that has been used for decades to get oil and natural gas out of rock that isn’t porous enough for conventional methods to get at them. As oil and gas extraction techniques go, it’s fairly money-, energy- and resource-intensive, and so it didn’t see a great deal of use until fairly recently. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then the price of oil climbed to the vicinity of $100 a barrel and stayed there. Soaring oil prices drove a tectonic shift in the US petroleum industry, making it economically feasible to drill for oil in deposits that weren’t worth the effort when prices were lower. One of those deposits was the Bakken shale, a sprawling formation of underground rock in the northern Great Plains, which was discovered back in the 1970s and sat neglected ever since due to low oil prices. To get any significant amount of oil out of the Bakken, you have to use fracking technology, since the shale isn’t porous enough to let go of its oil any other way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Once the rising price of crude oil made the Bakken a paying proposition, drilling crews headed that way and got to work, launching a lively boom. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Another thoroughly explored rock formation further east, the Marcellus shale, attracted attention from the drilling rigs for a different reason, or rather a different pair of reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The Marcellus contains no oil to speak of, but some parts of it have gas that is high in natural gas liquids—“wet gas” is the industry term for this—and since those liquids can replace petroleum in some applications, they can be sold at a much higher price than natural gas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Meanwhile, companies across the natural gas industry looked at the ongoing depletion of US coal reserves, and the likelihood of government mandates favoring natural gas over coal for power generation, and decided that these added up to a rosy future for natural gas prices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Several natural gas production firms thus started snapping up leases in the Marcellus country of Pennsylvania and neighboring states, and a second boom got under way. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As drilling in the Bakken and Marcellus shales took off, several other shale deposits, some containing oil and natural gas, others just natural gas, came in for the same sort of treatment. The result was a modest temporary increase in US petroleum production, and a more substantial but equally temporary increase in US natural gas production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It could never be anything more than temporary, for reasons hardwired into the way fracking technology works. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you’ve ever shaken a can of soda pop good and hard and then opened it, you know something about fracking that countless column inches of media cheerleading on the subject have sedulously avoided. The technique is different, to be sure, but the effect of hydrofracturing on oil and gas trapped in shale is not unlike the effect of a hard shake on the carbon dioxide dissolved in soda pop:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in both cases, you get a sudden rush toward the outlet, which releases most of what you’re going to get.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Oil and gas production from fracked wells thus starts out high but suffers ferocious decline rates—up to 90% in the first year alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Where a conventional, unfracked well can produce enough oil or gas to turn a profit for decades if it’s well managed, fracked wells in tight shales like the Bakken and Marcellus quite often stop becoming a significant source of oil or gas within a few years of drilling. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The obvious response to this problem is to drill more wells, and this accordingly happened. That isn’t a panacea, however. Oil and gas exploration is a highly sophisticated science, and oil and gas drilling companies can normally figure out the best sites for wells long before the drill bit hits the ground. Since they are in business to make money, they normally drill the best sites first. When that sensible habit intersects with the rapid production decline rates found in fracked wells, the result is a brutal form of economic arithmetic:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>as the best sites are drilled and the largest reserves drained, drilling companies have to drill more and more wells to keep the same amount of oil or gas flowing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Costs go up without increasing production, and unless prices rise, profits get hammered and companies start to go broke. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
They start to go broke even more quickly if the price of the resource they’re extracting goes down as the costs of maintaining production go up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the case of natural gas, that’s exactly what happened. Each natural gas production company drew up its projections of future prices on the assumption that ordinary trends in production would continue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As company after company piled into shale gas, though, production soared, and the harsh economic downturn that followed the 2008 housing market crash kept plummeting natural gas prices from spurring increased use of the resource; so many people were so broke that even cheap natural gas was too expensive for any unnecessary use. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Up to that point, the fracking story followed a trajectory painfully familiar to anyone who knows their way around the economics of alternative energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From the building of the first solar steam engines before the turn of the last century, through the boom-and-bust cycle of alternative energy sources in the late 1970s, right up to the ethanol plants that were launched with so much fanfare a decade ago and sold for scrap much more quietly a few years later, the pattern’s the same, a repeated rhythm of great expectations followed by shattered dreams. .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here’s how it works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>A media panic over the availability of some energy resource or other sparks frantic efforts to come up with a response that won’t require anybody to change their lifestyles or, heaven help us, conserve. Out of the flurry of available resources and technologies, one or two seize the attention of the media and, shortly thereafter, the imagination of the general public. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Money pours into whatever the chosen solution happens to be, as investors convince themselves that there’s plenty of profit to be made backing a supposedly sure thing, and nobody takes the time to ask hard questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In particular, investors tend to lose track of the fact that something can be technically feasible without being economically viable, and rosy estimates of projected cash flow and return on investment take the place of meaningful analysis. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Then come the first financial troubles, brushed aside by cheerleading “analysts” as teething troubles or the results of irrelevant factors certain to pass off in short order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The next round of bad news follows promptly, and then the one after that; the first investors begin to pull out; sooner or later, one of the hot companies that has become an icon in the new industry goes suddenly and messily bankrupt, and the rush for the exits begins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Barring government subsidies big enough to keep some shrunken form of the new industry stumbling along thereafter, that’s usually the end of the road for the former solution du jour, and decades can pass before investors are willing to put their money into the same resource or technology again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the way that the fracking story started, too. By the time it was well under way, though, a jarring new note had sounded:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the most prestigious of the US mass media suddenly started parroting the most sanguine daydreams of the fracking industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They insisted at the top of their lungs that the relatively modest increases in oil and gas production from fracked shales marked a revolutionary new era, in which the United States would inevitably regain the energy independence it last had in the 1950s, and prosperity would return for all—or at least for all who jumped aboard the new bandwagon as soon as possible. Happy days, we were told, were here again. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What made this barrage of propaganda all the more fascinating was the immense gaps that separated it from the realities on and under the ground in Pennsylvania and North Dakota. The drastic depletion rates from fracked wells rarely got a mention, and the estimates of how much oil and gas were to be found in the various shale deposits zoomed upwards with wild abandon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nor did the frenzy stop there; blatant falsehoods were served up repeatedly by people who had every reason to know that they were false—I’m thinking here of the supposedly energy-literate pundits who insisted, repeatedly and loudly, that the Green River shale in the southwest was just like the Bakken and Marcellus shales, and would yield abundant oil and gas once it was fracked. (The Green River shale, for those who haven’t been keeping score, contains no oil or gas at all; instead, it contains kerogen, a waxy hydrocarbon goo that would have turned into oil or gas if it had stayed deep underground for a few million years longer, and kerogen can’t be extracted by fracking—or, for that matter, by any other economically viable method.) </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those who were paying attention to all the hoopla may have noticed that the vaporous claims being retailed by the mainstream media around the fracking boom resembled nothing so much as the equally insubstantial arguments most of the same media were serving up around the housing boom in the years immediately before the 2008 crash.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The similarity isn’t accidental, either. The same thing happened in both cases:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wall Street got into the act. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A recent report from financial analyst Deborah Rogers,
<i>Shale and Wall Street</i> (you can download a copy in PDF format
<a href=http://shalebubble.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/SWS-report-FINAL.pdf>here</a>), offers a helpful glimpse into the three-ring speculative circus that sprang up around shale oil and shale gas during the last three years or so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those of my readers who suffer from the delusion that Wall Street might have learned something from the disastrous end of the housing bubble are in for a disappointment:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>the same antics, executed with the same blissful disregard for basic honesty and probity, got trotted out again, with results that will be coming down hard on what’s left of the US economy in the months immediately ahead of us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you remember the housing bubble, you know what happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Leases on undrilled shale fields were bundled and flipped on the basis of grotesquely inflated claims of their income potential; newly minted investment vehicles of more than Byzantine complexity—VPPs, "volumetric production payments," are an example you’ll be hearing about quite a bit in a few months, once the court cases begin—were pushed on poorly informed investors and promptly began to crash and burn; as the price of natural gas dropped and fracking operations became more and more unprofitable, "pump and dump" operations talked up the prospects of next to worthless properties, which could then be unloaded on chumps before the bottom fell out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s an old story, if a tawdry one, and all the evidence suggests that it’s likely to finish running its usual course in the months immediately ahead. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are at least two points worth making as that happens. The first is that we can expect more of the same in the years immediately ahead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wall Street culture—not to mention the entire suite of economic expectations that guides the behavior of governments, businesses, and most individuals in today’s America—assumes that the close-to-zero return on investment that’s become standard in the last few years is a temporary anomaly, and that a good investment ought to bring in what used to be considered a good annual return:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>4%, 6%, 8%, or more. What only a few thinkers on the fringes have grasped is that such returns are only normal in a growing economy, and we no longer have a growing economy.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Sustained economic growth, of the kind that went on from the beginning of the industrial revolution around 1700 to the peak of conventional oil production around 2005, is a rare anomaly in human history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It became a dominant historical force over the last three centuries because cheap abundant energy from fossil fuels could be brought into the economy at an ever-increasing rate, and it stopped because geological limits to fossil fuel extraction put further increases in energy consumption permanently out of reach. Now that fossil fuels are neither cheap nor abundant, and the quest for new energy sources vast and concentrated enough to replace them has repeatedly drawn a blank, we face several centuries of sustained economic contraction—which means that what until recently counted as the groundrules of economics have just been turned on their head. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
You will not find many people on Wall Street capable of grasping this. The burden of an outdated but emotionally compelling economic orthodoxy, to say nothing of a corporate and class culture that accords economic growth the sort of unquestioned aura of goodness other cultures assign to their gods, make the end of growth and the coming of permanent economic decline unthinkable to the financial industry, or for that matter to the millions of people in the industrial world who rely on investments to pay their bills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There’s a strong temptation to assume that those 8% per annum returns must still be out there, and when something shows up that appears to embody that hope, plenty of people are willing to rush into it and leave the hard questions for later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Equally, of course, the gap thus opened between expectations and reality quickly becomes a happy hunting ground for scoundrels of every stripe. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Vigorous enforcement of the securities laws might be able to stop the resulting spiral into a permanent bubble-and-bust economy. For all the partisan bickering in Washington DC, though, a firm bipartisan consensus since the days of George W. Bush has placed even Wall Street’s most monumental acts of piracy above the reach of the law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The Bush and Obama administrations both went out of their way to turn a blind eye toward the housing bubble’s spectacular frauds, and there’s no reason to think Obama’s appointees in the Justice Department will get around to doing their jobs this time either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once the imminent shale bust comes and goes, in other words, it’s a safe bet that there will be more bubbles, each one propping up the otherwise dismal prospects of the financial industry for a little while, and then delivering another body blow to the economies of America and the world as it bursts. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This isn’t merely a problem for those who have investments, or those whose jobs depend in one way or another on the services the financial industry provides when it’s not too busy committing securities fraud to get around to it. The coming of a permanent bubble-and-bust economy puts a full stop at the end of any remaining prospect for even the most tentative national transition away from our current state of dependence on fossil fuels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Pick a project, any project, from so sensible a step as rebuilding the nation’s long-neglected railroads all the way to such pie-in-the-sky vaporware as solar power satellites, and it’s going to take plenty of investment capital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If it’s to be done on any scale, furthermore, we’re talking about a period of decades in which more capital every year will have to flow into the project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The transition to a bubble-and-bust economy makes that impossible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Bubbles last for an average of three years or so, so even if the bubble-blowers on Wall Street happen by accident on some project that might actually help, it will hardly have time to get started before the bubble turns to bust, the people who invested in the project get burned, and the whole thing tumbles down into disillusionment and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>bankruptcy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If past experience is anything to go by, furthermore, most of the money thus raised will be diverted from useful purposes into the absurd bonuses and salaries bankers and brokers think society owes them for their services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the longer run, a repeated drumbeat of failed investments and unpunished fraud puts the entire system of investment itself at risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The trust that leads people to invest their assets, rather than hiding them in a hole in the ground, is a commons; like any commons, it can be destroyed by abuse; and since the federal government has abandoned its statutory duty to protect that commons by enforcing laws against securities fraud, a classic tragedy of the commons is the most likely outcome, wrecking the system by which our society directs surplus wealth toward productive uses and putting any collective response to the end of the fossil fuel age permanently out of reach. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times">All these are crucial issues. Still, there’s a second point of more immediate importance. I don’t think anybody knows exactly how big the shale bubble has become, but it’s been one of Wall Street’s few really large profit centers over the last three years.  It’s quite possible that the bubble is large enough to cause a major financial panic when it bursts, and send the United States and the world down into yet another sharp economic downturn.  As Yogi Berra famously pointed out, it’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future; still, I don’t think it’s out of place to suggest that sensible preparations for hard times might be wise just now, and if any of my readers happen to have anything invested in the shale or financial industries, I’d encourage them to consider other options in the fairly near term.</span></span></div>

One of your best. You have identified the relationship between the greatest PR stunt of all time (US energy independence on the back of fracking), the fact that the elephant known as peak oil has not left the room and the tragedy of the Presidential-sanctioned fraud and criminality of Wall Street that will not only go unpunished but actively stymies the ability to react to the current predicament.<br><br>The PR story in particular has been something to behold. Some economic commentators here in Australia who are probably the best in the land IMO have been gushing in their repeating of the great PR yarn. "The US phoenix rises" - that sort of stuff. To me the story has all the BS hallmarks of the Iraq-WMD story. <br><br>Thanks for articulating these themes so clearly.<br><br><a href=#c1309272798853551979 title="comment permalink">2/27/13, 10:45 PM</a><br><br>

I know you've been talking about this bubble, as has Kunstler and others, but the idea that it might be coming down in the next few months is a touch unnerving. To be honest, I had no idea that Wall Street was engaging in the same bundling play with natural gas leases as they were with mortgages. Hardly a surprise, though.<br><br>I keep thinking we're on the verge of another major blow to the economy--maybe something similar to scale as 2008. It's been a bit too quiet, which makes me think another unraveling is just ahead. This notion, though, that we're entering into an extended period of bubble-and-bust economics is frightening but far too logical. I hadn't thought of it in that manner, but it makes perfect sense the way you lay it out. We can't get past the idea of growth. Just because it's ending doesn't mean most are going to be willing to recognize it.<br><br>It's frustrating. My roommates listen to NPR fairly regularly, so I keep getting doses of their economic and political programming. It mostly drives me up the wall. Here you have a number of fairly smart people, capable of grappling with problems and proposing (theoretically) intelligent solutions, and they're all stuck within a set of assumptions that no longer apply. So all that ability is for naught! It's just wheel-spinning, without any recognition of our actual problems, and so it ends up being mostly infuriating. There's so much we could do to better deal with the harsh future we have ahead of us, but few people recognize the reality that future is going to take, so most of what we could do to make things better won't be done. Instead, we're going to flail around within the frame work of expired assumptions, likely make things worse more often than not, and then scratch our heads wondering why the heck the world won't start behaving right.<br><br>This is one more reason I mostly stay local. It's so much less frustrating, and I know I'm doing some good things. Today I monitored a cow giving birth. A ridiculous, disgusting, powerful and beautiful process that ended in new life--honest growth, if you will (setting aside the question of if there are already too many cows in the world.) Tomorrow I'll write a new blog post. Friday I'll likely be bucking some odd tons of hay. Before long, I'll be starting the garden. Next Wednesday, I'll be off to my second Grange meeting. We'll see what happens with this bubble--it may not effect my life too terribly much, though I'm sure it'll have its impacts. I worry about my friends and family, though, and my community as well. I'll just keep trying to spread alternative knowledge about what's happening in our society, keep growing and raising food, keep integrating into and helping build my local community, and hope to make things a tiny bit better.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for this analysis. The bubble-and-bust future is another bit of great insight from you that will help me figure out the future. As always, it's going to be fascinating to see how it all plays out, even as it no doubt proves quite the challenge.<br><br><a href=#c345615527013954696 title="comment permalink">2/27/13, 11:02 PM</a><br><br>

A lot of people here in the Pac. N. W. that had horses if they were close enough to BLM land turned their papered horses loose when they couldn't feed them anymore.<br><br>At the same time the Federal land has been deliberately stripped of it's wild horse population so cattle can get full use of the range, which degrades it compared to horses.

It was not even a few hours ago, I sat through a "sustainability" talk at my college which I found profoundly lacking in critical thinking, expectedly I watched the speaker jump headlong into a predetermined conclusion disconnected from any sort of logical science. In the Q&amp;A afterwards, I did my best to illuminate his poorly constructed argument, only to find he doubled down on his viewpoint with another, completely invented argument, with no basis in reality. Soon, the talk was over and all twenty or so people shuffled out of the room including white haired professors, family and students. Afterwards,a meek middle aged woman, a mother of a student, came up to me for clarification about my question. She didn't seem to understand anything about optimal foraging theory despite claiming to be a biologist by trade. Eventually our discussion led us from climate change to EROI and then "renewable energy." As her eyes became large with doubt and uncertainty, I could only recall the feeling that I was telling a child that Santa Claus didn't exist. We exchanged information and I directed her towards some solid academic information, but left the building with a feeling of exasperation. When your a child, you look to adults for the answers, and when your an adult you look to authority for answers. Each time you shed a layer of faith, faith in technology, faith in government, digging ever deeper into the fabric of reality. Are we in need of a movement, political in nature? Are we simply a fringe-group, the children on Cassandra, cursed of the ability to communicate our greatest of fears? Are we the fortunate who never enjoyed the taste of the lotus? Can complex idea's be focused into a abridged political motto, or should they? Should we keep our idea's to ourselves, lest the reflex of shooting the messenger of dire news become the status quo once more?<br><br><br>I have already begun the path of redefining happiness, by improving my health, attitude and well-being. However, there are so many folks who will never connect the dots or come to terms with the future your niche of readers will find all to familiar.

Take most bubbles from the past - be they tulips, exotic foreign investments, beachfront property, even up to the tech bubble. These are things that don't have quite the same ripple effect as basic housing. This has an effect not only in the, if you will, backward direction, that is, wiping out a lot of people's accumulated wealth. As bad as the effects of some of those crashes were, once done, they were done and books could be cleared. Investors damaged may have been limited in their ability to play in the next round, but their losses were probably done, or at least I can't think of any reason why they wouldn't be.<br><br>Real estate, however, is something we all stay "invested" in in some form or another. We either hold property that isn't worth what it was before, we are trying to buy in a market in which credit is not as easy as it once was, or we are renting from someone who faces those problems. Any "recovery" that has happened since the housing bust is not only possible due to the universal nature of the investment, but it is tangibly felt an direly needed by millions. So, when the next bust happens, I can imagine a secondary ripple effect back into housing that wouldn't have happened in previous busts, as investment losses feed into defaults, which depress values, and hence credit and income streams.<br><br>In other words, the housing bust projected risk forward as well as backward.<br><br>This is just speculation on my part, but sounds like a very dangerous double-whammy.<br><br>If I were to try to think the current bubble you have painted for us through, it is possible I could paint a similar picture with respect to energy-related bubbles.

Yet the world never really broke free of bubble-and-bust to begin with: we (i.e. primarily the Western World) had a few halcyon decades between WW2 and the stagflation of the 1970's, and the second economic halcyon of the 1980's-late 2000's was punctuated by various economic dramas such as the Asian crisis of the late 90's and the popping of the tech bubble in the early 2000's.<br>The difference now of course is that the underlying long run economic trend is downward: each new bubble from now on will, as you suggest, do significant permanent damage to the economy in the long run because the subsidy of cheap abundant energy will be less and less available to dampen the inherent negative feedbacks of bursting bubbles. To put it another way, past and future economic bubbles are occurring on the back of a "superbubble" which has been inflating since the dawn of the industrial era and is now starting to pop. <br>As the future bubbles do cumulative permanent damage to consumer and business confidence on the downward slope of this superbubble, perhaps the corporations of old (i.e. the sort you discussed last week) might return and start to supplant contemporary-style corporations? I imagine that such corporations, designed to fulfil a specific real-world purpose within a set timeframe and then be disbanded after that purpose is fulfilled, would be much better suited to the difficult and volatile economic conditions that will be normal on the downward slope of the global economic superbubble.<br><br><a href=#c8338600721859942499 title="comment permalink">2/28/13, 2:29 AM</a><br><br>

It is not just ‘renewables’ that are looking uncertain in this climate: nuclear will quite likely not get built, nor yet many a NG pipeline to connect many ‘stranded’ supplies, even if existing large retail NG grids (‘markets’) are maintained for a while yet. Even some oil lines look dubious. I understand pipeline issues surface for the new suppliers of oil &amp; NG in the USA, and much NG is commonly flared off in N Dakota even if the oil is collected by tanker. And in EU some German Lander (happen to be conservative-led) contemplate needing a civic form of 'nationalisation' of their electricity grids as a means to cope with wind and solar and with electricity import/export in the mix.

In fact more than a few of the frac trucks running today are that old. Just like drill rigs: a DW floater that goes for $700k per day can be had for $300k per day when demand drops.<br>The only aspect that has reduced in price is the cost of locations and the vertical sections of the wells. Build one location and drill one vertical section for a 6,000’ lateral instead of two wells with 3,000’ laterals. OTOH 4 years ago they would have pumped 2 or 3 frac stages into the shorter laterals but now will pump 20+ frac stages in the longer lateral. In fact some of the frac jobs on Eagle Ford wells are costing more than it cost to drill the well. So the net effect is that the 6,000’ lateral is costing more than the two 3,000’ laterals combined. They are pumping more frac stages because they need them to make the wells as profitable as possible.<br>“I suspect the 3D seismic imaging will get cheaper &amp; better and thus help them determine where to drill with a little less cost.” Nope. The cost per square mile of 3d has consistently gone up over time. Again for a similar reason as the increased number of frac stages has driven up those costs. Too long a tech explanation but the quality of the data and the level of processing had to increase as we chased deeper and smaller targets. But there is an odd savings produced by 3d seis: it has greatly reduced the number of wells drilled. The development of 3d seis has caused more wells to not be drilled than it has caused to be drilled. There are many companies that won’t even evaluate a prospect if there’s no 3d. The good news is that 3d has increased the success rate. As I’ve said before finding oil/NG has never been easier. The problem is that there just aren’t that many conventional prospects left to drill especially in the US. Which is why the shale plays are so hot: without them at least half of the companies in the US would go out of business. ... cont.<br><br>- See more at: http://www.theoildrum.com/node/9862#more<br><br><a href=#c7212404704642124362 title="comment permalink">2/28/13, 4:26 AM</a><br><br>

Just look at the results of halfhearted attempts in Europe to change to sustainable energy: the EU as a whole has set targets for every country so that it get's 20% of it's energy out of renewable energy-sources in 2020. <br><br>The results are unsurprisingly both disastrous: it's still much cheaper to put oil in an energy-plant then to use that same oil to create (for example) an windmill. So countries like Germany and Belgium created huge subsidies for people to buy their own solar panels. Energy-companies got artificial (and real peak oil) higher costs for producing electricity. In Germany and eastern Europe this has lead to a new category of people called the 'energy-poor'. <br><br>The middle class (and working people with some money on the side) meanwhile put the solar panels on their roofs and are able to continue their lifestyles for another decade. This is the unfortunate reality of a declining society that decides to devote a lot of resources to a transition: the costs will not be shared equally but will be imposed upon the least powerful. <br><br>Now granted, European countries aren't doing nearly enough to actually transitioning on time but I'm surprised how little renewable programs suffer from the grave austerity measures. Maybe that's because governments found a new source of income: charging 'dirty energy' to make 'clean energy' more viable. <br><br>My hopeful thought is that some sort of transition might be possible: but my depressing conclusion might be that the people that caused or problems in the first place, probably will suffer the least during this.<br><br><a href=#c3100677347120867367 title="comment permalink">2/28/13, 5:19 AM</a><br><br>

Like so many other things, we who were there in the 1970s when these deposits were already well known and the fracking techniques were already being developed know that the only thing "new" here is the high price of oil, making it (temporarily) "profitable" to go after these low-quality deposits. I always maintain that the fracking boom is not a sign of any new beginning, it is a sign of the end that we are going after those lousy reserves already. It's like eating the hedgerow weeds at the end of a long hard lean winter when the food stores are running out. <br><br>Re: the timing... as one of the people whose only surprise about the housing bubble was that it took so long to burst, I'm wondering why you think the fracking bubble's collapse might be imminent.

While peak oil is a global problem, it's affecting different countries and regions at different paces, as Stuart Staniford over at Early Warning has been discussing. And while the US's current preeminence in the global financial system means that crises here send shockwaves throughout the world, it's only a matter of time before the world finds a new global reserve currency to mitigate the effects of the US's mistakes. (Wonder what will happen to the continuing bailouts and the "quantitative easement" backing them up once that happens...) And some countries - such as Chile, with its fiscal discipline, extensive natural resources, and the prominent role local self-sufficiency and family/community bonds still play in the culture - seem poised to handle peak oil much more smoothly than the US or Europe. Since many, if not most, of the problems that currently beset the US (not the least of which is the federal government's response to the other problems), it seems like a uniquely bad place to be in the coming decades, both in terms of financial/material stability and the finer things in life.<br><br>I'm in my 20s and I've never been especially patriotic, and I'm increasingly seeing fewer and fewer reasons to stick around. Peak oil is something we're all having to adapt to, of course, but, if I can help it, I'd really rather not be stuck in a purely reactionary mode of having the rest of my life be defined by simply responding to crisis after crisis without pursuing my relatively modest and flexible goals in life more proactively. After all, this seems to be very much in line with your magical philosophy (something which, as a fellow polytheist/animist, I basically share). Forgive me if I'm putting words into your mouth, though.<br><br>I'd love to hear your thoughts on this issue. And in any case, thanks for writing what is hands down one of the most informative, prescient, and best-thought-out blogs out there. <br><br>Dan<br><br><a href=#c6828337245090173775 title="comment permalink">2/28/13, 10:43 AM</a><br><br>

Generally, your line of reasoning makes sense to me; we are living in the twilight of the American empire and can expect our standard of living to ratchet steadily lower due to dwindling energy reserves.<br><br>My beef (there had to be one I guess, or I would not be writing) is with your statement of imminent crisis in the months ahead. It seems that the claim of imminent crisis or dislocation is made repeatedly by many writers on the topic of peak oil and declining economic health. Meanwhile, the system (political, economic, social, environmental ...) continues to lurch along, and in some manner copes with the most recent problem to confront it. This allows the general public to ignore the on-going decline as the most recent crisis was yet again weathered, and indeed seems to strengthen the proposition that there is indeed no problem on the Titanic. Lost in the noise of all of this is general recognition of the long term problems we are facing, and and any mainstream discussion of it. At some point the system may finally seize up spectacularly due to the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, but will that be months from now or years, or might we fade away like the British Empire over the course of the decades since the end of the Second World War?<br>I realize I am not stating anything particularly new or contrary to your general argument here, but imminent crisis is a difficult view to hold to or promote in the face of contrary evidence ... everything is, after all, still bumping along.<br><br>Thanks for the excellent article.<br><br><a href=#c3339897729573714456 title="comment permalink">2/28/13, 10:59 AM</a><br><br>

I just received my copy of "Not The Future We Ordered" yesterday, and yesterday evening on the Nightly Business Report there was a guy pooh-poohing the whole Peak Oil thing. I've long expected the coming resource shortages, Warren Johnson, the author of "Muddling Toward Frugality," was my favorite professor back at SDSU. <br><br>I see the troubles moving in on us, and I’d like to do battle with the inevitability of decline. I’m encouraged by the efforts underway in California to pursue energy efficiency and the work of the Rocky Mountain Institute and others to define an alternative future, although I fully understand the limits like those pointed out in the link that Gideon’s Laptop offered us to The Automatic Earth. <br><br>So much of it boils down to the mythic vision that guides us. I was in 6th grade when I caught my first episode of Star Trek – and whoa did that make the world shinier. The idea that we were on a path of destiny where the human race could become a galactic civilization and all the wonderful stories I read written on that theme. <br><br>So, here we are, facing a long descent – perhaps destined to a natural, seral process before we recover to a new state of high civilization, the interregnum… If only (yeah – if only) we could follow a new myth. The myth of how the great ape found itself at a crossroads. The second crossroads the species faced after straightening itself and leaving its base nature for a higher calling. <br><br>This time, the species must reoccupy its nature, not as a master to enslave the processes of nature, but as the thoughtful being of nature itself, made up of everything, as consciousness reaching from human mind through leaf, surging tide and bees’ wing. Our scientists of all disciplines are reaching into nature in new ways. Healing the thin envelope of natural process that supports our existence will give us a greater knowledge of it. The possibilities for a species that no longer needs a harness on the forces of nature, but can leverage the incredible power already here to drive its destiny has surely achieved the next evolutionary step. <br><br>Imagine living in the shadow of the myth that could bring us to this. Looking back, the eve of industrial civilization’s destruction is just the fire of creativity rekindled.<br><br><br><a href=#c4712540696911323285 title="comment permalink">2/28/13, 12:26 PM</a><br><br>

It is a subject about which regularly blog, partly because I live in frackbubble wyoming. Shale gas at $3 is well below the cost of production which depending upon the field, is in the mid $8's but old conventional gas is profitable at a buck or 2. Pure frac gas well drilling is falling off a cliff and drillers are moving to oil/gas/ng liquids wells that are profitable because of the oil with gas is produced called associated gas as a bastard child. The bubble may deflate or pop as you state but it is more due to the low price than for geologic or finance reasons. Get gas back to $10-13 which it was a few years back and you will see frac gas in spades. This is a good news/bad news story. Good news it popped. Bad news, it will inflate again worse than ever. The real story should be the EROEI of these unconventional fuels which are already single digits for all of them. The lower the net energy, the sooner finance will dry up. The depletion rates are not as high as 90%/year in any of the major fields I follow and one of my hobbies are looking at well production logs but 2 and 3 year decline rates of 85-90 % are definitely seen but some of the early frac wells in the Barnett Field in Texas are still in production since the 90's when it began there in earnest. Decline rates are not the best metric because some pressures in say the Haynesville(LA) shale start with enormous pressures above 8000 psi, so when they decline 90%, you are still producing a lot of gas compared to longer life conventional wells which start lower but have a long tail profile. My point is that calling for the gas bubble to pop is unfortunately premature. Sure big indebted players like Chesapeake may go under but Exxon, the biggest wont. Net energy will kill frac gas since the frack process can involve a dozens or two 3000-6000 hp trucks running at once shaking the earth and darkening the sky and stampeding wild horses! Since 30-40% of our new gas is associated with frac oil, it is the decline of frac oil or a big jump in crude prices that will kill frac gas and make it uneconomical to produce at $3 but get it back to double digit levels as is in Europe and Asia right now and you ain't seen nuttin, honey.<br><br><a href=#c3810020013051576961 title="comment permalink">2/28/13, 2:13 PM</a><br><br>

I realized that some of what it presented has already been voiced by you, but in less detail. What did strike me hard was the idea that the effort to provide renewable energy sources is a vain and dangerous venture. “Vain” because on close examination it becomes obvious that nothing will be gained from the effort and like the consequences of pursuing relief of serious medical problems with various alternative medicine approaches, the end result is more than just failure in many instances, through the misallocation of resources. A second aspect that you have begun to expose is that maneuvers by powerful institutions are preventing remedial efforts to turn things around and enriching the manipulators in an obscene and pernicious way. This seems to be a recent development in the situation, at least in its pervasiveness. I think this is related to the successful rise of totalitarian socio-economic entities (governments, corporations , the media etc.) and the effects of their systemic use of high power computer systems for economic and political shenanigans. These seem to be a regular feature, at the present time. Sadly, the means to deal with such does not appear to be available. Your call to try to establish local action centers, I think is a possible approach along with wide publicity as to the need. However, the Emperor without clothes situation is in front of us, but it is hard to recognize. The enormity of what is just down the road is too difficult to perceive properly, because of the requirement to be ruthlessly imaginative. I am afraid that your optimism has become less justified by the present turn of events as demonstrated by the economic bubble and thievery processes that you have identified and mark our times.<br>The task of changing the processes that generate the way that our civilization operates in order to insure the continuation of human existence at some level of joyful experience of life in this world, appears ,in my view, to be almost impossible to perform. I , rejoice with having had to opportunity to be alive and be a witness of this world and its happenings and I deeply wish that ways can be found for humanity to continue. I consider being informed about what is actually happening, as a paramount initial step for participation in the effort to affect desirable changes. In this, you, John have been immeasurably valuable and important. Please continue courageously with your efforts. I will continue to try to do what I can, even with my time, here, running out.<br>Thank you, <br>Ben Simon <br><br><br><a href=#c3932539505046697698 title="comment permalink">2/28/13, 2:32 PM</a><br><br>

Once we, as individuals, families, and community groups, get our own act together and are in a position to show the rest of society that there truly is another option, then we can talk about politics on the larger scale. <br><br>Hal, excellent. You get today's gold star. You're quite right -- not only because housing (and, equally, energy) are far more essential to day-to-day survival than, say, the high-tech industries that were central to the previous bubble, but also because the impact of the housing bubble was largely papered over by "extend and pretend" policies that allow big firms to treat worthless securities as assets. The result is not unlike dry rot -- you've got some very imposing structures that are barely able to support their own weight, and may come apart very suddenly. <br><br>Richard, true enough. I've long thought the best investment for a hedge fund would be hedgerows. <br><br>Leo, thanks for the link. It's exactly the vulnerability of universities and colleges to funding cuts and government pressure that makes it essential to get this stuff into the hands of basement inventors and local community groups, who can't be bought off so easily. <br><br>Raven, sure, if you want to buy into that repeatedly failed scenario. <br><br>Approliving, good. The inherent instabilities of a capitalist economic system were reined in nicely between the 1930s and the 1990s by financial reforms such as the Glass-Steagell Act, which put much-needed firewalls between the speculative economy and the economy that produces goods and services. Once those were scrapped, we landed right back in boom-and-bust territory. As for the future usefulness of old-fashioned single-purpose corporations, well, yes -- that's one of the reasons I brought them into the discussion!<br><br>Renaissance, that would make a perfect musical accompaniment to this week's post.

What makes me hopeful, though, is that each bubble that pops seems to bring a new openness to the peak oil narrative -- and this one may do so in a very big way, once it can be shown that the people who were insisting peak oil is disproven by fracking were simply shilling for stock market cheats. <br><br>Cherokee, Sinopec also got taken -- they just announced a big purchase in the shale industry. One of these days it's going to sink in that buying a great investment opportunity from an American firm is right up there with answering one of those email scam artists from Nigeria who need your help to get a million dollars out of some African country...<br><br>Karl, tell your friends in the anti-fracking scene in NY to keep up the good work. Here in western Maryland, we dodged the bullet once gas prices crashed -- the gas in this corner of the Marcellus is dry gas, thus hopelessly uneconomic these days. Once the whole market implodes, it'll be a decade at least before there's another attempt, and by then you may be able to get some sensible legislation in place. <br><br>Yupped, it's precisely because people think they're so cynical these days that they're so easy to bamboozle. <br><br>Phil, Europe's in as deep a mess as the US, though admittedly it's a different mess with different probable consequences. As for Rockman, he's one of the main reasons I read The Oil Drum regularly -- it's always good to get a reality check from someone who actually works out there punching holes in the ground. <br><br>John, thanks for the info on shale leases! That's worth knowing. I'm a little less sanguine about the financial fallout than you are -- just as in 2008, chaos in the capital markets works out to job losses and other economic troubles -- but you're right that the rising price of natural gas won't help either. As for Italy, yes, I've been watching that very closely. <br><br>Deserted, it's early days yet. In comparable historical situations, the rich have usually ended up against the wall, in one way or another, as things wound down. I wonder how many of them have even begun to suspect that they're busy cutting their own throats.<br><br>Michelle, since I don't own a car, I can certainly sympathize!<br><br>Justin, if I'm understanding you correctly, you're saying that the gap between a shrinking real economy and an apparently growing paper economy is increasing, and being filled with bubbles.

I'd point to the fact that shale leases are being abandoned rather than flipped, and assets are being sold off to anybody who will pay for them, at a fraction of their assessed value, while the first signs of major financial trouble in the industry are being heard. That usually happens a few months before the bottom drops out. Of course I could be wrong, but that's my sense of where we are in the bubble. <br><br>M, there's no one good answer for that. You need to consider your talents and interests, and compare them to what your neighbors and other people in your community want and need, before making a decision and getting the necessary training. <br><br>Mister R., no argument there. <br><br>SMJ, good! It's entirely possible that 3D printing could turn into the basis for a bubble -- look at the way that its partisans finesse the need for raw materials and energy to make their technology go, and you've certainly got the purblind enthusiasm necessary to get a bubble off the ground. Still, trying to predict what's going to strike the fancy of the investing public next is a sucker's game. It could as well be thorium mines, or biodiesel firms, or anything else. <br><br>Dick, heck of a good question, which I don't have the data to answer. As for David Hughes' work, I've read it, along with a number of other sources, and I've also simply watched the shale business follow the standard speculative bubble logic -- Galbraith's <i>The Great Crash 1929</i> lays that out memorably, and once you know the pattern, it's easy to recognize. <br><br>Andy, that's entirely possible. There's already a huge bubble in education loans, which is probably a couple of years from popping. <br><br>Barath, see my response to Bill Pulliam above. The desperation with which shale assets are being sold off for a fraction of their assessed value suggests to me that crunch time is near. <br><br>Jason, my guess is that the implosion of the fracking frenzy over here will be big and painful enough to bring attempts to do the same thing elsewhere to a screeching halt. <br><br>Gideon, I disagree. That decision was made around 1980; at this point it's purely a matter of facing up to the consequences, and figuring out how not to make things worse. <br><br>Ael, every recent study not sponsored by the coal industry has shown that the standard estimates for remaining coal reserves are hugely inflated, and much of what's left is of such poor quality and so difficult to extract that the energy to be gotten by burning it is less than the energy you need to get it out of the ground. Richard Heinberg's book <i>Blackout</i> is a good summary of the issues here.<br><br><a href=#c990374280933692566 title="comment permalink">2/28/13, 3:51 PM</a><br><br>

The irony is that if they keep it up long enough, they'll guarantee the end of what's left of the rule of law in this country, by providing a sufficiently massive constituency for whichever demagogue is most ready, willing, and able to hang them from lampposts. <br><br>William, my guess is that that's not on the boards at this point. Our last two wars in the Middle East were disastrous for US interests there, and as our national bankruptcy proceedings draw closer, the issue of paying for them without causing a run on Treasury debt will be an increasing concern. Expect plenty of toothless blunder as we proceed down the curve of decline. <br><br>Jollyreaper, I'll cover that in an upcoming post. The short form is that honest work doesn't pay the kind of salaries that a good scam does. <br><br>Thijs, fascinating.

I've been snapping and snarling at various people all along!<br><br>CJ, oh man. They <i>are</i> smoking their shorts, aren't they? <br><br>Brad, it could be stopped in in its tracks easily, by reenacting the Glass-Steagall Act and enforcing existing laws against securities fraud. The problem is simply the level of graft in the executive and legislative branches that prevents what could be done from being done. <br><br>Wildwood, first of all, it's okay to be scared. The first step in facing up to fears is admitting they exist, and allowing yourself to feel them. Second, the fracking bubble isn't the end of the world, it just means another round of hard times on the heels of the last one, and so you're not stuck in a too-little-too-late situation unless you choose to be. Third, there's plenty you can do that will make a difference; for that matter, if you've got a church community and a garden, you're already way ahead of most Americans. <br><br>As for the rest, I think it's probably time for another blog post for people in your position -- there are a lot of them, and this blog's stats have climbed sharply enough that I suspect most of 'em haven't been reading long enough to have gotten the last one. Stay tuned; I'll have something to say in the next week or two. <br><br>Dan, do you really want to be an American in a foreign country at a time when blaming Americans for everything that's wrong with the world is likely to become a worldwide full-contact sport? The assumption of privilege that so many Americans have absorbed, as citizens of the current global empire, will not shield you from an angry mob, or from local governments that decide that throwing you and your assets to that mob is a great way to win popular support.<br><br><a href=#c5465881023350343643 title="comment permalink">2/28/13, 4:11 PM</a><br><br>

You can make ANYTHING with it... anything, that is, out of ABS plastic, that fits within a 3" cube, that you have a CAD design file for, that you can wait a few hours for (each unit), that can be built-up in layers with little overhang. So, it's GREAT for desk decorations and doll-house furniture, and maybe for ham radio coil forms, but not so good for anything you might want to expose to harsh solvents, high temperatures, or physical stress (e.g. bicycle parts). We suspect that it might be good for making simple patterns, for sand-casting metal objects of actual value, such as hammer heads or (rough) gears, but we don't have a foundry (yet). <br><br>OK.

From what I understand, the original regulations were mostly motivated by a fear of communism. As soon as that passed the regulations themselves didn't last long beyond it. So it seems to me like a continual loop of increasing inequality eventually leading to threat of social revolution which eventually prompts effective measures to pacify the masses by the investor/political class, leading to a pacified and therefore no longer threatening mass, which leads to a no-longer-scared investor class which therefore goes back to increasing inequality again starting the cycle all over.

I don't know what the interest on your (presumably student loan) debt is, but one way to think about it is that every dollar uesd to pay down that debt "earns" whatever interest your loan rate is.

I could imagine a situation where a few corporations were lucky/efficient enough to actually accomplish something useful after the previous bust and before being wiped out by the next bust. From this lucky accident, something similar to the old-style corporation will evolve in the context of a collapsing economy, possibly without those involved even realising that they are effectively reinventing it. As the current set of economic intellectuals lose their credibility in a collapsing economy, I think people will respond by re-evaluating their economic priorities (e.g. adopting a less money-oriented point of view and focusing more on real-world results) and a new set of intellectuals with a very different, better-adapted set of ideas will come to dominance. I don't think that people will allow themselves to lose all hope for good and let things fall apart completely. Even if most people are ignorant of the collapse of past societies, or currently think it can't happen to us, the fact that information is even there will inform the way our society responds to collapse. Negative feedbacks can have their own negative feedbacks.<br><br><a href=#c6515115487841511411 title="comment permalink">3/1/13, 1:39 PM</a><br><br>

However, no particular post has seemed a specifically appropriate point at which to table this idea, but I believe it might be useful. <br><br>I just finished a BA in history, and came to the following conclusions.<br><br>1) All arguments and definite stances on the human civilisational trajectory circa this minute depend on a historical meta-narrative, where the hunter-gatherer "point zero" occupies the crucial position.<br><br>2) The hunter-gatherer "point zero" is analytically unavailable. <br><br>This is not to deny that there are no extant hunter gatherer societies available for study. It is to deny that hunter gatherer societies which have not been massively restructured by contact with civilisation are analytically available. No space to argue this but it is true, and has been for some time.<br><br>Anyways, what I'm really getting at is that I respect your approach to "traditional life ways" more than any other broad reaching historical commentator I have encountered. You seem interested in treating indigenous peoples as living breathing fallible human beings capable of diversity, cruelty, and brilliance, rather than yielding tectonic devices in a historical metanarrative. <br><br>So I was wondering if you might be willing to countenance, at some point, a comparative treatment of this topic from your own perspective, using some of the most prominent metanarrativists on the contemporary market as the points of departure.<br><br> The two works that come immediately to mind are Derrick Jensen's "Endgame" and Steven Pinker's "The Better Angels of Our Nature." The battle cry of a self-proclaimed "indigenist" juxtaposes nicely with a civilisational paean that exalts a continuous Western Ascent away from tribal violence to a Modern Monopoly on "self control," "empathy," "morality," and "reason."<br> <br>I'm quite radically out of sympathy with both works of course, (although I'm much more afraid of Pinker's book, as it will almost certainly become a guiding light for neoliberal aspirations for a decade at least, to the planet's sorrow) but I think they define the contemporary fork rather perfectly. And both of them hinge on variant attitudes toward the tectonic phantom of the "point zero" hunter gatherer society. <br><br>An extended treatment would be an absurd request of you of course. But if you ever did find time or inclination to address this idea in any format, I would be very grateful. <br><br>It weighs on my mind heavily these days. Despite feeling old and tired already, I am technically, at 23, still part of the youth demographic, the people whose decisions are going to really count. The phantom of the hunter gatherer haunts this generation like no other, I am finding. Whether it's talking about our "unnatural" reliance on newly poisonous sugar, or exalting the elevated moral sentiments and capacities for self control that the internet and modern cognitive science has brought us, in contrast to our impulsive ancestors, it seems to dominate our thoughts, regardless of where we are on the spectrum. <br><br><br><a href=#c1518332104808741842 title="comment permalink">3/1/13, 4:19 PM</a><br><br>

I am no exception and as you say, again found The Oil Drum useful, particularly useful. <br>http://www.theoildrum.com/node/9702 <br><br>American 'conventional' 'crude oil' extraction / production was in long term decline over decades but recently stabilised after 2005, and is about 5 million barrels a day. The USA still makes use of 'total liquid fuel', that is 'crude oil' + 'others', to the extent of about 18 million barrels a day. (The total 'liquids' consumption was more than 20M bbl/d in 2007, but has come down since.) US domestic production of 'total liquids' has risen 35% since 2007; the rise entirely made up from 'other', rather than from previous ‘conventional’ sources. Most of the rise comes in about equal measure from Biofuel and from oil from shale, but there is a not insignificant contribution from extra natural gas liquids (NGL), like propane, which can be bottled as liquid for various uses. NGL and Biofuel are not the same as crude oil.<br><br>The net result, thenr, is that US must still import about 45% of its 'total liquids'. What is more, imports must still meet 50% of the US requirement for the 'real thing', that is for 'crude oil'. Shale oil has reduced imports of crude from about 60% of requirement, to 50% of requirement. Which, I presume is the '10% of requirement' quoted by Nathan. This seems a very long way from ‘independence’, by any realistic route, unless we factor in a very dramatic further reduction of American consumption of transport fuel. <br>best<br>Phil<br><br><br><a href=#c486088577581316185 title="comment permalink">3/2/13, 10:49 AM</a><br><br>

Back in the 19th century the same thing happened with the expansion of the railroads.<br><br>The initial investors received extremely good returns from their investments. Then as the years progressed and the costs of operating and maintaining the railroads increased, the investment returns decreased significantly and many people lost their shirts.<br><br>The reason for the increase in operating and maintenance costs of those companies is that over time the rail infrastructure and rolling stock had to be replaced. This cost was not taken into account and thus led to very high initial returns and then accelerating costs wiped those out.<br><br>This led to - after much resistance from the business community and heated debate - the inclusion of the cost of asset replacement (depreciation) in the books of those railroad companies.<br><br>The problem today is that because companies can externalise costs by either dumping wastes into the environment and/or extracting resources from that environment as cheaply as possible, they'd be crazy not to do it.<br><br>This is another tragedy of the commons.<br><br>The ability to calculate an accurate cost for the use of the commons has not been seriously considered by our society and as such it is widely ignored. <br><br>There is also an investment maxim that says, "past performance is no guide to future performance". Such is hard won wisdom.<br><br>I have faith that your writing is good enough to sustain you during a downturn.<br><br>PS: The rise of internships in the US in businesses is also a tragedy of the commons.

It didn't help that two major US bookstore chains went bankrupt and never paid publishers for millions of books they'd sold, meaning that the authors of those millions of books didn't get royalty payments on them, either. <br><br>Unknown, you really ought to lay off the thriller novels, you know. Wipe out 98 per cent of the population, and there won't be any wave of rebuilding -- existing stocks of housing, manufactured goods, and everything else will be enough for everyone left for decades, meaning that the economy will grind completely to a halt and leave the paper held by banks as worthless as Confederate dollars in 1866. <br><br>I could go on -- your scenario has enough holes to fly a herd of hippogriffs through -- but why bother? The point I'd encourage you to consider is why you, and so many other people these days, have such a powerful craving for narratives that accuse somebody you don't like of pursuing sinister agendas. <br><br>Jim, exactly. This is another example of the way that bubble economics fosters economic distortions. <br><br>Repent, sure, you should be terrified because I spend my spare time raising money for <a href=http://scottishrite.org/about/philanthropy-scholarships/ritecare/ rel=nofollow>free clinics for children with language problems</a> and other local and global charitable needs. It disgusts me that so many people are so eager to spread a set of weary and repeatedly disproved lies about an organization that has done a huge amount of good in the world, and very little evil.

I come to work, trade real energy for digital representations of dollars, then go to my local store and trade those digital bits for real items. The system works because, at a local level, the rule of law still works and everybody has faith in the value of those bits and pieces of paper. However, I am seeing that the bigger the institution, the rule of law is sporadically applied, and am losing faith that I will ever see the real value I presently attach to those digital dollars caught in the retirement system (actually I have written off most of those promises, and any value I see in the future will be a bonus)<br>So am I correct in seeing “faith” in the monetary system as a commons?

These are questions I don't really have the answer for, not yet. <br><br>Hypothetically, could we handle a 50% per capita drop in consumption? What would that look like? Work closer to home, take mass transit, eat locally, build homes that aren't energy hogs, etc. <br><br>They say 40% of our food in this country is wasted. How much of this could really be saved? <br><br>Whenever anyone with sense talks about budgeting, it's always easier to save a buck than make a buck. And when it comes to conservation, there's much about our built society that's not worth saving and wouldn't be missed. <br><br>3,000 SQFT mcmansion in the burbclave, two full-sized luxury cars, private schools for Muffy and Buffy, expensive vacations, the expense of keeping up appearances and buying things you don't need to impress people you don't like.
