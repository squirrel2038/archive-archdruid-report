<div class=MsoNormal>
When William Butler Yeats put the phrase I’ve used as the title for this week’s post into the powerful and prescient verses of “The Second Coming,” he had deeper issues in mind than the crisis of power in a declining American empire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, the image is anything but irrelevant here; the political evolution of the United States over the last century has concentrated so many of the responsibilities of government in Washington DC that the entire American system is beginning to crack under the strain.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is admittedly not the way you’ll hear the centralization of power in America discussed by those few voices in our national conversation who discuss it at all. On the one hand are the proponents of centralized power, who insist that leaving any decision at all in the hands of state or local authorities is tantamount to handing it over to their bogeyman du jour—whether that amounts to the bedsheet-bedecked Southern crackers who populate the hate speech of the left, say, or the more diverse gallery of stereotypes that plays a similar role on the right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the other hand are those who insist that the centralization of power in America is the harbinger of a totalitarian future that will show up George Orwell as an incurable optimist. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’ve already talked in a number of previous posts about the problems with this sort of thinking, with its flattening out of the complexities of contemporary politics into an opposition between warm fuzzy feelings and cold prickly ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’d like, to pursue the point a little further, to offer two unpopular predictions about the future of American government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The first is that the centralization of power in Washington DC has almost certainly reached its peak, and will be reversing in the decades ahead of us. The second is that, although there will inevitably be downsides to that reversal, it will turn out by and large to be an improvement over the system we have today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These predictions unfold from a common logic; both are consequences of the inevitable failure of overcentralized power. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s easy to get caught up in abstractions here, and even easier to fall into circular arguments around the functions of political power that attract most of the attention these days—for example, the power to make war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I’ll be getting to this latter a bit further on in this post, but I want to start with a function of government slightly less vexed by misunderstandings. The one I have in mind is education. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the United States, for a couple of centuries now, the provision of free public education for children has been one of the central functions of government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Until fairly recently, in most of the country, it operated in a distinctive way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Under legal frameworks established by each state, local school districts were organized by the local residents, who also voted to tax themselves to pay the costs of building and running schools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Each district was managed by a school board, elected by the local residents, and had extensive authority over the school district’s operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In most parts of the country, school districts weren’t subsets of city, township, or county governments, or answerable to them; they were single-purpose independent governments on a very small scale, loosely supervised by the state and much more closely watched by the local voters. On the state level, a superintendent of schools or a state board of education, elected by the state’s voters, had a modest staff to carry out the very limited duties of oversight and enforcement assigned by the state legislature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the federal level, a bureaucracy not much larger supervised the state boards of education, and conducted the even more limited duties assigned it by Congress. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Two results of that system deserve notice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First of all, since individual school districts were allowed to set standards, chose textbooks, and manage their own affairs, there was a great deal of diversity in American education. While reading, writing, and ‘rithmetic formed the hard backbone of the school day, and such other standards as history and geography inevitably got a look in as well, what else a given school taught was as varied as local decisions could make them. What the local schools put in the curriculum was up to the school board and, ultimately, to the voters, who could always elect a reform slate to the school board if they didn’t like what was being taught. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Second, the system as a whole gave America a level of public literacy and general education that was second to none in the industrial world, and far surpassed the poor performance of the far more lavishly funded education system the United States has today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In a previous post, I encouraged readers to compare the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858 to the debates in our latest presidential contest, and to remember that most of the people who listened attentively to Lincoln and Douglas had what then counted as an eighth-grade education.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The comparison has plenty to say about the degeneration of political thinking in modern America, but it has even more to say about the extent to which the decline in public education has left voters unprepared to get past the soundbite level of thinking. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those of my readers who want an even more cogent example are encouraged to leaf through a high school textbook from before the Second World War. You’ll find that the reading comprehension, reasoning ability, and mathematical skill expected as a matter of course from ninth-graders in 1930 is hard to find among American college graduates today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you have kids of high school age, spend half an hour comparing the old textbook with the one your children are using today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You might even consider taking the time to work through a few of the assignments in the old textbook yourself.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Plenty of factors have had a role in the dumbing-down process that gave us our current failed system of education, to be sure, but I’d like to suggest that the centralization of power over the nation’s educational system in a few federal bureaucracies played a crucial role.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To see how this works, again, a specific example is useful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Let’s imagine a child in an elementary school in Lincoln, Nebraska, who is learning how to read.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ask yourself this:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>of all the people concerned with her education, which ones are able to help that individual child tackle the daunting task of figuring out how to transform squiggles of ink into words in her mind? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The list is fairly small, and her teacher and her parents belong at the top of it. Below them are a few others:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>a teacher’s aide if her classroom has one, an older sibling, a friend who has already managed to learn the trick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Everyone else involved is limited to helping these people do their job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their support can make that job somewhat easier—for example, by making sure that the child has books, by seeing to it that the classroom is safe and clean, and so on—but they can’t teach reading. Each supporting role has supporting roles of its own; thus the district’s purchasing staff, who keep the school stocked with textbooks, depend on textbook publishers and distributors, and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, the further you go from the child trying to figure out that C-A-T means “cat,” the less effect any action has on her learning process. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now let’s zoom back 1200 miles or so to Washington DC and the federal Department of Education. It’s a smallish federal bureaucracy, which means that in the last year for which I was able to find statistics, 2011, it spent around $71 billion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Like many other federal bureaucracies, its existence is illegal. I mean that quite literally; the US constitution assigns the federal government a fairly limited range of functions, and “those powers necessary and convenient” to exercise them; by no stretch of the imagination can managing the nation’s public schools be squeezed into those limits. Only the Supreme Court’s embarrassingly supine response to federal power grabs during most of the twentieth century allows the department to exist at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
So we have a technically illegal bureaucracy running through $71 billion of the taxpayers’ money in a year, which is arguably not a good start. The question I want to raise, though, is this:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>what can the staff of the Department of Education do that will have any positive impact on that child in the classroom in Lincoln, Nebraska?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They can’t teach the child themselves; they can’t fill any of the supporting roles that make it possible for the child to be taught.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>They’re 1200 miles away, enacting policies that apply to every child in every classroom, irrespective of local conditions, individual needs, or any of the other factors that make teaching a child to read different from stamping out identical zinc bushings. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are a few—a very few—things that can usefully be done for education at the national level. One of them is to make sure that the child in Lincoln is not denied equal access to education because of her gender, her skin color, or the like. Another is to provide the sort of overall supervision to state boards of education that state boards of education traditionally provided to local school boards. There are a few other things that belong on the same list.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All of them can be described, to go back to a set of ideas I sketched out a couple of weeks ago, as measures to maintain the commons. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Public education is a commons. The costs are borne by the community as a whole, while the benefits go to individuals:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the children who get educated, the parents who don’t have to carry all the costs of their children’s education, the employers who don’t have to carry all the costs of training employees, and so on. Like any other commons, this one is vulnerable to exploitation when it’s not managed intelligently, and like most commons in today’s America, this one has taken quite a bit of abuse lately, with the usual consequences. What makes this situation interesting, in something like the sense of the apocryphal Chinese proverb, is that the way the commons of public education is being managed has become the principal force wrecking the commons. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The problem here is precisely that of centralization. The research for which economist Elinor Ostrom won her Nobel Prize a few years back showed that, by and large, effective management of a commons is a grassroots affair; those who will be most directly affected by the way the commons is managed are also its best managers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The more distance between the managers and the commons they manage, the more likely failure becomes, because two factors essential to successful management simply aren’t there. The first of them is immediate access to information about how management policies are working, or not working, so that those policies can be adjusted immediately if they go wrong; the second is a personal stake in the outcome, so that the managers have the motivation to recognize when a mistake has been made, rather than allowing the psychology of previous investment to seduce them into pursuing a failed policy right into the ground.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Those two factors don’t function in an overcentralized system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Politicians and bureaucrats don’t get to see the consequences of their failed decisions up close, and they don’t have any motivation to admit that they were wrong and pursue new policies—quite the contrary, in fact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Consider, for example, the impact of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, pushed through Congress by bipartisan majorities and signed with much hoopla by George W. Bush in 2002. In the name of accountability—a term that in practice means “finding someone to punish”—the NCLB Act requires mandatory standardized testing at specific grade levels, and requires every year’s scores to be higher than the previous year’s, in every school in the nation. Teachers and schools that fail to accomplish this face draconian penalties. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
My readers may be interested to know that next year, by law, every child in America must perform at or above grade level. It’s reminiscent of the imaginary town of Lake Wobegon—“where all the children are above average”—except that this is no joke; what’s left of America’s public education system is being shredded by the efforts of teachers and administrators to save their jobs in a collapsing economy, by teaching to the tests and gaming the system, under the pressure of increasingly unreal mandates from Washington DC. Standardized test scores have risen slightly; meaningful measures of literacy, numeracy, and other real-world skills have continued to move raggedly downward, and you can bet that the only response anybody in Washington is going to be willing to discuss is yet another round of federal mandates, most likely even more punitive and less effective than the current set. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Though I’ve used education as an example, nearly every part of American life is pervaded by the same failed logic of overcentralization. Another example?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Consider the Obama administration’s giddy pursuit of national security via drone attacks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As currently operated, Predator drones are the ne plus ultra in centralized warfare; each drone attack has to be authorized by Obama himself, the drone is piloted via satellite link from a base in Nevada, and you can apparently sit in the situation room in the White House and watch the whole thing live. Hundreds of people have been blown to kingdom come by these attacks so far, in the name of a war on terror that Obama’s party used to denounce. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course that habit only makes sense if you’re willing to define young children and wedding party attendees as terrorists, which seems a little extreme to me. Leaving that aside, though, there’s a question that needs to be asked:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>is it working?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since none of the areas under attack are any less full of anti-American insurgents than they have been, and the jihadi movement has been able to expand its war dramatically in recent weeks into Libya and Mali, the answer is pretty clearly no.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However technically superlative the drones themselves are, the information that guides them comes via the notoriously static-filled channels of intelligence collection and analysis, and the decision to use them takes place in the even less certain realms of tactics and strategy; nor is it exactly bright, if you want to dissuade people from seeking out Americans and killing them, to go around vaporizing people nearly at random in parts of the world where avenging the murder of a family member is a sacred duty. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In both cases, and plenty of others like them, we have other alternatives, but all of them require the recognition that the best response to a failed policy isn’t a double helping of the same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That recognition is nowhere in our collective conversation at the moment. It would be useful if more of us were to make an effort to put it there, but there’s another factor in play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The center really cannot hold, and as it gives way, a great many of today’s political deadlocks will give way with it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Eliot Wigginton, the teacher in rural Georgia who founded the <i>Foxfire</i> project and thus offered the rest of us an elegant example of what can happen when a purely local educational venture is given the freedom to flower and bear fruit, used to say that the word “learn” is properly spelled F-A-I-L. That’s a reading lesson worth taking to heart, if only because we’re going to have some world-class chances to make use of it in the years ahead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of the few good things about really bad policies is that they’re self-limiting; sooner or later, a system that insists on embracing them is going to crash and burn, and once the rubble has stopped bouncing and the smoke clears away, it’s not too hard for the people standing around the crater to recognize that something has gone very wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In that period of clarity, it’s possible for a great many changes to be made, especially if there are clear alternatives available and people advocating for them. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the great crises that ended each of America’s three previous rounds of anacyclosis—in 1776, in 1861, and in 1933—a great many possibilities that had been unattainable due to the gridlocked politics of the previous generation suddenly came within reach. In those past crises, the United States was an expanding nation, geographically, economically, and in terms of its ability to project power in the world; the crisis immediately ahead bids fair to arrive in the early stages of the ensuing contraction. That difference has important effects on the nature of the changes before us. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Centralized power is costly—in money, in energy, in every other kind of resource.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Decentralized systems are much cheaper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the days when the United States was mostly an agrarian society, and the extravagant abundance made possible by a global empire and reckless depletion of natural resources had not yet arrived, the profoundly localized educational system I sketched out earlier was popular because it was affordable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even a poor community could count on being able to scrape together the political will and the money to establish a school district, even if that meant a one-room schoolhouse <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>with one teacher taking twenty-odd children a day through grades one through eight. That the level of education that routinely came out of such one-room schoolhouses was measurably better than that provided by today’s multimillion-dollar school budgets is just one more irony in the fire. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times">On the downside of America’s trajectory, as we descend from empire toward whatever society we can manage to afford within the stringent limits of a troubled biosphere and a planet stripped of most of its nonrenewable resources, local systems of the one-room schoolhouse variety are much more likely to be an option than centralized systems of the sort we have today.  That shift toward the affordably local will have many more consequences; I plan on exploring another of them next week.</span></span></div>

Those old textbooks you mention are gems. I remember once reading the high school graduation exam from Kansas in 1918 and it was simply astounding, the level of knowledge required.

Anyway, if something cannot last, it won't, even though it may do so for far longer than one thinks possible. Too bad so few are using this time to prepare.

If you suggest that education shouldn't be quantified in such a way you might hear them say, "Well, how else would you know that they learnt something?" So paper certification = capable person, and you end up with people who don't know English teaching English to kids.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c2896958450658643500 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 12:14 AM</a><br><br>

For the simple reason that it has by definition failed. If it had succeeded in properly educating people, the US and the world as a whole would not be in its current state. So while it might have been better than the current one, it was most definitely not good by any objective measure.<br><br>2) That education in the US has been terribly governed on the federal level is not a good argument against centralized control of education. It need not be terribly governed. <br><br>3) Fundamentally, it is a disastrous idea to leave so much control over education to people at the local level. This assumes that people locally are educated enough to make proper decisions what should be taught, and that's pretty much never the case, exactly the opposite. If it was left entirely to local communities to decide what should be taught, schools in more than half of the country would be teaching young earth creationism and all sorts of other anti-scientific nonsense. They already do that in fact, for that very same reason while that's not the case in any other non-Muslim, non-Third world country in the world as all those countries have completely centralized educational systems (and most of them give much better education to their students than the US has ever done). In fact, the rest of the world thinks that US education sucks so much precisely because it is so decentralized. Scientific facts simply can not be voted on by people on the local level who usually no nothing about it.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c4718979328807118403 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 2:05 AM</a><br><br>

Despite the over-centralisation of the US education system from my (limited) knowledge is that there is no federal standard set across the country, however that in the first place is a daunting task for a country the size of the US.<br><br>However developing countries such as India and China do have centralised standards which have been relatively successful at producing a large amount of trained citizens, although the education systems of both countries leaves a lot to be desired.<br><br>In the small nation-state of NZ where I live, the education system have been quite good in the past, and despite a national standard still remains relatively decentralised. However the centre-right coalition here is determined to emulate the US's draconian raise-results-or-get-fired style of dealing with teachers, and I predict it will have the same results here as it did in the US.<br><br>I think a national standard, for at least a state where intra-country migration (in labour and resource) happens, is absolutely essential. How else is a university supposed to know the relative capability difference between the kid from a rural town in Nebraska and one from an affluent neighbourhood in Boston? The means to achieve that national standard can be decentralised, as it was till now in NZ. In terms of a developing country or a small nation-state this makes much more sense. However, it is not necessary that the same formula would work in the US of now, let alone the deindustrialised, fragmented and energy-poor US of tomorrow.<br><br>YJV<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c3694988672534652263 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 2:36 AM</a><br><br>

In Britain we had something of a breakthrough in the 1960s and a brief flowering of more imaginative methods, especially for connecting with a then still very large and rightly sceptical working class. That did not last long and we have since copied standardised testing and management concepts from, guess who!

Sadly, to get full marks in most of our qualifications, children must parrot phrases <i>in the exact order that they were taught them</i> or get zero marks, which means, for example, that you can only quote Ohm's law one way round if you want to get any marks for knowing it, although it is an equation... this, according to an ex-teacher friend, who was puzzled by my dismay, is "to ensure uniformity in marking the papers!"

Fewer field trips, fewer non-testable activities in school, and a longer wait to begin music lessons (though I'm thankful they're offered at all!). All this is further complicated by the "diversity" in the classrooms, which means that undisciplined brats as well as children with genuine organic problems take up an inordinate amount of time in crowd control, reducing actual learning time. And my second-youngest, who's great at math, is burdened by having to learn two or three ways to work each problem, even though he understands how to do the work on the first try with the first method - just in case some other student needs alternative strategies.

It can be found in its entirety online for free.<br><br>Outside of Massachusetts, compulsory public schooling was largely imposed during the decades sandwiching the year 1900. As the contemporary sources cited by Gatto make clear, the purpose of this institution's establishment was not education, but social control. To quite a significant extent, in fact, the purpose of public schooling and its associated centralizing tendencies was explicitly to PREVENT education from taking place by means of public schooling. The system was deliberately devised in part to prevent certain kinds and levels of learning from taking place. <br><br>In this way, public schooling could be used to mold the kind of undifferentiated mass human being that the elites in a rising industrial society found congenial to their purposes. If the true purpose of the system is thus recognized, then centralization was in fact a very effective means of carrying it out.<br><br>In a similar way, the fact that Obama's drone murders make no sense as a means of waging a war on terror should only be seen to prove that this is not their real purpose. The tactical and strategic purpose of the drone strikes is to grab resources for the US. The fact that this in reality inflames terrorists is in a real sense a beneficial secondary effect in terms of the true aim of the drone strikes, since a certain amount of "blowback" is helpful in whipping up the kind of mass hysteria that renders increasing levels of violence in the service of securing resources more politically tractable.<br><br>Broadly speaking, my general point is this: Centralization makes a lot more sense when it is recognized that the stated purpose for it is usually not the real purpose.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c1705509257455695367 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 5:56 AM</a><br><br>

The problems in education, however, go back much farther than the creation of the US Department of Education. In my late thirties, I attempted to break into the field in the 1990's after encouragement from many friends who were teachers. <br><br>The certification process required the learning of so many acronyms that I told friends it left me with a severe case of acronymophobia. These were usually short hand for all the latest trendy methods and gimmicks that had been concocted by professors of education since the 1970's and sold to school boards or politicians as the latest answer to all their problems. These ideas also usually required new textbooks which text book publishers supported wholeheartedly, of course.<br><br>Our schools were already teaching to the test but with higher stakes of state funding involved. This was half a decade before NCLB. The major problem here is that most students have little incentive to do well on these tests since they don't affect their grades. That led to more gimmicks. Our principal, for example, learned that other districts were offering incentives like throwing pizza parties in order to get kids to even show up. <br><br>This and the general state of affairs in education led me to wonder how things had evolved the way they had. That led me ultimately to John Taylor-Gatto's book, "The Underground History of American Education." He also had many of the same questions I had. He was selected as “Teacher of the Year” in both the New York City system and for New York State. But things never got any easier for him even with this recognition. <br><br>The reason the Lincoln-Douglas debates put to shame anything that passes for a debate these days was not just the eighth grade education of the listeners, but their desire and need to be literate. Many of the listeners had no formal education whatsoever. There is even ample evidence that literacy in American had already reached it's peak well before the imposition of compulsory education in the mid 1800's promoted by “reformers” like Horace Mann who came back from a trip to Prussia much inspired by their highly centralized school system designed mainly to teach obedience and produce good soldiers.<br><br>Education is a good example of a “commons” but there is more involved than just the level of control over the system.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c1291465871173606676 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 6:07 AM</a><br><br>

From speaking with many school-age families, I believe that the one (max. two) child family has also very much changed education - parents don't have the "luxury" or even awareness to "change what's wrong" and then see if their next child has a better experience. (I remember going to school with the older siblings that my younger sisters and brother did - matched like bookends. Ah, the Irish, Polish and Italian families of the past!) They've put all there eggs in one basket (literally) and expect that basket to be perfect. Their expectations have an impact on the way the school system has changed, though I agree with you that centralization (that insane desire for "efficiency of scale" without the understanding of that process)has had a greater impact.

The constitution clearly delineates who is in charge of what and the provinces have been much more successful at vigorously defending their political territory during the 20th century than have the various states.<br>The only role the Federal government plays, generally, is the setting of standards and ensuring funding across the nation.

These school boards are locally elected, but paid for by the province. (They are supposed to funded by subscription on our tax forms, but since the government 'tops up' the funds out of general revenue, these distinctions are functionally meaningless.) There are also separate private (i.e. wholly non-government-funded) school boards, e.g. Jewish and Muslim, that fund and run their own schools. The only caveat is they must teach certain subjects to certain standards.<br>Education and Health Care are the two big-budget, hot-topic items for the provinces.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c6646879505307892702 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 6:51 AM</a><br><br>

While our small town has both a hospital and numerous doctor's offices, our insurance company mandates that we must travel to a city 30 miles away for our health care. I also have children in our town's public schools, whose policy it is that in order for an absence due to illness to be excused, a note from a doctor is required, a parent calling to let the school know that a child is sick is not sufficient. So, you can easily end up with a situation where, say, your elementary school student has the stomach flu. If you want this child's absence from school excused, you are expected to load up your vomiting child into your car and spend an hour driving them to see a doctor, spreading the germs to the other poor patients and workers in the doctor's office, all so that, while the doctor can do nothing for the illness, they can provide an excuse to the school. I would be hard pressed to come up with a more insane system.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c931930806233746537 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 7:01 AM</a><br><br>

Many local school districts have become dependent on outside money, whether it comes only from the state or from the Federal government by way of the state. Acceptance of that money brings with it strings attached (or maybe I should say, chains attached) that now the state or Federal government can dictate their standards.<br><br>The same is rampant in higher education (where I work). To participate in the offering of Federally backed financial aid to students means that you must now deal with accrediting agencies in much bigger ways than you did before. The regional accrediting agencies are forcing performance standards on higher education which are dictates also out of the Department of Education in Washington. What was once a trust that the education and degrees you provided were good and sufficient are now being micro-managed from afar, right down to having to assure identical notions of term length and contact hours in the classroom, and study expectations outside of the classroom.<br><br>I would love to see all of this disappear again (which it might as higher education implodes anyway with the loss of students). Much of my time as an administrator can be loosened up again to focus on providing the education itself, and not having to continually justify ourselves.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c5865208049376949989 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 7:20 AM</a><br><br>

Communication was difficult if not impossible, travel took long times, and folks of a particular culture or ethnicity normally remained in the same geographic area for their lifetimes. I don't disagree that kids then had a better grasp of the three R's, but there was no special education for special kids and no opportunity to explore the varied careers that are available today. Just how well did a farmer need to understand anything beyond the basics?<br><br>Today our world in much smaller and more nimble: we communicate instantly and inexpensively; travel can be done in hours as opposed to months and video-conferencing has replaced a great deal of travel. We are a mobile people today and think nothing of relocating nationwide which has given us a well-mixed society. Therefore, not only do we have the ability to centralize operations, but I think that centralization is necessary to provide an equal opportunity for all children to expereince the same level of educational opportunity.<br><br>If we have anyone or anything to blamce for the failure of our children's education, let's start at home -- we have uninvolved parents, mom works and isn't available to supervise homework and attend PTA meetings. What ever happened to room mothers? And let's take a swipe at our current culture as well - kids watch TV shows that portray the dad as a buffoon, unworthy of any respect. The media teaches our kids to have an attitude of "who give a sh** -- you can't make me do anything because I know my rights". That's why we have a "soundbite level of thinking" today.<br> Finally, regarding the use of drones, I struggle to see the difference between the crew of a big bomber plane dropping bombs and a soldier piloting an unmanned drone via a satellite link from a base in Nevada. Perhaps the only difference is the distance between the pilots and their targets? Does this make drones unethical? I doubt it.

But also the fact that while I've been in China the past two years, I've had the opportunity to learn a bit about the teaching profession as I got a crash course in teaching English as a second language. Through this experience, I've learned a lot about the Chinese education system, which basically consists of a lot of a rote memorization, and a lot of cramming before exams. Perhaps the fact that the majority of parents bring their children to tutors or some other education center outside of school reflects on how much the standardizing of education has accomplished. From personal experience, the kids can add, subtract, and recall any number of facts much faster then I, but when it comes to practical application of the things they've learned, of real world experiences .. it is sadly lacking. With this in mind, I'm scared to send my step-son into the education system here, and I recall from not that long ago how useless my education in American schools was, which led me to search for an alternative. There is home school, but that is not for everyone. There is also Waldorf education, something I think you've mentioned before, and something which I am discovering more and more to fit in with the grassroots changes, on a societal level, we'll need to have a brighter future. With the experiences I've gained here in China, I've been considering what I will do upon my return .. and perhaps it is not just coincidence you made this point at this time.

Most people working in the front-line operations of any organization are generally quite content to be left alone to get along with whatever they needed to do locally. But the people running these organizations, mostly alpha left-brain executive types, saw their mission in life as standardizing operations in the name of quality. IT systems, powered by plentiful energy, were key to enabling all of this. Without the IT, there would be no ability to take names and enforce standards. <br><br>As a just-out-of-college kid doing the automation work I thought I was contributing to the march of progress and quality. Efficiency and effectiveness was the mantra, and I was taken in by it all for quite a while. It took years for me to realize that pretty much anything rolled-out from the center by strong executive personalities rarely went well, and certainly never as advertised. All the industries I worked in – healthcare, energy utilities and government services – became more complex, expensive and unsustainable during this period of centralization and automation. <br><br>Perhaps it’s a nice example of the law of balance in action that deploying all of these IT systems led to technology becoming so pervasive in life that the Internet evolved. And the Internet, while a major enabler of centralization, is also a vehicle for decentralized expression, primarily through access to information and different narratives. <br><br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c7892650632469841701 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 8:50 AM</a><br><br>

The thought that followed right behind that was, "So what?"<br><br>A key feature of any decentralized system is diversity, and diversity is as much about boneheaded failures as it is about adaptive success: it's about posthumous Darwin Awards. You cannot prevent autonomous portions of a decentralized system from failing. That's how the classical model of evolutionary adaptation works. Not every adaptation is a positive adaptation: if it's negative enough, it kills the organism before it reproduces, and thus removes itself from the gene pool.<br><br>That's happening to the US as a whole right now: no centralized international authority is going to prevent the US from becoming a benighted, third-world backwater.<br><br>That's precisely what decentralization means, as you've pointed out. It obliterates the centralized, abstract commons (that is poorly managed, because its leadership is far away and not vested) and creates a local commons that might be better managed. <i>Or might not.</i> The point is, it's no one else's commons to manage.<br><br>So if Kansas wants to teach that Creationism is science, that pi has the value of 3.0, and that women cannot become pregnant through rape, it's their educational commons to ruin. Most competent teachers will flee the state, most bright children will flee the state, most jobs that require a bright workforce will flee the state.<br><br>The boards of education might figure out there's a problem: more likely, not.<br><br>This is a general downside of all decentralization, and isn't much commented-on. Relocalizing school systems means some school districts will have terrible schools. Relocalizing food-production will mean that some communities will starve. Relocalizing government will mean some governments will be miserable to live under.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c6968702862656714974 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 9:07 AM</a><br><br>

While *I* agree that this would be a good thing, I worry about the transition. In my community, many people are stressed already by the responsibility of feeding and housing their families. Most people don't know how to deal with being a responsibile school district voter, and they often don't have time or energy to learn. I know this sounds arrogant of me, and perhaps it is. Maybe I will be pleasantly surprised by the receptiveness of parents and other community members to the responsibility. I do know that there is a trend among people who are able, to move to an area with a well-reputed school district, rather than to try to help the schools improve in their home area. I wonder if this is a result of not knowing how to help, or of seeing the effort as more difficult or even futile.<br><br>On a more pleasant note, I once did a little reading on old school textbooks, and found a wonderful summary of 19th-century American education at http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?idno=00AEP6688M&amp;view=toc&amp;c=nietz . The full text of his work is posted there at the univerity's website, along with the full texts of a bunch of old textbooks themselves.<br><br>So how did the Department of Education come into existence, if its authority is unconstitutional? What motivated the people who created it? Was it an outcry from the populace, complaining that the people on the ground in many areas were failing their jobs? Was it a group of bureaucrats who were honestly trying to make supporting roles for themselves in a (however misguided) effort to help? Was it a simple, cynical power grab; was the old system's failure manufactured to justify the grab? Or perhaps it was seen as a logical continuation of an established pattern of federalizing power? My guess is that it was a combination of these things.<br><br>I'm not surprised to see the No Child Left Behind act brought up. The mandate that test scores must improve every year smacks of the myth of constant progress to me. There's no provision for statistical noise, no allowance for a particularly difficult class of kids one year, or particularly bad testing conditions, or anything like that. It's no surprise that cheating is rampant. And the people in the best place to detect cheating -- the school's administrators -- are the least motivated to report it. Sometimes they even instigate it. Beatings will continue until morale improves, I guess. <br><br>The American habit of using attack drones seems to be another example of the idea of the myth of the machine, one which is especially beloved of our military.<br><br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c6725783012220924810 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 9:49 AM</a><br><br>

One the one hand, schooling was compulsory until some reasonably high school-leaving age, as in the USA. On the other hand, schools would not admit a child to the first grade (normally at age 7) unless the child could already read and write. <br><br>This meant that parents were obliged to teach reading and writing to their child themselves, or else risk depiction as inept parents by their gossiping neighbours.

I don't know how you can respond to those, other than to point out that the system as-is does quite poorly in comparison to the decentralized system of the past.

I'd like to offer a few comments here, in the hopes that other persons living in Canada can offer more. <br><br>(1) I see literacy levels each year as a scorer for the Province of Ontario Education and Accountability Office (EQAO) circa-grade-10 compulsory literacy exam. I think that I am not breaking the terms of my employment by saying that EQAO demands are fairly modest, and that the kids for the most part do seem to rise to the rather modest challenge, and that the whole exercise is a bit depressing. I seem to recall press assessments putting Ontario into a reasonably good position internationally on literacy.<br><br>(2) Recent press has suggested that Ontario does worse, on the international scale, in maths and science than in literacy. <br><br>(3) My own 1991-September "frosh" cohort in University of Toronto, at least in my own tutorial room, was generally disenchanted. Their general feeling was that Ontario schools had been handing them Grade 12 physics marks in the high 90s while in reality preparing them poorly for UofT. <br><br>(4) My experience as a Nova Scotia pupil matriculating in 1970 (I became a 1991 UofT "frosh" in later middle age, having as a young man gone into humanities, at Canadian and British universities far from Toronto) was adverse. The Nova Scotia curriculum had at that time not a scrap of calculus. I am reasonably reliably informed that the former USSR, by contrast, started calculus in Grade 9.<br><br>(5) A friend of mine who left Leninland not long after the 1991 collapse was examined by Canadian immigration authorities to determine his academic placement. His USSR degree, in cybernetics and electronics - I think a three- or four-year degree - put him somewhere into Canadian graduate-school territory, albeit short of a completed PhD. <br><br><br>Signed, a little grimly,<br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo<br><br>Toomas dot Karmo at gmail dot com<br><br>www dot metascientia dot com<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c2354336119728481241 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 10:10 AM</a><br><br>

The local control factor means that the quality of education you receive is virtually a lottery based on your parent's ZIP code. Our balkanized habitation patterns based on class and income means the wealthy are able to move to exurbs and pool their resources while cities and legacy suburbs are starved of funds. This, in my experience, has been one the major overlooked factors driving suburban sprawl in the U.S. Where I live, it's pretty <i>de rigeur</i> for uban couples to move to a distant exurb once they begin breeding, because their kids need to be "in a good school district" to succeed and remain comfortably middle class (what every American wants for their kids). To get into these school districts, they often have to buy much more house that they can afford, so I believe this system was also a major factor in the housing bubble. If you ask people why they bought such expensive homes, often times it was to be in a good school district for their kids.<br><br>Many European countries have national standards yet achieve good results, and here I'm primarily thinking of the Nordic countries (Germany, Finland, etc.) and East Asian countries (Japan, Korea, etc.). This ensures a uniform quality of good education for all citizens no matter your place of residence or social class. Not so in America. As others here have pointed out, these countries are typically much smaller than the U.S. I think a state-level redistrubution would be a good idea, but the extreme locality of U.S. education I think is problematic. But I admit, I'm far from an expert in these matters.<br><br>I think the dumbing-down of American education is a feature not a bug - politicians want a dumb electorate, to paraphrase George Carlin, just smart enough to do their jobs, but not smart enough to question what they're doing. There's an attempt already to deny student loans for anyone not in college for strictly vocational purposes. I think we can all agree that NCLB is an abomination designed to further this agenda. Many American schools have become little more than pre-prison holding pens.<br><br>I think American leaders recognize that the vast majority of future new jobs will be low-wage McJobs, and are intentionally pursuing an economic model of a large workforce of poorly educated quasi-serfs competing against one another for bargain-basement wages (unlimited immigration is also a part of this) with good education reserved for elites, rather than the human-development model of a small, highly educated populace engaged in high-value activities pursued by places like South Korea or Denmark. I'm sure you would point out that the latter model anticipates a future of plentiful fossil fuels, however.<br><br>FYI - Why Finland's Education System Is the Best in the World (Business Insider): <br>http://www.businessinsider.com/finlands-education-system-best-in-world-2012-11?op=1<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c7827755340101808870 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 11:06 AM</a><br><br>

On the first day of class in freshman year, he made things completely clear: "The county stops at my door." He had no time for the standardized anything. In later years of my high school when the school boards started demanding detailed plans from teachers of how they would teach to the standards and tests, he simply wrote very long obfusticating reports that he knew no-one in the bureaucracy would make it through such that he could do pretty much whatever he wanted. And nobody in the school dared encroach on him because they knew how good he was, rules or no.<br><br>Having been a Navy communications technician in the fifties before teaching for at least 35 years, he knew his stuff practically as well as abstractly. And he knew the history and theory behind *everything*. He fought a rearguard action against the encroaching state and county school system before finally retiring shortly after I graduated, and then worked to keep the school program sane from outside. Dedicated people like him are rare gems these days; my class and I all owe him for a job well done.

Hunting down imaginary cartoon villains called "far-right" is latest Stahanovian endeavor by Powers Behind the Throne to make people think righteously. This strangely ethereal and shadowy "far-right" happens to be linked by media with one and only political party opposing centralization and deeper integration of EU. What an fascinating coincidence. <br><br>While particulars vary from country to country, I believe this bizarre climate of fairytale politics is familiar concept for many readers of this blog.<br><br>In Western Europe contraction and separation of expectations from reality has lead to fast tightening of political climate; labyrinthine demands of political correctness are such that no ordinary person without university degree cannot open his/her mouth anymore about "hot issues" without insulting some sensitive pressure group. Liberalism where mouth of citizens is sewed shut; history truly has sense of irony.<br><br>This situation is contradictory compared to original idea of liberal democracy. If you have to watch out everything you say, there cannot be free debate; without free debate, there cannot be true democracy. <br><br>This kind of situation also tends to make people more extreme in their opinions; modest, compromising versions of different political views slowly wither away, while people adopt more black-and-white positions; this is not good thing. <br><br>Elites want deeper integration; ordinary people do not. So every trick is used to coerce majority of people to submission. It astonishes me deeply how fast European Union has degenerated to this perverse anomaly of true democracy it is today. <br><br>Only one solution is left for "good" people: full integration of European nations into harmonious bureaucracy without ethnic or national boundaries. The inconvenient reality where most persons below certain class line actually WANT to be divided by these divisions is just ignored and broomed under carpet.<br><br>Of course this purely elitist dream will fail spectaculary if fully implemented to reality. Hubris is one of oldest sins of mankind; without it, many great tragedies would have never been told. <br><br>So if we are going to get more localized environment somewhere down on the road, I believe we must pass through very dark times before it. As old system of doing things fails repeatedly, answer from the mighty ones is bigger doses of same medicine. <br><br>More centralization, more regulations, more control. <br><br>People have been kicked to earthly paradise by central administration apparatus couple of times in history; this round of bureaucratic commands instead of grassroot democracy shall not offer any better results.<br><br>So I agree with you; empowerment of people and rebirth of true local communities is what prevents poor future turning into monstrous future; but first we shall see last attempt by ancien regime to "correct" it all. And the historic period when ancien regime of Western Europe and her old colonies tries to "correct" things shall be very, very insane time to live through, and it is right in front of us. Before any new ways of doing things can be brought in, that storm must be faced.

Centralization sells itself by promising a better outcome for all; what it usually produces, as in the present case, is a bad outcome for all. <br><br>YJV, why not let the university make its own decision about which of the students it wants, on the basis of something more meaningful than easily-faked multiple choice tests? Somehow, back in the day, universities managed to get by just fine without national standards. <br><br>Cam, true enough -- it's interesting to note that historically, bureaucracies gradually stop doing their jobs, and have to be circumvented by the establishment of new bureaucracies, which then stop doing their jobs and have to be circumvented with new bureaucracies...rinse and repeat, and you've got today's US government. <br><br>Genesis, to my mind the home schooling movement is a very promising thing -- it's among the few really successful modes of dissensus in today's society.

I think the decline in education can be ascribed to television and other attention grabber. Entertainment at the time of the L-D debate was limited to reading and conversation for most of the population.... compare to 50's and on. <br><br>When I had kids in school, involved in PTA, etc., calling kid's parents to round up help for a Valentine Party, Field Day, etc. was easy in early 80's... trying in late 80's was like night and day. Mom's were at work, not in and out of the classroom as previously. Something to do with the economic condition... wages not rising since 70's?<br><br>I was amazed when I asked if best teachers would be assigned to the struggling kids.. and was told, no, they were rewarded with the class of advanced kids. ??<br><br>I also ran across a program called HOTS - Higher Order Thinking Skills. 'Behind' students had 30 mins per week in a small class, with a generic problem to solve, and LOTS of attention from the teacher... and not allowed to quit until they had achieved the solution. Results leaked into more achievement in subject classes. <br><br>I saw the local school district fail to adopt successful pilots like this, but enact others, which faded away after a few years, with no final report, etc. When more money was available as levies passed, I saw management swell but classrooom size did not shrink. I think the problem is with the local management and some aspects of the unions. Yes, voters should pay attention and vote better boards.... but that's another result of every parent working... the economic conditions, and the larger cultural manipulation by the boob tube messaging.<br><br>Back in 1968, in a 101 PolySci class, I learned one thing that surprised me.... more corruption at local level than the federal level. I don't think that has changed! I also learned of our founder's idea that competition for power might keep the field fairly level, which doesn't seem to be working as planned....financial gorillas seem to be hanging off the 'chandelier'.<br><br>To end, in the late 80's, I began randomly asking teenagers I ran across what they learned about voting in Civics class. If they remembered (or even had a half semester of Civics) I was astounded to hear the same word over and over in reply..."Uh, it's a PRIVILEGE." I was taught it is a duty... but curriculI must have changed since the 60s.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c3629413754307432410 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 3:07 PM</a><br><br>

The phrase "bedsheet-bedecked Southern crackers who populate the hate speech of the left" does not mean that the crackers in question belong to the left. Break it down, starting from the end of the sentence -- that's usually the best way to parse a complex English phrase. So we have: <br><br>"the left" -- yes, that's the Democrats and those people further in a liberal-to-radical direction than they are. <br><br>"the hate speech of the left" -- hate speech can be defined as bigoted utterances that classify people negatively according to ethnic, cultural, or other stereotypes. People on the left engage in this as much as people on the right; it's just that they use different stereotypes. <br><br>"who populate the hate speech of the left" -- that clues you in that we're about to talk about the stereotypes that people on the left use when they engage in hate speech. <br><br>"Bedsheet-bedecked Southern crackers" -- that's the stereotype used by people on the left who engage in hate speech: poor white Southerners ("crackers" is a slang term for them) who are presumed to belong to the Klan (thus "bedsheet-bedecked"). <br><br>Got it? You're welcome. <br><br>Cathy, that's a fascinating suggestion. <br><br>News, one of the odd things that can happen in an overcentralized system is that the center continues to push for more overt control, while the states or other subgroups are quietly extracting themselves. That happens because too much centralization makes it impossible for the people running the center to notice that the whole system is slipping through their fingers. More on this in a later post. <br><br>Renaissance, that seems sensible enough -- and not at all unlike the system we used to have in the US.<br><br>Edde, don't worry, I'll have some other suggestions in a forthcoming post!<br><br>Gretchen, it's bizarre demands like this, ramifying outward on a larger and larger scale, that bring complex systems crashing down in a hurry. Hang onto your hat. <br><br>Kevin, that's an excellent point.

As I said, plenty of factors have contributed to the mess that is modern American education. <br><br>Cat, the ideas you're offering have been the conventional wisdom in American education for more than fifty years now, and have given us the steadily worsening mess we've got today. They haven't worked, they're not working, and there's no reason to think that they will work any better in the future than they do today. Doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results, is a functional definition of insanity, you know. <br><br>Prizm, Waldorf is an option, and there are other alternative teaching systems out there. A lot depends on what you can access in the community. Glad to have helped spark some thoughts!<br><br>Jetfire, yes, starting at the level of the local school board is one way to do it, though some pressure on state and federal representatives to get state and federal bureaucrats to back off a bit would also be needed. I'll have some other suggestions as we proceed. <br><br>Yupped, I've come to think that computer technology is going to play a massive role in the decline and fall of industrial society. It allows centralized control to go so much further, and thus amplifies the inherent failures of overcentralized systems so much more dramatically, than any previous system ever could. <br><br>Ghung, ouch. I hadn't heard about that. <br><br>Joseph, exactly. If you give people the freedom to try new things, some of those new things are going to fail. Others may succeed beyond anybody's wildest dreams. That's the principle of dissensus -- accepting the fact that some people are going to do things you don't like is the price you pay for having the freedom to follow your own path, and the evolutionary flexibility to find new options for everyone. <br><br>Nano, if they're blaming the system at least they're putting the blame in the right place. <br><br>James, that's why I was talking specifically about education. I discussed in my earlier post about relocalization how easily the US states could function as quasi-independent entities. <br><br>Moshe, you're oversimplifying what I've said considerably. I've discussed at quite some length how political change can take place in a hurry -- did you read, for example, the fictional narrative last October, which had the US going completely to pieces over a two-year span? My point is that such crises aren't the end of the world; in the present case, they're part of the long, ragged, fractally structured process by which a civilization grinds to its end -- a process that involves a lot of sudden localized breakdowns, from the individual scale to that of whole nations.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c8736103547658564791 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 3:52 PM</a><br><br>

As you've seen, I've already had a bunch of people waving around the Scary Flyover State Christians (tm) as the reason why we can't have local control of schools. My response remains the one I mentioned back in the post about relocalization: if you want a democratic society, you have to accept the fact that some people will do things you don't like. <br><br>Rlb, the constitution does not give that power to the federal government. That means that the population of each state has the right, through their elected representatives or directly via initiative and referendum, to decide who makes those standards. <br><br>Elsie, fascinating. It seems to work!<br><br>Jon, I've met a number of elderly people who had their schooling in a one-room schoolhouse.

One was to "educate the masses" in the Adam Smith Wealth of Nations way. The other was to "socialize the masses" in a kind of enforced-mythology, Soviet-like propaganda way.<br><br>The former benefits from localization. The latter definitely benefits from centralization.<br><br>A third trend I've since noticed has been the educational system used as a holding area for excess work force. <br><br>As you've pointed out, students who graduate from high school at age eighteen today are demonstrably dumber as a group than the students who graduated from eighth grade at age fourteen in 1880. So it begs the question of why it now takes so much longer to produce an inferior product. Not the "whom shall we blame?" why, but the "how is this acceptable?" why. What seems pretty obvious to me is that as a society, we don't have anything else for young people to do.<br><br>My late father (b. 1913) didn't finish high school, which was common in the late 1920's, and nearly no one then held a college degree. The pre-work holding area has now expanded to one's mid-twenties and includes a baccalaureate: nearly one-third of the normal human lifespan. The four-year undergraduate degree has typically become a six-year degree. The three-to-four-year post-graduate PhD of my childhood is now routinely seven years: after the obligatory post-docs, my son-in-law and his wife are just starting their (assistant) professorships in their mid-30's.<br><br>In the past two decades, I've noticed a particularly perverse form of this: people who "go back to school" to get a degree. In many cases, to get <i>yet another</i> degree. A surprising number of these aren't sure what degree to get. They're partly gambling that this piece of paper will be more valuable than the last, but there's another feature I've noticed: "free" money. Faced with the choice between locking down two or three part-time McJobs just to pay the rent, or taking out a (livable) student loan and going back to school -- though you're hocking your future earnings on a Hail Mary pass -- a lot of people choose to borrow. I'm not sure I blame them. As borrowed money goes, it isn't that bad: you can (or could -- I've been out of it for a while) defer payments until you get a good job, and interest rates have been artificially low, and fixed. In the past, no one was going to come around and break your kneecaps.<br><br>I'm commenting on a trend, BTW, not on individuals. It's different when people want and need specific training, and they've figured out the path. My wife is one of those, as is my nephew. So I'm not trying to generalize to the exceptions.<br><br>From a systems perspective, this could be viewed as a form of national welfare. But it isn't.

I have never experienced anything of the sort in my field though. And eventually, the truth prevails - JMG gave plate tectonics as an example, well, as far as I know no respectable geologist today does not accept the theory of plate tectonics so it would seem to me that that the self-correcting mechanisms of science worked in that case, as they usually do. <br><br>Also, it is a bit of a strawman argument to point out how far science is from the pure intellectual ideal of what it should be at the cutting edge when it is not the cutting edge we're talking about here. I pointed out in my original post that if left on their own people will choose to indoctrinate their children into believing thing that contradict scientific truths that have very close to zero chance of ever being overturned and they will choose not to educate them into other similarly well established scientific theories because they don't see the need for that. <br><br>I fully agree that students graduating from high school today are dumber than those in the past. But I don't think the stretching of the time it takes to get a PhD is due to that. That's for the simple reason that the amount of knowledge one has to acquire to be able to be productive in pretty much any scientific field today is much larger than it was today and independently from that, the amount of work that goes into a typical scientific paper these days is an order of magnitude larger than in the not so distant past. What was a <i>Nature</i> or <i>Science</i> paper back in the days is often a supplemental figure today. Yes, the tools have advanced in that period and it's a lot easier to do a lot of things but humans still have only two hands, two eyes and one brain, and the day still has only 24 hours. <br><br>In some fields this has reached truly grotesque dimensions. You may have noticed some of the popular articles that reported on the proposed proof of the ABC conjectures last year that is so complicated that they can't find anybody who is able to understand it without spending years studying it. <br><br>The complexity has simply grown too much but that's inevitable. The solution for the time being is not to decry the sorry state of high school education but to push a lot of the material down the educational ladder. The human brain is a lot more perceptive to new knowledge when it's young while currently (and in times past) kids basically waste their time in school because they are not challenged or pushed hard enough (I myself view my time in school exactly that way - I could have learned so much more if there had only been the conditions around me and the someone to push me harder). Of course, we've done exactly the opposite, but if you give parents even more control, things will go even further in that direction<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c2428703785826469035 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 8:45 PM</a><br><br>

I especially appreciate that you correctly identify what "accountability" actually means in an education context. The whole blame-the-teacher sentiment (which I see even cropped up in the comments here) bemuses me: we live in a society that does not respect or reward learning, with mothers and fathers both too busy on the work-money-consume treadmill to engage their children, with new electronic distractions that have unexpected cognitive effects, and with the teachers' primary mandate to make sure the kids pass the standardized test. Given all that, I think my kids' public school teachers have actually done a decent job. <br><br>As my kids move from middle school in to high school, I vividly see how much of secondary and higher education is a big game where the members of the Outer Party (whoops - middle class) jump through lots of hoops to secure their children's future class position. Unfortunately, the game seems to produce neurotic kids more than anything else, and actual learning takes a back seat. <br><br>Hey, with all the recommendations made to look at old text books and readers and such, I wonder if yesteryear's elementary, high school, and college student is strictly comparable to today's. A much higher percentage of the population goes to college now than in 1930, don't ya think? Could it be that the average high school graduate of 1948 represents a smaller, more intelligent fraction of the population than the average high school graduate of 2012, and if so, that explains some of the drop in standards?<br><br>Certainly there's been some educational inflation - people going to college to get degrees in something that didn't used to require a degree. Journalism is a prime example, and I went to a college-prep seminar recently where a young lady described her search for the right "hospitality" degree program - that's right, a college degree for innkeeping. Anyway, I could see how such educational inflation vacuums up a higher percentage of the population into higher ed, with a corresponding decrease in the learning level.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c343777915108852339 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 9:28 PM</a><br><br>

If you compare the problems given at the International Mathematics or Physics Olympiad 40 years ago with those given today, you would be amazed at how much the bars has been raised. The same applies for university exams at least at the institutions I am familiar with, which admittedly may not be a representative sample of the general situation. But that's the very top of the educational pyramid while in the same time the amount of reading students do in school has dropped significantly, the amount of reading they do independently has shrunk to basically zero, the enforcement of whatever educational standards exist has become more and more lax because nobody has any real incentive to fail anyone, and finally, an educational philosophy that promotes the deeply misguided idea that it is somehow bad for students to expose them to too much information has become widespread.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c3252013110828151507 title="comment permalink">2/7/13, 11:11 PM</a><br><br>

Largely, people seem to miss the central point that if they have children or young adults within the educational system then it is their combined responsibilities and no one else’s. Lamenting your children’s education situation here is a pointless activity. You cannot outsource these responsibilities!<br><br>I have both an undergraduate and a post graduate degree from a reputable university and can assure readers that when an assignment was requested as it inevitably was, the required reading was listed. If this situation does not in itself make marking standardised and hence easier for lecturers and tutors I don't know what would do it. Exams were no different.<br><br>Critical thinking skills are to be developed outside of the educational system as it currently stands.<br><br>The other thing that no one has touched here other than our blog host is that in order to learn, we need to have a culture that is not so harsh on failure. For if we do not allow ourselves to fail occasionally and freely admit those failings, then, we will not learn from those mistakes.<br><br>Finally, while I'm up for a good rant, those commenters saying how good the education system is in their respective countries (eg. Canada and Europe seem to be particularly prone to this over inflated opinion) seem to forget how many dramas those particular countries are in right now. Alberta Tar sands anyone, how about 50%+ youth unemployment in Spain, Greece and Portugal? What about a double dip recession in the UK? What about the current diaspora in Ireland which is just another in a very long history?<br><br>As to the commenter talking down the Indian education system, he obviously had not had the conversation I had with a very affable Indian gentleman yesterday. The gentleman was trying to talk me into outsourcing my job whilst collecting fees on their work as a middleman. Truly, I looked into the future and it was bleak... The conversation that ensued in relation to how the growth model is flawed truly perplexed him, but I give him 10 out of 10 for audacity.

However, as the first generation of 'No Child Left Behind' are hitting college, what little I am hearing isn't positive. <br><br>There seems to be a sharp uptick in the number of students who are unable to read critically or deeply.

I have to say that many hidden factors are also driving success of Finnish school. We enjoyed very homogenous culture right to the end of last millennium. Even political parties were highly ceremonial because people voted them based on their class background: Rural Union (later Center Party) got votes from farmers, Social Democrats or People's Democratic Union got votes from proletariat and National Coalition got votes from bourgeois. So back then, you knew approximate results before there was any elections most of the time. <br><br>This keen sense of one's place in the world was reflected in school and during military draft service. While I was in the school or army, there was many unwritten codes of conduct. You kind of knew beforehand who was going to be officer (no People's Democrats allowed)or who was going to university or trade school. Many times it had nothing to do with abilities, background mattered a lot in certain things. But everyone got good education, and no one was left behind. Everybody had a place. <br><br>Growing myself inside this highly predictable and homogenous environment, I was totally ignorant about it's nature as a child or youngster. Only after I had seen other parts of world through my work, have I understood how unique our country is.<br><br>This cultural bloc has been breaking down since late nineties, especially in the big cities. We are experiencing here right now first wave of so called white flight, as parents in big cities are getting their children out from schools where there are many immigrant students. Reasons for this behavior are obvious for any sane parent; you just have to look how messed up Swedish big cities are today to wake up your parental instincts. Roland Huntford spoke words of truth in his book "New Totalitarians", and now it is time to harvest fruits of those seeds in our western neighbor.<br><br>At the same time decline of teacher's authority is major issue here, in the old times teachers were true authority figures, less so today. As in most cases when leftist-liberal and progressive ideas are implemented to real world, result has been chaos, cruel bullying and law of the jungle in those schools where progressive ideas have been taken more seriously.<br><br>But apart from these two factors, our educational system is doing good job, largely thanks to our homogenous population.

Centralized heath care<br>2.Federal gun confiscation<br>3. National ID card<br>4. Centrally planned and controlled economy, with cash outlawed.<br>5.

The plans of globalists are for global central control, and they won't stop until they get there.<br><br>I believe Peak Oil caught these guys by surprise, but they have long trained to never let a good crisis go to waste. If anything, Peak Oil has accelerated their time-frame.<br><br>I have long believed true freedom lies in locally controlled communities. To maintain some form of freedom, these communities have to be further subdivided into autonomous and independent units of unbreakable cohesion. The only form that cohesion can possibly take is blood. Families are the final independent level of local government. A large extended family, its members well armed and jealous for the honor of their line is the last and final bastion of freedom.<br><br>Such a family, whose members are sworn, not by oaths, but by genetics, to uphold their collective honor, is a formidable weapon. Communities of such families act as checks and blances upon each other, and thus keep the possibility of sociopaths and psychopaths from seizing power.<br><br> The only way to destroy the family is to remove the members from the land, subvert their morals, and disperse them into urban settings, where the family can have little or no validity.

In Herefordshire there is a policy to close small rural schools as they are considered too costly to heat, maintain and employ teachers. Small rural schools generally perform better than urban schools for a number of reasons. If a village school is closed then parents are more likely to drive their children to school, but this is not considered in the decision to close. One school has decided to keep going despite the county council’s decision to close it. Here is the link to Dilwyn Primary School.

I've passed this one along to a friend who, among other things, teaches middle school. I hope she'll see fit to weigh in.<br><br>Sacrifice is on my mind today (and as luck would have it my captcha challenge is "sessymen"), and I think it might be relevant to a couple of your responses...<br><br>1. JMG to Toomas, re: this is not Estonia: clearly, but is there a bit of American Exceptionalism showing? I'm sure you'd agree community cohesion is something worth having in the future, and that service, (revealed) secrets and (blood) sacrifice are the most popular practices to that end, but the latter in particular seems atavistic to modern, effete Western sensibilities (with few but notable exceptions). Holding a community responsible and "accountable" (to their peers!) for the satisfactory completion of an educational prerequisite sets a rough floor for the amount of adult guidance and scholastic investment a child receives and seems a less wasteful and destructive sacrifice than most traditions to date have to offer. A hard sell in a culture already inclined toward anti-intellectualism and distrust, but if such a social institution manages to stick for a few years the beneficial positive feedbacks could keep it stuck for generations.<br><br>2. JMG to Escape, re: inability to find local people of skill: It is hard to find light sweet crude at $10/bbl, isn't it? Plenty of WTI at $100, but lacking any sense of duty whatsoever, they don't care to invest in cracking (training) and, seeing themselves as different in kind from labor, are demanding labor "disciplined" enough to absorb the externalized losses/costs of the moment without complaint or recompense (witness the rise of "independent contractors" who are neither except on paper). Employers want to hire someone with something to lose, and in true corporate toddler fashion, believe more is better.<br><br>Loch Wade, actually, I suspect they *don't* want central control -- that necessarily requires giving a little occasionally without a clearly consequential, quantifiable return, and that cramps the corporate toddlers' style. They just want control tightly distributed amongst themselves and a set of rules that suits them.<br><br>(Never attribute to conspiracy that which can be adequately explained by an iterated game with a skewed payoff matrix.)<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c5507829998276144045 title="comment permalink">2/8/13, 12:22 PM</a><br><br>

The younger classes were "open classroom," the high school was run much like graduate student seminars (though I had no idea at the time), with the teacher leading open discussion of the subject for the day, and a lot of hands-on work wherever it was appropriate. I learned calculus at the age of 14, as well as how swing a hammer and frame a wall. The student-teacher ratio probably averaged about 8:1. Teachers did not all have certifications; many were escapees from grad school. The only standardized tests we ever took were the SATs, needed by those who were college-bound. We didn't even receive grades, just written paragraph-long evaluations of our performance. The students included those who would have been classed as "gifted," "learning disabled," and "discipline cases" by the mainstream schools, all side-by-side in the same classes. And in spite of all this unconventionality and lack of official stamps-of-approval, some of us were accepted into top-tier Ivy League schools (yes, that means Harvard). Others became auto mechanics after graduation. As a child of a divorced single mother, I also think it was very positive for me that many of the teachers were men in an era where this was not common (and give the time frame, many of them looked rather like me and JMG do now...). <br><br>So even though I worry about loss of large-scale oversight of education (for typical reasons -- religion replacing science, ingrained racism and sexism, cultural hegemony and the tyranny of the majority, etc.), my own very positive experiences with childhood eduction were actually the product of a school that was far from the mainstream and had near 100% autonomy in its choices of teachers, materials, and methods. So I really don't know what to think about this.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c8277071683468377471 title="comment permalink">2/8/13, 4:37 PM</a><br><br>

That word implies an absolutism that is inherently unscientific. Most of these "truths" have not been directly observed, nor are they even observable. No one can go back 4.6 billion years and say "Yep, there it is, that's the earth coalescing from the Solar Nebula." We can observe processes and phenomena in the present day, and we can observe patterns in the world as it exists now, and from that we can infer how we believe these patterns came to be, hypothesizing a past that uses the processes we have observed to fill in the huge amount that we will never be able to observe. Using words like "truth" just invites comparison to and attack from religions that have a very different sense of what that word means. <br><br>I actually wish that this empirical rather than revealed nature of scientific knowledge was taught more explicitly at an earlier age. Kids have scientific "truths" "revealed" to them, then they get scriptural "truths" "revealed" to them, and how are they supposed to know the difference? Then as they get more advanced, they are re-taught these "truths" in more complex forms that often contradict the "truths" they were taught earlier. It isn't really until post-graduate education that they actually begin to teach science the way it really exists, as a process of discovery and reinvention, and a collection of "consensus best theories," always evolving, never cast in stone no matter how long established they may be.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c787255220467043038 title="comment permalink">2/8/13, 10:07 PM</a><br><br>

It's funny, seeing some comments here about the horror of leaving schools to teach Creationism. I'm not a believer in Creationism myself---not religious at all, wasn't raised that way---but I'm a little unsympathetic to the idea that we must root our education in scientific materialism. We've largely done that, and how well are we living in the world? Science is a fantastic tool, but I'd be hard pressed to claim we've used it very well as a species.<br><br>So would scientific materialism allow us to live better in the world than fundamental Christianity? I have no idea, and I'm a little amazed at how many people seem certain of the answer considering our current realities. Similarly, might other core beliefs arise as the foundation of a future education and culture that helps us to live well in this world? No doubt they will eventually, out of simple necessity.<br><br>I've kind of settled into this idea that this desperate focus on which beliefs are correct is extremely unhelpful. What beliefs will help us live well and sustainably in the world? If they do that, than they're worthy. If not, I don't see how they're all that helpful. What is "truth," anyway, and what is it's importance? Again, I think how we live under our assumptions prove the validity of those assumptions far more than whatever we've come to define as objective truth.<br><br>I don't know, I guess I just think that the point of us being here isn't to become all-knowing dieties with the entirety of the cosmos figured out, but to be a healthy part of the ecosystem and to take in the joy that comes with that.

School prayer was banned only some 50 years ago, and that's just one small thing in the bigger scheme of things. Education does not happen entirely in schools, quite the opposite, what happens at home is a lot more important and when the majority of the population holds creationist beliefs of one from or the other, that they teach a watered down version of evolution in schools is largely irrelevant. Also note that while schools in the US are not allowed to promote religion (a rule that in practice is very often violated), they are also not allowed to attack religion (which never really happens anyway). It's not much better in the rest of the world - there is no need to discuss Muslim countries, but even the formerly communist states, one of which I come from, where atheism was nominally the official state doctrine, were doing a horrible job at promoting a scientific worldview. Because it is not sufficient to say "There is no God", you have to also develop critical thinking skills and that was never even attempted. <br><br>2) If we are to live in anything remotely approaching a sustainable way, people need to understand where humans fit in the ecosystems of the planet and how those ecosystems work. My guess is that JMG will argue that you don't need science do achieve that understanding and that druid wizardry, etc., have already provided it before science even appeared. I strongly disagree - you may get an intuitive feel of the connections between the parts of the ecosystem on the local level in such a way, but not the kind of understanding we currently have about how the world as a whole works, and even on the local level, we know better. And that is a result of scientific research. <br><br>3) It very much matters what people believe. I find it hard to understand how anyone can think the words "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it" have absolutely nothing to do with the current mess we're in. The fact is, creationist beliefs, whether of the Christian or Muslim kind are in practice incompatible with a sustainable, steady state society. They are not incompatible in principle, if the relevant passages of the books are ignored, but that's the reality of the mindset of the people holding such beliefs at present. If such beliefs are not thoroughly eradicated from the face of the planet, the predictable will happen - due to their numeric superiority, and the strength and conviction those beliefs give them, those people will overrun everyone else and that will be the end of whatever small pockets of transition, localization, etc. movements trying to change people's way of life in the right direction. Finally, it is always preferable that people do not hold demonstrably false beliefs, and there is not a single religion out there, which is not demonstrably false.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c1663850326288573764 title="comment permalink">2/9/13, 5:27 PM</a><br><br>

One mother went back in and baked a large plate of chocolate-chip chocolate cookies for all. Later my wife and I invited everyone in to sit around out wood-stove and enjoy more cookies, some hot chocolate, and also very high-quality sipping rum (with or without ginger beer) for the grown-ups who wanted some.

It just came about spontaneously, as have other such shared jobs of work on our block in the past. Nor was there any particular ideology that we all share, or any sense of stern duty. <br><br>What we share, instead, is as simple as a single block of an ordinary city street. Most of the young families moved into our about the same time (within a three-year period) as older homeowners died or moved into assisted living. Our neighborhood works -- such things happen of themselves here -- simply because we all have gotten to know one another and we all happen to like one another. We *like* doing things with one another. Also, common interests draw us into shared tasks, for example planting young trees up and down the block. <br><br>We have also all shared our email addresses with one another, so it's easy to talk together on line.<br><br>The most important factor of all, I think, is that the preschoolers all like one another a lot, and they play together in a sort of loose pack whenever they can. This shared play binds their families together.<br><br>Individuals can and do make a difference, of course, in a neighborhood, but in our neighborhood they do so only by very small-scale acts. <br><br>For example, the family that owns the snow-blower let it be known that anyone on the block could borrow it. A couple of years ago the husband (who is in his 60s) dug the whole sidewalk out on both sides. Running that big noisy machine looked like a lot fun to some of the younger fathers that day, so they asked him if they could have a turn at the controls, and it just took off from there.<br><br>The young mother who baked cookies today did it just because she felt like doing something for her neighbors who dug the whole block out. We made hot chocolate and had a fire in our wood stove simply because we like to see our neighbors come and visit, and this was as good an excuse as any. And so forth . . .<br><br>I think this sort of thing works better and more smoothly than any planned neighborhood organization. <br><br>Some of it is luck: we all happen to get along, and there are enough preschoolers to form a pack. But it's also true that one makes one's luck as one goes along: subtle pushes, just the right amount of force at just the right time and place set the wheel to turning far more smoothly than brute force ever can. And that is where small acts by individual neighbors make all the difference. <br><br>It is very clear by now that if serious trouble ever comes our way, we will all be looking out for one another. We didn't plan to at the beginning. It just came about, and it is all the stronger for not having been planned.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c2331354367256303420 title="comment permalink">2/9/13, 5:31 PM</a><br><br>

He's a Christian, and he's made some very beautiful arguments for sustainability and proper living in the world that are rooted in that religion. "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it" does not have to be taken literally. The Bible does not have to be taken literally. Throughout human history, a variety of religions have been used in bad and good ways, much as scientific materialism has been used in bad and good ways. It can become understood in a distorted way that leads to destructive behavior and it can be understood in holistic ways that lead to good behavior.<br><br>There have been cultures in the past that have lived relatively sustainably on the earth without scientific materialism. And we have had cultures since the advent of scientific materialism that live unsustainably. That doesn't tells me that it's impossible to live sustainably under scientific materialism or that it's impossible to live unsustainably under any other religion, but it's quite clear that unsustainable living can happen under scientific materialism and sustainable living can happen outside of scientific materialism.<br><br>I'm interested in theory, sure, but I'm a bit more interested in what we've seen through actual application. So far, I haven't been impressed with the societies that have developed under scientific materialism. And it seems that some more impressive societies have developed outside of that paradigm. That tells me that scientific materialism isn't a panacea--and that, indeed, we have yet to be provided any evidence that it works at all in creating sustainable societies. Again, that doesn't mean that I think it can't work, but I'm more impressed by actual proof. And again, I actually think the scientific process is a fantastic tool, but I don't think we've put it anywhere close to the best use.<br><br>In short, I'm not convinced by your certainty that it's the only way we can live sustainably in the world, and I honestly don't know why you think that. I'm sure this doesn't change your mind, but there you go.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c2401355568181485879 title="comment permalink">2/10/13, 12:51 AM</a><br><br>

I believe those people who have invested strongly to somekind earthly ideological worldview tend to operate strictly on conscious level of human mind. They write fancy articles and blather endlessly about some fairytale societal constructs, that will never materialize. And if they do materialize, they are without exception monstrous regimes destined to fail from day one. <br><br>That is because academic intellectuals are unable to see unwritten rules between human beings; those organically growing codes of communities produced by historical, natural development. When progressive liberals come into picture and brush all those unwritten rules to trashcan, crudely implementing ideological wishful thinking, totally alien to local community, result is ALWAYS pure disaster. <br><br>Look North Africa. Look old Soviet bloc (not liberals there, but communist progressive daydreamers). Look state of family and societal ties in Western societies. In all these places, progressives have come to house and put to practice their fantasies about gender roles, multiculturalism and harmonious globalism. After that, everything either starts to burn or decay.<br><br>Decay or burn until some system actually workable in real world replaces deranged dreams of ideological invasion. This is happening right now in North Africa, where "islamists" (=local conservatives) are harvesting the fruits of color revolutions. This should be done everywhere: local community with it's members and their codes of conduct should be praised and elevated. Internationalist nightmares of current elites should be dismissed. Just stop watching establishment news and start working with your immediate neighbors and friends. <br><br><br>My point is, this state of things where elites from center can project by force some ideological conditions upon population is thing build by excessive amounts of energy. It is ultimate use of coercive violence seen in history of mankind, even reaching inside families. Family life has never before modern era been politicized, but now it has happened. What happens between husband and wife and children has never before been regulated by some heartless bureaucracy. Community expectations and pressure from peers has set boundaries to what is acceptable. Family organization in core Western countries is in state of utter decay, and people see some clumsy and unresponsive bureaucracy as "head of the family", ultimately setting rules for conduct and serving dough. What a perverse and unnatural situation this is; no wonder Western countries are sliding down to chaos, weakness and poverty. When this brute coercive force, made possible by leviathan amounts of cheap energy, goes away central power reverts to its original role. It becomes once more racketeering syndicate, which has right to tax and keep an army. No more, no less. That is how things were done before modern era: center had no responsibility nor ability to modify codes of conduct for remote subjects, and everyone outside capital was remote subject. People were organized around one and only natural model for agricultural society, patriarchal extended family. That is how things are working even today in Central Asian Steppe and generally in areas beyond Transoxania. If you don't believe this, go there and work there for a while with locals. I did.<br><br>Concerning this "scientific materialism" conversation raging in this blog: you guys have not even remotest understanding about true nature or function of religions. Like many mathematically gifted persons who have absolutely no eye for more delicate adjustments of society, you got it all wrong. Future looming ahead mankind right now, based on facts about our energy supplies, is not going to be responsive for your ideas. Those ideas by the way are almost directly copied from 50's scientific masturbation fantasies about neat, clean and very rational future. Unfortunately for you, history of mankind has never been any of those things, and shall be even less in the immediate future.

Industrialism and the access to cheap energy have promoted very rapid change in modern culture. It has also allowed and encouraged the expectation of such rapid change. The problem with modern education is we expect rapid change. Education of humans takes the better part of 20 years. Once a direction is set the effect from that change in direction takes several rounds of training or 40 years to see the results. By expecting rapid change in a process that inherently takes 20 years to produce a result just creates screwed up outcomes that cannot be compared to anything. For education to work it needs stability in process for fairly long periods of time to see what the change brings. Imagining that we can through scientific knowledge know what the results will be sooner is hubris. <br><br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c942080071416560445 title="comment permalink">2/10/13, 8:14 AM</a><br><br>

Many of the people I have been talking with seem to have a vague notion that "they" have to make up their minds in order for something to change, I don't know who "they" are but I know that "they" would never allow social security to collapse, the American Empire to stop, or the rich to loose any serious amount of wealth. "They" must be gods. But whatever they are it doesn't change the face that the center cannot hold.<br><br>It is a dangerous thing to even get me started on the topic of education! I was blessed to go to an alternative school in Grand Junction Colorado for High School, its is amazing how good of an education one can get in two days a week sitting on couches arguing about the relative influence of Blue Oyster Cult and The Pixies, arguing theology, economics, just war theory, and whatever other topic the student body used as a distraction to avoid thinking about the silver file cabinet and its contents of the State of Colorado curriculum we were intended to be studying. Good education, compared to the standards of today, seemed to me shamefully easy to facilitate.<br><br>Seeing some of my friends who mostly ran on grain alcohol during their high school years (the school had many students of last resort kicked out of the rest of the schools in the area already) finally decide they wanted a degree sit down and crank out three semesters of school work in two months; all to a standard of quality that I came to miss when I was grading undergraduate papers during my college years; made me realize how pathetic the standards are. The particular friends I have in mind are not defined in my mind as being especially bright or driven, but they were able to learn the paint by numbers State required part of our curriculum with just a little bit of effort, and demonstrate mastery in short order. As a fellow student I sat in on their demonstrations of mastery to grade them, in high school I wasn't always impressed with the quality, but by college I came to realize just how amazing it had been. My college peers who lacked a good couch in high school where they could argue about god, the world, and culture couldn't think their way out of a paper bag, in comparison.<br><br>The culture, especially the way technology infests it is not always the best thing for educations, though the person of discerning taste can sample good stuff through technology (this fine blog for example) to even suggest that there is such a thing as 'taste' beyond the context of sugary breakfast cereals is nearly taboo at this point. Technology deserves a lot of blame, but many people need not be so stunted by it if they were taught a healthier relationship to is.<br><br>A general failure of our culture to pass down old value through an era of very rapid and static filled mutation in our mimetic systems makes comparisons between education of the past and present difficult. The readings of the early 20th century classrooms were far more developed prose than the perpetually 4th grade reading level of the modern world, but in defense of bad education written English itself has simplified over that, as the poorly educated are encouraged to pump out books and books on any minutia worth a 15 minute skimming of fame. The devil might advocate "teach them advanced reading? So they can read what? Nothing 'new' is so hard and awkward to read as the 'over stuffed' writings of the past." Basically, our culture doesn't have a general sense of taste, and with out taste one cannot distinguish the good fruit from the bad, and therefore also the trees.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c2538413256877951989 title="comment permalink">2/10/13, 8:33 AM</a><br><br>

No comparison of different religions involved there. Insulting some community's religious/cultural feelings is probably easiest way to bring any kind of compromising negotiations to grinding halt, and bring out the guns instead. Western, humanistic worlview has many elements upon which people from various backgrounds can agree. By binding their opinions to deeply inflexible framework of scientific materialism and more extreme forms of modern liberalist thinking, current breed of Western inteligentsia is just alienating about everyone outside their own, hermetically sealed circle. And after seeing persons from WIDELY differing backgrounds I can say this for sure: modern academic liberal from Western bloc is in many ways very, very extreme in his/her own worldview. <br><br>Huge majority of mankind lives a life totally apart from deconstructionist cultural ideas and agressive brand of modern feminism, to name a few of those extremities. <br><br>Deepness of this divide is a shame, because there ARE many elements worth preserving in (classical) liberal thinking; but the package as it is sold today shall never, ever be accepted by majority of people even in Western countries themselves. <br><br>I can understand deep suspicion and resentment felt by those folks belonging to American "religious right"; from what I have read, the other side of culture wars has done about everything to alienate them as far as possible.

We are all fine here. Life feels good while one is rising to a challenge, and the feeling lasts for several days afterward. <br><br>Even I, who am 70 and have led a sedentary academic's life, was able to do some of the snow shoveling. It seemed important to do my part for the neighbors, however small my part might be. This counts as applying small amounts of force at the right time and place to keep the wheel turning smoothly. <br><br>The trick of snow shoveling for a man of my age and condition is do it like a tortoise moves: very, very slow, but steady. I do two or three small shovelfuls in the course of two or three minutes, then rest three or four minutes, then do two or three more small shovelfuls, then rest again, and so on for an hour or two of shoveling. Then it's time for a longer rest inside, even if I've only done, say, 15 feet of the walkway in all that time. It all gets done eventually. Also, I make a point of paying attention to my heart rate and other indicators as I work, and take longer rests whenever I notice any small change. (None of this macho competition with the younger men for old men like me! That's a fool's game.)<br><br>Another commenter mentioned how the generations before us had much more strength and stamina. As times get harder and you need to do more physical labor, your strength and stamina will slowly increase of themselves. Even at my age I find I can slowly build up somewhat more strength and stamina whenever I need to do some physical labor for several days in a row (splitting firewood, shoveling snow, etc.). It all comes back very, very much more slowly than when I was 30, but most of it comes back eventually. (Also, it goes away more quickly when the labor is over.) <br><br>People younger than I am will surely be able to build up the strength and stamina they need for a crisis if only the crisis takes a few years to really hit hard. So don't worry about that too much. With time and enough hard work, you'll become as strong and tough as most people were three or four generations ago.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c2661036954286185104 title="comment permalink">2/10/13, 11:55 AM</a><br><br>

JMG, you wanted me to confirm who I meant with term "you guys". This left me little bit confused, because of course I can't suspect you or many others commenters of this blog about atheism. For me you are minister of your religion. That religion is different from mine, but you are still a priest for me. As you are priest of minority religion, which means being under a threat of persecution on long run, I am convinced you must have deep personal conviction and religious experience behind what you are doing. <br><br>Here protestants have been persecuting Eastern Church during periods of history, and vice versa. So I have family stories about courage it takes to represent minority religion as its spokesman during hard times. <br><br>At the same time I have to clarify whom I am talking about when I talk about "intelligentsia" in negative way. Of course it is wonderful thing when person knows a lot about his/her field of expertise. Thumbs up for it. But it takes also humility to be wise. I have confronted many times this distinct personality type: cocktail of academic background, essentially materialistic worldview and so zealous belief in confusing "progressive" ideals that person himself doesn't even understand it is ideological view, not truth per se. From what I have understood, "progressiveness" means for this type of person essentially more personal freedoms for everybody and less structure and rules in society and communities. They seem to be unable to notice obvious downsides of losing societal structures, which bind us humans together in form of trust towards others and form natural safety net against hard times. More often than not this kind of person is very arrogant toward people outside his class and blind when it comes noticing things outside his/her chosen mental framework.<br><br>No religious person can belong to this "intelligentsia". Religion is by its very nature communal thing, something you share with others. So being a priest and belonging to intelligentsia (which is phatic and negative term for me) is impossible situation. <br><br>So have I misunderstood something? Is some element lost in translation for me? Was the form of my sentence such that I was blaming every commenter of this blog about arrogant behavior towards religion? English is difficult language indeed.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c292546582592214353 title="comment permalink">2/10/13, 1:06 PM</a><br><br>

Everyone agrees the system is terrible, and getting worse. All the focus is on causal explanations for this, and potential fixes to eliminate the causes: bad teachers, uninvolved parents, video games, centralization, NCLB, etc. <br><br>In keeping with the whole arc of this blog, I don't think that's the problem at all. The real problem is teleological. Education is irrelevant to the future the students face, and they know this better than their parents and teachers do. They FEEL it.<br><br>Consider that the first public education in the US took place in an environment where many people could not read or write, and few could do more than simple sums. An education -- readin', writin', and 'rithmetic -- provided a wealth of immediate personal benefits. You could read the simple contracts you were asked to sign. You could sign your own name, and write your own basic legal documents, like promissory notes or a last will. Basic math skills opened up the world of running your own business and keeping track of costs and profits. Schooling allowed you to run your own life in a way that put you ahead of your peers in a very direct and practical way.<br><br>The problem with modern schools is the students themselves, and their problem is teleological, not moral. They don't see the point to the education they are getting. My kids certainly didn't, and they and their peers complained endlessly about it.<br><br>There is still a niche for the high achievers, but for any student below the top tenth or twentieth percentile, the idea of bettering yourself -- or your practical circumstances -- through education isn't obviously true, and probably isn't true at all. What good does literacy do in a world where everyone is literate, and most legal documents are so convoluted that even the lawyers require specialty knowledge? What good do basic math skills do in a world that requires a certified accountant to do your business taxes (or sometimes, your personal taxes)? <br><br>I'm going to guess that a modern child doesn't actually need anything higher than a third-grade education. <br><br>I would take as the dividing line the point in school where the bulk of students lose motivation. That's the point at which they are mature enough to realize the education they are getting isn't going to help them. <br><br>If they had meaningful work to do, they'd drop out and do it. But there is no meaningful work. So they stay in school, but there's no point to the schooling for them. It's marking time.<br><br>If there is any truth to this insight, there is no possibility of fixing the schools without first providing some reason to have an education, and then changing the system to provide that education, and not some other education that is no longer relevant.<br><br>If we can find that sweet spot, we will not be able to keep the students away with a stick.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c7127425194652241258 title="comment permalink">2/10/13, 6:23 PM</a><br><br>

I think Beatrix Potter finally received an official apology from the Royal Society about 54 years after her death, or approximately one generation or a whole lot of funerals :-)<br><br>"A large extended family, its members well armed and jealous for the honor of their line is the last and final bastion of freedom." <br><br>Hmmm, well, I know of some women and girls in various parts of the world who might disagree with that one....<br><br>I'm still thinking about the "basic ground rules" of a democratic but decentralised/devolved federation of states. My feeling is that while a lot of local autarchyy should be tolerated and/or encouraged, there must be *some* (few) fundamental rights or laws... I mean, if all religious/cultural local variants are to be tolerated, do we tolerate FGM? how about child marriages? honour killings? Hrrrm. Where would lines be drawn? Where does a matter of opinion become a human rights issue?<br><br>What could we agree on? Murder is wrong? Well, "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." So already we have a potential conflict over religious literalism... sigh. My guess would be that a Constitution for such a democratic federation might deny the power of capital punishment at the State level and reserve it for transgressions of Federal laws. If I were writing it, it would also forbid the detainment or captivity of persons -- in other words, if people don't like your local rules and laws then you have to let them walk away, you can't close your borders and keep them prisoner. So... believe whatever you please, practise whatever rituals satisfy you and your gods, but you don't get to kill (or torture) people and you don't get to keep your population captive if they want to leave. Maybe that's about as "rights-oriented" as a Federal hub can afford to get, w/o getting too micromanagerial...<br><br><br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c6507517092187551990 title="comment permalink">2/10/13, 11:06 PM</a><br><br>

But I am not sure that they aren't both wasting breath and blood pressure. Kids aren't just blobs of Play-Doh.<br><br>If people only ever regurgitated, lifelong, what they were taught in school, then we would certainly not be arguing about evolution today, much less doing so using computers and an internet :-) Some percentage of us always question, rebel, think outside whatever box the grups are trying to build around us, turn out to be natural contrarians... and we'll go right on doing that, regardless of the indoctrination process. The guy who stood in front of the tank in Tiananmen Square was, presumably, the product of an Party-approved State school. That might be *why* he stood in front of the tank :-)<br><br>It's like the folks who argue that gay parenting (adoptive or otherwise) must inevitably "create" hordes of gay teenagers (and what a dreadful thing that would be eh) -- like all the gay people who are around today had gay parents? Surely most of them were "created" by straight parents :-) they just didn't get stamped out as perfect little cellular replicas. <br><br>Same goes for educational systems; force Creationism down kids' throats and Evolution will become a forbidden and fascinating topic; rebel kids will run away and become genetic biologists. Outlaw religion and it'll become cool just by being outlawed; rebel kids will run off and join ashrams or take holy orders. If blue jeans are demonised as a symbol of wicked Western decadence, oh boy, what a hot black-market there will be in blue jeans -- every teenager will long for a pair. And so on. The children of hippies, strangely enough, sometimes become corporate lawyers :-)<br><br>My mother always said that it was compulsory Bible school that made her a lifelong atheist :-)<br><br>"Your children / are not *your* children / they are the sons and the daughters of Life's longing for itself. / They come through you / yet they are not of you; / though they are with you / they belong not to you. /<br>You can give them your love but not your thoughts: / they have their own thoughts, they have their own thoughts. / You can house their bodies but not their souls, / for their souls dwell in a place of forever / that you cannot visit, no, not even in your dreams. / You can strive to be like them / but you cannot make them just like you -- / strive to be like them / but you cannot make them just like you."

I have a great reverence for nature, but I'm also aware that my thoughts and desires have no bearing one or way or the other in the matter and I worry for the birds, the insects and the animals that share this place.<br><br>The presence of university entrance exams doesn't surprise me at all. They are probably also used as a barrier to entry as well given that the universities demand them and then also police them.<br><br>The universities here use the threat of entrance exams as leverage against the state and federal governments. It seems effective as a threat, so there must be something in it.<br><br>There's another game that gets played over here by the private school system which is worth mentioning. Much ballyhooing is made of the percentage of children that pass the final year of high school exams (year 12 or form 6) for an individual school. This is a particularly treasured statistic for private schools. What goes behind the scenes though is that at the end of year 9, any child that has been assessed as not being able to make the grade scholastically is pretty much invited to leave the institution.

Both my partner and I considered becoming teachers until we understood the full horror of the public school systems.

For those that doubt the high-quality of education in previous generations, I have in my possession an 8th grade math textbook from 1914. The math in there is more advanced than what I learned until my second year in college.<br><br>Furthermore, the local Amish community near our farm still uses one-room schoolhouses and there kids come out of eighth grade fluent in English and German, with a working knowledge of Latin, math through trigonometry (sometimes calculus) and more geography, history, etc than most high school graduates. <br><br>I mentioned last week that I'm reading Toynbee. I'm fairly well-educated by modern standards and I have more knowledge of Latin than 90% of Americans, yet reading these books has shown me just how poor my education has been. He frequently quotes lots of Latin (which I can at least get the gist of), Greek, French, and occasionally a language I can't even identify, and the context is such that he obviously expect his readers to understand all of it.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c4129368322575447255 title="comment permalink">2/11/13, 5:21 AM</a><br><br>

Generally, when explaining that Biology is a purchased curriculum, Algebra 2 and Geometry are from a book (and we just found our slide rules so will be sure to incorporate them!), English and History overlap quite a bit because the reading is from English translations of Greek and Roman classics, and Spanish then Latin the conversations tended to fade into a jumble of words. This was often compounded if the conversation wound around to my credentials, of which there are none. I know that part of myself well that wants someone else to tell me how to do it, and that's what I see in response to our decision. Unfortunately, having someone else, out there, telling us what to do doesn't guarantee success, safety, or even the ability to pin blame should something go terribly wrong. Thankfully, I don't need to be certified as a teacher to be able to facilitate what I believe will be an excellent education for our daughter. However, when I do feel the need for reassurance, I can reflect that I barely have a high school education and have managed quite nicely to craft a life and what she is studying is already far outpacing that and what is on offer in public school.<br><br>GHung, I think the lesson to draw from Eliot Wigginton's developing the Foxfire Project contrasted with child molestation is to take what is of value and leave the rest.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c924014591719388263 title="comment permalink">2/11/13, 7:20 AM</a><br><br>

Although the US education appears to be more centralized , the actual mechanics of the NJ school were largely determined by a handful of activist parents and the school board. Alas,there was more focus on the sports teams and computers than on the basics of reading, mathematics and reasoning. In contrast, the provincial standards and the professional management of the schools in Nova Scotia have resulted in much better general education in English, Math and Social Sciences. The Canadian schools are not perfect; but they provide the basics and seem to leave the child's curiousity and self respect intact. As a result, in Canada my son has found that he is responsible for his own future education and learning. I wonder if the problem is not really centralization vs. decentralization of education; but is really whether the society (local, regional or national) values learning, creativity and education. I suspect that the decline in education in the US has more to do with too much focus on entertainment provided by others and electronics.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c5693976646439976529 title="comment permalink">2/11/13, 7:53 AM</a><br><br>

The balance between decentralization and regulation of a commons. I totally agree about the need to re-localize education. And your last few posts have given a new viewpoint on how local regulation of commons can work. But other commons like atmospheric pollution can't be localized. And many states in the US really would become less competitive economically if they were allowed to teach their children young earth creationism as they want to. I see your point though, that the best approach is probably to let the bad ideas get implemented on a local scale and let people find out what doesn't work. But we have to remember that this would mean letting the Confederacy go with their slave economy in 1861 and letting the south reject civil rights in the 1960s. Decreasing central control of civil rights and education policy seems like a radical policy, but it may be the only way forward. The need for central control of bad behavior by individuals is deeply rooted in the American left and also in much of the actual practice of the American right (even though their rhetoric usually doesn't match their legislation).

Those reasons alone may make it much better than the other options. And I’m often reminded of a scene from the (excellent) HBO show The Wire, in which a teacher suddenly realizes that for some of his students, school is merely a safe place to practice manipulating and getting over on people, a crucial skill for their lives on the street, where their real future lies. <br>My perspective is surely skewed some by my years on the more extreme end of the educational system (big city, concentrated poverty, layers of risk factors). Mine are kids whose families never made it inside the bubble. On the other hand, while my students are on the margins of society, those margins are getting wider all the time. It’s interesting now to hear a much broader section of the new generation responding to school in the same ways young people have for generations here.<br>In any case (and as Joseph also wrote), what’s missing is a better option. I’m hoping that’s where this series is headed. Right now, the company line in education is “College for All”; one-on-one I can push a young person’s thinking about what they want for themselves and why, but it’s risky to do that on any larger scale.<br>Jonathan.<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c9155891347458018818 title="comment permalink">2/12/13, 1:02 PM</a><br><br>

I’m not much of a watcher myself, and this is the one show I do recommend often. That’s because it’s modeled on the Greek tragedies, watches like a novel, and aims to dramatize the life of an American city as the empire ends (that’s really how the writer describes it!). Beginning with working cops and mid-level drug dealers, it adds layers each season—unemployed longshoremen, mayoral candidates, teachers, children, newspapermen; the characters are workaday nobodies trying to survive whichever of those institutions they’ve committed themselves to. I decided to check it out when, within a week of one another, an intellectual-type psychiatrist friend of my father-in-law’s and my just-home-from-prison brother-in-law both told me that they and all their friends watched it religiously.<br>The fourth season has education as its theme and gives a good treatment to both the state of a city school system and the less formal ways that children learn the things they really need to know.<br>In case anyone’s interest is piqued, these are a couple interviews with the show’s creators, a long one about the show vision and a short about the education theme, both somewhat relevant to the theme of the blog:<br>http://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/simon_4_1_11/<br>http://www.hbo.com/the-wire/inside/index.html#/the-wire/inside/interviews/interview/ed-burns.html/eNrjcmbO0CzLTEnNd8xLzKksyUx2zs8rSa0oUc-PSYEJBSSmp-ol5qYy5zMXsjGyMXIyMrJJJ5aW5BfkJFbalhSVpgIAXbkXOA==<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c3062235990316557118 title="comment permalink">2/12/13, 1:03 PM</a><br><br>

The Associated Press ran an article today (Feb 12) reporting a significant increase in metal and cable thefts in that country. Targets include various infrastructural components including industrial cable, power-line transformers, storm-drain covers, heavy factory doors, mining equipment, abandoned army bridges, and even the 9-year-old light rail system. Apparently, “ravenous” demand in China and India are driving this latest development. The AP also noted that the profile of the budding Greek ruinman has changed from “gypsies and immigrants living on the margins of society to mainstream Greeks who have fallen on hard times.”<br><br>Also, did anyone else notice last week that the Virginia House of Delegates adopted a bill to study alternative currencies in case of cyber attacks on, or potential loss of confidence in, financial institutions and the Fed, and to address the apparent irresponsibility of the federal government?<br><br><a href=the-center-cannot-hold.html#c6795512796132574185 title="comment permalink">2/12/13, 6:47 PM</a><br><br>

But when I was a single parent with one child in elementary, we got up at 6:30 so he could be at daycare and I could get to work on time ... then by the time I got back from the office and picked him up at after school care and got home it was 6:30 pm. I made us dinner and we ate and while I cleaned up he practiced his reading or did whatever small assignment he had, then there was half an hour to play, have a bath, and hit the sack so we could do it all again the next day.<br>There are a lot of families who are that busy, just keeping heads above water. I *wanted* to be the one to teach my kid, but who would pay the bills and keep a roof over our heads? There aren't always as many choices as one might like.<br><br>And, *more assignments* are not the answer. In the 6 hours my kid is *at* school, I want him learning things that are valuable and useful. Mostly, I am content with the public curriculum here in Alberta - but I'm glad that our lives changed and my kid's been able to school virtually (standard curriculum, not taught by me, basically correspondence school done online, from home) since Junior High. It has neatly sidestepped the cultural 'lessons' I did not want him learning in public school and allowed him to learn time management and self-direction he would not have otherwise caught on to until much later in life, at a much higher cost. <br>However, the only reason we have had this choice is that my circumstances changed.

Not ideal, but the best I could do at the time.<br>I agree with whoever made the argument that kids don't see the point anymore. They are being pushed toward college whether they belong there or not, yet must know of older siblings, cousins and neighbors who have graduated and are now baristas with a burden of student loan.
