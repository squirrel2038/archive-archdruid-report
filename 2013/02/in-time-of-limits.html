<div class=MsoNormal>
When the French nobleman Alexis de Tocqueville toured the newly founded American republic in the early years of the nineteenth century, he encountered plenty of things that left him scratching his head. The national obsession with making money, the atrocious food, and the weird way that high culture found its way into the most isolated backwoods settings—“There is hardly a pioneer's hut which does not contain a few odd volumes of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shakespeare,” he wrote; “I remember reading the feudal drama of Henry V for the first time in a log cabin”—all intrigued him, and found their way into the pages of his remarkable book
<i>Democracy in America</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, one of the things de Tocqueville found most astonishing bears directly on the theme I’ve been developing over the last several weeks here on <i>The Archdruid Report</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Americans of his time, when they wanted to make something happen, didn’t march around with placards or write their legislators demanding that the government do it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Instead, far more often than not, they simply put together a private association for the purpose, and did it themselves. De Tocqueville wrote: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
“Americans combine to give fêtes, found seminaries, build churches, distribute books, and send missionaries to the antipodes. Hospitals, prisons, and schools take shape in that way. Finally, if they want to proclaim a truth or propagate some feeling by the encouragement of a great example, they form an association. In every case, at the head of any new undertaking, where in France you would find the government or in England some territorial magnate, in the United States you are sure to find an association. I have come across several types of association in America of which, I confess, I had not previously the slightest conception, and I have often admired the extreme skill they show in proposing a common object for the exertions of very many and in inducing them voluntarily to pursue it.”</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The types of associations de Tocqueville encountered used an assortment of ingenious legal structures borrowed, for the most part, from English common law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those of my readers who dislike the role of corporations in contemporary American life may be interested to know that the distant and much less toxic ancestor of today’s corporate structure was one of them. A corporation, back in those days, was not a privileged legal pseudoperson with more rights and fewer responsibilities than a human being.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was simply a group of people who set out to accomplish some purpose, and got a charter from the state government allowing them to raise money for that purpose by selling shares of stock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most had single purposes—building a hospital, say, or a canal—and limited lifespans, defined either as a fixed number of years or until the purpose of the corporation was completed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Making money was sometimes an object in such exercises, but by no means always. Members of a local religious community who wanted to build a new church, for example, would very often do that by organizing a corporation to raise money for the construction costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Each member would buy as many shares as he or she could afford, and fellow believers in neighboring towns who wanted to support the project might also buy shares to chip in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When the church was finished, the corporation would be wound up, and thereafter a portion of the income from tithes and donations might be set apart to buy back the shares a few at a time; on the other hand, the members of the congregation might consider themselves well repaid when they filed into a new building on Sunday mornings. It was a remarkably effective means of local microfinance, and it paid for a huge number of civic improvements and public amenities in the young republic. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Not all associations that directed their efforts toward the public good in this way were corporations, and I hope I may be allowed a personal reminiscence about one of the others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>I think most of my regular readers know that I’m a Freemason. Yes, I’m quite aware that this makes me an object of vilification across most of the further reaches of contemporary American political life; no, I don’t particularly care, though it tickles my sense of absurdity to be accused to my face now and then of being one of the evil space lizards David Icke rants about in his books. In the town where I live, the various Masonic bodies meet in a large and lovely century-old building—which was, by the way, constructed by the sort of building corporation described earlier in this essay—and share certain projects in common. This year, I serve as the secretary to one of those, the Masonic Endowment Fund. Half a century ago, it had a different and more revealing name:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the Masonic Relief Fund.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here’s how it functioned back in the day. Donations from living members, bequests from dead ones, and a variety of fundraising activities kept the Fund supplied with money, which it invested, and the interest from those investments went to help Masonic brothers and their families who fell onto hard times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The members of the Relief Board, who were appointed by each lodge or other Masonic body, investigated each case and then started writing checks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Elderly brethren still recall the days when a long hard winter meant that the poorer families in town would run out of money for coal well before spring, and those who had a family member in the Masons could count on the truck from the local coal firm making a delivery anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Groceries, visiting nurse services, school expenses, funeral costs—the Relief Fund covered all those and much more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Everyone in the local Masonic scene supported the project to whatever extent their means allowed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Partly that was because that’s what you do when you’re a Freemason, and partly it was because everyone knew that, however well off they were at the moment, some unexpected turn of events might leave them in a situation where they had to rely on the Fund for their own survival. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Fund no longer buys truckloads of coal for poor Masonic families in the winter, and the reason for that is a microcosm of the impact of empire on American communities. In the wake of Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” programs of the 1960s, government welfare programs took the place of the Masonic Relief Fund and its many equivalents in the lives of the local poor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Requests for help slowed and then stopped, and the Relief Board found itself sitting on an increasing pile of money that no one seemed to need any more. After much discussion, and by vote of the Masonic bodies that funded the Board, its name was changed to the Masonic Endowment Fund and its income was put to work paying for improvements on an aging Masonic building. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same thing, often in much more drastic terms, happened to many other voluntary organizations that once occupied the roles currently more or less filled by government social welfare programs. In 1920, for example, something like 3500 different fraternal orders existed in the United States, and around 50% of the country’s adult population—counting both genders and all ethnic groups, by the way—belonged to at least one of them. Reasons for belonging ranged across the whole spectrum of human social phenomena, but there were hard pragmatic reasons to put in a petition for membership at your local lodge of the Odd Fellows, Knights of Pythias, or what have you:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>at a time when employers generally didn’t provide sick pay and other benefits for employees, most fraternal orders did. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
If you belonged to the Odd Fellows, for example, you went to lodge one evening a week and paid your weekly dues, which were generally around 25 cents—that is, about the equivalent of a $20 bill today. In exchange, if you became too sick to work, the lodge would give you sick pay, and if you died, the lodge would cover the costs of your funeral and guarantee that your family would be taken care of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If, as often happened, the husband belonged to the Odd Fellows and the wife to the Rebekahs, the women’s branch of the same organization, the family had a double claim on the order’s help. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Here again, I can call on something more personal than the abstract facts that can be gotten from old history books. My paternal grandfather’s father was a city police officer in the wide-open port town of Aberdeen, Washington, and an Odd Fellow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>In 1920 he was shot to death in the line of duty, leaving a wife and thirteen children. The Aberdeen Odd Fellows lodge paid for his funeral and then took care of his family—his children until they reached adulthood, his widow for the rest of her life. It’s not an accident that my grandfather, when he was in his twenties, became a founding member of a community service organization, Active 20-30 International. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In 1920, Odd Fellowship was at the peak of its size and influence, and ranked as the largest fraternal organization in North America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Today, it’s a faint and flickering shadow of its former self.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>When welfare programs and employer-paid pensions came in, the core function of the Odd Fellows and a great many organizations like it went out by the same door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So, in due time, did most of the organizations. We once had a thriving Odd Fellows lodge here in Cumberland; the building is still there, with the letters IOOF in mosaic work on the front step, but the lodge is long gone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now it’s only fair to point out that the shift from private relief funds to government welfare programs had certain definite advantages. The voluntary associations that handled relief in the pre-welfare era—fraternal orders such as the Freemasons and Odd Fellows, religious bodies such as churches and synagogues, and the like—had limited resources, and usually conserved them by limiting their relief payments to their members, or to other narrowly defined populations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To return to a point made earlier in these posts, the relief organizations of an earlier day had to treat their resources as a commons that could be destroyed by abuse, and so they put a variety of limits on access to those resources to make sure that the people who got help actually needed it, and weren’t simply trying to game the system. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The deep pockets of government<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in an era of national expansion made it possible, for a while, to ignore such factors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The new social welfare programs could reach out to everyone who needed them, or at least to everyone whose claim to need them advanced the agenda of one political faction or another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The resulting largesse was distributed in various amounts all over the class spectrum—welfare for the poor, a dizzying array of direct and indirect federal subsidies for the middle class, ample tax loopholes and corporate handouts to benefit the rich—and did a great deal to fund the lavish lifestyles Americans by and large enjoyed during their nation’s imperial zenith. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the kind of thing a society can do when it can draw on half a billion years of stored sunlight to prop up its economy, not to mention a global empire that gives it privileged access to the energy, raw materials, and products of industry that a half a billion years of stored sunlight made possible. Whether or not it was a good idea isn’t a question I particularly want to discuss at this point. It’s far more important, it seems to me, to recognize that the welfare states of the late 20th century were the product of a vast but temporary abundance of energy and the products of energy; they did not exist before that glut of energy arrived, and it’s thus a safe bet that they won’t exist after the glut is gone. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I think it’s at least as safe a bet, mind you, that nobody in America will be willing to face that fact until long after the abundance of the recent past is a fading memory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The last decade or so of bickering in Washington DC is more than adequate evidence of the way the winds are blowing. Republicans talk about jobs, Democrats talk about justice, but in both cases what’s going on is best described as a bare-knuckle brawl over which party’s voting blocs get to keep their accustomed access to the federal feeding trough. Choose any point on the convoluted political landscape of modern America, and the people at that position eagerly criticize those handouts that don’t benefit them, but scream like irate wildcats if anything threatens their own access to government largesse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I suspect, for what it’s worth, that the last US government handouts to be paid out will be those that prop up the lifestyles of the American middle class: the financial aid that keeps middle class families from having to shoulder the whole cost of a college education for their children, the social security and medicare that keeps them from having to foot the whole bill for their old age and that of their parents, the galaxy of programs intended to make it easier for them to afford homeownership, and all the rest of it. Programs that benefit the middle class disproportionately already make up the largest share of US federal entitlement programs, dwarfing the 2% or so of the federal budget that goes to the poor, or the 5% or so that counts as corporate welfare, and that figure is a fair measure of the political clout the middle class can wield in defense of its privileges. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It would be pleasant to suppose, as the United States slides down the trajectory of imperial decline and the number of Americans in serious trouble increases, that middle class voters would recognize the severity of the situation and support, say, means tests on middle-class welfare programs, so that those who don’t actually need help can be asked to step aside in favor of those who do. I hope none of my readers plan on holding their breath and waiting for this to happen, though. Quite the contrary:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>as economic contraction accelerates and energy and resource shortages bite harder, the fight around the feeding trough will just get worse. I doubt many of the combatants will take enough time from the struggle to notice that, in the long run, it’s a fight with no winners. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
In the time of limits ahead of us, no country on earth will be able to afford a welfare state of the kind that was common in industrial societies over the last century or so. That’s one of the harsh realities of our predicament.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>National economies powered by diffuse renewable energy sources, bound by strict ecological limits, and forced to cope with the cascading instabilities of a damaged planetary biosphere, simply won’t be able to produce the surplus wealth needed to make that a possibility. Methods of providing for urgent social needs that worked in the days before the economy of abundance are another matter, and for this reason it makes sense to suggest a revival of the old American custom of forming voluntary associations to fund and manage public amenities. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are at least two important advantages to such a project, and both of them take the form of lessons that Americans once knew and are going to have to learn again in a hurry. The first is that a private association doesn’t have the luxury of pretending that it has limitless resources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Currently some 60% of Americans receive more in the way of financial benefits from government than they pay in taxes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Conservative pundits like to insist that this means the well-to-do are getting robbed by taxation, but the facts of the matter are considerably more troubling: the gap in question is being covered with borrowed money—which means, in an era of quantitative easing, that it’s being paid by printing money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That’s a recipe for massive economic trouble in the short term. A private association, by contrast, can’t print its own money, and if its members vote themselves more benefits than the treasury can pay for, they will discover promptly enough why this isn’t a good idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s the first advantage. The second is closely related to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The benefit funds of the old fraternal orders and their equivalents across the spectrum of voluntary associations learned two crucial lessons very early on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first was that some people are solely interested in gaming the system for whatever they can get out of it, and are unwilling to contribute anything in return.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The second is that allowing such people to get their way, and drain the fund of its resources, is a fast road to failure. The standard response was to limit access to the benefit fund to those who had contributed to it, or the organization that sponsored it, at least to the extent of joining the organization and keeping current on their dues. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s why the Masonic Relief Fund here in Cumberland only bought coal for those poor families who had a family member in Freemasonry, and why so many of the comparable funds operated by other lodges, by churches, and by a range of other social institutions in the pre-welfare days had similar rules.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The reasoning involved in this custom is the same logic of the commons we’ve discussed several times already in this series of posts. A relief fund is a commons; like any other commons it can be destroyed if those who have access to it are allowed to abuse it for their own benefit; to prevent that from happening, limits on access to the commons are essential. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There were also organizations that existed to provide help to people other than their own members, and in fact most of the old lodges directed some part of their efforts to helping people in the community at large—as indeed most of them still do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Here again, though, access to the limited resources that were available was controlled, so that those resources could be directed where, in the best judgment of the sponsoring organization, they would do the most good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Nineteenth-century talk about “the deserving poor”—that is, those whose poverty was not primarily the result of their own choices and habits, and who thus might well be able to better their conditions given some initial help—is deeply offensive to many people in our present culture of entitlement, but it reflects a hard reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Whether the habit of throwing money at the poor en masse is a useful response to poverty or not, the fact remains that a post-imperial America on the downslope of the age of cheap energy won’t have the resources to maintain that habit even with the poor it’s already got, much less the vastly increased numbers of the newly poor we’ll have as what’s left of our economy winds down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those who worry about ending up destitute as that process unfolds need to be aware that they won’t be able to turn to the government for help, and those whose sense of compassion leads them to want to do something helpful for the poor might want to consider some less futile response than trying to pry loose government funds for that purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times">In both cases, the proven approaches of a less extravagant time might be worth adopting, or at least considering. It’s fair to admit that the voluntary associations central to those approaches won’t be able to solve all the problems of a post-imperial society in a deindustrializing world, but then neither will anything else; they can, however, accomplish some good. In a time of limits, that may well be the best that can be done. </span></span></div>

Your response, to a commenter a few weeks ago, that you consider your political philosophy to be somewhat "Burkean conservative" was interesting, and I've seen a lot of that coming through in these more recent posts. <br><br>The "little platoons" approach has much practical appeal in difficult times, allowing for small scale solutions to arise and work with the facts on the ground. Very different from the top-down solutions we have all come to expect. When I was much younger, fashioning myself as a young socialist in 1970s England, these ideas seemed so old-fashioned, a relic of Tory England, very inefficient and un-modern. Now of course it seems so obvious that a social fabric with lots of small, interlocking organizations, and a fair dollop of disensus, is much less brittle than the centralized collosus that we've built over the last few decades.<br><br>I also expect we'll see a widespread return of multi-generational families/homes, with people combining to look after each other under the same roof. I wonder whether some of the political, communication and give-and-take-skills necessary to make these smaller social and political organizations work were incubated in the multi-generational family setting?<br><br><a href=#c7838050548025203360 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 12:54 AM</a><br><br>

The society has evolved into more of a social club and may be said to be dying as there are now much fewer new immigrants from German speaking areas of the world. However, the society retains a vigorous democratic form which is interesting to see in action. The members have various sub-clubs to brew beer, make wurst, sing German songs, teach German, keep a cultural and historical museum, folk dance, play card games, hold Oktoberfests, Faschings(sort of a German Mardi Gras), "Christmas in Germany" festivals, etc. <br><br>It is also interesting to be a part of a membership based on volunteer labor to make all of this activity possible. The meetings are based on the Robert Rules of Order which are, for the most part, followed. The leaders are elected by the membership and are often rotated as the officers often tire due to intense involvement and hard work. If things get bad enough before this institution dies, I can see it has the structures needed to return to it's original fraternal purposes even without the influx of new Germans.<br><br>For the last couple of years, I have been reading your blog and I really enjoy your large perspective.

In 19th century Ireland that was a front for bigotry and racism used to prop up the British imperial wealth pump and it was ugly. After independence it was a euphemism for those who obeyed the moral diktats of the Catholic church. Now there's a common train of thought that the poor are almost by definition undeserving as they've failed in some way to obey the discipline of the economy - it's assumed they must have been careless or lazy or greedy etc. <br><br>Seems to me like those making the decision, whether it's the state, a landlord, church or just members of a voluntary association who have a job and income, always have an incentive to limit the category of the 'deserving' in callous and arbitrary ways. To use it to control the morals of the poor by punishing the sinners, to extract more labour from them, to push them out to another area to be someone else's problem.Or just to choose those most similar to them who they can identify with best or those who somehow allow them to maintain their belief that it could never be them who ends up poor. The idea of your neighbours deciding whether your family gets help that could mean the difference between life and death based on their judgment of your character makes my blood run cold.

Is this not so?<br><br>With one third of the population out of work for extended periods, and massive deflation, the churches, fraternal organizations and local governments were overwhelmed; they did not have enough money to keep people from starving and losing their homes. <br><br>Herbert Hoover, FDR's predecessor in the White House, had run a very effective relief program in Russia after the Great War. He knew how to do it but was ideologically opposed to federal intervention either to improve the economy or to help the unemployed. That's why he wasn't reelected. <br><br>One can make the case that once the crisis was over, these federal programs should have been scaled back or terminated instead of being made permanent. Instead, they were expanded after WWII. Indeed, conservatives did argue that position and a few still do, although not very consistently.<br><br>I agree that we can't afford to carry on this way, and that neither national party is doing much to scale back federal expenditures. The availability of wealth to redistribute is a positive feedback loop that breeds corruption, overwhelming every attempt at reform.<br><br><a href=#c2870287407483645316 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 4:18 AM</a><br><br>

This was one of the periods of great stress as you have identified (I forget the terminology you've used at the moment), where the nation held together but only barely, and was greatly changed in the event.<br><br>These older, localized social safety structures were not the cause of the failure, but they were overwhelmed by the scale. Whatever the causes of the depression (I'm avoiding getting into that here), we were at that time still a nation with a lot of energy resources, including fossil fuel energy. To hold it together required committing some of that energy to support those the previous system had failed, and the nation that emerged was then much different from what it had been before. Just as the nation that emerged from the Civil War was much different than what it had been. <br><br>I guess in both cases continuing the project required making a step change in complexity and centralization of power, which could only happen with the energy resources to support it, and each time there was an increase in per-capita energy available to the population. I'm not sure the voluntary associations would have worked with that new, more complex social organization. However, now that this process is running in reverse we will need to shed that complexity and they may eventually become a useful model again. <br><br>My concern is that we still have that complexity and the voluntary associations are no longer established, and it is more than likely that we'll have a situation where they will be overwhelmed even if they were (like the Great Depression). It will be mighty tough to re-establish such things in that environment.<br><br><a href=#c6977213455896014037 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 7:26 AM</a><br><br>

This disadvantage is that each one is much more fragile, with smaller risk pools and much less money.<br><br>Ultimately, this discussion needs to turn to our modern obsession with living forever, which lies at the root of our sense of entitlement. There used to be an expression out here, "dying with your boots on." They used to call pneumonia "the old man's friend." The Lakota said, "Today would be a good day to die," and the ancient Celts (and Vikings, and Saxons, and you-name-it) found the idea of dying in bed abhorrent.<br><br><a href=#c7148728260851663401 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 7:47 AM</a><br><br>

But there is a rich history of local people forming cooperative banks (precursors to credit unions of today), cooperative dairy creameries, cooperative rural electric associations, cooperative telephone companies, cooperative feed stores and general stores. Same idea. You became a member and funded the start-up of the enterprise by your membership, and then became a loyal customer afterwards. At least once a year, and sometimes quarterly, there would be association meetings where decisions were made by members of the association.

If I go on to mention that half or most of the members of this society belong to fraternal associations (I'd call them "collectives") that provide for their members ("according to their needs") and also undertake charitable work in the community, they'll exclaim "Libertarian Communism!" and point to the relevant passage in Kropotkin.<br><br>If, on the other hand, I suggest that these things were aspects of the United States of the past, they'll probably call me a racist. <br><br>Funny how that works. <br><br>Of course, I'm aware that the fraternal associations, local planning boards, and so forth that you describe are in no way identical to Kropotkin or anyone else's idea of socialism or communism. But I think that there is a certain family resemblance there which may be helpful in selling these ideas to Leftish people (of course, there's a lot to appeal to Rightish people too; I think it's all a matter of framing.) Communes and utopian societies seem, to me, to be not entirely different from monasteries, or from the fraternal orders you describe. And I also think it's worth pointing out that, during the 19th Century, when the reach of the federal government was significantly less than today, communistic and utopian experiments of many different varieties flourished. Most failed or changed, to be sure, but that doesn't mean the idea is a failure anymore than the fact that most businesses and churches from 1875 are no longer around refutes the idea of business or religion! I have a book on the topic-- a survey of dozens of communal societies, written in 1875-- that opens by suggesting that the point of communal societies is "to enable at least the more intelligent, enterprising, and determined part of those who are not capitalists to become such, and cease to labor for hire." I think that idea will have as much relevance for our de-industrial future as it did for the pre-industrial past.<br><br><a href=#c4627947768224296065 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 10:18 AM</a><br><br>

This seems to be particularly true in my state, where it is easier to get on disability and some people move here just to get onto it. I found out that this is a source of resentment among my coworkers who all seem to know multiple people on welfare, young women about 20 years of age who have two and three and four children, different fathers, living on welfare and medicaid. And I do mean white people. Plenty of people are collecting disability checks who, if you met them somewhere, you would have no idea they are disabled.<br><br>There's a very good reason that in the past women were strongly stigmatized for bearing children out of wedlock. It was called morality, but the real reason is that a woman who becomes pregnant without a man committed to her is about to become a huge burden upon her family and community. Plenty of adequate people make mistakes, especially when they are young, but there is also a subset of people who do not show any sense of personal responsibility for their lives, don't "grow up" and give back.<br>There's also a tremendous number of people in the medical system, some with insurance and some on the dole, who have terrible health and absolutely zero interest trying to understand anything they could do about it, but when it comes to payment for the thousands upon thousands of dollars spent on their care, they have no skin in the game. Well, other than their actual skin that is!

But when I see the actions and attitude of the government, it seems to me that once the game is up and the problem is out in the open, that the various enforcement agencies will have all the oil they need for some time to come.

Yet the same tools in other hands put to other ends have done wonderful things to promote and preserve the commons on many scales.

These organizations took care of their own poor, sick and elderly just as you have described, and did so in exemplary fashion. In addition to aid given to needy families, the Freemasons also maintained Masonic Homes for the elderly or disabled, which -- at least in my own relatives' experience -- provided care to a very high standard.<br><br>Some of the commenters asked whether all this depended on cheap energy and a growing economy. Of course it benefitted from these things, but I do not think it depended on them. Even when the economy was bad (as it was during the Depression, for instance) the fraternal orders kept their charitable activities going by means of lots of self-sacrifice on the part of individual members, who willingly cut back on their own consumption of food and fuel to help their less fortunate fellow members. It just came down to character and the practice of virtue -- a pair of old-fashioned concepts, to be sure, but concepts well worth cultivating, especially as our age grows darker. <br><br>These things -- character and virtues -- are exemplified over and over again in the stories and histories that underlie Masonic initiations and other lodge rituals, and this counts for far more than *direct* teaching. Any rituals has a powerful impact on the people who enact it over and over again, and lodge rituals are no exception. Without their rituals and initiations, no fraternal organization would ever have become more than a mere social club, or a self-promoting charitable association most active when times were good and the economy was booming. <br><br>Our society is contemptuous of "mere" ritual, as it is of "mere" fantasy and "mere" imagination. That is possibly the most serious of its several errors in judgement. There is nothing "mere" about either ritual or fantasy or imagination!<br><br>Among the many books that I would like to see survive the coming hard times are not only good textbooks of such things as geometry and grammar, but copies of Robert's Rules of Order and of a variety of lodge ritual manuals. (It would be even better if the lodges themselves can survive the coming hard times, but failing that, if their rituals at least can make it through the centuries, they will be able to serve as templates for new fraternal orders.)<br><br><a href=#c6540206036103006660 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 1:47 PM</a><br><br>

However, I don't think it's at all given that there won't be any winners, at least in anything shorter than the very long term. <br><br>The medieval era is our current best example of what happens when empires hit the skids. People of means or in positions of authority lay claim to whatever resources remain -- especially productive land -- thereby forcing those who are not as well positioned into economic subjugation. The power and authority of the U.S. Federal Government seems to me to be an ideal instrument through which the powerful could bring about this condition.<br><br>The medieval era was not a pleasant time for the 99%. As Thomas Hobbes described it: "No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short”. And it lasted for a thousand years.<br><br>JMG's vision of a democratic, relocalized future is an attractive one, even if it means a harder life for most people. Unfortunately, historical examples run a bit thin. What one finds instead is a progression to authoritarian rule, with a small cadre of elites living very well indeed off the sweat of their subjects, with a legal and moral code that justifies and enforces all of it.<br><br><a href=#c2541081364644046395 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 2:35 PM</a><br><br>

Conflict resolution would be an experience of daily life, as would accountability for decision taking.<br><br>I have one or two questions regarding ‘fraternal orders’ in the USA. (BTW, Kier Hardie early Scottish Labour Party had a definition of Socialism: “Fraternity based on justice.”) <br>How did your fraternal organisations fare in the New Deal era? <br>My second is really an observation: I understand that by the time of Lyndon Johnson the great exodus of the American middle-class to the suburbs and to petroleum prosperity was well under way. The concept of looking after other people and taking responsibility for neighbourhood affairs, apart from protecting property values, does not seem very likely in the new suburbs? (Here in Britain we saw a brief resurgence of personal and collective action and automatic taking of responsibility during wartime in the pre-petrol London suburbs; but it did not last long. I saw some of the last practical civic and personal measures in the remaining 19thC poorer areas of Edinburgh in the early 1970s. These admirable Scottish self-help and civic structures did not survive ‘modernisation’.)<br><br>Again here in Britain, assuming you are correct and even here ‘we’ do not find ourselves in the ‘Dark Ages’ for a good while yet, I still have hopes that we preserve British medical services based on the understanding that these are available to everybody, free. These services have been allocated according to medical need, however undeserving the recipient, and have included the criminal, or even the plutocrat if he has his emergency away from his de-luxe private health care. I base my hope on the fact that our national system was founded at a time immediately after WWII when the country was broke, the imperial wealth pumps no longer worked, and we had hardly begun the petroleum age. Per person purchasing power was a small fraction of what we have now. If we could afford it then, we should be able to afford it for a while yet! There is however a serious attempt underway just now to dismantle the old ways – and with no political mandate for such dismantling – but I am still hoping. I am old enough to remember what our NHS did for the whole tenor of life in UK back in my childhood.<br><br>best<br>Phil<br><br><a href=#c8308589324829939367 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 2:44 PM</a><br><br>

But historically there was no way for an unmarried woman to reliably identify the father. Sure, the kid might look like the milkman, but unless the milkman steps up to the plate there was no way for society or the law to enforce the responsibilities of fatherhood in the absence of marriage. Our current situation in the USA completely reverses this. With DNA testing fatherhood can be established by court order and the father can be forced to contribute to the support of any child he sires, regardless of marital state. Having no garnish-able income is the only escape. Our official mores have not changed to reflect this new reality.<br><br><a href=#c4003241716267484750 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 2:51 PM</a><br><br>

Harry, that sounds like a very good approach! Kudos to you and your lodge.<br><br>Grebulocities, depends on the lodge. These days, there are quite a few younger men and women joining lodge organizations. As for books on Masonry, I don't know the specific one you mention; there's a lot of crap out there. Christopher Hodapp's <i>Freemasons for Dummies</i> is a good basic introduction. <br><br>Leo, got it in one. <br><br>Renaissance, exactly. As I commented in <a href=../../2011/06/how-not-to-play-game_500.html rel=nofollow>a previous post</a>, the only way to win is not to play the game. <br><br>Librarian, I've been saying for some time that the Rust Belt is where the next America is going to be born, and it's good to see Pittsburgh stepping up to the plate. By all means share this with your grandfather. <br><br>Yupped, that's a fascinating supposition. Not sure how to test it, but it's certainly plausible.<br><br>John, where do you think the Freemasons got their three degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason? <br><br>YJV, "private" doesn't necessarily mean "owned by an individual;" it just means "not owned by a government." <br><br>Unknown, good heavens, keep that order going! Get out there and interface with high school and college German classes, community groups, anything that will get the name out there and catch the attention of potential younger members. We Masons have learned that a lot of young people are desperate for the kind of community and activity that a fraternal order can provide, and lederhosen and beer steins can't be any more campy than some of the things that have a place in Masonry. Make the effort, and I predict you'll find people ready to listen to your message and build a gemütlich future for the order. <br><br>Raven, it's fascinating to me how many people like to insist that any good venture must inevitably be destroyed by their favorite bogeyman -- in your case, the state. It's an interesting habit, and will get a post one of these days. <br><br>Mallow, if there isn't enough in the way of resources to go around, someone's going to have to decide who gets help and who doesn't. It doesn't have to be your neighbors, but it's going to be somebody, and some thought about how to make that process as fair as possible would be appropriate now.<br><br><a href=#c7757479939625628770 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 3:51 PM</a><br><br>

That in itself speaks of a curious prejudice, one not to be found within lodge doors!<br><br>Unknown Deborah, I'm not at all sure that the Great Depression was that much worse than the Long Depression of the late 19th century, and the latter was the heyday of American fraternalism; furthermore, the collapse of American lodge organizations happened after 1960, not in the Great Depression. I suspect that there's been a fair amount of ex post facto justification woven into current narratives. <br><br>Unknown, glad to hear it. Icke and his peers are just the latest in a long string of hatemongers who've learned that it's more lucrative to fling smear stories about people who are doing good in the world than it is to do some good themselves. <br><br>Mark, exactly! I spoke of the Masons and the Odd Fellows because I have personal experience of the ways they do things; plenty of churches and other community organizations had their own ways of helping. <br><br>Nestorian, now go back and read my post, and you'll find that I said that entitlement payments for the poor amount to around 2% of the budget, and payouts that can be classed as corporate welfare are around 5%. That doesn't mean the rest of the budget goes to the middle class, because the government budget includes a lot more besides entitlement payments. Honestly, a little reading comprehension would help!<br><br>Carly, are you a member of your local Eastern Star chapter? That might be a good start. <br><br>Scott, remember that they're not all going to be cut off at once. It'll be a gradual process -- and in fact it's been going on for years now. <br><br>Allie, interesting! Good to see someone trying something along these lines. <br><br>John, er, please go back and read my response. Perhaps I need to be even clearer: this specific approach can't be scaled up to solve that specific problem. That doesn't mean the problem is insoluble; that means that a different approach needs to be used. <br><br>Mark, as I mentioned to Unknown Deborah a while back, the heyday of American fraternalism was in the Long Depression of the late 19th century, so your basic supposition is incorrect. It's precisely when times are hard that mutual aid organized through voluntary associations makes the most sense.<br><br><a href=#c2367918052728787131 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 4:06 PM</a><br><br>

You get tonight's gold star for paying attention to history. The confraternities, by the way, were the template for the medieval guild system, out of which Freemasonry and several others of the older fraternal orders emerged. <br><br>Twilight, the fraternal orders did fairly well during the Depression, so long as they were smart enough not to invest their benefit funds in the stock market. It was the Great Society programs of the 1960s that crushed them. Again, I'd point out that the bitter Long Depression of the late 19th century was the heyday of American fraternalism, so hard times aren't an obstacle -- quite the contrary, they help convince people that mutual aid is a good idea. <br><br>Andy, not so off-topic as all that. The point of right-to-work laws is to make it impossible for unions to protect their commons, and so force a tragedy of the commons on them. <br><br>Wullow, in the US the American Medical Association had a huge role in ending the arrangements by which lodges hired physicians to provide their members with health care. Because the lodges put yearly contracts out to bid, and held physicians responsible for incompetent care, "lodge practice" (as it was called) held down health care costs and made it impossible for inept physicians to make a living. For both those reasons, it was intolerable to the AMA, and they put years of litigation and lobbying into the task of destroying it. <br><br>Joseph, well, to my mind it's a bit more complex than that. As presently constituted, most people in the Baby Boom generation can expect to get back quite a bit more money from social security than they paid into it. That's a major problem; of course you're quite right that all the solutions proposed to solve that problem are worse than the problem. <br><br>Kevin, that's another good example. <br><br>Kollapsnik, let's talk about that at Age of Limits! The short answer is yes, but it's going to require replacing some dysfunctional but popular organizational forms with others that work. <br><br>Harlan, exactly! Do you remember my post a couple of years back on binary thinking? The binary that says "the only alternative to massive government programs is a Hobbesian war of all against all" is as common as it is unhelpful. If this post can help your friend get untangled from that binary, I'll be delighted. <br><br>Rabtter, it's fairly simple: Freemasonry is always hated and feared by totalitarian movements. That word "totalitarian" has a specific meaning, by the way; it refers to any organization that claims authority over every part of its members' lives, and leaves no private sphere in which people can make up their own minds without asking permission from the state, the church, or what have you. <br><br>To be a Freemason is to define such a private sphere -- to say to the world, "this part of my life doesn't belong to the church or the state or anyone else, only to me, my brother Masons, and deity." Totalitarians can't stand that. That's why Lenin, Hitler, and the Ayatollah Khomeini all banned Freemasonry immediately after seizing powerm, and why those extremist branches of Christianity that insist on the right to tell the whole world what to do in every aspect of life, however private, hate and fear Freemasonry as well.<br><br><a href=#c4094444524053077600 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 4:45 PM</a><br><br>

But when the economy recovers, the cuts will come. Well, the stock market's been rising for some months, unemployment is stable or falling, and housing is stable. <br><br>But we know that the long-term outlook is bleak, especially in the face of rising medical costs and other entitlements. Social Security is either in fine shape, or utterly hopeless, depending on whether you believe that there will be enough federal income to redeem the IOUs currently in the SS account. Let's suppose that the Powers That Be all know that entitlements MUST be cut. They also know that "the anonymous federal employee" is not thought to be a model of self-sacrificing efficiency nor a hero to the taxpayer. So they put on a big show of conflict to enable "devastating" cuts to spending on federal employees and contractors this year, paving the way to entitlement cuts in the years to come. Numerically, we're nearing the point at which every federal government employee could be laid off and still we would need to borrow more money to pay the entitlements, so a 10% cut in employee pay is little more than a symbolic gesture. But the symbolic gesture may be a necessary prelude to serious action.<br><br><br><a href=#c7923246827861525926 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 6:36 PM</a><br><br>

A lot of these were larger regional churches such as the Baptists and Christian Life ministries, but an amazing amount were small churches and other groups and even families and individuals all over the country that just got together, loaded a truck with food, water, blankets, diapers, and maybe a generator or two. They then sent the truck, be it a pickup or a tractor-trailer rig, along with a few volunteers to claim a parking lot somewhere and set up, or find a going recovery camp and join in.<br><br>I still get a lump in my throat when I think of a couple of meals I ate, provided by Organic Valley, cooked by Rainbow Family travellers and Seventh-day Adventist who had joined to serve people in one particular camp.

Do you remember the discussion of binary thinking a year and a half ago on this blog? Democrats like to insist that everyone who's poor is poor because somebody is oppressing them, Republicans like to say that everyone who's poor is poor because they're immoral. In this way the fact -- and it is a fact, of course -- that poverty has many causes, and some people are poor as a result of circumstances beyond their control while others are poor because of their own choices and habits, gets lost in the resulting bickering. I suggest a willingness to look past the reflexive habit of binary thinking is called for here. <br><br>Justin, I consider the creation of private community libraries, which are supported by dues and donations and so don't have to depend on failing government funding, to be one of the major tasks of the next decade or so.

Bowling alone chronicles the decline in all forms of social capital in the USA since 1960 from fraternal orders to bowling leagues. The title comes from the fact that bowling attendance has increased in absolute terms while league participation is down in absolute terms. The second book is a survey of institutions in America that have bucked the trend and managed to create social capital and powerful democratic structures that accomplished meaningful goals on the very local level. My favorite is the Dudley Street Neighbourhood Initiative which managed to get eminent domain rights allocated to the neighbourhood association.<br><br> I have a theory about the decline of empires, industrial civilization, nobility, etc. All of them rose to prominence on the basis of some merit and fell due to a lack of it. At its most basic the theory goes like this: hardship necessitates practice. Practice develops mastery. Mastery makes life easy. Easy living is bad for you. Ben Franklin put it well when he said "To be thrown upon one's own resources, is to be cast into the very lap of fortune; for our faculties then undergo a development and display an energy of which they were previously unsusceptible." Modern American's are a point in case. We used to be industrious, frugal, and self-reliant and now we are lazy, dependant, spendthrifts.<br><br> We owe our present national character to fantastic gifts our forefathers gave us. In 1950 we were producing and consuming half of the world's oil supply and we were the undisputed military, economic and political master of the globe. Two generations later we are heavily in debt and from manufacturing to governance we are incapable of doing anything for ourselves. Spoiled children.<br><br> Of coarse one can't help who one was born to any more than one can helped how one was raised. This segues nicely to the favorite bogeyman problem; the neighbours or government or capitalists that you distrust were born to and raised by your neighbours and capitalists and governments. We are all human and if we weren't deeply flawed we wouldn't be facing the long descent that you all come here to read about. Any solution to our problems has to work with those deeply flawed human beings. That is, of course, the basic challenge, how to make a system work with when working with human beings. The basic flaw of the favorite bogeyman argument is that jerks and slackers come from some opposed ideology but jerks and slackers come from being human. We have to find a solution that works tolerably well in spite of our shortcomings. <br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim<br><br><a href=#c195848785894809677 title="comment permalink">2/21/13, 10:07 PM</a><br><br>

There's a 5-10 page summary on laws related to sexual behavior in Colonial Virginia. As the law reads, bastardy and adultery were illegal. But for bastardy only males were prosecuted, and only if they were making no effort to provide child support. Given that the state and local governments had no apparatus to enforce child support and the reluctance of courts to supervise injunctions with a duration of years, it looks like a stopgap to use criminal law to carry out a social welfare function. <br><br>Adultery was prosecuted only when the parties made it a public matter, as when a wife and her lover went put of their way to call attention to their relationship and humiliate the husband. Although it would be a century or so before Brandeis used the phrase "right of privacy", the theme appears to be that if you kept the proceedings in the bedroom, the law would't take notice.<br><br>The book is by an academic historian, Cynthia Kierner. It concerns a scandal involving members of the prominent Randolph family, one of who unwisely got herself impregnated by her brother-in-law. She lived under a cloud for many years until the richest man in New York, Gouverneur Morris, made an honest woman of her. Gouverneur got around. He performed the unglamorous but necessary scut work of arranging financing for the American Revolution and served as Ambassador to France during the Terror, not a job for a scardey-cat. In between, he showed up for some high-level discussions of applied political theory in Philidelphia. Since he took the best set of notes, they let write up the working draft of their conclusions. We've all read many of his sentences, the most famous one of which begins "We, the People".<br><br>So girls, if you do some unwise things and get a bad reputation, there's hope for getting a respectable guy.

But I think for some domains like education or health care the need for rationing the energy input doesn’t imply so much need for rationing the overall services output on the contrary to other kind of commons.<br><br>For example , what is the energy content of a doctor ?<br><br>If you live in the U.S, you can add the energy content of a high-tech medicine campus with a gym of 10 000 seats and a BMW, a mac-mansion, vacation in the Bahamas for every physician ... etc. I understand that if you live in the U.S. you can have the impression that if energy availability decreases, there will not be enough doctors for everyone.<br><br>But if you think about what is the minimum energy input for a health system ? Some physician and nurses to feed, whatever roofs under which you pile the sick, and some laboratories where to manufacture some vaccines and a dozen of the most needed molecules. You can go without most of other licenced drugs or high-tech placebo.<br><br>This is why some poor countries can achieve results in terms of health almost as good as in the US at a fraction of the cost.<br><br>To summarize, the "energy content" of a physician is directly proportional to the "energy content" of the average lifestyle while the service he provide doesn’t depend of it. When we say proportional, it can be five times in the case of a elitist health care system which limits the number of physicians, but it can be just one time in a system where physician are happy with an average life style.<br><br>All I want to say is that if there is a rationing of the number of doctor or services strictly by lack of resources, this is when you can not feed more mouths than those who work in the fields. In this case, hairdressers will have disappeared long before the doctors. But one can argue that in the case of a long decline in the availability of energy, we start from such levels that we will still have enough energy for centuries to have a significant portion of the population available for anything other than working in the fields.<br><br>So, if there is nevertheless a rationing, it is more caused by internal locking in the system. The type of locking described by Tainter when he describes the way in which the elite is resisting any questioning of the status quo that has benefited to them until then. If the doctors’ “guild” prefer to remain few and well paid, we can call this an artificial rationing. In this case there is a multiplier effect to rationing : something which should sound like : "we can’t have a a space as comfortable as it used to be" can become "we can’t provide care to everyone."<br><br>Imagine a society where resource availability decreases by x%. One can imagine several ways of resolving it. The more common way is when everyone clings to its portion of resource and then it has to give way somewhere. In this case the strongest minority will maintains its share and the majority of the population will see its share of resource fall for much more than x%. The second way which more difficult is when everybody manage to deal with a decrease of its share of x%.<br><br>For me, it does not necessarily invalidate your argument for a more localize and cooperative way to deal with the commons, but I don’t think the question is that of the limits on access to resources” or that of the too deep pockets of the government, or that welfare is not possible in an energy constraint world. <br><br>I think the argument is rather that maybe a more local system will manages the decrease of x% more equitably while the status quo will lead to an artificial rationing of more than x%.<br><br>PS : I hope that this post is not too long and that <br>my English is not too difficult to read as it is not my mother tongue<br><br><a href=#c2972005873631000338 title="comment permalink">2/22/13, 12:48 AM</a><br><br>

Local poor farms where people worked the land in return for limited shelter and food have been replaced by governmental subsidies, not to the indigent as the primary beneficiary, but to the slumlords who participate in the subsidy programs.

My point was that your description of the basis for your figures was incomplete - which it is: No source is provided, definitions of the categories are lacking, definitions of what constitutes a payment to each of the categories is lacking, etc.<br><br>The bottom line is that I find it very hard to believe that the wealthy and the poor receive 5% and 2%, respectively, of the total federal budget. That may be true if you understand these shares narrowly in terms of DIRECT transfer payments, subsidies, etc., - though I find even that claim dubious. <br><br>In the end, though, a full reckoning of the allocations must take into account INDIRECT means of benefiting from government largesse as well. For example, it is mostly the wealthy who own shares in large defense corporations such as Raytheon, Dyncorp, Lockheed-Martin, etc. Any portion of the personal wealth accrued on this basis, whether as capital gains, stock dividends, or bond interest, ought to count as an indirect government transfer payment to the rich. Any salary their middle class employees receive ought to be counted as government transfer payments to the middle class.<br><br>The notion that these constitute indirect government transfer payments is predicated, of course, on the notion that defense is largely parasitic on the rest of the productive economy. As such, those who benefit financially from defense are essentially the recipients of government handouts.<br><br>When these sorts of considerations concerning what constitutes an indirect transfer payment enter the picture, the accounting of who, in the end, gets what from the government among the rich, middle class, and poor, becomes much more complicated than it may be at first glance.<br><br>But, as I say, I am skeptical even of the 5% and 2% claims that seem to entail direct transfers of wealth to the rich and poor, and I would be interested to know what the basis of these figures is.<br><br><br><a href=#c2378800981991796689 title="comment permalink">2/22/13, 7:28 AM</a><br><br>

When resources are scarce, cooperation and getting along with neighbors are key. <br> I would imagine there would be a need for poor houses and "state farms" for those who were not connected to a group, or who have mental or substance abuse issues that interfere with the ability to get along and contribute in a group.<br><br><a href=#c4440063219756958250 title="comment permalink">2/22/13, 8:14 AM</a><br><br>

Listener/member supported, volunteer run, and also not part of the NPR "network"...true local radio. Of course we exist in FM ghetto, the far left of the dial (though the political spectrum runs the gamut). Membership based and operated media venues -and I do hope radio will exist far into the future- is definitely worth supporting. Entire subcultures of musicians have been built around some of the more diverse programs on the station, like Art Damage where I got my start. A good community radio station can really help to establish and create culture. Of course, as the station is run by the board elected at our annual meetings, it has the same problems and issues as any other group operating through those means. What I've noticed however is that the people who complain the loudest about the politics at the station are the ones who are least involved aside from their respective programs. If they really wanted to change the way the station is run -and there have been many boards and many variations of change- all they have to do is step up to the plate with their time and sweat equity. Still this is just one example of a good alternative to clear channel.<br><br><a href=#c1268144872248294551 title="comment permalink">2/22/13, 8:14 AM</a><br><br>

Many believe that relatively monolithic ethnic and cultural background combined to historically strong central governments of these countries has a lot to do with this success. But even here high point of state welfare has been reached. We live in the world of growing demand for inputs and diminishing returns when it comes to welfare systems. Unfunded liabilities are just too great. Mathematically thinking, we are f**ed. <br><br>Coming from working class background, I get no ideological satisfaction from this observation. System just does not work as well as it used to work. Growing number of people are gaming the system, just as you described. The rest are coming more cynical about whole system. When faith dies, systemic collapse follows. Not immediately, but it comes. <br><br>In Old World we have two delusional political belief systems competing for highest power right now. Other believes that bureaucratically controlled, nationless welfare state saves the day. Their straw man is somekind evil ubercapitalist conspiracy lurking like Great Old Ones from Lovecraft novels behind every economic misfortune. Bourgeois rising from city of R'lyeh and all that. Other belief system rallies its troops around some fantasy construct called "free trade". Historical fact that there has NEVER been truly free market does not bother these troops at all. Their straw man is mythic regulator beast, whose artificial limitations prevents heaven on Earth happening. <br><br>It is horrendously obvious that when ship is not only without captain, but position of captain is fought over by two lunatic coxswains, the ship is doomed. Question is just when exactly that ship is going to Davy Jones' Locker. As high priests of these belief systems are stumbling from one abysmal failure to other, we ordinary folks have to find some reliable support groups to cushion that sinking for ourselves. Brotherhood organizations from old times are not bad place to start with. <br><br>I believe mindblowingly rapid expansion of gang culture into Western society is first symptom of this new feudalism. From what I have read about USA, gang culture has changed all functions of society in inner cities from 60's onwards; that is very rapid pace for as big historical change as that is. Same thing is happening right now in Western European cities also, with even more distinct ethnic and religious dividing lines between turfs. What an enormous change, this rebirth of warband culture inside heartlands of modern civilizations.<br><br>There is one common feature in successful grassroots communities. They must organically grow from society surrounding them. When people establish "ideal" communities from some abstract philosophical standpoints, they just learn hard way how perfectly imperfect human being is. I believe over there in USA amish communities are doing just fine, while hippie communities of swinging 60's are dead, boring and prehistoric memories for newer generations. That is how it goes. If you have to build co-operative the way writers imagine utopist communities in sci-fi literature, you have already failed. It is better just give it up and drink couple of beers while watching football than waste your time.<br><br>Loyalty is scarcity resource in our hedonistic times. It cannot be bought, and to work as it should be it has to work both ways. And religion is ALWAYS stronger bond that some philosophical blathering. If your group is honestly religious, with roots anchoring it to existing traditions, your community has survival chances at least.<br><br><a href=#c7427898552197944281 title="comment permalink">2/22/13, 8:48 AM</a><br><br>

Still, that it isn't new doesn't make it less relevant. <br><br>Second Wind, Icke claims that the people he doesn't like -- for example, the current queen of England -- are evil space reptiles who thirst for human blood. That's hatemongering. (It's also psychotic, but that's a different point.) I didn't say, by the way, that Icke had called me an evil space lizard; it was some of his followers that called me that to my face. <br><br>Vincent, that's quite true, and it's one of the reasons I've been proposing all along that it's possible to have a society with relatively complex technology on a renewable basis. The difficulty in getting from here to there is that all our infrastructure, and all our institutions, presuppose the current extravagant use of energy and raw materials. Getting alternative structures built in time involves substantial costs and faces all-out resistance from those -- for example, the current US medical industry -- who profit from the status quo. <br><br>Cherokee, yes, the middle classes in pre-fossil fuel societies usually amounted to around 10% of the population at most. I hadn't thought of describing our present situation as Peak Middle Class, but it's a valid way to look at it. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, thank you! I hope my atheist readers are taking notes. <br><br>Cherokee, another possibility is that the people in question are interested in building a little empire for themselves, and see growing the organization as a way to do that.

Getting libraries into the hands of voluntary associations in the community, who aren't dependent on tax revenues, is a crucial step.

The other great benefit of involvement in such a group is that once you learn how it's done, you can do the same things in other contexts. <br><br>Justin, another excellent example. I'd like to see more interfacing between the alternative broadcast radio scene and the ham radio community -- there's a lot of common ground in terms of technique and technology, and my guess is that connections between the two could become the seed for the long-distance communications and media net of the future. <br><br>Maria, excellent. As we used to say back in the day, 'tis an ill wind that blows no minds. <br><br>Vera, you're absolutely right -- there are deserving and undeserving rich as well.

That's a glorious image. <br><br>Onething, I expect to see fuel and a lot of other things rationed by price and by political connections, and the tighter supplies get, the more extreme the divergence between those who have access to them and those who don't. As for the notion of the very rich huddling in their guarded compounds, it's a common fantasy, even among the rich -- and nobody seems to think about the guards, who aren't themselves rich, and can take everything for themselves by the simple expedient of pointing their assault rifles at their erstwhile employers and letting off a burst or two.

That can be expressed in the language of morality, which was a language that people in the 19th century found congenial and useful, but it can also be expressed in terms more congenial and useful to people today.

Thanks. <br><br>Two relevant items:<br><br>First to the poster who asked about the history of poor farms: A commercial venture here in Oregon, McMenamin's Brothers Brewery, have been buying up old historical buildings and turning them into charming outlets for their beers, wines and distilled spirits. One such is the old poor farm at Edgefield. They have published an informative pamphlet on the original operation of the farm and it's various changes up to the present. It's a excellent introduction into how the poor farm system worked, at least in this case. It probably varied from place to place. Easy to find online.<br><br>Second, JMG, you will be pleased to know that a tired and failing old Grange in the Applegate (not far from your prior stomping grounds) was quickly seen as an opportunity and snatched up by a group of young farmers. Still in it's first year it has what I guess are common birthing pains. But the simple fact that the young CSA and farmer's market growers of this area understand the value of this association is most encouraging.<br><br>Addendum: I read here much and comment rarely.

That's what makes it one form of middle class welfare."</i><br><br>Before I begin, let me be the first to say that I'm pretty pragmatic about Social Security. We can afford what we can afford and no more, and that is the key point on which the future of Social Security must turn.<br><br>Having said that, I take issue with the oft-stated comment that retirees will take more out of the system than they put in to it. While this statement may be true in nominal dollar terms, this is not the correct way to calculate contributions and withdrawals. Just as Social Security's expected shortfall is always brought back to a "net present value" ("NPV")figure, so an individual's contributions should be calculated in NPV terms as well. For those who aren't up on this term, NPV attempts to account for the time value of money. Inflation, of course, is a prime component of any NPV calculation. A dollar in 2013 is a far cry from a dollar in 1970.<br><br>I did an NPV calculation for my own contributions and found the NPV value to be almost 2.5 times the sum in nominal dollars. (I used the CPI to convert contributions in past years to NPV.) When I compared this NPV value with the value that I would be expected to draw out given an average life expectancy (as an NPV value, of course), the figures matched almost exactly.<br><br>I guess the Social Security Administration does have a few Actuaries on its staff after all;)<br><br>Before I get flamed for this post, let me reiterate that I don't believe that I either deserve or will receive payments that match my contributions. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go program, and I suspect that we simply won't be able to afford to pay future retirees the NPV of the contributions they made over their working lives. Such are the times we live in.<br><br>But the often-made claim that retirees draw out more than they contributed, and that Social Security is thus a form of middle class welfare, doesn't appear to be justified when one actually does the math.<br><br><a href=#c2395066493122103520 title="comment permalink">2/22/13, 5:13 PM</a><br><br>

For some years now I've been very intrigued with his observations of how the citizens of the U.S. had a tendency to form an organization to solve a problem.<br><br>Now Justin Patrick Moore has mentioned the fascinating idea of forming a private lending library to share and preserve the sort of knowledge that will be needed as we move into this uncertain future. This is really clicking with me. I suppose it's worth attempting to get some of the existing libraries to take this on as part of their mission, but it will be a tough sell to many of them. Here in Vermont we have many excellent if tiny libraries and some may embrace it enthusiastically (and will probably tell us that they've been trying to do this all along!) However, my local librarian keeps telling me that she has to get rid of one book for every book she takes in. So, if it turns out that the existing libraries are not up to this function, we should work to establish libraries dedicated to just this sort of preservation of useful and critical knowledge.<br> <br>I'm used to thinking of a library as a relatively large entity, but a few hundred volumes on a limited range of subjects could serve an important function, as long as it is kept in a safe location and properly curated. In recognition of the mission of preserving the books, it could be organized such that it is easier to add a book to the collection than to permanently remove one (I have to think about that--space will always be an issue).<br><br>And this idea ties in with the ongoing discussion of the concept of the common. This idea of making the books part of a common seems very powerful to me. Otherwise, any individual's collection is all too likely to be dispersed as they age or die.<br><br><a href=#c5514044791083712904 title="comment permalink">2/22/13, 5:29 PM</a><br><br>

Reminds me of an interesting chapter in Chicago history...<br><br>When the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) started during the Great Depression, it started with the idea that all worthy poor people should get decent housing. That meant the poor had to meet certain criteria – couldn't be a drunk (probably no drinking at home), had to have a job or actively looking at one, pass an interview process as well as an application, and learn to tolerate people unlike yourself (as you'd be living right next door to them at CHA housing. Whites lived with their next door neighbors being black, and blacks lived with their next door neighbors being white). In short, the poor people wanting to move in had to prove themselves as Deserving the help.<br><br>And as for those judged Undeserving? There were plenty of slums, SROs and low-rent motels in which they could drink themselves into a stupor, try to find a husband for their multiplying one-parent family, or struggle to meet rent while avoiding work.<br><br>So what caused the change? A change at the top, during WWII. The new guy felt he couldn't in his right mind refuse anyone an available apartment if they were poor, so soon enough the CHA began to go downhill as drunks and other lowlifes were allowed to live on CTA property. This, of course, came before Project Towers, the Great Society, the abandonment of the city by Industry and the post-Carter Ghetto Malaise (which worsens with every year).<br><br>It will be interesting to see if the concepts of "Deserving Poor" and "Undeserving Poor" make their way back into public discourse. Right now it seems that the only concept that has any traction is "The Poor as Undeserving (by dint of asking for help)."<br><br><a href=#c6922325545032660814 title="comment permalink">2/22/13, 10:49 PM</a><br><br>

Take the case of $100 contributed in 1970. The CPI was 38.8 (average) that year. In 2012, the CPI stood at 229.6, nearly a 6-fold increase. So the $100 contribution in 1970 dollars is equivalent to nearly $600 in 2012 dollars. <br><br>The idea is to quote all past SS contributions in today's dollars. You really have to do it this way because there's no way that a $100 contribution in 2012 compares to a $100 contribution in 1970. Total them all up to get the value of a person's total contributions in today's dollars.<br><br>For withdrawals, take the monthly benefit and multiply it by the number of months a person is expected to collect the benefit. For a person who has reached the full retirement age (66), the life expectancy from that point is a few months shy of 18 years. Men and women are lumped together for this calculation because the law prohibits different benefits based on gender. You don't have to worry about cost of living adjustments for this calculation because they are always equivalent to the same amount of money in today's dollars.<br><br>While I have not yet reached full retirement age, I am close enough to get a pretty good fix on the total conributions and the dollar amount of the benefit. In my case, a back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates I will pay in about 1.5% more than I will collect in benefits, assuming average life expectancy. I suspect that the 1.5% covers the cost of administering the SS program, although I am not sure of this.<br><br>Obviously, if one dies before reaching retirement age, it's all gravy for the SS program -- or rather for the US Treasury.<br><br>All this assumes that the CPI is a reliable guide to what's happening to our money over time. Opinions vary on this issue, but it is the measure that the Social Security Administration uses, so I used it also.<br><br><a href=#c7266929846229272187 title="comment permalink">2/23/13, 1:05 AM</a><br><br>

(The oft quoted ‘Hobbesian’ world view of uncivilised humanity: “life … nasty … brutish … short” did not refer the Middle Ages.) Thanks to you both.<br> <br>However, just in case there might be a connection, I mention that I have long struggled with the ‘Christian’ view that ‘original sin’ requires that every infant needs to be instructed top-down and trained early to moral values and obedience against its ‘natural’ inclination. I have seen many a self-fulfilling series that followed from this notion and generally with very poor outcomes in what actually turns out a very dubious moral universe, despite our ‘best intentions’.<br><br>I also congratulate @Helix on his calculation of social security payment and his receipt of NPV adjusted benefits (net present value calculation). As a retired government scientist in the UK I have a very reasonable work pension alongside my very modest ‘universal’ State Pension. These are both paid out of current taxation. One of the reasons I am keen on people paying their taxes /;-) and on a fair distribution of the tax burden, but I fully expect a reduction in our purchasing power (wife and I) as the years go on. <br><br>Whether I made a net welfare contribution during my working life is hard to assess. Aggregate conventional prosperity hardly depended on my ‘hard work’, though I tried hard to make sense of my work, but, for good and ill, depended mostly on the way our society extracted ‘work’ from firstly coal and later more effectively from oil and NG. (My first job was digging trenches by hand for the building of a primary school in England in 1959. I rode to work on my bicycle. My parents’ house was heated with coal/coke, cooking was by coal-gas, and electricity from coal-fired power stations.)<br><br>I guess in economic terms it does not matter much whether it is taxpayers or me who spend the largesse, as long as the ‘energy wheel’ goes round. If we all in future extract far less, i.e. ‘net’, from the energy wheel, then so be it. Generally the lower income groups are more generous than the better-off, so I expect to be fed and both ends kept clean, while I complete my personal cycle.<br>best <br>Phil<br> <br>PS JMG your book <i>“Not the Future We Ordered”</i> has this second arrived from Karnac books.

Let's just say you'd need to be able to run pretty fast. <br><br>Rita, no that's not what I said. In some societies the burden of care for the baby would be with the whole community, not just the mother and her nuclear family. Or the baby might be adopted by the father's family, another unrelated family or distant relatives or given to the care of some religious organisation which in turn might be supported by the whole community. In other societies the father would be pretty unarguable because they're small enough that everyone would know who was partnered with whom, whether married or not.

Feeling of hate behind written lines is so deep you can almost touch it. When I wrote first to this blog, some commenters automatically connected me to extreme forms of politics, just because I defended role of Christianity as defining narrative of descendants of (Old and New) Rome.

Around 1955, when I was about 13, in my public school in Berkeley, California there was a state-mandated course in civics, taught from a small green pamphlet published by the California state government. It emphasized the necessity of making distasteful [and even immoral] compromises for any democratic government to work. I put "and even immoral" in square brackets because that part was not explicit, but implicit: the prime example used in our class to show the political necessity of immoral compromises was the well-known compromise about slavery and the counting of slaves embodied in the United States Constitution. It was emphasized that there would have been no United States without accepting that compromise, or something quite like it and equally immoral by our present standards. <br><br>Our own teacher softened the blow of this hard datum to our young and tender sensibilities somewhat by making a hypothetical argument that there might not be any such thing as "natural rights" (or even a natural, universal morality) at all, but that all these things might be nothing other than temporary and transient social or political constructs. This possibility did indeed soften the blow, at least for me and many of my classmates.<br><br>Fast-forward some 10-20 years, to the decades when the counter-culture, as it was called, was in full bloom in the United States. It was an era preoccupied with arguments on morality and ethics (on the right and on the left side of politics alike), especially as applied to the treatment of the oppressed. What had begun as a struggle for the "civil rights" (so called) of Blacks in the 1950s soon developed into a more general crusade for a moral and ethical social order. This was something that felt quite new go most of us at the time, though I later learned that it did have deep, if thin and obscure, roots in earlier US history. <br><br>The little green pamphlet on civics was soon retired, and it soon became utterly impossible to use the "slavery compromises" of the Constitition as an effective argument for the necessity of political compromise. (Within the last few weeks the President of Emory University found out the hard way that it is still impossible and even dangerous to use this example in arguing for the necessity of political compromises. He did so, and his academic career now seems to be over.)<br><br>One must never, it soon came to be widely accepted, compromise at all on any moral or ethical issue whatever, no matter what goal the compromise might further. Wrong was wrong, and that was an end to any possible argument! Or so it seemed to me at the time. <br><br>And as the '70s gave place to the '80s and the '90s, somehow more and more issues came to be couched in ethical or moral terms, and thus placed beyond any possibility of political compromise. By now, almost all significant national issues are so couched, and compromise is not to be had on any important matter at all.<br><br>And thus we came to our present impasse.<br><br>I should add that this is specifically United States history, thought it has had an impact on the rest of the English-speakign world and beyond. Never forget, please, that the United States was largely populated by people who had left Europe precisely because they hated, feared or despised its then current forms of government and politics. These European forms of government and politics were often effective, of course, and thus they had to be used used, but that did not mean that they were widely respected. There was always an effort to overturn them (if one was radical), or to recast them into a supposed older, nobler form (if one was less radical). Hence the constant use of Ancient Roman republican government (often only as Livy had presented it) as a model for the United States.<br><br><a href=#c5113051389353187220 title="comment permalink">2/24/13, 12:11 PM</a><br><br>

Helix's method of calculating that seems reasonable to me, although I haven't checked the numbers.<br><br>Whether there will be enough money in the system to pay promised benefits in the future is a different question requiring a separate calculation. <br><br>Unlike private defined-benefit pension systems, in which contributions are invested to generate future income, SS payroll tax is not set aside. Most of the money is paid out immediately to current retirees. Some is set aside (at least as a bookkeeping entry) to deal with demographic fluctuations, but it isn't invested in anything that produces income.<br><br>This has nothing to do with whether people pay in over their working life as much as they expect to collect. It's the ratio of payroll tax-paying workers and employers in any given year that matters. If a lot of workers and employers are supporting a handful of retired people, they can contribute a pittance and the system breaks even. Conversely, if a small workforce is supporting a huge population of elderly Boomers, they can be taxed to starvation levels and the system still runs short of money.<br><br> If the ratio of workers paying in rises relative to the number of current retirees, whether from more people entering the workforce or more people dying before they are old enough to qualify for benefits, the system is easily currently solvent. <br><br>Conversely, if the size of the workforce paying into the system shrinks in relation to the size of the population collecting benefits, the system may run a deficit. <br><br>At present Social Security is running a surplus because only a few of the Baby Boomers have reached retirement age and applied for benefits. Most are still working and paying payroll taxes. Boomers are a much larger group than any of the generations born before them, older generations whose survivors are currently receiving payments, so plenty of money is coming in to cover those payments. <br><br>However, as more Boomers reach retirement age, the number of people eligible to collect payments will for a while rise faster than the size of the younger workforce paying in, because Boomers are a larger cohort than their juniors and have proved to be a fairly healthy, long-lived group. Most are are living long enough to collect from the system for many years. Because there are not sufficient younger people employed when and after the Boomers all hit retirement age, a deficit is projected.<br><br>(continued in next post because of length cap)<br><br><a href=#c6300418051511590705 title="comment permalink">2/24/13, 5:30 PM</a><br><br>

Some of them were successfully implemented the last time Social Security was overhauled about twenty years ago.<br>Here's a list of every solution I can think of:<br><br>1. Increase the size of the workforce paying in. Achievable through full employment, increasing the youthful population through immigration or a higher birthrate, lowering the death and disability rates for people in their earning years, expanding the categories of employment subject to payroll tax, or cracking down on people working off the books.<br><br>2. Raise payroll taxes. Raise the rate on employees, employers or both, or eliminate the current cap on taxable wages so that every dollar earned is subject to payroll tax. <br><br>3. Reduce people's eligibility to collect. Require more years of employment before one may receive minimum benefits (currently ten years), raise eligibility age, raise age for getting maximum benefit. <br><br>4. Reduce the size of payments. Current proposal is to tinker with the formula for cost of living increases. <br><br>5. Tax the payments received by some or all of the recipients, to collect some of the money back. Usually this is proposed as a tax on the SS pensions of the wealthy. <br><br>6. Instead of relying solely on employment taxes to fund Social Security, support it with other tax revenues.<br><br>7. Abolish Social Security altogether. The problem with this is that people will refuse to pay taxes to support current retirees if they have no prospect of receiving anything themselves in the future.<br><br><a href=#c4576720284695497045 title="comment permalink">2/24/13, 5:33 PM</a><br><br>

Your subsequent comments have of course dispelled that false impression. <br><br>What a fascinating question - is there a good non-partisan recent history of the US that explains the poisoned political atmosphere? No one book specific to that topic comes to mind. However, I would caution you that there have been deep divisions within the US in the past, and these often get papered over in the history books, so the current division you see is not necessarily a new phenomena, although it may spring from new sources. The violent labour struggles in the early 20th century and the attempted fascist plot in the 1930s are two often-neglected counterexamples to the stable republic narrative, for instance. <br><br>Personally, I would argue that a lot of the current paranoia and mistrust comes from the fact that there's been a distressing lack of openness about certain events since our ascent to world empire after World War II. The political assassinations of the 1960s are a prime example; whatever were the actual causes and guilty parties, I would argue that lack of a full accounting was quite damaging to the integrity of the political system. Furthermore this leads to people projecting the blame on their perceived political enemies, and to very unhelpful extreme binary thinking (e.g., there was no conspiracy, the government is telling the full and complete truth about the lone nut versus it was a massive government conspiracy). Realize also, these events take place against a background of creeping executive-branch police power and seeming continual war. <br><br><br><a href=#c1015765039100263574 title="comment permalink">2/24/13, 7:56 PM</a><br><br>

From what I do see, there is something of a resurgence, definitely in the production of hand-crafted saddles and blacksmithing. They hold conventions and have memberships in organizations and I suspect it might be a small step from there to mutual-support organizations like the Kiwanis or the Lions Club. <br>Consequently, some people are turning craft hobbies into part-time jobs, which sometimes become full-time. I suspect the precursor to re-localization is happening and there is an organic small-economy sprouting in the cracks between Monsanto and WalMart. There are a lot of crafts are being preserved by people as hobbies. I know hand-knitting has never enjoyed as much popularity as it has lately (almost everyone I know knits), which has given rise to a whole industry around to support that, with specialty wool shops, classes, and local farms raising specialty wool animals, such as Alpacas, and so on. Leatherwork is enjoying a resurgence, and there are blacksmith conventions where everyone trades knowledge and ideas and techniques. I know that since the second world war, (ironically thanks to MacArthur) Japan has a strong guild of sword-makers who freely share every thing they know, in contrast to times past when craftsmen kept trade secrets jealously guarded.... much like big industry does today.<br>As an aside, in Germany, at least until 1980 when I lived there for a year, they still used that system as it was supposed to be used. Germany has always had the iron and steel industry as a source of national pride, and their educational system was divided into three streams, early on, with children being separated out at age 10 for either trades, managers, or university doctorates. The trades would go to class during the morning, then apprentice at some production firm in the afternoon. They still had journeymen, who would do the more skilled work in the production places, but they would then move on after a few months and "journey" to the next shop to pick up whatever tips and improvements they could. After a few years, they would become masters and either be employed as senior skilled work at concerns or run their own businesses. It was alive 30 years ago, but I cannot say what the past years of economic upheaval have wrought and there is a very, very high unemployment rate there.<br><br><a href=#c4363829254092481461 title="comment permalink">2/25/13, 3:21 PM</a><br><br>

But the problem isn't Social Security. The problem is old people.<br><br>We've been through dotage with both my parents, and now we're going through it with my wife's father. Dotage: senile dementia. Popularly known as Alzheimer's. But it's broader than that: it's the whole collection of disabilities that come with age. As a society, we've learned a lot about nutrition, fixing the human body, and eradicating disease, and have done a great deal toward making work less mortally dangerous.<br><br>The result is a huge increase of people who outlive their productive years. You cannot put them to work. Once they tip into dementia, they don't even serve as repositories of wisdom, or "deep memory." They lose control of their bowels, and must be bathed. Sometimes, they need assistance to eat. They lose the will to engage in social activities. Sometimes they go mad and howl.<br><br>Solutions to this problem are much more difficult than doing an actuarial analysis of Social Security, and are made even more difficult by soulless calculations of profit and loss in some misguided "economic theory of nations." Here are the possible solutions:<br><br>1. "Bring outcher daid!" From the Monty Python skit in The Holy Grail. Look the other way while adult children "put down" their useless elders. A variant could empower agents of the state to do this on an impartial basis, perhaps the third time they lose their car keys.<br><br>2. Start a national program (and perhaps religion) to promote voluntary suicide, and provide easy access to suicide assistance and lethal drugs. Count on people to take care of themselves when the time comes.<br><br>3. Bring back smallpox or plague and let "acts of God" take care of this the way it has traditionally been done. A variant could be cutting off all medical care for anyone over the age of, say, eighty, so that "nature can take its course."<br><br>4. Ignore the problem as a "personal issue," and let families try to cope with it on their own. That's how it's done in Colombia, where my wife's father lives: old age is managed with personal wealth, then family support, and then the street. We're currently engaged in trying to keep Papito off the street.<br><br>5. Recognize the fundamental problem <i>we've caused</i> by promoting longer, healthier (physical) lives, and take it on as a problem of commons, with solutions like Social Security. Or, as the national system breaks down, more local equivalents. <br><br>This idea that "we can't afford to provide entitlements" is bunk, because if we don't provide for our elders -- and trust me, it's bloody expensive to care for those who pass into dotage -- we have to start killing them. We can look the other way while someone else clubs them and pretend we didn't do it, but I, for one, have never found that sort of self-deception very workable. Nor am I personally happy with a solution of homicide when the only issue with providing a comfortable close to a too-long life is -- remind me again? -- oh, right, "excessive taxation." That is, interfering with the private wealth machine. Which "creates" all that wealth for what purpose, again? I keep forgetting if "we" win a toaster oven, or a new iPod. <br><br>We're currently wasting 15.6% of wage income to care for our elders. We need to add 2% to make Social Security viable for the next 75 years. And that's apparently "too much." It leaves me speechless.<br><br><a href=#c3258907216157519228 title="comment permalink">2/25/13, 4:06 PM</a><br><br>

If one compares the "official" CPI figures to, for example, the major commodity indices, one observes a wild variance between them, with the CPI uniformly coming out on the bottom.<br><br>This actually results in Social Security recipients receiving far less in payouts than they contributed during their working years on a more realistic constant-dollar basis. I used CPI to calculate the value of contributions and benefits only because that's what the Social Security Administration uses. One could use the figures produced by, for example, John Williams at Shadowstats.com for a truly depressing (or enlightening?)exercise. I can do this calculation if readers are interested.<br><br>The original claim, however, was the Social Security was a form of middle-class warfare given that retiress would draw out far more in their retirement than they contributed during their working years. This is simply not true on a constant-dollar basis.<br><br>My view is that the greater issue for Social Security is what we can realistically and reasonably afford. I personally think two things should happen: 1) the cap should be removed. As it is, the cap on the payroll tax makes the entire US income tax code hugely regressive. If you want to talk about class warfare, here's one of the major battlefields. 2) The formula for benefits needs to be adjusted to the current economic conditions in the country. Social Security should pay out what it takes in over the long term and no more. It's a pay-as-you-go program where current workers pay for current retirees. If current workers are having to deal with economic hardship, seniors will have to deal with economic hardship also. Otherwise, "generations warfare" enters the discussion.<br><br>As to what happened to the money? Well, it went into the general fund and was spent, just as any other tax revenue. It's pretty clear to me that a lot of it was wasted on unnecessary wars, pork for special interests, and a huge buildup of unneeded, unwanted, and oppressive Federal programs. It is a sad comment on our times that "the land of the free" has been reduced to just another slogan by an onerous burden of regulations.<br><br>But I also believe that that which is unsustainable will eventually stop. And so I meditate on the musings of people like JMG, who have done some serious thinking about what life might require as that happens.<br><br><a href=#c1218886936756162701 title="comment permalink">2/26/13, 8:39 AM</a><br><br>

It has nothing to do with the returns of the actual investments held which may be earning nothing, going backwards or even only increasing a little bit.<br><br>Thirdly, the official interest rates from the Federal Reserve, where the investment is held are at or near zero, so any increase in benefits paid to beneficiaries over and above investment returns comes from capital funds (i.e. amounts paid in by people).<br><br>It may be of interest to you, but this is one of the indicators of a Ponzi scheme.

Most of the money taken in during one fiscal year is immediately paid out to retirees. If there is a surplus, it's held, but not invested in anything that would pay significant interest.<br><br>Obviously Social Security is not a Ponzi scheme, or it would have collapsed already instead of paying out as promised for more than seventy years. <br><br>Ponzi schemes give the highest returns to early investors, because they are pyramids. They are mathematically impossible to sustain, because the numbers of current investors must be many times larger than the number of payees. They collapse when you run out of investors. <br><br>Social Security payments are capped at or near a level that is sustainable from projected revenues, based on actuarial tables. People are required by law to pay in to the fund and the amount they pay in is predictable within broad limits.<br><br>Currently SS has two problems. The short term one, which is fixable, is that the rate of growth of the workforce has slowed down, owing partly to a slower rate of population growth and partly to the recession. The generation just getting to retirement age is outsize compared to younger generations who will have to pay their pensions. The numerical disparity is orders of magnitude lower than any Ponzi scheme, and can be dealt with. <br><br>The longer term problem is that the growth of the U.S. economy has slowed down and may, if JMG is right, reverse. Social Security has never yet operated in an economy or a population expected to shrink over the long term. Payment schedules are predicated on historical growth rates. If overall employment falls, and the people who are working are getting paid less, there won't be enough money coming in to pay out promised benefits.<br><br>Medicare will run out of money sooner than Social Security, because the cost of medical care in the U.S. has been rising much faster than inflation for a long time, and still is rising. This is a systemic problem. The right-wing solution is to give vouchers for medical care and expect that the free market will bring medical costs down to a level that the vouchers will cover.
