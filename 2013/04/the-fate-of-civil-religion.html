<![endif]-->To describe faith in progress as a religion, as I’ve done in these essays numerous times, courts a good many misunderstandings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The most basic of those comes out of the way that the word “religion” itself has been tossed around like a football in any number of modern society’s rhetorical scrimmages. Thus it’s going to be necessary to begin by taking a closer look at the usage of that much-vexed term. <br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The great obstacle here is that so many people these days insist that religion is a specific thing with a specific definition. Now of course it’s all too common for the definition in question to be crafted to privilege the definer’s own beliefs and deliver a slap across the face of rivals; that’s as true of religious people who want to define religion as something they have and other people don’t as it is of atheists who want to insist that what they have isn’t a religion no matter how much it looks like one. Still, there’s a deeper issue involved here as well. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The word “religion” is a label for a category. That may seem like an excessively obvious statement, but it has implications that get missed surprisingly often. Categories are not, by and large, things that exist out there in the world. They’re abstractions—linguistically, culturally, and contextually specific abstractions—that human minds use to sort out the disorder and diversity of experience into some kind of meaningful order. To define a category is simply to draw a mental boundary around certain things, as a way of stressing their similarities to one another and their differences from other things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To make the same point in a slightly different way, categories are tools, and a tool, as a tool, can’t be true or false; it can only be more or less useful for a given job, and slight variations in a given tool can be useful to help it do that job more effectively. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A lack of attention to this detail has caused any number of squabbles, ranging from the absurd to the profound. Thus, for example, when the International Astronomical Union announced a few years back that Pluto had been reclassified from a planet to a dwarf planet, some of the protests that were splashed across the internet made it sound as though astronomers had aimed a death ray at the solar system’s former ninth planet and blasted it out of the heavens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now of course they did nothing of the kind; they were simply following a precedent set back in the 1850s, when the asteroid Ceres, originally classified as a planet on its discovery in 1801, was stripped of that title once other objects like it were spotted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Pluto, as it turned out, was simply the first object in the Kuiper Belt to be sighted and named, just as Ceres was the first object in the asteroid belt to be sighted and named.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The later discoveries of Eris, Haumea, Sedna, and other Pluto-like objects out in the snowball-rich suburbs of the solar system convinced the IAU that assigning Pluto to a different category made more sense than keeping it in its former place on the roster of planets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The change in category didn’t affect Pluto at all; it simply provided a slightly more useful way of sorting out the diverse family of objects circling the Sun. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A similar shift, though in the other direction, took place in the sociology of religions in 1967, with the publication of Robert Bellah’s paper<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Civil Religion in America.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Before that time, most definitions of religion had presupposed that something could be assigned to that category only if it involved belief in at least one deity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Challenging this notion, Bellah pointed out the existence of a class of widely accepted belief systems that had all the hallmarks of religion except such a belief. Borrowing a turn of phrase from Rousseau, he called these “civil religions,” and the example central to his paper was the system of beliefs that had grown up around the ideas and institutions of American political life. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The civil religion of Americanism, Bellah showed, could be compared point for point with the popular theistic religions in American life, and the comparison made sense of features no previous analysis quite managed to interpret convincingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Americanism had its own sacred scriptures, such as the Declaration of Independence; its own saints and martyrs, such as Abraham Lincoln; its own formal rites—the Pledge of Allegiance, for example, fills exactly the same role in Americanism that the Lord’s Prayer does in most forms of Christianity popular in the United States—and so on straight down the list of religious institutions. Furthermore, and most crucially, the core beliefs of Americanism were seen by most Americans as self-evidently good and true, and as standards by which other claims of goodness and truth could and should be measured: in a word, as sacred. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
While Americanism was the focus of Bellah’s paper, it was and is far from the only example of the species he anatomized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When the paper in question first saw print, for example, a classic example of the type was in full flower on the other side of the Cold War’s heavily guarded frontiers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>During the century and a half or so from the publication of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i> to the implosion of the Soviet Union, Communism was one of the modern world’s most successful civil religions, an aggressive missionary faith preaching an apocalyptic creed of secular salvation. It shared a galaxy of standard features with other contemporary Western religions, from sacred scriptures and intricate doctrinal debates on down to steet-corner evangelists spreading the gospel among the downtrodden. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Even its vaunted atheism, the one obvious barrier setting it apart from its more conventionally religious rivals, was simply an extension of a principle central to the Abrahamic religions, though by no means common outside that harsh desert-centered tradition. The unyielding words of the first commandment, “Thou shalt have no other gods before me,” were as central to Communism as to Judaism, Christianity, or Islam; the sole difference in practice was that, since Communist civil religion directed its reverence toward a hypothetical set of abstract historical processes rather than a personal deity, its version of the commandment required the faithful to have no gods at all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Not all civil religions take so hard a line toward their theist rivals. Americanism is an example of the other common strategy, which can be described with fair accuracy as cooptation: the recruitment of the deity or deities of the locally popular theist religion as part of the publicity team for the civil religion in question. In this case, a picture is indeed worth a thousand words: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
<a href=../../img/paintingjesus-7ca395-g95.jpg style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><img border=0 height=296 src=../../img/paintingjesus-b83832-400x296-g95.jpg width=400></a></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I hope I don’t need to point out to any of my readers that the US constitution, that cautious tissue of half-resolved disputes and last-minute compromises, was not handed down by Jesus to the founding fathers, and that it’s even a bit insulting to suggest that a document needing so much revision and amendment down through the years could have come from an omniscient source.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I also hope I don’t need to point out that most of the founding fathers shown clustered around Jesus in the painting were Deists who were deeply suspicious of organized religion—and of course then there’s Ben Franklin, skeptic, libertine, lapsed Quaker, and sometime member of the Hell-Fire Club, standing there with a beatific smile on his face, one hand over his heart, and the other doubtless hiding crossed fingers behind his back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Still, that’s the sort of distortion that happens when the emotions evoked by civil religion shape history in hindsight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>The Communist Manifesto</i>
and the October Revolution came in for the same sort of hagiography, and inspired even worse art. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Other examples of civil religion would be easy enough to cite—or, for that matter, to illustrate with equally tasteless imagery—but the two I’ve just named are good examples of the type, and will be wholly adequate to illustrate the points I want to make here. First, it takes only the briefest glance at history to realize that civil religions can call forth passions and loyalties every bit as powerful as those evoked by theist religions. Plenty of American patriots and committed Communists alike have readily laid down their lives for the sake of the civil religions in which they put their faith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Both civil religions have inspired art, architecture, music and poetry along the whole spectrum from greatness to utter kitsch; both provided the force that drove immense social and cultural changes for good or ill; both are comparable in their impact on the world in modern times with even the most popular theist religions. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Second, the relations between civil religions and theist religions tend to be just as problematic as the relations between one theist religion and another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The sort of bland tolerance with which most of today’s democracies regard religion is the least intrusive option, and even so it often involves compromises that many theist religions find difficult to accept. From there, the spectrum extends through more or less blatant efforts to coopt theist religions into the service of the civil religion, all the way to accusations of disloyalty and the most violent forms of persecution. The long history of troubled relations between theist religions and officially nonreligious political creeds is among other things a useful confirmation of Bellah’s thesis: it’s precisely because civil religions and theist religions appeal to so many of the same social and individual needs, and call forth so many of the same passions and loyalties, that they so often come into conflict with one another. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Third, civil religions share with theist religions a curious and insufficiently studied phenomenon that may as well be called the antireligion. An antireligion is a movement within a religious community that claims to oppose that community’s faith, in a distinctive way:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>it embraces essentially all of its parent religion’s beliefs, but inverts the values, embracing as good what the parent religion defines as evil, and rejecting as evil what the parent religion defines as good. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The classic example of the type is Satanism, the antireligion of Christianity. In its traditional forms—the conservative Christians among my readers may be interested to know that Satanism also suffers from modernist heresies—Satanism accepts essentially all of the presuppositions of Christianity, but says with Milton’s Satan, “Evil, be thou my good.” Thus you’ll have to look long and hard among even the most devout Catholics to find anyone more convinced of the spiritual power of the Catholic Mass than an old-fashioned Satanist; it’s from that conviction that the Black Mass, the parody of the Catholic rite that provides traditional Satanism with its central ceremony, gains whatever power it has. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Antireligions are at least as common among civil religions as they are among theist faiths. The civil religion of Americanism, for example, has as its antireligion the devout and richly detailed claim, common among American radicals of all stripes, that the United States is uniquely evil among the world’s nations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This creed, or anticreed, simply inverts the standard notions of American exceptionalism without changing them in any other way. In the same way, Communism has its antireligion, which was founded by the Russian expatriate Ayn Rand and has become the central faith of much of America’s current pseudoconservative movement. There is of course nothing actually conservative about Rand’s Objectivism; it’s simply what you get when you accept the presuppositions of Marxism—atheism, materialism, class warfare, and the rest of it—but say “Evil, be thou my good” to all its value judgments. If you’ve ever wondered why so many American pseudoconservatives sound as though they’re trying to imitate the cackling capitalist villains of traditional Communist demonology, now you know.
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Emotional power, difficult relations with other faiths, and the presence of an antireligion:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>these are far from the only features civil religions have in common with the theist competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Still, just as it makes sense to talk of civil religions and theist religions as two subcategories within the broader category of religion as a whole, it’s worthwhile to point out at least one crucial difference between civil and theist religions: civil religions tend to be brittle. They are far more vulnerable than theist faiths to sudden loss of faith on the grand scale. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The collapse of Communism in the late twentieth century is a classic example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the 1980s, despite heroic efforts at deception and self-deception, nobody anywhere on the globe could pretend any longer that the Communist regimes spread across the globe had anything in common with the worker’s paradise of Communist myth, or were likely to do so on less than geological time scales. The grand prophetic vision central to the Communist faith—the worldwide spread of proletarian revolution, driven by the unstoppable force of the historical dialectic; the dictatorship of the proletariat that would follow, in nation after nation, bringing the blessings of socialism to the wretched of the earth; sooner or later thereafter, the withering away of the state and the coming of true communism—all turned, in the space of a single generation, from the devout hope of countless millions to a subject for bitter jokes among the children of those same millions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The implosion of the Soviet empire and its inner circle of client states, and the rapid abandonment of Communism elsewhere, followed in short order. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The Communist civil religion was vulnerable to so dramatic a collapse because its kingdom was entirely of this world. Theist religions that teach the doctrines of divine providence and the immortality of the soul can always appeal to another world for the fulfillment of hopes disappointed in this one, but a civil religion such as Communism cannot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the Soviet system stumbled toward its final collapse, faithful believers in the Communist gospel could not console themselves with the hope that they would be welcomed into the worker’s paradise after they died, or even pray that the angels of dialectical materialism might smite the local commissar for his sins. There was no refuge from the realization that their hopes had been betrayed and the promises central to their faith would not be kept. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This sort of sudden collapse happens tolerably often to civil religions, and explains some of the more dramatic shifts in religious history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The implosion of Roman paganism in the late Empire, for example, had a good many factors driving it, but one of the most important was the way that the worship of the old gods had been coopted by the civil religion of the Roman state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time the Roman Empire reached its zenith, Jove and the other gods of the old Roman pantheon had been turned into political functionaries, filling much the same role as Jesus in the painting above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The old concept of the
<i>pax deorum</i>—the maintenance of peace and good relations between the Roman people and their gods—had been drafted into the service of the Pax Romana, and generations of Roman panegyrists insisted that Rome’s piety guaranteed her the perpetual rulership of the world. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When the empire started to come unglued, therefore, and those panegyrics stopped being polite exaggerations and turned into bad jokes, Roman civil religion came unglued with it, and dragged down much of Roman paganism in its turn. The collapse of belief in the old gods was nothing like as sudden or as total as the collapse of faith in Communism—all along, there were those who found spiritual sustenance in the traditional faith, and many of them clung to it until the rising spiral of Christian persecution intervened—but the failure of the promises Roman civil religion had loaded onto the old gods, at the very least, made things much easier for Christian evangelists. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=separator style="clear: both; text-align: center">
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It’s entirely possible, as I’ve suggested more than once in these essays, that some similar fate awaits the civil religion of Americanism. That faith has already shifted in ways that suggest the imminence of serious trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Not that many decades ago, all things considered, a vast number of Americans were simply and unselfconsciously convinced that the American way was the best way, that America would inevitably overcome whatever troubles its enemies and the vagaries of nature threw at it, and that the world’s best hope lay in the possibility that people in other lands would finally get around to noticing how much better things were over here, and be inspired to imitate us. It’s easy to make fun of such opinions, especially in the light of what happened in the decades that followed, but it’s one of the peculiarities of religious belief—any religious belief, civil, theist, or otherwise—that it always looks at least faintly absurd to those who don’t hold it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, the point I want to make is more specific. You won’t find many Americans holding such beliefs nowadays, and those who still make such claims in public generally do it in the sort of angry and defensive tones that suggest that they’re repeating a creed in which neither they nor their listeners quite believe any longer. American patriotism, like Roman patriotism during the last couple of centuries of the Empire, increasingly focuses on the past: it’s not America as it is today that inspires religious devotion, but the hovering ghost of an earlier era, taking on more and more of the colors of utopia as it fades from sight. Meanwhile politicians mouth the old slogans and go their merry ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I wonder how many of them have stopped to think about the consequences if the last of the old faith that once gave those slogans their meaning finally goes away for good. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Times">Such things happen to civil religions, far more often than they happen to theist faiths. I’d encourage my readers to keep that in mind next week, as we focus on another civil religion, one that’s played even a larger role in modern history than the two discussed in this post. That faith is, of course, the religion of progress.

F. Schumacher's "divergent problems".<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_guide_for_the_perplexed#Two_types_of_problem<br>On my own reflecting of issues I'm repeatedly going back to that recognition whenever I hear two sides passionately defending their ideology as self-evident, without noticing it quickly collapses without its nemesis at the table as well. The strangest conflict for me is between the good and evil of compromise. That is, "the good fight" so often comes out from insecurity that you might be wrong, so the more certain someone acts about their beliefs, the more they need to deny the opposite has any virtue for fear of losing everything. But I guess there are times when compromise has no middle ground. Centralization and relocalization are two pulls of authority, and maybe its like the dinosaurs and mammals. Resilience depends on both having some power, and centralization would appear to delay collapse our society, allowing transition time for relocalization that wouldn't happen if the central power collapsed instantly. So I think fundamentalistic dependence on either side can be resisted, and you have to live in two worlds during a time where power is clearly in one realm, and yet everything really important is happening in the hidden one.<br><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c3823743799943646929 title="comment permalink">4/3/13, 11:21 PM</a><br><br>

My general rule for committing internet chattery is that I only do so with people who I already know in actual life, or who I have a reasonable possibility of meeting in person.

Which is a shame because as late as the early 1990s country music could be both satirical, humorous and heartfelt. Now it mostly sounds like elevator music with a twang.<br>My guess is that the civil religion of Americanism will fall apart first, and that to one degree or another the successor states will still embrace the religion of progress. When people perceive the religion of progress has failed (perhaps in another generation or two), what fills the void? Militant Protestant Christianity? Catholicism? Druidism?<br>It took Europe about 1000 years to go from Roman civic religion to Catholicism to the Renaisance.

These were invariant and consisted of recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, singing of any one of half a dozen patriotic songs, recitation of The Lord's Prayer, and listening to the teacher read a couple of Bible verses.<br><br>When "under God" was added to the Pledge (spoiling the scansion), I quietly refused to say those words, on the principled basis that a pledge to the Republic should not include any religious statement. No one took notice of this. I also had to decide what to do about the Lord's Prayer. <br><br>Decades later, I asked my father about his boyhood in Oklahoma in the 1920s. He faced the same issue of whether to recite The Lord's Prayer with his classmates. My father and I were probably the only Jews in our respective rooms.<br><br> Both of us thought it over without consulting our parents, and arrived at the same conclusion. It's a Christian prayer, but nothing in it is contrary to Judaism, therefore I can recite it without violating my conscience and don't have to court martyrdom.<br><br>The Bible verses must have been innocuous as I can't remember what any of them were.<br><br>I think opening exercises of some sort are a good idea for any school. I'm old fashioned enough to approve of first graders learning to sing a verse or two of The Star-Spangled Banner; America the Beautiful; Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean; My Country, Tis of Thee and The Battle Hymn of the Republic by heart. By doing so one commits to memory through repetition some decent poetry with more complicated sentence structure than our textbooks had. (Especially our national anthem, which has fiendishly Latinate syntax as well as a range of an octave and a half.)<br><br>Also, if this practice had carried on, we would not have had the spectacle after September 11, 2001 of all the members of Congress trying to display their patriotism on the Capitol steps and being unable to sing anything together except God Bless America. Not one of Irving Berlin's better efforts, and I was embarrassed for my country.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c3115550385713595402 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 1:52 AM</a><br><br>

It amuses me that an archdruid should be proposing such a crudely functionalistic idea of religion. The way you strip the notion of the 'sacred' from all references to transcendence is most telling - it seems you have a couple of axes to grind there.<br>It leads to simplifying things too much, methinks.<br>For instance: the 'worship of the old gods' was never coopted by what you call the 'civil religion of the Roman state'. Roman politics and Roman religion were closely intertwined from the word go, and there was never a time that the gods were not 'political functionaries'. They were so already in the Iliad which, if I recall correctly, predates the foundation of Rome by at least a century.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c7410325865114499336 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 2:01 AM</a><br><br>

But here we have some problems that are associated with categorization in concreto.<br><br>One can theoretically define religion as one wants, but since it is a tool, some definitions are more useful for certain purposes than others. And I would prefer a definition of religion as it is found in mainstream religious studies, because those people know well how they define what they study. If the definition is too broad, as appears to me is the case of this essay, usefulness of the category diminishes, because necessary discrimination of diverging features with possibly strong impacts on outcomes goes away. In the present perspective, almost any system of belief or ideology can be seen as religion in the end, which does not seem to be "right". Also, it is of course important to capture common features of let us say catholicism and communism, but the point (e.g. in cognitive linguistics) is that the whole is not just a combination of the part - we have a gestalt, or special ecology of the structures under investigation, and holistically taken, catholicism and communism work differently precisely because the elements constitute the whole in different ways, some are missing and some are present, etc. I think that this generalization and comparison is far too broadly conceived. In any case, it is a nice example of the point made in the text, that categorization is often adapted by its conscious use so that it serves his purposes :o)<br><br>Similarly, according to me, one should carefully distinguish different strata of systems of belief. Are we talking about "folk Christianity", or high-level theology? About communism as (mis)used in the states of the USSR block, or intellectual communism? These distinctions matter. They matter the more that e.g. here in former Czechoslovakia, intellectual communism or marxism is not dead at all, and these things are intensively discussed: it is now a common view in these circles (with which I partly sympatize) that the practice and history of "communist states" do not say anything about communism or marxism as an ideology. In other words, USSR and its satelites are taken not be really communist (which of course is similar to the problems with religions on one hand and historical churches on the other). <br><br>And it is a bit problematic to speak about total disintegration of "communist religion" after 1989 in these areas, because common people never really understood it and took seriously, at least in the marxist vein (a different story is that most of them really wanted social equality, emancipation etc.). In fact, many of them look back to those time with nostalgy, and many leftist intellectuals either never dismissed the belief, or have discovered it again (younger ones). So in any case, the idea of communism or at least socialism is well alive and so brittle as proposed, whatever the experience with bolsheviks was here.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c1212333594763585055 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 2:45 AM</a><br><br>

Theistic religions explicitly rely on claims of divine authority for their validity, while civil religions rely on reason and the interpretation of commonly-accepted historical knowledge. Followers of theistic religions stress the importance of faith in times of adversity, while followers of civil religions tend to have a more pragmatic attitude when reality casts doubt on their beliefs. Civil religions are more like big social experiments than actual religions because their central claims are much more falsifiable, and their followers show evidence of holding this perception (e.g. references to “the American experiment”; the voluntary abandonment of Communism throughout Eurasia when it became clear that it wasn't working).<br> <br>Communism bears so much resemblance to Christianity because, as you mentioned last week, the Western imagination was thoroughly in the grip of Christianity when Communism emerged. Communism is similar to Christianity out of practical necessity: had it not been based on the Christian template, Communism probably would have been too intellectually alien to its Western audience to have ever taken off. Luckily for the founders of Communism, they were also subjected to this Christian cultural conditioning. <br><br>With all this in mind, and given that religion is evolving phenomenon, I think that civil religion is actually a distinct species of intellectual organism which has (at least in part) evolved out of religion.<br><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c1645870128374305247 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 3:02 AM</a><br><br>

I like to say that I'm living in my second declining Empire now, having grown up in the UK in the 60s and 70s. Back then, the UK's sense of itself, its civil religion, had clearly crashed - the sun really had set on the British Empire and the Deferential Society. And the immediate replacement, post-war socialism, was having a tough time paying for itself. So from the 80s onwards the UK rebooted itself as a kind of groovy-USA - neo-liberal but with a more caring/intellectual ethos and somewhat better beer. I would say that the UK and Europe's civil religion, at least until recently, was largely based around the conceit that they could do progress too, while being cleverer and more refined than the US.<br><br>But as you say, these are all abstractions, stories we tell ourselves to make sense of things, to frame our hopes of the future and inspire us. Most of the components of these civil religions are not actually true, in any objective way, and often don't make much sense in the context of individual lives which are always more reflective of reality, the facts on the ground. It's so interesting how important these mental frameworks are to our functioning. They're very crumbly and unreliable, and much less tangible than working with day to day reality. But still we cling. <br><br>I wonder if, as the progress religion comes undone, it will shake up more of us to accept reality as it is, with all of its rules and mysteries and limitations. Or maybe we'll all just reboot another conceptual framework in which to believe? Perhaps paradoxically I've found that the former is a much better path to something transcendent.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c6033419459781099986 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 4:51 AM</a><br><br>

The word “religion” is based on a Latin root that means “to bind one thing to another.” Extended metaphorically, the etymological centrality of the idea of binding emphasizes the definitional centrality of the human will as a way of binding oneself to some ultimate belief system. This ultimate belief system (or rather, the purported set of realities it references) in turn come to command all the most fundamental forms of allegiance and commitment on the part of the believer – volitionally, emotionally, intellectually, and even physically. The belief system to which a person binds herself also defines for the religious believer her system of meaning and value, due to the ultimacy and finality of the psychological and spiritual binding involved.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c6598270797266708378 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 4:59 AM</a><br><br>

Does it follow from this that the strangely warped and twisted form of Protestant Christianity that prevails here will also be obliterated in the collapse of American Empire, and is it likely that it would take all other forms of Christianity with it, even those small minority sects that preached long and hard against the civil cooptation? <br><br>I've always thought of the prevailing religion I see here in the Bible Belt, in downtown San Francisco, in Boulder, Eureka Springs, Sedona, Salt Lake City, Kalispell, and on all 298 of the cable TV channels that stream into my mother's house, as Materialism. I see people seeking identity, meaning, answers, and comfort in their stuff; and if that is not the function of religious belief, what is? I'm contemplating how this maps into the picture you are weaving. Perhaps my category of Materialism is a higher level classification, at the same level as Theism. Then, Progress, Communism, and American Exceptionalism would fit as subcategories within it, just as Christianity, Buddhism, and Atheism fit as subcategories within Theism. If this seems like a workable scheme, I wonder if the (slow, grinding, ongoing) collapse of American Empire will actually obliterate Materialism itself, or just leave a space for some other materialistic belief system to evolve into the void.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c1721696879648513890 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 6:08 AM</a><br><br>

The first, which I'll call paleosatanism, are basically the old-fashioned devil-worshipers who work black magic and gleefully embrace some very bad behavior. These exist in relatively small groupings that function largely underground. Then there are the neosatanists who embrace a very Ayn-Rand-like philosophy of life. Within neosatanism, there are the atheistic satanists such as Anton LaVey's Church of Satan, that regards Satan as an impersonal universal force in nature. There are also the neosatanist groups such as the Temple of Set who regard Satan as a dark deity they worship, rather than a demon or fallen angel.

My mom is very religious. She accepts all the arguments put forward by Christian promoters as fact: <br>1. No book is as attested to in the historical record as the bible <br>2. No other religion has had someone come back from the dead <br>3. (when pressed that resurrection is in tons of religions) No religion has had resurrection confirmed in the historic record as with Jesus <br>4. Every atheist who made a genuine study of the bible to debunk it came out a believer. (those who did not didn't make a genuine study.) <br>5. Look at how Jesus clearly fulfilled every bit of scripture in the book <br>6. It takes more effort and faith to disbelieve than believe <br><br>Anyway, there are tons more howlers like that -- demonstrably false claims -- but recounting them all would belabor the point. Whenever this conversation comes up -- and it does with dreadful frequency -- the final question is "What do you put your faith in? You have to believe in something, base your life around something, or you're just a gerbil spinning in a wheel." <br><br>I think that statement has a rather complex answer. People need to eat, drink and breathe -- those are the inarguable essentials. Not everyone requires higher levels of justification and rationalization. I myself want them but that does not mean my neighbor down the street would see any value in it. <br><br>The thing about these civil religions is they seem so concrete and sensible. The faith can be justified within this very life. While one could look at the failure of a civil religion as a bad thing, I think you could also consider it to be the sensible debunking of a scientific life philosophy that has been proven false. Only a fool would continue believing in something that clearly doesn't work. While a scientist might be sad that a favored theory like vitalism or the luminiferous aether has been debunked, he at least knows the way has been cleared for a better theory. <br><br>I don't see a civil religion of progress as a bad thing, so long as we can define what progress is. "I know it when I see it" doesn't really cut it. The American Dream of rapacious consumerism doesn't really seem to make people happy, regardless of questions of sustainability. But food, love, safety, using our minds to improve the world for ourselves and our fellow man, that's something I can get behind. <br><br>What is interesting is seeing how man saw nature over the ages. The Puritans who came over here saw the Wilderness not as a romantic getaway but a manifestation of hell with the Indians playing the part man in a godless state, little better than devils. A hippie talking about hugging trees would have been utterly alien to them. <br><br><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c5534800603424940058 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 7:16 AM</a><br><br>

"Taking on the colors of utopia as it fades from sight," that's a powerful and accurate image there. Also loved the description of Randism/Objectivism as an "antireligion". So if Objectivism is an antireligion of Communism, then howcome it hasn't simply gone away now that Commmunism is dead and gone? Do I just need a little more patience?? :) (odious Randism can't make its exit soon enough, IMHO.) <br><br>Also thought I'd point out a fictional example of the collapse of a religion. In the interesting sci-fi novel "Hyperion" by Dan Simmons, the Earth itself was completely destroyed at some point in the future and humankind lives in space colonies. It becomes a plot point that the Jewish faith officially disbanded at that point, because its rabbis concluded quite logically that, since the Promised Land was destroyed, then God was not going to keep his promise to give them the Promised Land. The future Jewish descendants still believed in God, but no longer practiced or believed in the validity of their religion. An amusing fictional depiction. <br><br>What other faiths might be shattered if the Earth's climate really becomes inhospitable to humans?

One person put up a link to brief blog that asserted the US Pledge of Allegiance was "idolatrous" (in the Christian understanding of that term). After reading your discussion of civil religion here, the voicing of such an opinion by the Christian faithful might be additional evidence, coming from the other direction, that American civil religion is in trouble.

The conflation of and the co-opting by ACR of American Christianity is a long-standing irritation to me.

The only point I wish to argue with is what constitutes a religion. And this then leads me to contend that Progress is not so much a religion as a mythology or myth - myth or mythology as the term is used by Joseph Campbell, that is, a set of beliefs that is accepted by the majority of a culture as true and self-evident. <br>The myth of progress at least as far as I can tell is one of science and technology perpetually improving the condition of humans on earth by increasing both knowledge of the material universe and conquering by means of technology all the problems that vex us. <br>The term religion for me implies not just a set of beliefs but also a formal organization that puts itself in charge of defining what those beliefs are.<br>Religions also have officials and rituals that mediate key transitions such as birth, the onset of adulthood, marriage and death. <br>And finally, most crucially for me, religions have some notion of aspiration to wisdom that cannot be attained through intellectual exercises that is, wisdom that can only be attained by means other than rational thought. <br>I agree that that the term civil religion is a useful one since civil religion typically covers most of the same bases as conventional religions. However, progress in itself is not a religion in my own estimation but rather a core philosophical component of many civil religions. I imagine that the idea of Progress was as much a part of Russian Communism as it was of American Capitalism. In other words, I would regard Progress as a belief central to certain civil religions but not a civil religion in itself.<br><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c8783760513235804957 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 7:31 AM</a><br><br>

In the days of Stalin, when Estonia had just gone under, there was a fancy-schmancy encyclopedia. Some of the articles were political. Some people had this encyclopedia, in what I presume was multivolume well-bound hard-covered expensive big-format fancitude-schmancitude, on their shelves at home. I have heard that when the political climate in the USSR shifted a bit, people were given printed sheets which they had to take home and paste into those fancy encyclopedias, to correct political errors in the material as originally printed. (Perhaps the new sheets were a bit critical of Stalin. After 1953, poor Joe got categorized as an unsound, dissident, theologian, kind of like Prof. Hans Küng opposing Cardinal Ratzinger.) <br><br>What I have heard is that some people were so cowed, or so pious, as to actually take the proffered sheets home and do the required pasting-in. <br><br>I also want to remark on offences related to "paragrahv 58" or "paragrahv 68" (sorry, not quite sure of the number) in the Soviet Estonian Criminal Code. <br><br>When the civil church was really breaking down, in 1990, it was considered possible for diaspora Estonians to go back home WITHOUT being labelled collaborators. With my parents' full approval, I did just that, taking the ferry from Helsinki, and going inside for a whole week. <br><br>At some point I had the following conversation with my dear Uncle-or-Cousin-or-Whatever X and my dear Aunt-or-Niece-or-Whatever Y, at the kitchen or dining-room table near Tallinn:<br><br>TOOMAS (explaining how things are in the West, probably with reference to rallies in places like Toronto, against such things as the 1939 August 23 late-night Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, with those secret Baltic clauses that only came out after World War II): So we see all sorts of demonstrations and rallies, with anti-Soviet agitation spreading all over the place.<br><br>X AND/OR Y (at first getting the political line wrong, but quickly correcting themselves, so as to end up on the evidently winning side): Oh, yes, it really is dreadful, anti-Soviet agitation cropping up simply EVERYWHERE, simply awful....I mean, yes, it's WONDERFUL, yes, ANTI-Soviet, it's simply WONDERFUL, you get **SO** much anti-Soviet stuff these days...<br><br><br>Ai-ai,<br><br><br>Toomas (Tom) Karmo, near Toronto<br>http://www.metascientia.com <br><br>PS: When one feels sad about the past, one can get cheerful again by viewing http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4UhJpviVYg. The vid relates, admittedly, not to the jurisdiction just referred to, but to a cognate one. However, the two jurisdictions are similar enough. They differ, Churchill said, only as the North Pole differs from the South Pole. <br><br>In this cheer-up vid, I particularly prize the bits from 00:57 or so onward, in which the speaker says "Tomania was down, but now he has risen", and does something rather creative with his glass of water, and the crowd dutifully reiterates the theme with its stiff-armed salute (rendering the phallic character of the proceedings explicit). <br><br><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c2933812075198468645 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 7:34 AM</a><br><br>

If the religion of progress is undergoing its own implosion, the faithful will be grasping for a new belief system in its wake, and an organized party that coherently points out the flaws of the departed Progress and offers an alternative vision of meaning and purpose in its absence will have a powerful draw. <br><br>Thanks for this fascinating series.

And, more ironically, Proudhon himself is now a central figure in an anarchist theology that sees him as the first in a succession of Great Prophets. First Proudhon taught us Mutualism; then came Bakunin, and taught us Collectivism; finally, Kropotkin taught Anarchist Communism, and this is the Final Revelation.<br><br>Also, the idea of the antireligion: It seems to me that civil religions often absorb the properties of the antireligions of their competitors-- and this hastens their end! So Americanism absorbs and is redefined as Anti-Communism. Now, without Communism, what is left for America? <br><br>And, of course, it works the other way around, too. America was much admired by many early socialists and communists, including Marx and Bakunin. Later, Anti-Americanism became a necessary feature of all radical Left civil religions. What will become of them when America implodes? <br><br>And of course, Proudhon's criticism of Marx still holds. He continued: "Let us not, merely because we are at the head of a movement, make ourselves the leaders of a new intolerance, let us not pose as the apostles of a new religion, even if it be the religion of logic, the religion of reason." Why is it that so, so many opponents of the dominant hegemony become hegemons in their turn?

You won’t find many Americans holding such beliefs nowadays, and those who still make such claims in public generally do it in the sort of angry and defensive tones that suggest that they’re repeating a creed in which neither they nor their listeners quite believe any longer. American patriotism, like Roman patriotism during the last couple of centuries of the Empire, increasingly focuses on the past: it’s not America as it is today that inspires religious devotion, but the hovering ghost of an earlier era, taking on more and more of the colors of utopia as it fades from sight."<br><br>Do you think that this was the same way that people felt in the 1920's into the 1930's?<br><br>I say this because it's clear to me that we have reached a trough in terms of what one person called "national will".<br><br>Meaning we are reaching a point at which we have reached the maximum of social mood shifting in the "this world" and "individualistic" direction.<br><br>You don't really see the patriotism of the 1950's in the Great Gatsby, for example.<br><br>One of the problems that I have with history is that it's extremely difficult to capture the zeitgeist or overall culture without actually being there.<br><br>Because the past exists only between the covers of books, which often don't tell you what you really want to know, because that knowledge is experiential.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c5970738238141045913 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 10:39 AM</a><br><br>

I guess we’ll have to wait to see how Americanism fits together with Progress. My guess is it’s a child/ parent relationship of some sort, because it seems to me Europe has at least as strong (or stronger) faith in Progress as America. <br><br>As for Americanism, it not only co-opted, but also directly stole from Judaism and Christianity. A recent example (I’m sure I will take enormous flak for saying this) is the treatment of Obama's arrival as that of the much-awaited messiah. The less and less he has lived up to their expectations, the louder and louder the faithful shouted (look, for example, at back issues of Time magazine). At this point, however, I think the spell is broken for most people, because we seem to have returned to the pre-messianic explanation of 'Well, at least he's not as bad as the other guy.'<br><br>Another thorny issue in this soup is what to call this civil religion. It has many names. You've called it Americanism, I’m not sure how that ties into Progress (up until today I would not have distinguished between the two), but personally I usually use the terms Secular Liberalism or International Secular Culture, and I recently was reading a book by a devout Christian who was grappling with trying to understand this competitor with no name, who deemed it the Doctrine of Evolution. (Not a bad attempt considering the muddy waters surrounding this concept. Thanks to you I knew he meant the religion of Progress.) Certainly E.F. Schumacher has referred to “Evolutionism” in a slightly different context. I also love a term Wendell Berry has used for the modern version of the faithful: “doctrinaire pluralists.” We’ll all have to agree to some name if we want to simplify our conversation.<br><br>I also suspect you won’t be able to conclude this discussion without returning to that most fascinating of topics, thaumaturgy. Certainly thaumaturgy plays a role in preventing us from even seeing this civil religion as a religion.<br><br>And, of course, I think another thing you’re going to have to address somewhere along the line is the common misconception that religion can be successfully separated from culture (which of course, despite our many attempts in the recent centuries, it cannot). Some may disagree with me on this point, but based on humanity’s recent experiments, I am completely convinced that religion and culture cannot be separated successfully.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c4232828072905802491 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 10:44 AM</a><br><br>

First, there's the question of what functions are best done on a centralized basis and what are best done on a local basis; then there's the question of just how central, and just how local -- in the US, for example, you've got state and county governments between the central and local ends of the continuum. That said, your broader point about compromise stands. <br><br>Darren, I'm going to guess that that's a compliment -- since I don't own a TV, I'll have to guess!<br><br>Matthew, good. It's not a matter of one defining the other; both are being shaped by reflections that I've been mulling over for many years. <br><br>Stunned, thank you! I may be in Britain next year -- if so, I'll post something. <br><br>Ben, it's worth noting that the western world went through a lot of intermediate territory between the twilight of classical Roman religion and the emergence of the Renaissance. We'll be discussing that, too. <br><br>Unknown Deborah, agreed -- it's not a good sign when a nation's political culture has decayed so far that nobody in Congress can even manage the national anthem. By the way, you can also sing any of Emily Dickinson's poems to the tune of "The Yellow Rose of Texas" -- try it sometime. <br><br>Thijs, I haven't proposed a theory of religion; I've simply discussed one aspect of religion, using a commonplace of sociological theory to do so. As for classical religion, I'd encourage you to reread the Iliad; the Greeks and Trojan leaders all had to worry constantly about whether what they were doing would please or displease the gods. In late Roman civil religion, the assumption was that Jove was always on Rome's side, the way so many people over here insist Jesus is on America's. There's one solid measure of the difference between an uncoopted and a coopted theist religion. <br><br>Lei, I'm not surprised to hear that the rehabilitation of Marxism is well under way on your side of the pond; it's also happening here. It'll be interesting to see how far it gets. As for the broader question of definitions, of course -- but then every religion, civil or otherwise, includes a great diversity of viewpoints and levels of understanding. <br><br>Zachary, thank you!<br><br>Approliving, it's always possible to draw category lines elsewhere. My point is that seeing civil religions as a species of the genus "religion" reveals things about them that most other analyses obscure.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c2868700290539102754 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 12:38 PM</a><br><br>

In the original text, it is still accept the broadened concept of religion as a metaphor (but as we know, metaphors are typically incomplete and complex extensions of the core of the category), though it is accoridng to me a bit too much to label atheism as a religon without a god. But now you see where it leads: people then begin to call "civil religion" simply any belief, system of though, conglomerate of ideas - even "International Secular Culture" is supposed to be a name for this religion. Then, the word "religion" becomes meaningless and loses all diagnostic potential.<br><br>One of the points of atheism is that one accept a full-fledged system of thought that ascribes the world and live a meaning without needing religion for this purpose. By calling any such system of ideas/belief/thouht a religion, one conflates these crucial distinctions.<br><br>As for other points, which I was thinking about - many systems of thought become "civil religions" only after being coopted by political structures as orthodox state ideology (still, one should distinguish between religion and ideology, again). On other words, it was not that communist religion was coopted by USSR and others, but the other way round - only there in the hands of the ruling class and its ceremonies and rituals it became something very close to a religion. Of course, this a common fate of ideologies and philoshophies exploited by political structures. This is the same with anarchism mentioned above: anarchism is not a religion, which naturally does not prevent at least some "organized" anarchists to establish a schematic myth of transmission and evolution (which is however nothing inherently religious).<br><br>Talking about Americanism - my experience is too indirect to have the right to speak about it to this audience. In any case, as far as I can say, Europeans (and Czechs in particular) tend to be much more skeptical, not only regarding theist religion, but also "religion of progress". Of course, you have in newspapers, economists and politicians must talk that way, but ordinary people usually do not take it too seriously. In fact, people here in central Europe, beacuse of their rich historical experience, have been long used to disregard official religions, and it is actually quite hard to find anyone among the people I know who would share the believes described here as a "religion of progress".<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c1428332853201693197 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 1:02 PM</a><br><br>

One is the inevitable flipside of the other. <br><br>Bill, that's certainly one workable way to categorize things. I'll be suggesting a slightly different one as we proceed; I'd point out, just as an appetizer, that if Americans were actually materialistic, in the strict sense of the term, it's hard to see how they would be able to stand the shoddy, cheapjack nature of so many of the material things with which they surround themselves. Wouldn't a materialist demand things that gave more sensual pleasure and material gratification? More on this soon...<br><br>Robert, thank you.

I can hardly find anything to quibble with. It was nice to be reminded of Bellah, who I read many years ago. Another parallel between civil and theistic religions is the way in which the high practice and low practice can go their separate ways - as the common people reject or ignore or choose to misunderstand the prescriptions and demands of their elites. I'm sure you can name a dozen different ways this can play out - including collapse, reform, inquisition, revitalization, or the rolling out of the tumbrils. It really is an interesting way to think about the ongoing failure of the American polity.

This is the “cosmic religion” Einstein spoke of and people like Tsiolkovsky, Stapledon, Sagan and Clarke promoted. It began in Russia in the 19th century, and seems to be making a comeback there in the wake of Communism’s failure. Basically Cosmism is the Religion of Progress taken to an extreme, but it is also a form of pantheism – treating the vast Cosmos itself as an object of religious awe. Cosmism isn’t so different from Druidry – it shares the druid’s keen interest in and quasi-mystical respect for what Sagan called “the awesome machinery of nature,” but expands it to cosmological scales. There is a nice quote by Arthur C. Clarke which captures the Cosmist perspective on the future:<br><br>“There is no way back into the past; the choice, as Wells once said, is the universe—or nothing. Though men and civilizations may yearn for rest, for the dream of the lotus-eaters, that is a desire that merges imperceptibly into death. The challenge of the great spaces between the worlds is a stupendous one; but if we fail to meet it, the story of our race will be drawing to its close. Humanity will have turned its back upon the still untrodden heights and will be descending again the long slope that stretches, across a thousand million years of time, down to the shores of the primeval sea.”<br><br>Here is another relevant quote by the astronomer Fred Hoyle:<br><br>“It has often been said that, if the human species fails to make a go of it here on the Earth, some other species will take over the running. In the sense of developing intelligence this is not correct. We have or soon will have, exhausted the necessary physical prerequisites so far as this planet is concerned. With coal gone, oil gone, high-grade metallic ores gone, no species however competent can make the long climb from primitive conditions to high-level technology. This is a one-shot affair. If we fail, this planetary system fails so far as intelligence is concerned.”<br><br>If one accepts these quotes, then to give up on the Religion of Progress is to admit that our “long descent” down to the shores of the primeval sea and eventual extinction has begun. Personally, I don’t accept this fatalistic mentality, and will do what I can to ensure that the human adventure in the Cosmos continues indefinitely.<br><br>If anyone is interested in learning more about Cosmism, you may enjoy these posts:<br><br>http://templeofcosmism.com/cosmism-the-religion-of-the-future/<br>http://templeofcosmism.com/the-essence-of-cosmism/<br><br>Thank you for hosting this high quality discussion of these vitally important matters.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c4653850097328382793 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 5:04 PM</a><br><br>

By calling any such system of ideas/belief/thought a religion, one conflates these crucial distinctions."<br><br>I can see where you might find this a bit insulting, or muddling. And several other posters have objected to the conflation of societal belief systems with religion. <br>At the same time, if there is a religious impulse, or if religion serves the same basic human needs, then has such a person really escaped? In the case of atheism, I listen to people and try hard to understand where the reward lies, and what the thought system is about. Many atheists are a kind of nature worshiper, or pantheists, because the universe of matter is all that exists, and there is a kind of reverence and awe that chance and necessity has wrought such wonders. Existence itself, and what has become of it and within it, is very like a god methinks.<br><br>There is the question posed as to the difference between religion and spirituality. It might be worth considering that atheists come closer to my definition of spirituality than to religion. Not the indifferent ones of course, but the ones who seek and think.<br><br>My take: Religion may contain a lot of spirituality, or almost none at all. Religion is a body of teachings one may subscribe to that may contain some very close approximations of truth, or be entirely off base, but spirituality is a subjective and personal experience that requires no dogma, but may be described within understood categories. The mystic is spiritual, and often loses their religion. <br>Spirituality refers to things of the spirit, which includes conscience, soul, God, and all things numinous. Then again, one can see all things as spiritual, as this Native American did: "Every pine needle is sacred, and every step is a prayer."<br><br>Now that, is spirituality.<br><br>But on reflection, you say atheists "accept" a full-fledged pattern of thought which comes from communal sharing of books and ideas, leading to common expressions, so there is a little more going on than just not happening to believe that there is a god. It's like you kind of join the club and start getting filled in on the thoughts and arguments so that you can incorporate them.<br><br>In addition, atheism "has a way to ascribe life and the world a meaning"...this is also what religion does.<br><br>Robert, the poem was wonderful.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c8520937588362359868 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 5:26 PM</a><br><br>

If, hypothetically, mankind pollutes the environment to such a degree that the Earth becomes much less hospitable to human life -- global warming, ocean acidification, or whatever -- how will the Druid faith react?

But then about halfway through the essay, Ross Anderson says that the lifetime of the Sun "should be long enough for us to develop star-hopping technology". Then, after re-hashing Asimov's <b><i>The Last Question</i></b> for 7 paragraphs, he ponders on the "sinister" "mystery" of "Where are they?" He speculates that the Universe is "very bad at nurturing star-hopping civilizations" because intelligent life may inevitably be "self-annihilating" or there may be "catastrophic events that science cannot predict". Meanwhile almost completely glossing over the idea that "they" aren't "here" yet because it is simply not possible to hop across stars! JMG, you have ruined me as a sci-fi fan, because I can no longer just take it on faith that interstellar travel will someday be so cheap and easy that it can be taken for granted as a plot point.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c3200234215827718644 title="comment permalink">4/4/13, 7:29 PM</a><br><br>

There was still the sense then that you could get there by leaving the urban coastal strips. Now, at least in my take, that sense is gone; the America of the old songs -- "Thine alabaster cities gleam, undimmed by human tears" -- is a fading mirage of a past that never was. <br><br>Blue Sun, I used Americanism and Communism as examples of civil religions, because it's easier to make sense of the phenomenon in those contexts; next week I'll be mapping the same points onto the religion of progress. <br><br>Joel, nah, Constantine set out to coopt Christianity to bolster Roman civil religion, and largely succeeded, with substantial and unhelpful impacts on Christianity ever since. <br><br>Quos Ego, no, I think the future will be balanced between decline and its denunciation. <br><br>Bill, nice. Do you happen to recall what "somewhere" (as in, the opposite of nowhere) would be in Greek? <br><br>Lei, no, treating atheism as a religion is not conflating the distinctions, it's arguing that the distinctions in question are polemic rather than real -- that atheism properly belongs to the same category as other religions, but that atheists reject that placement as part of their polemic against other, non-atheist religions.

The fact that I will die does not make my life meaningless; the fact that the earth will die does not make its existence meaningless, either, or its beauty less worthy of reverence.

And of course, I mean stories in the sense of narratives through which we live our lives, and not arbitrarily made up fairy-tales.

America was supposed to be a paradise of religious freedom, and the Soviet Union an atheist worker's paradise, and yet both ended up with very similar, very dominant, and clearly very inspiring, belief systems. Both broke free from a dominant story, but remained trapped in the same structure. Echoes of "what you contemplate, you imitate", perhaps.

I'm an enrolled member of the Iowa tribe. I have seen over and over certain situations. <br><br>For example, if you are having a sweat, say, a nonnative person wants to participate. So you might say ok, if you are friends or at least know them. So they go, try to follow what is told to them, what to do. It's a good thing. A blessing. But then the next thing you know, this person is running a sweat themselves, without having been given the training, the right and responsibility, because it comes with both. It's like a pipe, not everyone in an Indian community is a pipecarrier, but every white guy or woman who is interested, thinks by definition, they have the capacity and the RIGHT to do it. Indians don't think that. Not every native person is a shaman, so why does every white person think they can be one? A shaman mainly serves the community. <br><br>..ok, so let's go back to that first guy who went to a sweat. Now that guest suddenly decides he has the knowledge to run a sweat. To make things worse, he starts charging people MONEY to go to it. (Isn't that what this culture is all about anyways? Money and the SELF?) That's the next stage. That lack of being humble. That greed. Now this guy calls himself some Indian/native sounding name, and he (or SHE) is running workshops to TRAIN OTHERS. A guy who had no training, now he purports to train others and charge hundreds of dollars, maybe linked workshops that add up to thousands of dollars. Sounding like cultural misappropriation yet? But wait, that's not the final stage. <br><br>The final stage is when this guy, maybe he calls himself Red Buffalo Thunder or something, he starts collecting his followers like some kind of guru, has workshops, has written a couple of books, has a 501(c)(3), etc. And THEN he starts criticizing the very same Indians who out of kindness, invited him in the first place. He starts saying how they really don't understand the truth, or that they misunderstand things, they don't do it the right way, that they have no right to say anything about him because he has his rights, dontcha know? That the INDIANS are the ignorant, bad ones because they tell him he should be doing that, that he is doing cultural misappropriation. <br><br>Now, do you understand? No, I figure some might and some still won't. They will still justify their rights, to do what they want, make the money they want, and write the books they want. And then people wonder why Indians don't want to talk to them anymore... Except of course for those Indians who have become shysters themselves, raking in the bucks themselves from ignorant nonIndians so eager to get some real Indian spirituality. Sad.<br><br>The intent in the guy's heart from Colorado (I was corrected, the event was in Sedona...figures!) was about money obviously. Having said that, the other part is that when you do those things, you assume a spiritual role of responsibility in that person's life...not being a big shot or a boss or a guru, but someone who is responsible for them. And whatever blowback occurs. It amazes me when people get mad about a priest or minister "having authority" and the same people go running to someone else who bosses them around spiritually.<br><br>But the main thing is, hey, if you are doing any of that stuff in private, for yourself, only, and you are experimenting with your own spiritual path, that's on you. Fine. That's between you and the spirits, you and the Creator. The problem comes when you (anyone, not talking about JMG) assume any role of responsibility for others, or representing yourself as a spiritual leader.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c5158969548428417128 title="comment permalink">4/5/13, 5:40 AM</a><br><br>

At this point we have lumped civil and theistic religion together in the same Venn circle. Does anything remain beyond this boundary? For Aristotle, “Only beasts and gods live beyond the polis.” To which Nietzsche later quipped, you forgot yourself Aristotle! Alas, probably not, Aristotle was a god in his own mind. But it makes a great point of departure! What do we have beyond the confines of the polis? Again to Aristotle, politics (the logos of the polis) is the master science of the good. Political power is the arbitrator of all human activities within the polis, including of course, the practice of religion. As my previous post indicated, this fact was once much more obvious. Political intolerance has a way of clearly demonstrating the limits of religious freedom. But the problem runs deeper: political power is much more effective on minds than bodies.<br><br>Here are two common and connected problems found in modern philosophers, importantly including Nietzsche. First, they tend to place a great deal of emphasis on intellectual and spiritual freedom, second they tend (for that reason) to be fairly absolutist by which I mean they tend to arrive at all or nothing conclusions about freedom, political power, human knowledge, beauty, etc. In some ways these habits make it really hard for them to remain philosophical in the old fashion meaning of that term. (If you like that, consider how serious the influence of Christian theology must have been on the development of these habits.)<br><br>The ancient philosophers (and importantly also Taoists and the simpler Zen practices) did not fall into these habits (probably because political power was exercised so much more brutally.) For instance, for Socrates the mind is the public sphere, the body is private. The mind is language, and language is a political activity. If you begin here you will not tend to arrive at the conclusion that your thoughts are free to fly away from it all (think of Thoreau sitting in jail while his mind is free to contemplate pure conscience). The body, of course, is private. No one feels your stubbed toe like you do! This starting point reveals the mind as already formed by political power by the time you are old enough to understand that you are a chump. This is why Socratic dialectic is so infuriatingly unproductive, because producing wisdom is really not the point of philosophy. Also, this is why eastern philosophy begins by silencing the crowing roosters of theory and ideas, those guys need to shut up if we are to have any peace! Political power is persecuted by either logic or paradox, but the real point is the persecution, not the method of torture.<br><br>There is something beyond the polis. Though it is very difficult to appreciate from within the city limits. All too often the second thought here is overlooked and what wanted desperately to escape returned with scorched wings as a more sinister and sophisticated political power. It is so hard in this world of endless cities of glass and mirrors to even think of escape!<br><br>Oh yes, one last and encouraging point on absolutism. The best part about starting where the ancients (and easterners) start is that you also don’t have to have a pure and complete theory of everything. There are no unmixed souls! That means that on a good day even the worse denizen of the lowest sewer beneath the cave of the polis can see that there is indeed another way. And that is a reassuring thought to me.<br><br>-p<br><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c7221507891102316796 title="comment permalink">4/5/13, 8:00 AM</a><br><br>

For instance, the ancient Egyptian belief in Maat, or the supposedly world encompassing and ruling divinely ordered empires of China, Persia, Rome or Islam. That also provides a model for the American belief that they have the right way of life and a divine mission to make the world conform to it. Naturally this is expressed in the prevailing religious imagery of their time and place.Christ handing down the Constitution is like Moses delivering the Commandments, or Gabriel supposedly dictating the Koran to Mohammed. As belief in the Constitution and in Christianity weakens, it seems that Islamic belief strengthens and they are less squeamish about the use of force as a reflection of divine disapproval.<br><br>The artist is very hesitant to distinguish between good and bad people in his painting, probably a reflection of the strength of evil in modern America. A more spiritually confident people might have something like Rogier van der Weyden's Last Judgment on the walls of their hospital wards, showing the sinners on the left hand of Christ being led to the hell that they have made of the modern world, whilst the righteous are escorted to the holy city that America was supposed to become!<br><br><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rogier_van_der_Weyden_001.jpg?uselang=en-gb" rel=nofollow>Last Judgment</a><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c3014710821759135832 title="comment permalink">4/5/13, 9:35 AM</a><br><br>

As an anarchist I've experienced people dismissing my opinions instantly on the basis that my beliefs are a religion (usually because they mistakenly believe we follow the gospel of Marx...), that my beliefs are therefore irrational and everything I say is motivated by my desire to convert others and so should be ignored. The dismissers never seem to consider their own political views to be religious. While any belief system (including of course anarchism, socialism, Marxism etc.) can be a religion, it doesn't follow that it must be so for everyone who holds those views. <br><br>For example, I know people who would describe themselves, among other things, as Marxists, on the basis that, as someone said, most of what he said about capitalism was right, while acknowledging that most of what he said about communism was wrong. I know a lot of anarchists and many,if not most, have never read Proudhon, Bakunin or Kropotkin and, if asked, would only vaguely know what they wrote about. It's not just the equivalent of a Christian being too lazy to read the bible, they just don't consider them the source of our ideas or their legitimacy so have no interest in reading them. Anarchism to them is something they come to through their own experiences at work or from being involved in campaigns or union organising. Even among the more intellectually inclined, there's an anti-authoritarian bent to anarchism that very consciously rejects treating any such thinkers as defining the tradition. The real religion of most anarchists is the myth of progress as far as I can see. <br><br>What I'm trying to say is that there is an already common bad habit of using the religion card to dismiss people's political views and I'd hate to see these posts used as justification for that. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c39750901816951413 title="comment permalink">4/5/13, 12:52 PM</a><br><br>

" /QUOTE<br><br>Ummm, and it doesn't seem to you that using an expressly female-gendered slur (even a mild one) to express exactly that triumpant "you're such a loser" attitude, is still an implicit slap at women? Can't resist a bit of linguistic analysis here 'cos it just jumps out at me...<br><br>Just because a slur can be tossed at a person of either gender doesn't mean it's not sexist, if the slur itself relies on gender for its impact... say a guy calls a guy a c**t or a p*ssy -- the insult is not only to the male recipient, it's also to women in general -- because if there were not a disdain for women in general, the female-gendered slur would have no negative connotation, no "female=icky-bad" presupposition.<br><br>I believe the contemporary "bitch/loser" usage derives from (a) prison rape jargon, in which men who suffer rape at the hands of other men are referred to by the perps as "my bitch", by obvious analogy with their domineering relationships with women in the outside world [cf the urban slang "prison bitch"], or (b) the language of pimps who, we're told, often refer to the women under their control as "bitches". Hence to "make someone your bitch" means to dominate or exploit them, to crush their spirit, to physically rape or otherwise vanquish and humiliate them; the metaphor is one of sexualised domination, and in the discourse of what my buddy Stan Goff calls "probative masculinity," bitch=female=loser.<br><br>The metaphor, at heart, is a rape metaphor; there are plenty of other such slang expressions, like "to rip [someone] a new one" (meaning "to get really angry with or punish" -- which again refers to prison-related or other forcible anal rape). So nah, I can't buy the argument that "bitch" is a gender neutral locution, not even close. No more than "fag" is a gender-neutral insult on the playground; it's part of our universal training in gender policing, in contempt for the gendered Other, that results (when taken to extremes) in the suicide of gay teens.<br><br>Similarly if one whitefella says to another whitefella on the job site, "jeez man, you're as lazy as a n*gg*r," that's not a race-neutral slur just because it can be applied between same-race speakers. There's still the implicit message: "dark-skinned people are inherently work-shy or lazy." Or, in the case of "bitch," that women are inherently losers, rightfully destined to be dominated and bullied. Speaking of icky-bad, that's icky-bad by me.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c3486427345840876456 title="comment permalink">4/5/13, 4:26 PM</a><br><br>

Atlas Shrugged, of course, contains the obligatory rape scene in which the "uppity woman" is tamed by brute force and consequently falls in slavish love with the dominant alpha male; that could be dimissed as mere lazy genre writing for the commercial market... but more disturbingly, Rand openly admitted that one of her great heroes and inspirations was William Edward Hickman, a sociopath notorious in his time for murdering and dismembering a little girl.<br><br>“Other people do not exist for him, and he does not see why they should;” [that's Ayn Rand writing about Hickman, who had] “no regard whatsoever for all that society holds sacred, and with a consciousness all his own. He has the true, innate psychology of a Superman. He can never realize and feel ‘other people.’”<br><br>This is also the essence of the traditional, imperial warrior/alpha male archetype, whose deficiency in empathy makes him capable of "hard" behaviour like warfare, torture, massacres, conquests: even the extermination of whole peoples and species in the search for kingship/domination/power/wealth/glory. It's an ideal to which -- at great psychic and emotional cost to themselves, as well as incalculable cost to humanity at large -- legions of boys and young men are pressured and coerced to swear allegiance. This is also the pimp/mafia-don archetype, to whom all women, all defeated opponents, and all the natural, living world, are just "bitch" -- something to dominate and exploit for profit.<br><br>For any substantial number of men to see women in this way is arguably dangerous to women, and crippling to the emotional development and life of the men in question; but to see the entire natural world (by extension) in this way, is demonstrably dangerous to our survival as a species. Hence I would argue that the decoupling of a validating, satisfactory masculine identity from this puerile, insecure contempt and hostility towards women-and-nature is a high priority :-) and a first step would be to become more aware of the problem, which saturates our culture, even unto our daily, unexamined use of the vernacular.<br><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c2207520458595418492 title="comment permalink">4/5/13, 4:49 PM</a><br><br>

More on this later on. <br><br>Thijs, of course emperors had their personal patron deities; so did their subjects. That's standard practice in a mature polytheism. The point that I'm trying to make is that by the empire's heyday, the blanket assumption was that the old Roman gods as a group were always on Rome's side, no matter what, so long as the traditional observances took place. No Roman emperor thought he had to worry about annoying the gods the way, say, Agamemnon or Priam did; that's what I mean in saying that in imperial times, the gods had become part of the imperial publicity team. <br><br>Phil, elegantly done. The Singularity, of course, is the recent, apocalyptic version of the heaven of Progress; the older version was humanity's grand destiny out there among the stars, to which we would inevitably progress if we just funded science adequately...<br><br>Das Monde, my take on fascism is a bit different; it doesn't share the same presuppositions as Marxism, the way Objectivism does, and its opposition to Communism was a matter of competitive exclusion: it was the same kind of totalitarian society as Soviet Communism, though it had a different ideological foundation. <br><br>Cherokee, Druidry doesn't have a fixed pantheon.

Nietzsche was very clear on the religious dimensions of what I'd call nationalism, the genus of civil religion of which Americanism is a species. As for what isn't a religion, I'd draw the Venn diagram a good deal less broadly. Religions have, among their most visible functions, the function of propounding a set of basic presuppositions about life in the world, which believers consider self-evidently true, and use to judge all other claims -- you can use the word "sacred" about such presuppositions with reasonable precision. <br><br>While religions do many other things as well, it's safe to say that anything that doesn't do this isn't a religion. Thus the common experience in complex societies of a distinction between sacred and secular spheres: those institutions directly involved in propounding the core presuppositions of a society belong to the sacred sphere, while those that accept those presuppositions and then go off and do something else with their time are secular. (Those that openly reject the presuppositions, in turn, belong to the sphere of social deviance.) <br><br>Ian, good. The antireligion is where people go when they're dissatisfied with the religion but don't have the independence of thought to discard its presuppositions, so as the religion becomes less and less appealing, membership in the antireligion would tend to go up, yes. <br><br>Nicholas, all in good time!<br><br>Raven, there were plenty of more strident visual portrayals of the apocalypse of Americanism back in the day; you're right that it's faded a bit in recent decades. <br><br>MawKernewek, pur dha! <br><br>5keptical, you might find my response to NH Peter above useful.

There is moreover a problem with the word "beyond dispute", and also with "sacred", which is IMHO not applicable with reasonable precision. It has actually much to do with the issue of under what conditions those presuppositions can be disputed and who or what grants them their alleged indisputability.<br><br>One such difference between religion and ideology could be that the core presuppositions are supposed to be grounded (at least seemingly) in rational argumentations why they are true in ideologies, and so they are more open to evidentially based criticism and even debate, whereas they usually are revealed and excluded from any rational and evidence based criticism in religion. In this sense, the word "sacred" really applies to religious shere; again one can use it as a metaphor, but then we end in journalistic style and the things Mallow depicts.<br><br>This openness to criticism has of course much to do with the brittleness of "civil religions" in comparison to true religions, as proposed here.

People might be unwilling or unable to recognise the will to power in themselves or others and so unable to maintain structures to keep it in check or to do the work of participating in decisions that affect them - I know many who prefer someone else to make all the decisions for them and are content to live the consequences of that. Or enough people may be unwilling to give up the dream that capitalism will allow them to some day become a millionaire. Also it wouldn't work if people try to do it overnight- too many anarchists value innovation for its own sake and are ignorant of how current structures actually function.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c6755749824279227419 title="comment permalink">4/6/13, 3:13 AM</a><br><br>

That's one reason they last longer if they are made into religions. One can't imagine the <i>Book of Job</i> in civil-religious form. Once civil religions fail, they are wrong, because their workings are assumed to be basically known and beneficial.<br><br>Not that I want to get into "theodicy", but broadly speaking these civil religions are bereft of discussions like that because they assume the good will result -- unlike Agamemnon, yes -- or that it already has resulted, and that lack is one of the reasons for the inability to notice peak oil. “Civil religions” are <i>late</i> (they are civil<i>ised</i> in the Spengerian sense) and that accounts for their hubris, just as “the late city defies the land”. <br><br>Scientism actually takes Nature for its god just as Druidry does. It is simply the kind of religion which believes in stamping on your god if it doesn’t perform to your liking, which is no new thing -- Chinese religions have seen underperforming deities whipped through the streets. <br><br>Since any discussion of religion as primarily social rules out most spiritual experience, it also rules out any real engagement with the source of meaning. Spiritual revelation doesn't exactly "propose presuppositions", after all! But it has to be translated into a social form. <br><br>When the “source of all” (which in Western religions has so often been the central aspect) becomes the social “known source of inevitable benefit” in a civil religion, then a <i>good faith</i> :) attempt to engage with the source of meaning becomes impossible; this and their lateness in the cycle are also part of what condemns them to brevity. They are based on what JMG would call a “confounding of the planes”, or an “immanentisation of the eschaton”; it could also be seen as a “projection of a mistaken Ultimateness”. They are thus losing propositions before they even begin.<br><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c2161595090569294878 title="comment permalink">4/6/13, 4:39 AM</a><br><br>

(This is despite my knowing the big old ‘churches’ and their revealed truths have very much been a part of politics, with enduring consequences. Even Buddhism, for example and not only the ‘religions of the book’, was integral with some thumping big empires off and on during its history.)<br><br>I thought rather of the Orkney &amp; Shetland Islands in the far north of Britain, and stories retold by the poets George Mackay Brown and Hugh McDiarmid (Chris Grieve). It’s worth noting that climate (and weather) varies dramatically across Britain and that our north projects steeply into the fickle North Atlantic and the streaming dark. <br><br>Brown, native to Orkney, had many stories from the old days and this is one of them if I remember correctly. A croft perhaps on a solitary island would prepare carefully for Christmas, as for guests, thoroughly cleaning and setting to rights the house and themselves. Then they would set a light in the window and unbar the door before going to sleep. Hot water, fire and light, like food, were very precious in mid-winter in those days, but guests of the spirit arriving anxious and in need would be more so. <br><br>I prepared just now a story from MacDiarmid, but it made this comment too long. Sufficient to say that this poet was both an idealist and a robust ‘materialist’ – in the sense of a faith in the ‘recurrence of being’ across what passes for the vast empty reaches of eternity - living as he did for years in relative poverty and unknown outside literary circles, writing much poetry in a crofting / fishing community whose craftsmanship and quality of mind he much admired. I’ll save Grieve / MacDiarmid for another day.

So even under this scenario, the story of complex life on earth is not even half over. Imagine what another billion or two years of evolution might bring, especially as the planet's geography, atmosphere, and oceans continue shifting. A billion years is 60 times longer than it has been since the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, and the evolutionary changes in that brief time have been huge. Many entirely new classes of organisms may come and go. Whole new body plans will likely arise and be replaced many times over. Descendants of octopuses may indeed some day fly through the air on six intricately synchronized wings, and compose poetry with their other two limbs while they ponder the fossils of bizarre long-extinct ancient hairy creatures with only four limbs and weird rigid calcified poles all throughout their bodies.

What I find most useful with this starting point is the defined category can easily include religious thinking not associated with traditional religion, for example Americanism. I also agree with your description of sacred work as that involved in the maintenance or establishment of said core presuppositions. And of course, combined, these ideas allow the establishment of non-traditional sacred work in the service of clarifying core presuppositions. I do wonder, however, how you understand the activities you call secular, which are in acceptance of core presuppositions, but not actively engaged in their promulgation. Do you think of these secular activities as essentially aligned with religion or do they have some vitality independent of religion, perhaps even in competition with religion? And of course, here I use the term religion to indicate the now more broadly defined category above. <br><br>If the latter, perhaps religion is not really such a serious matter. Of course, the alternative is to realize that religion is ubiquitous. There is a long standing question mark around the writings of Machiavelli, that most devilish progressive! He proposes no theoretical philosophy. No metaphysics, no physics, no moral philosophy, no epistemology, no aesthetics, no political philosophy, and certainly no theology! Is that because the human world is essentially secular?

After leaving the US last year, I have been observing the US culture (as seen from media to friends on FB) and there is a distinct cultural narrative which I think is the civil religion that JMG refers to. Ironically I noticed it matches many of the symptoms of Narcissist Personality Disorder which I find I was not the first to notice it. This is probably true of many of the "religions" which veered into unhealthy places. I think this also explains the resistance of people to see what is going on as anything that invalidates their sacred beliefs is dangerous to their whole narrative.. so they resist facts as many faithful do.

I'm glad you've ventured into this area.<br><br>I'm understanding your category of religion as being the "top level" story that we each have, which provides the framework for our lower level stories such as who I am, what my future is, etc. By definition, the top level story has nothing above it which it follows from and so has the role of axioms - it's self-evident, or a matter of faith.<br><br>Looked at in this way, do we all have a religion? I suppose it's possible to have more than one top-level story, but I'm having trouble wrapping my mind around what that would be like.<br><br>Even the atheistic position (I count myself an atheist, but I'm working on it *grin*) is still a story with which to structure our lower-down stories. "There is no meaning, your lower down stories are just meaningless noise" - it's not a very attractive story, but it's still a story.<br><br>I'm waiting with great anticipation to see where all this goes.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Graeme<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c3310862499546891494 title="comment permalink">4/8/13, 5:47 PM</a><br><br>

Feminism is not a religion in that it's principle historic leaders are not deified and idealized anything at all like the Roman Emperors or our Founding Fathers are. Respect does not equal religious worship. I might also note that the man-hating radical feminist is a caricature, scarcely a reality; if you looked really hard you might be able to dig one up, but for the most part they exist only in Portlandia. Now of course, many feminists might hate *individual* men, especially if they have been abusive or degrading or insulting, but that is not the same as hating all men collectively. The bible-thumping fundamentalist christian or the flag-waving radical american exceptionalist, on the other hand, is very real, and extremely numerous.<br><br>As an aside, at least within the neopagan communities, there have been plenty of men's identity movements that have not defined themselves just as an inversion of feminism.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c6917143627676869914 title="comment permalink">4/9/13, 6:20 AM</a><br><br>

I don't feel like Feminism can be best described as a civil religion. A better framework is that of an underprivileged group (women) campaigning for equal rights to those with privilege (men). "Mens rights" is a fairly typical example of backlash from members of the privileged group against the prospect of losing their (obviously unfair to all but them) privilege. You see similar phenomena with other underprivileged groups, for example racial minorities, the queer and transgendered, road users other than motorists, or even the poorer social classes. You can, if you try hard enough, shoehorn feminism into the civil religion category, but I feel like it isn't doing feminism justice, and is granting too much legitimacy to MRM.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c1316531204307735040 title="comment permalink">4/9/13, 12:19 PM</a><br><br>

I take that as evidence that more and more people are aware of the failure of progress, and are scrambling around trying to bolster their flagging faith. <br><br>NH Peter, a thorough response to that would take a couple of posts. I see Machiavelli as very nearly the first modern thinker, in a somewhat unusual sense: he's the first who seems to think that he doesn't have a metaphysics, that reality is perfectly transparent and is exactly what it is -- or, at least, what it appears to be to Machiavelli. I'll be arguing down the road that this is the core delusion of the modern mind, and a distinctive marker of a particular stage in a historical process. <br><br>John, I disagree.

You can call Strauss "pedestrian" or Beethoven "overblown" or Mozart "boring," or Haydn "unimaginative," and some people will object, while others will nod in agreement. No one reaches for a gun.<br><br>But call Dmitri Shostakovich a talentless hack, and you get blowback. Strangely ANGRY blowback, and from people who've never listened to a single note of his music, and couldn't be paid enough to sit through an entire concert.<br><br>It's almost like you're blaspheming their religion.<br><br>Up until this discussion, I've never had a framework for understanding this behavior. But now it makes perfect sense. I <i>am</i> blaspheming their religion: the Religion of Progress.<br><br>Sometime around 1900, give or take, music jumped the rails and crashed. People started writing and performing atonal monstrosities they called (and oddly enough still call) "experimental" music. As a musical experiment it has always been an outright failure: its entire cachet lies purely in that magic word, "experimental." It was, and paradoxically remains (a century later), a fixed and revered expression of "Progress."<br><br>In the early 1980's, I heard the late Isaac Stern perform in New York, and he chose to do the Bartok violin concerto (#2). Afterward, one of my pod-mates (grad school) gushed, "Wasn't that wonderful? And so <i>modern</i> -- why, Bartok was so far ahead of his time that it could have been written yesterday!" <br><br>My opinion, which I kept to myself, was that classical music had stagnated so completely that what was written yesterday was <i>still</i> Bartok. And he'd been dead for over three decades: nothing "modern" about that.<br><br>I spent some time with the work. I checked out the score from the library, to try to see what I'd missed so completely. I never found what I was looking for. But I had learned well that you don't call the Bartok concerto a "cacophonous mess," unless you want a severe verbal whipping by those who consider themselves musically literate. <br><br>I think back on decades of under-the-breath comments from a wide range of professional musicians about this "music of Progress," and I'm somewhat comforted in knowing that I'm hardly the only Philistine out here.<br><br>I'm really curious how the introduction of the phonograph affected this transition: I wonder if it congealed in place the musical expression of the religion of progress when all the money started to flow out of live performance and into recording. Recording certainly facilitated the initial rise of some of the <i>successful</i> "experimental" music, like jazz and rock-and-roll. I also wonder what the current collapse of the recording industry, to say nothing of the future collapse under social catabolism, will do to music. It will certainly put whatever money there is back into live performance. It's already done that. Maybe it will also revitalize the art.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c4957510180908015089 title="comment permalink">4/9/13, 11:16 PM</a><br><br>

Consider what William Irwin Thompson points out in <a href=http://www.williamirwinthompson.nstemp.com/Interviews/witazint.htm rel=nofollow>this interview</a>:<br><br><i>Actually, when I did have a conversation with Heisenberg, we got on fine and we talked nonstop for about two hours. We were able to communicate across this vast abyss of his knowledge of science and mine. There are some people in our culture who understand that science shares with poetry deep roots in myth, in narrative ideas of order and process. These sorts of scientists such as Heisenberg or C. H. Waddington, like music and art and like to hang out with artists.<br><br>Those who take for granted that there is some objective, real matter that they are going to manipulate and be in charge of, they don’t like artists at all and prefer to hang out with politicians and people in power who seem to be in control of society. Like Teller, these guys are basically control freaks. They hate ambiguity; they hate complexity. They want to simplify everything and in simplifying it they basically want to take control. Their form of taking control is to eliminate everything that is other than their way of handling matter.</i><br><br>In the latter, <i>there</i> is your "nature in chains". But the inspiration of (perhaps non-routinised, anyway much less positivistic) scientism has always partly drawn on appreciation of nature as a source of wonder and beauty.<br><br>That's not just for the Heisenbergian elite either. It's the story told by <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wonders-Solar-System-Professor-Brian/dp/0007386907/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365591781&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=images+of+the+solar+system" rel=nofollow>popular books such as this one</a> -- whose author by the way has made rabidly skeptical and materialist remarks in his time, totally in line with the dominant materialism. But recognition of the human need for beauty, on a scale that dwarfs humanity, has been absolutely bound up with the popular "selling" of scientism, just as much as celebration of our cleverness. (Richard Dawkins has stumbled out similar things that indicate he has a soul, although he can’t put it that way.) <br><br>To say Faustian fundamentalism "is the real scientism" would just be no true scotsman. Meaning was always threatening to burst out in scientism, as Thompson is pointing out, but the power-hungry side was the side that ended up temporally governing, since it did actually <i>achieve</i> the short-lived and meaningless power it promised, and made I-it meaninglessness the de facto position.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c7836997069643540988 title="comment permalink">4/10/13, 4:54 AM</a><br><br>

I've only just got through reading this week’s comments. Excavations are going on by hand using a mattock and wheelbarrow (I'm tired). Preparations for next summer start as soon as the weather turns cooler in Autumn. It is an interesting cycle Down Under –locals ignore it at their peril!<br><br>A few thoughts for you:<br><br>- Aren't cheap shoddy manufactured products that people surround themselves with strangely akin to a cargo cult? <br><br>As an amusing side note, the guy that sold me the water tank told me he was getting rid of it because he didn't like the colour (I can't make this stuff up) and he replaced it with another tank of the same dimensions but of a colour to match the house. My expression was like a stunned mullet (a Down Under expression).<br><br>I look out for well manufactured long lasting items and they are mostly the cheaper second hand stuff that people over look. Sometimes I occasionally get stung though as the wind turbine that I'm getting around to installing (delayed by the water tank) is a bit of a trip, but I'll get there eventually...<br><br>- It seems that the civil religions studiously ignore nature as anything other than a place to extract wealth and dump pollution. I understand that this is advantageous in the short term and that it is sort of necessary in order to buy off the population. It kind of seems pointless though because it takes our eye off the long term game.<br><br>- I've had status and in fact I still carry some with me. However, I reckon status is bunk. People don't seem to get the idea that the only way to win is to not play the game. It never ceases to amaze me how many questions I have to field from people about all sorts of personal aspects. Sometimes I just want to shout at them, "Stop consuming so much and you won't have to work as hard" but perhaps this will be deemed anti-social, so I simply keep quiet.<br><br>I can see clearly now why the Aboriginals thought that white-fellas were a bunch of lunatics the way we kept on working such long hours...<br><br>Hi Cathy,<br><br>What about an antidote for such dystopian sci-fi as The Road? Truly, I think the future will have more in common with the Depression Era. Yeah sure, there was great poverty, but socially I'd say that they were better connected? The future doesn't have to have bling, but it need not be bleak. There's the title too, "Bling, not bleak" - that'll confuse people for sure (I'm channelling John Lennon’s walrus at this point. hehe!)<br><br>Chris<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c33314510157514399 title="comment permalink">4/10/13, 6:09 AM</a><br><br>

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c523341223100431353></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11664048318053952948 rel=nofollow>Nick Dahlheim</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>(Pt 1) I have loved following this blog regularly over the course of the last 3-4 years as it is truly one of the few consistent voices of sanity on the Internet about our collective plight in the face of the confluence of Peak Oil and Climate Change. It’s been over a year since I last commented on a post here on your blog (my short response earlier yesterday about E.F. Schumacher elsewhere on this comments page notwithstanding). <br><br> Your recent post on the functional differences between the social forms of civil religion and theistic religion as well as some of the comments referencing passages of Nietzsche’s Thus Spake Zarathustra bring to mind another important but more obscure Nietzsche work: Human All-Too Human: A Book for Free Spirits (Menschliches, Allzumenschliches: Ein Buch für freie Geister). Nietzsche scholarship in the English-speaking world, following the lead of translator Prof. Walter Kaufmann, had ignored this early book in his corpus. As an avid fan of the penetrating psychology of Nietzschean thought, much of it nearly a century ahead of its time in detecting the nihilism and ennui lurking beneath the glossy veneer of bourgeoise society and its Cult of Progress; Human All-Too Human reveals the thoughts of a fertile mind more keenly attuned to Man as a political animal than even Nietzsche’s brilliant later works would suggest. One key passage from Volume 1, Section 8, Aphorism #472 crystallizes much of what you have to say, JMG. And it supplies your observations with a heuristic political psychology. <br><br> Nietzsche believes that a healthy and vital State is a polity whose rulers recognize the immaturity of the unwashed masses and therefore understand that the State must act to preserve religion in order to give the “not yet as of age” masses a sense of narrative meaning and purpose. Nietzsche probably would have agreed with the Stoic philosopher Seneca, “Religion is for the masses true, for the rulers useful, and for the wise false.” And a healthy State carefully guards this social reality for the good of the State. For religion “quietens the heart of the individual in times of loss, deprivation, fear, distrust, in those instances…which the government feels unable to do anything towards alleviating the psychical sufferings of the private person…[and] guarantees a calm, patient, trusting disposition among the masses” during crises like wars, famines, and financial panics. A State where a majority of the population believes in religion will witness the hand of Providence/Fate/God behind political intrigue and misgovernance—Religion’s narrative structures shortcircuiting skeptical and refractory impulses. The fact of political unity and civil peace sealed through a common religion creates the appearance that a higher Transcendent Power actively cooperates with the organs of the State. Nietzsche smartly points to the Concordat Napoleon Bonaparte signed with the Roman Catholic Church as the key development that allowed for the French Republic to recover from the Jacobin Terror and for Napoleon to consolidate his political power base.<br><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c523341223100431353 title="comment permalink">4/10/13, 1:47 PM</a><br><br>
<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c1577013375347962090></div><b><a href=https://www.blogger.com/profile/11664048318053952948 rel=nofollow>Nick Dahlheim</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>Part 2-- For democratic States, maintaining the power of religion becomes more difficult when the political legitimacy of the government rests upon the fiction of sovereignty of “the people” rather than upon the State’s origin as a manifestation or reflection of a transcendent order. In such a democratic cultural milieu, the foundation of religious belief—whether civic or theistic—moves from the terra firma of tradition, public ritual, and the formalized, institutional Church leadership to the shifting sands of unconventional belief, idiosyncratic personal expression, and the charisma of gurus and demagogues. Society’s gifted people openly adopt an irreligious perspectives and a bohemian aesthetic often with barely unconcealed disdain for the foundational myths of the State. Political representatives chosen democratically increasingly must ascertain and then reflect back the divergent passions and drives of the masses the State purportedly governs. The smug postmodern bourgeois cynicism and personal libertinism typical of the hipster cultures of, say, San Francisco and New York City as well as the radical anti-elitism and anti-intellectualism of the Midwest and Deep South both are indicative of this trend in democratic culture. The archetypes of the commanding Statesman and the pious Intellectual who together guard the politics of the State both in deed and in ritualized performance gradually dissolve and are lost to public memory. <br><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c1577013375347962090 title="comment permalink">4/10/13, 1:48 PM</a><br><br>

Many in the body politik will declare their allegiance to the Christian God and vocally resent the erosion of public reverence for traditional religion. Similarly, the moral panics of the Culture Wars (i.e. recent debates over Creationism, abortion, homosexuality, public displays of Faith) achieve a higher decibel level. Leading members of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish congregations have found common cause on these issues whereas once before they had either ignored one another or looked upon one another with great mutual suspicion. Yet, religious expression of the conservative religious congregations of the past generation worship increasingly bears little resemblance to either the popular English cults of the 17th and 18th century colonial America or the 19th century religions of European peoples emigrating to industrial America. The religion of post-Reagan America is simultaneously more fundamentalist than the 20th Scofield Bible Dispensationalists, at least as charismatic as the early Pentecostalists, incredibly savvy in exploiting the latest media technology for staging highly theatrical mass worship services, and as clever as the top multinational conglomerates in advancing their salvific messages in the spiritual marketplace. And yet, save for the remaining traces of aspirational Puritanism, contemporary American religion bears very little resemblance to the incarnations of generations past. The confessional (in the sense of “confessing” sins and not reciting formal church creeds), experiential, and therapeutic dimensions of religious life have triumphed over the dogmatic, transcendent, and redemptive power of God over sin. The post-WWII economic boom amidst suburban sprawl unleashed the migratory restlessness Tocqueville first observed among mid-19th century Jacksonian Americans as never before; and the accompanying individualism undoubtedly spilled over into religious life as Americans became less attached to the religious communities of their youth. Add the social upheavals of the 1960s, the increasing multicultural character of America’s demographics as new immigrants found their way to the United States, and the advent of post-literate televisual mass media; and the weakening of the traditional Christian denominations (i.e. Catholic, Methodist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, etc.) appears in hindsight to have been virtually inevitable. And the success of mega-churches led by charismatic preachers emphasizing experiential spiritualities, therapeutic relief, and a sense of communal belonging likewise appears a natural result of the societal changes of the latter decades of the 20th century.<br><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c1449287045153227747 title="comment permalink">4/10/13, 1:49 PM</a><br><br>

Feminists fought hard against legally instituted bias against women; men need to do likewise (you should hardly expect women to do our dirty work for us, even though that is exactly what men have expected for millennia...). Thing is -- these laws that favor women in things like custody, alimony, domestic violence, avoiding military service, etc... these laws were put in place by MEN, not by women. They are not the fault of the feminists. I think you will not find a large fraction of feminists who would argue that we should keep gender bias in divorce and domestic violence laws and enforcement, nor would you find many arguing that we should continue to exclude women from military service. Of course you can find an apocryphal quote that will say anything; I am talking about the larger picture.<br><br>So again of course men should work to overturn legal gender discrimination.. but they should remember that it was not the women who put it in place. The converse cannot be said about legal discrimination against women. <br><br>Time for the next post.<br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c4481474890461765083 title="comment permalink">4/10/13, 2:41 PM</a><br><br>

Leading members of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish congregations have found common cause on these issues whereas once before they had either ignored one another or looked upon one another with great mutual suspicion.<br><br>Not as much common cause as you state, I think.<br><br>Jewish leaders have no reason to take sides over Creationism, which is an internal doctrinal debate within Christianity. It has no relevance to Judaism.<br><br>I can imagine some Orthodox rabbis making common cause with Christians to support laws that discourage homosexuality, because Orthodox Judaism and the more conservative Christian denominations have similar views on this subject. Also because the Orthodox may feel beleaguered by the more liberal sexual views of the other branches of American Judaism, who vastly outnumber the Orthodox.<br><br>I have a hard time imagining "leading members" of any branch of Judaism in America making common cause with the right wing of Christianity on the other Culture War issues you list. I'm open to being corrected if you can supply citations.<br><br>Judaism has no doctrine on the question of when the soul enters the fetus. Halachic Judaism requires (not permits, requires) abortion at any period before the moment of birth if abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother, while discouraging abortion in other circumstances. I believe that Jewish attitudes about our duty to the living are so firm that a Jewish obstetrician would break the law if he or she had to in order to save the mother. No Jewish leader would want to put a Jewish doctor into that situation.<br><br> Chanukah is a minor holiday that happens to coincide with a major Christian one. For historical reasons Chanukah is more overtly political than other Jewish holidays, and it happens to be the one holiday on which Jews are commanded to display lit candles in a window where passersby can see them. By comparison, outside the Jewish State, the major Jewish holidays are celebrated at home and in the synagogue, not in public spaces. The right to erect a giant Chanukiah in the town park is not a moral issue for Jews, rather it's a consolation prize for having to walk by the Nativity display in the same park. In other words, it's of marginal importance.<br><br><br><br><a href=the-fate-of-civil-religion.html#c7395231538561350603 title="comment permalink">4/10/13, 10:11 PM</a><br><br>
