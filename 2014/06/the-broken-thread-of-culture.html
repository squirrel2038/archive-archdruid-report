<div class=MsoNormal>
There are times when the deindustrial future seems to whisper in the night like a wind blowing through the trees, sending the easy certainties of the present spinning like dead leaves. I had one of those moments recently, courtesy of <a href=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1997-06-05/news/myths-over-miami/ >a news story from 1997</a> that a reader forwarded me, about the spread of secret stories among homeless children in Florida’s Dade County.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These aren’t your ordinary children’s stories: they’re myths in the making, a bricolage of images from popular religion and folklore torn from their original contexts and pressed into the service of a harsh new vision of reality. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
God, according to Dade County’s homeless children, is missing in action; demons stormed Heaven a while back and God hasn’t been seen since. The mother of Christ murdered her son and morphed into the terrifying Bloody Mary, a nightmare being who weeps blood from eyeless sockets and seeks out children to kill them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Opposing her is a mysterious spirit from the ocean who takes the form of a blue-skinned woman, and who can protect children who know her secret name. The angels, though driven out of Heaven, haven’t given up; they carry on their fight against the demons from a hidden camp in the jungle somewhere outside Miami, guarded by friendly alligators who devour hostile intruders. The spirits of children who die in Dade County’s pervasive gang warfare can go to the camp and join the war against the demons, so long as someone who knows the stories puts a leaf on their graves.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This isn’t the sort of worldview you’d expect from people living in a prosperous, scientifically literate industrial society, but then the children in Dade County’s homeless shelters don’t fit that description in any meaningful sense. They live in conditions indistinguishable from the worst end of the Third World; their lives are defined by poverty, hunger, substance abuse, shattered families, constant uncertainty, and lethal violence dispensed at random. If, as Bruce Sterling suggested, the future is already here, just not evenly distributed yet, they’re the involuntary early adopters of a future very few people want to think about just now, but many of us will experience in the decades ahead, and most of humanity will face in the centuries that follow: a future we may as well call by the time-honored label "dark age." </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That label actually dates from before the period most often assigned it these days. Marcus Terentius Varro, who was considered the most erudite Roman scholar of his time, divided up the history known to him into three ages—an age of history, for which there were written records; before that, an age of fable, from which oral traditions survived; and before that, a dark age, about which no one knew anything at all. It’s a simple division but a surprisingly useful one; even in those dark ages where literacy survived as a living tradition, records tend to be extremely sparse and unhelpful, and when records pick up again they tend to be thickly frosted with fable and legend for a good long while thereafter. In a dark age, the thread of collective memory and cultural continuity snaps, the ends are lost, and a new thread must be spun from whatever raw materials happen to be on hand. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
There are many other ways to talk about dark ages, and we’ll get to those in later posts, but I want to focus on this aspect for the moment. Before the Greco-Roman world Varro knew, an earlier age of complex, literate civilizations had flourished and then fallen, and the dark age that followed was so severe that in many regions—Greece was one of them—even the trick of written language was lost, and had to be imported from elsewhere centuries afterwards. The dark age following Varro’s time wasn’t quite that extreme, but it was close enough; literacy became a rare attainment, and vast amounts of scientific, technical, and cultural knowledge were lost. To my mind, that discontinuity demands more attention than it’s usually been given.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What is it that snaps the thread that connects past to present, and allows the accumulated knowledge of an entire civilization to fall into oblivion?</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
A recurring historical process lies behind that failure of transmission, and it’s one that can be seen at work in those homeless children of Dade County, whispering strange stories to one another in the night. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Arnold Toynbee, whose monumental work <i>A Study of History</i> has been a major inspiration to this blog’s project, proposed that civilizations on the way to history’s compost heap always fail in the same general way. The most important factor that makes a rising civilization work, he suggested, is mimesis—the universal human habit by which people imitate the behavior and attitudes of those they admire. As long as the political class of a civilization can inspire admiration and affection from those below it, the civilization thrives, because the shared sense of values and purpose generated by mimesis keeps the pressures of competing class interests from tearing it apart.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Civilizations fail, in turn, because their political classes lose the ability to inspire mimesis, and this happens in turn because members of the elite become so fixated on maintaining their own power and privilege that they stop doing an adequate job of addressing the problems facing their society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As those problems spin further and further out of control, the political class loses the ability to inspire and settles instead for the ability to dominate. Outside the political class and its hangers-on, in turn, more and more of the population becomes what Toynbee calls an internal proletariat, an increasingly sullen underclass that still provides the political class with its cannon fodder and labor force but no longer sees anything to admire or emulate in those who order it around. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
It can be an unsettling experience to read American newspapers or wide-circulation magazines from before 1960 or so with eyes sharpened by Toynbee’s analysis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most newspapers included a feature known as the society pages, which chronicled the social and business activities of the well-to-do, and those were read, with a sort of fascinated envy, very far down the social pyramid. Established figures of the political and business world were treated with a degree of effusive respect you won’t find in today’s media, and even those who hoped to shoulder aside this politician or that businessman rarely dreamed of anything more radical than filling the same positions themselves. Nowadays? Watching politicians, businesspeople, and celebrities get dragged down by some wretched scandal or other is this nation’s most popular spectator sport. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s what happens when mimesis breaks down. The failure to inspire has disastrous consequences for the political class—when the only things left that motivate people to seek political office are cravings for power or money, you’ve pretty much guaranteed that the only leaders you’ll get are the sort of incompetent hacks who dominate today’s political scene—but I want to concentrate for a moment on the effects on the other end of the spectrum. The failure of the political class to inspire mimesis in the rest of society doesn’t mean that mimesis goes away. The habit of imitation is as universal among humans as it is among other social primates. The question becomes this:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>what will inspire mimesis among the internal proletariat? What will they use as the templates for their choices and their lives? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s a crucial question, because it’s not just social cohesion that depends on mimesis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The survival of the collective knowledge of a society—the thread connecting past with present I mentioned earlier—also depends on the innate habit of imitation. In most human societies, children learn most of what they need to know about the world by imitating parents, older siblings, and the like, and in the process the skills and knowledge base of the society is passed on to each new generation. Complex societies like ours do the same thing in a less straightforward way, but the principle is still the same. Back in the day, what motivated so many young people to fiddle with chemistry sets? More often than not, mimesis—the desire to be just like a real scientist, making real discoveries—and that was reasonable in the days when a significant fraction of those young people could expect to grow up to be real scientists. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That still happens, but it’s less and less common these days, and for those who belong to the rapidly expanding underclass of American society—the homeless children in Dade County I mentioned at the beginning of this essay, for example—the sort of mimesis that might lead to a career in science isn’t even an option. A great many of those children won’t live to reach adulthood, and they know it; those who do manage to dodge the stray bullets and the impact of collapsing public health, by and large, will spend their days in the crumbling, crowded warehouse facilities that substitute for schools in this country’s poorer neighborhoods, where maybe half of each graduating high school class comes out functionally illiterate; their chances of getting a decent job of any kind weren’t good even before the global economy started unraveling, and let’s not even talk about those chances now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When imitating the examples offered by the privileged becomes a dead end, in other words, people find other examples to imitate. That’s one of the core factors, I’m convinced, behind the collapse of the reputation of the sciences in contemporary American society, which is so often bemoaned by scientists and science educators.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Neil DeGrasse Tyson, say, may rhapsodize about the glories of science, but what exactly do those glories have to offer children huddling in an abandoned house in some down-at-heels Miami suburb, whose main concerns are finding ways to get enough to eat and stay out of the way of the latest turf war between the local drug gangs? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course there’s been a standard kneejerk answer to such questions for the last century or so. That answer was that science and technology would eventually create such abundance that everyone in the world would be able to enjoy a middle-class lifestyle and its attendant opportunities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That same claim can still be heard nowadays, though it’s grown shrill of late after repeated disconfirmation. In point of fact, for the lower 80% of Americans by income, the zenith of prosperity was reached in the third quarter of the 20th century, and it’s all been downhill from there. This isn’t an accident; what the rhetoric of progress through science misses is that the advance of science may have been a necessary condition for the boomtimes of the industrial age, but it was never a sufficient condition in itself. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The other half of the equation was the resource base on which industrial civilization depended. Three centuries ago, as industrialism got under way, it could draw on vast amounts of cheap, concentrated energy in the form of fossil fuels, which had been stored up in the Earth’s crust over the previous half billion years or so. It could draw on equally huge stocks of raw materials of various kinds, and it could also make use of a biosphere whose capacity to absorb pollutants and other environmental insults hadn’t yet been overloaded to the breaking point by human activity. None of those conditions still obtain, and the popular insistence that the economic abundance of the recent past must inevitably be maintained in the absence of the material conditions that made it possible—well, let’s just say that makes a tolerably good example of faith-based thinking. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Thus Tyson is on one side of the schism Toynbee traced out, and the homeless children of Dade County and their peers and soon-to-be-peers elsewhere in America and the world are on the other. He may denounce superstition and praise reason and science until the cows come home, but again, what possible relevance does that have for those children? His promises are for the privileged, not for them; whatever benefits further advances in technology might still have to offer will go to the dwindling circle of those who can still afford such things, not to the poor and desperate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of course that simply points out another way of talking about Toynbee’s schism:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Tyson thinks he lives in a progressing society, while the homeless children of Dade County know that they live in a collapsing one. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
As the numbers shift toward the far side of that dividing line, and more and more Americans find themselves struggling to cope with a new and unwelcome existence in which talk about progress and prosperity amounts to a bad joke, the failure of mimesis—as in the fallen civilizations of the past—will become a massive social force. If the usual patterns play themselves out, there will be a phase when the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>leaders of successful drug gangs, the barbarian warbands of our decline and fall, will attract the same rock-star charisma that clung to Attila, Alaric, Genseric and their peers. The first traces of that process are already visible; just as young Romans in the fourth century adopted the clothes and manners of Visigoths, it’s not unusual to see the children of white families in the suburban upper middle class copying the clothing and culture of inner city gang members. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Eventually, to judge by past examples, this particular mimesis is likely to extend a great deal further than it has so far. It’s when the internal proletariat turns on the failed dominant minority and makes common cause with what Toynbee calls the external proletariat—the people who live just beyond the borders of the falling civilization, who have been shut out from its benefits but burdened with many of its costs, and who will eventually tear the corpse of the civilization to bloody shreds—that civilizations make the harsh transition from decline to fall. That transition hasn’t arrived yet for our civilization, and exactly when it will arrive is by no means a simple question, but the first whispers of its approach are already audible for those who know what to listen for and are willing to hear. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The age of charismatic warlords, though, is an epoch of transition rather than an enduring reality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>The most colorful figures of that age, remade by the workings of the popular imagination, become the focus of folk memories and epic poetry in the ages that follow; Theodoric the Ostrogoth becomes Dietrich von Bern and the war leader Artorius becomes the courtly King Arthur, taking their place alongside Gilgamesh, Arjuna, Achilles, Yoshitsune, and their many equivalents. In their new form as heroes of romance, they have a significant role to play as objects of mimesis, but it tends to be restricted to specific classes, and finds a place within broader patterns of mimesis that draw from other sources. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
And those other sources?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>What evidence we have—for the early stages of their emergence are rarely well documented—suggests that they begin as strange stories whispered in the night, stories that deliberately devalue the most basic images and assumptions of a dying civilization to find meaning in a world those images and assumptions no longer explain. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Two millennia ago, for example, the classical Greco-Roman world imagined itself seated comfortably at the summit of history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Religious people in that culture gloried in gods that had reduced primal chaos to permanent order and exercised a calm rulership over the cosmos; those who rejected traditional religion in favor of rationalism—and there was no shortage of those, any more than there is today; it’s a common stage in the life of every civilization—rewrote the same story in secular terms, invoking various philosophical principles of order to fill the role of the gods of Olympus; political thinkers defined history in the same terms, with the Roman Empire standing in for Jupiter Optimus Maximus. It was a very comforting way of thinking about the world, if you happened to be a member of the gradually narrowing circle of those who benefited from the existing order of society. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
To thos who formed the nucleus of the Roman Empire’s internal proletariat, though, to slaves and the urban poor, that way of thinking communicated no meaning and offered no hope. The scraps of evidence that survived the fall of the Roman world suggest that a great many different stories got whispered in the darkness, but those stories increasingly came to center around a single narrative—a story in which the God who created everything came down to walk the earth as a man, was condemned by a Roman court as a common criminal, and was nailed to a cross and left hanging there to die. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s not the sort of worldview you’d expect from people living in a prosperous, philosophically literate classical society, but then the internal proletariat of the Roman world increasingly didn’t fit that description. They were the involuntary early adopters of the post-Roman future, and they needed stories that would give meaning to lives defined by poverty, brutal injustice, uncertainty, and violence. That’s what they found in Christianity, which denied the most basic assumptions of Greco-Roman culture in order to give value to the lived experience of those for whom the Roman world offered least. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This is what the internal proletariat of every collapsing civilization finds in whatever stories become central to the faith of the dark age to come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s what Egyptians in the last years of the Old Kingdom found by abandoning the official Horus-cult in favor of the worship of Osiris, who walked the earth as a man and suffered a brutal death; it’s what many Indians in the twilight of the Guptas and many Chinese in the aftermath of the Han dynasty found by rejecting their traditional faiths in favor of reverence for the Buddha, who walked away from a royal lifestyle to live by his begging bowl and search for a way to leave the miseries of existence behind forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Those and the many more examples like them inspired mimesis among those for whom the official beliefs of their civilizations had become a closed book, and became the core around which new societies emerged. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
The stories being whispered from one homeless Dade County child to another probably aren’t the stories that will serve that same function as our civilization follows the familiar trajectory of decline and fall. That’s my guess, at least, though of course I could be wrong. What those whispers in the night seem to be telling me is that the trajectory in question is unfolding in the usual way—that those who benefit least from modern industrial civilization are already finding meaning and hope in narratives that deliberately reject our culture’s traditional faiths and overturn the most fundamental presuppositions of our age. As more and more people find themselves in similar straits, in turn, what are whispers in the night just now will take on greater and greater volume, until they drown out the stories that most people take on faith today. </div>

I spent most of <a href=http://anubisbard.blogspot.com/2014/06/summer-solstice-above-chicago.html rel=nofollow> the past ten weeks </a> traveling in the US as a research anthropologist with a short list of questions about what government is for. What shocked me (and I've been doing this kind of work for a decade or so) was the universality of diagnosis of political corruption - in particular the fact that our leaders don't serve the interests of regular people, but serve their own interests and the interests of their wealthy sponsors. That insight might not be groundbreaking, but what is groundbreaking was the fact that this diagnosis was shared by everyone - from the left to the right, from the most sophisticated to the least, among the poor and relatively well-off.

It had been a few years since we used temps, so I hadn't taken stock of them in a while.

Some of my clothing is certainly an imitation of American street gang wear (hoodies and black dickies trousers?) even my speech might be faintly recognizable as 'street gang talk'. I cannot say though that I personally hold street gangs in high esteem, but i certainly do feel like I share their pain at times. They are bored, miserable, frustrated with the world around them and looking for meaning in their lives. The society around them does not really offer them much it has to be said- other than harsh welfare policies or attacks about 'lazy ignorant youth' or forcing us all into boring miserable underpaid work. With such a worldview and an outlook, i can tell you finding much positives to look for is an exceptionally difficult challenge. One thing all this misery also does is it makes discussion about the situation of industrial civilization/ the state of the world with anyone quite difficult. There are so many problems and it would appear to many, very little hope.<br><br>Incidentally I am reading at the moment an abridged illustrated copy of a study of history, and have just been reading the section about the internal and external proletariat. One thing toynbee does note is that the actions of proletarians are not always violent or destructive, and in some case quite generous and peaceful. Missionaries converting the invaders of the roman empire to christianity for example, plus the original sack of rome in 410 was apparently done 'almost politely'.<br><br>Anyway, I recently turned 23 and I have dedicated it as my life's mission to forging a new path ahead, a new sense of purpose and a new direction for the youth of today/internal proletarians and hopefully for future generations.

Including the idea that more scientific literacy and better technology will help people including those homeless children in Dade county. But unfortunately that's part of the problem.<br> <br>People now seem to equate delusional beliefs and attitudes automatically with religion, but it's not just them, its a human thing. Even Atheists and Agnostics tend to delude themselves just as much, simply not in the same way. As you've said before weather it's interstellar travel or some other "savior" as long as its desirable people WILL believe in it. Even people who should really know better. I've had conversations with other Atheists and Agnostics about the theory of evolution and they will vehemently agree with it and if someone were to disagree with it they will adamantly defend it with the imperial scientific data collected to prove it over centuries. But, bring up say the scientific data about the light speed barrier and other things that make many other popular syfy tropes improbable or even impossible, and suddenly "anything is possible!" its as if all that logic and reason and scientific data went right out the window. I imagine Tyson would freak out if you went up to him and told him that: if governments and big corporations ever found a way to get a real economic/political/military advantage in space he would probably get all the space funding he wanted, and the Space Treaty would probably be torn apart and burned the same day. That considering the ISS is the size of an american football field (about 100 meters), is not sustainable in anyway shape or form, only holds at best about 10 people, hugs the globe in low earth orbit, and still cost upwards of 100 billion dollars. An O'neil cylinder city sized space colony(about 32,000 meters), holds 10,000 people, is totally self sustainable and floats around in Mars orbit would probably cost more money than the entire global GDP. That even if we have significant technological advancements and scientific literacy this does not mean that everyone will suddenly be singing happy day and that a large number of people will still have very crappy lives.<br><br>Really the problem is that no one wants to admit the truth, and the truth is that no really cares about the truth, they care about good results. The creationists Christian loves God as long as he believes that he is going to get good results from God, ie it will answer his prayers and that he is going to go to heaven when he dies, if he thinks that's not working anymore he'll try something else. Now, he is an evolutionary Atheist and loves Science... as long as Science keeps turning out awesome new igadgets and other things he likes and basically says "yes we can!". When Science starts saying "no we can't!" I honestly fear for Science. Because this is really the exact same guy as he was before, he didn't really care about any of these things, he cared about good results. When he stops getting good results, he will probably have the same reaction that he had towards God: feelings of anger and betrayal, and similarly may abandon it.<br><br>Nate<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c2912571349963090079 title="comment permalink">6/25/14, 8:19 PM</a><br><br>

The narrative is still so new they haven't gotten the polish and decoration of ages of re-telling. Part of my incomprehension is because I prefer the creation stories of American Indians which are more comfortable to me at a visceral level. Much of the children's stories give me an urge to take them away from the cities to a more rural area, to a different narrative. It probably wouldn't change the stories in major ways but the feeling and idea that nature is more forgiving then civilized surroundings and city officials might give them more hope for themselves personally. I've always been a wild child inclined to disappear down a trail on my horse or into the back country when I could to nurse a hurt rather then go to some city amusements. Cities and lots of people are not and never have been a place I felt comfortable with.

That's the kind of collapse of legitimacy that generally leads to the collapse of a system of government, or even of a nation. <br><br>Space Seeder, that has everything to do with stories. You've just told your story, and it's at least as troubling to believers in business as usual as anything those homeless children in Dade County whisper to each other. <br><br>JimK, care to guess why I've been talking about Freemasonry and other lodges over and over again on this blog? <br><br>Tom, exactly -- the youth who take to gangs do it because it really is the best of the many bad options open to them, and -- as Toynbee points out -- the consequences are not universally bad. <br><br>Avery, I'm familiar with both of them, and in fact I'm planning on citing a number of late Roman figures as we proceed. <br><br>Nate, very cogently put. Tyson's a first-rate writer and science educator, and of course that's the point; it's not a lack of intelligence or compassion that puts him on one side of a widening gap and those kids in Dade County on the other. Science as a method of inquiry is one of the two or three really great achievements of the modern Western world; science as a utopian ideology and ersatz religion is simply one more belief system that promises more than it can deliver, and it's the latter that shapes most people's response to it just now. <br><br>Angel, I'll have to reread Jacobs' book. Scott's thesis seems a bit too simplistic to me, but it's an interesting concept -- and you're right that applying the same logic to today's gizmocentric economy does not lead to comforting thoughts. <br><br>Nate, thank you for giving me the benefit of the doubt! As I see it, the black (and Hispanic, and Asian, and white) kids in inner cities who are joining street gangs are in many cases choosing the best among the handful of dismal options our society leaves open to them, and the fact that that option also appeals to suburban white kids suggests, to me, that those suburban white kids may be making the same judgment call: life in a street gang seems less hollow, less hypocritical, and less self-defeating than the options pressed on them by their society.<br><br>That was likely true in ancient Rome as well; I wonder how many of the young Romans who put on a Visigoth's trousers and tunic, shocking their toga-clad parents, had read Tacitus' <i>Germania</i> and decided that given what Roman society demanded of them, they'd rather be barbarians, thank you very much. It's a common reaction in corrupt and dying civilizations, and a good sign of just how far ours has, shall we say, progressed along the usual trajectory.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c7064357956927576912 title="comment permalink">6/25/14, 9:08 PM</a><br><br>

This isn’t an accident; what the rhetoric of progress through science misses is that the advance of science may have been a necessary condition for the boomtimes of the industrial age, but it was never a sufficient condition in itself...The other half of the equation was the resource base on which industrial civilization depended."<br><br>The timing of that zenith supports your formulation, although it's not a global resource peak that appears to be driving it, but a national one. Peak oil in the U.S. arrived in 1971. A few years later, the divergence between real GDP per capita and median real income that characterized the modern economy began right when the first recession caused by an oil price shock hit in 1974. The same pattern shows if one plots productivity vs. real hourly compensation or GDP vs. the Genuine Progress Indicator, which includes the costs and benefits of externalities such as pollution, resource depletion, crime, and income inequality. People on what passes for the Left in the U.S. would like to blame the deterioration of the economic situation of the bulk of the American people on the pro-inequality policies that began under Reagan, although they certainly didn't help and likely made a bad situation worse, but the truth of the matter is that they started seven years earlier, when the U.S. was no longer in control of its own energy supply. I point this out to my students every semester. I'm surprised you didn't make this point first.<br><br>As for an "age of charismatic warlords," you're right; the U.S. isn't there yet, although I doubt it's a coincidence that one of our cultural icons is a tormented fictional mobster named after the high female voice in a choir, one that the real Governor of New Jersey is named after. On the other hand, one can look at two states in collapse, Iraq and Syria, and see what an organized band of would be 21st Century feudal warlords is doing over there. They seem to be intent on starting a Dark Age on fast forward by destroying the cultural artifacts of rival traditions, among their other violent acts.<br><br>http://crazyeddiethemotie.blogspot.com/2014/06/what-sith-jihad-wants-includes-science.html<br><br>Yes, I call ISIS "The Sith Jihad."

The Hard Song. The Blue Lady's secret name. Bloody Mary. God chased out of Heaven in heartbreak, leaving his abandoned, overmatched, and rather rudderless angels to resist the victorious demons.

They are attracted to garlands of skulls and smearing oneself with human ash, or drinking liquor out of a human skull. There's a whole industry supporting this here in Nepal. Think thighbone trumpets. They're all the rage.<br><br>It all strikes me as suggestive of changes especially in western cultures.

It's still the dominant ideology of most people in the educated upper and middle classes, so it still dominates media and political discourse. But very few of the people I've talked with who live outside of this shrinking group of people seem to be under the impression that progress in general is inevitable. There are still vestiges of it among the internal proletariat - people do expect electronic technology to continue to get better, for instance.<br><br>I think that belief in Progress tends to decay for people who have seen it fail to match their reality for a long period of time. What we're beginning to see is the collapse of this story even among the educated class; even the government's usual fiddling with the statistics couldn't hide a 2.9% annualized GDP decline last quarter, and the fact that "normal" conditions aren't returning seems to be dawning. Scientists are among the last who will see this; for most scientists, there may be a worrying lack of research funds, but progress is still occurring in a large number of fields. Astronomy, for instance, has seen a number of very interesting discoveries in the past two decades. In 1994 no exoplanets had been detected, it was unknown that the universe's expansion is accelerating, no rover spacecraft had been to Mars, the Hubble had just been repaired and was only beginning to make a long string of impressive discoveries, and so on. People like Neil deGrasse Tyson can easily point to all those discoveries and hold on to the belief that science will eventually advance all of humanity beyond scarcity and perhaps allow us to leave the planet entirely. Minor details like the fact that the US no longer has a functioning manned space program can still be brushed aside for now.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c1845120409040125606 title="comment permalink">6/25/14, 11:58 PM</a><br><br>

He uses Biblical mythology quite freely in his trilogy - one protagonist has an unpleasant meeting with the not-so-nice angel Metatron, for instance - but it's nothing like so dark as the Virgin murdering her son to become a sort of celestial banshee - now that is a really brutal takedown. I don't think the Vatican would like it. As for the blue lady of the sea, it sounds like we have a potential goddess developing there; and they probably wouldn't be too keen on that either. <br><br>As I recall, Dade county was the central focus of Anita Bryant's nationally-touted campaign to "Save Our Children" by means of anti-gay legislation, back in 1976. Four decades on, I guess the kids really got saved, didn't they? Where are she and her ilk now - feeding the hungry and housing the homeless? Maybe, but I'm not too sanguine on that point. Perhaps there's some slight difference between morality on the one hand and a moral panic on the other. <br><br>I remember well that halcyon time in the early 70s when we were going to save the whole world, preserve democracy, and raise everyone's standard of living to match our own, or at least something like it. That no doubt was a fantasy, but I do think we could have done a great deal better than we have done.

And our Western civilization is on a vastly greater scale. I also am not aware of, at least, any ideology or religion that has the faintest chance of sweeping across the world, except perhaps either a revived Communism or Islam (by sheer demographic power).<br><br>To talk, then, of a new mimesis in a singular sense seems slightly out of place; to be sure, the political fracturing of the Roman empire didn't weaken the influence of the Christian worldview, but I think there is a serious difference of character with Westerners today. There is a loss of faith in our political institutions as well as a loss of faith in their underlying ideology, so today, I don't think it likely that some new belief system could spread its influence without also presenting a political system with it. This again brings us to Communism/Islam. The other examples you mentioned were a case of a political crisis (or imperial decline if you prefer) leading to a general crisis, but whether it was Han China or ancient Rome, it was more a question of who should be emperor instead of whether they ought to have one.<br><br>No doubt the sort of adored warlords you mentioned could cement the influence of this or that ideology that is currently marginal. Providing security in decline could alone be enough to create an ideology around such a leader. I can't help but feel that the 20s and 30s already showed us this phase, however. Perhaps we could mark that as the crisis that preceded the end of Christendom and its final replacement with Progress.<br><br>In short, I think we are likely to either see the spread of Communism or Islam, perhaps countered (or facilitated) by an attempted single warlord "empire," but afterward the whole idea of a unified West will be a dream like Rome became, some ancient ideal that was unattainable. <br><br>I do hope the warlord of the Midwest is in favor of subsidiarity; perhaps I ought to be building up my own army now... :)<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c1713202786737293740 title="comment permalink">6/26/14, 12:41 AM</a><br><br>

That's not an unfair view to take of what's happening here in post-Soviet Russia. The Russians experienced Western 'liberal economics' in the 90s, and it was a horrible experience for them. The Chinese watched in awed horror, and determined that they weren't ever going to let the same happen to them (they, of course, had prior experience back in the 19th century). Both are now building a position that protects them from the tentacles of the Western oligarchy - for which they must, of course, be portrayed as evil in the stories the West tells itself.<br><br>Here in Russia, though, the fruits of the recovery are unevenly distributed. Furthermore, particularly in the south, there is a big demographic change going on as the Muslim cultures of the Caucasus maintain higher birthrates than the Russians. The latter are responding to these two trends by seeking refuge in the Neo-Cossack movement, which is something of particular interest to me. Although I don't share many of its values - and those values are often at variance with those of the historical Cossacks - the movement does seem to genuinely be creating a strong and internally stable new culture.<br><br>This is where the threads of history and culture were frayed but not yet forgotten; the old clothes can be repurposed for new garments.<br><br>In other places - West Africa, Dade County - culture has collapsed to the extent that transgression and new cults are the only refuge of the disoriented remnants. <br><br>I appreciate that I've mentioned this several times recently, but Robert Kaplan predicted this in 1994 in his essay 'The Coming Anarchy', with the tagline "Skinhead Cossacks and juju warriors", which is well worth reading for people interested in this week's theme!<br><br>I've written a bit about it on my own blog, if anyone's interested: <a href=http://emlyn.info/skinhead-cossacks-and-juju-warriors-or-what-a-fine-baby-ive-killed-two-like-him-today/ rel=nofollow>Skinhead Warriors and Juju Warriors or: What a fine baby, I've killed two like him already today</a>.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c131780059356077079 title="comment permalink">6/26/14, 1:26 AM</a><br><br>

But is that my aging ears, my new perspective, my stepping away from the progress story or what? Something of each, and then some, most likely. There certainly is no shortage of stories and narratives out there to explain the world, once you start to look. It's both fascinating and a little exhausting.

Most of them keep their hair very short, very few allow facial hair other than Lech-Walesa-style moustaches, and many wear very often those hoodies, like imitating the urban guetto style from the States or the UK. Actually, despite this being nowadays a country with a very low rate of foreigners (it used to be a culturally rich place before WW2 and even more before their independence after their partition period) and almost a non-existent exposure to black people, teenagers find idols to follow in American black musicians, and want to wear their brands and play their sports. <br>All this was kind of shocking for me, coming as I do from a not-that-urban background in a completely different climate zone, where I would say that hippie, reggae and ska subcultures combine better with the Spanish worldview, at least in the portion of the Mediterranean coast where I grew up. Of course there are many looks coexisting in Spain, but the point is that hoodies are not as popular as in Poland and mostly associated with soccer right-wing fans.<br>By being here I also experience that sensation about the future not being yet evenly distributed. For example, is amazing the way that Poland recalls features of Spanish recent past, like the poor quality of the roads, the old public transport network and the widespread presence and acceptance of the Catholic church. In the same way, Poles who have been to Ukraine or to Belarus describe those countries as "Poland twenty years ago". There's a very patronizing first layer of this thought about "we" living in the future and "they" living in the past, and it took me a while to identify the ideology of progress at work, for according to the storyline of growth, in twenty years, Ukraine would be like Poland and Poland like Spain, although that won't probably be the way. <br>The most amazing reality of all this is how, despite the globalization trend of the last decades, neighboring countries can still be so different and follow their own internal pace.<br><br>Jordi<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c7760285608709897987 title="comment permalink">6/26/14, 7:04 AM</a><br><br>

Though homeless, these children have probably been exposed to visual electronic media all their lives (though, in 1997 the internet wouldn't have been a factor for them, as it is in the Slenderman stories.) <br><br>Perhaps one of the things that might be forgotten in our future dark age is the multi-billion dollar industry that served as one of the major sources for these kinds of stories--The industry, that, for all its sophistication, is promoting a largely oral/visual, a-literate, illiterate, non-reasoning way of encountering the world: profiting off synthetic myth-making, as it were, and more influential in many young people's lives than anything school offers.

Really strong post! I have long perceived that those going through a collapse wouldn't see it as one, due to the slow decline (wrote several poems about that in the early 80's), but your point about mimesis was both startling and (after I thought about it) very clear. I also remember how the rich and the authorities were looked up to in 50’s, 60’s - and now, it seems they are lower than street cleaners on the respect scale! And it's a sobering thought that such a situation might loosen the balancing ties of society.

Make it up? But no one has come forward to totally refute it, either - it's like it popped up "fully born" and then disappeared... and has popped up again this year... so it will be interesting to see if anyone can find any other confirmation or refutation of this one article...but I don’t doubt the underlying point, which is that there are new stories being created by the disenfranchised, ones that more closely fit their experiences.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c8070600225709729134 title="comment permalink">6/26/14, 7:50 AM</a><br><br>

He was shocked when he actually met some of these white suburban kids who seemed to love the idea of the hell he grew up in. I was subsequently shocked when I learned that some of his friends called him all kinds of horrible things when they learned he got with a white girl(even though she was just as poor as them) and had a little brown baby, as if he betrayed them or something. What can you say, a person can be smart but people seem to just be dumb all around."</i><br><br>Respectfully, let me point out a practical, rational possible explanation of that reaction from your father's (ex?) friends. It's a pragmatic explanation that usually goes with saying (doesn’t have to be explained) among other “tribes" (non-African-Americans). <br><br>If you scratch the surface of most modern-day middle-class and above African-Americans, you'll find previous generations who were desperately poor. So, the trajectory of <i>"up from hell to a better life outside the slums"</i> is not an unusual life narrative among non-poor African-Americans.<br><br>My parents (who made the leap from big-city poverty in their youth to upper-middle-class affluence through higher education) grew up poor in Chicago’s segregated slums. The high-rise housing projects (like the infamous Cabrini-Green) that were created in the late 1950s/early 1960s were actually considered a step up from the tenements that my parents had grown up in.<br><br>If your Dad's experience was anything like my Dad's experience as he clawed his way out of the slums, there were a LOT of material and non-material resources invested into him by the African-American collective. More than a few equally-poor Black folks invested in his rise. Especially the African-American women in my Dad’s orbit. Very few people are singular "up from the slums" success stories <i>totally all by themselves</i>. When you look closely at the situation, they usually had some type of help or support. Often from some of the other poor people around them.<br><br>Regarding my Dad, the African-American women in his orbit invested a LOT of energy into supporting his rise. From his poor Black mother and poor Black grandmother. To his equally poor Black aunts.

My grandfather and other male relatives, the male pastor of my grandmother's church, and my Dad’s male friends were helpful. But these men weren't on a fervent "mission" to support him (and other young Black male strivers) like the Black women in his orbit. The Black church ladies launched these fund-raising missions to give some financial support to my Dad and other young Black male strivers from the neighborhood. Not the male pastor. Not the male deacons. This overall pattern was not (and is not) unusual in poor African-American neighborhoods. <br><br>The (equally poor) Black church ladies also got together to periodically send "care packages" to many of the poor young Black male college students who were living away on campus.<br><br>The Black women in my Dad's orbit invested a lot of their hopes and dreams into seeing him and other striving young African-American men rise. These women played a not-insignificant part in enabling his rise. Let's be clear: Black women made the lion’s share of the investment in my Dad's rise. Black men made some investment in my Dad’s rise. Nonblack women did not invest anything in my Dad's rise out of the slums.<br><br>So it would've left a very bad taste in more than a few of my Dad's Black friends', Black relatives' and Black acquaintances' mouths if he had accepted all that support from the African-American "tribe," and then gave all the economic benefits of his rise to an outsider woman from another tribe and another community. Particularly if the outsider woman was from a "tribe" that either: (1) did nothing to help his rise, and contributed nothing to his rise. Or (2) had tried to hinder or block his rise. <br><br>Keep in mind my Dad was a young man in the 1960s. I don't know what age group your Dad is in. Perhaps everything was okay when your Dad made his rise. Of course, I also don’t know what, if any, investment the other Black folks around him made into your Dad’s rise. Maybe your Dad did it all by himself. Or maybe outsiders helped your Dad rise. Maybe outsiders even provided the lion’s share of support for your Dad’s rise out of poverty.<br><br>I’m simply saying that my Dad’s experience was not unique or unusual. African-Americans (particularly African-American church ladies) tend to rally around and pour a lot of resources into young Black male strivers. <br><br>From conversations I've had with friends over the years, it seems pretty clear to me that other "tribes" understand the economic effects of this sort of wealth transfer. It's why many of the Jewish and Greek people I know have not-so-thrilled reactions to males from their group marrying outside their group---thereby transferring their material resources from the Jewish or Greek "tribe" to a woman from an outsider tribe. Most cohesive tribes try to keep their material resources flowing among and toward themselves.<br><br>In the scheme of things, NO rational or reasonable person cares about other folks’ romantic choices. But rational people <i>do</i> tend to care about whether or not their tribe is getting a return on the investment they made in various tribal members. The African-American tribe has the same legitimate concerns about where its tribal resources are going as any other tribe. <br><br>During the Long Descent, I won’t be surprised if various tribes increasingly start circling the wagons, so to speak. Tribal membership can be defined in various ways. Nevertheless, in times of economic pressure people in most countries tend to default to ethnic membership.<br><br>Just saying'. {smile}<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c4459500553354620357 title="comment permalink">6/26/14, 8:34 AM</a><br><br>

(?)<br><br>Portions of the stories you relate -- particularly the rout of Heaven, God MIA, etc. -- sound like they were lifted from a number of recent television series, including the wildly-popular Supernatural series, now in it's tenth season. I'm wondering how many other images are drawn from various "children's cartoons," popular anime, and the like.<br><br>These stories in turn come from professional writers who are crafting in an iconoclastic or even nihilistic mode that deliberately undercuts existing verities. It has become very popular to rehabilitate the villains of old, for instance -- Bram Stoker's stain of pure evil that infested an abandoned castle in the Carpathians became Fred Saberhagen's erudite and misunderstood "friend of the family," who then became the various tragic and even heroic "sparkly vampires" of modern stories, while the heroes and gods of old are turned on their heads and portrayed as morally compromised or even outright shams.<br><br>I mention this because I've read that much the same happened during the birth of Christianity. It's a fact that dying-reborn gods were all over the Near East in the centuries around CE 1, and each major ethnic group had its own: Osiris, Attis, Adonis, Dionysus, etc. I've read that the Jews were no exception, and that a group based in Alexendria called the Therapeutae, were actively crafting a uniquely Jewish version of the dying-reborn god, which may have formed a basis for some of the later Christian stories. Which may or may not be a historically defensible claim -- I wouldn't know.<br><br>The point, however, is that dying cultures have plenty of detractors, many of those detractors are literate and tell really fine stories, and variants of those stories filter down to the illiterate and suffering classes who embrace and blend them to provide hope in the face of a hopeless reality. Those stories, in turn, are <i>intended</i> to tear down the existing order.<br><br>Perhaps it is a little like the scavenger species -- ants, worms, bacteria -- that recycle the organic matter from which life has departed.

(The Russians won. More staying power I guess.)<br><br>All this may seem a bit beside the point of your post, except that this quote of Tyson's, garnered from Wikipedia, intrigues me:<br><br>"Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence."<br><br>Now, I don't consider myself a standard religious believer; nevertheless it strikes me that if the basic story we tell ourselves about the universe AS A HOME FOR US, is one that sees it as a murderer of its own children, well then maybe the need for CONTROL is going to be the first thing on your mind, and maybe you will want to bend every instrument of mind and body, science and engineering to that project of control. And maybe you'll enthusiastically call for more funding. More investment. More control. Even as the returns on those investments dwindle. <br><br>But let's go back to the core assumption behind all that: the universe as murderer. <br><br>To my mind, maybe our biggest job in the face of descent, is to figure out how to contribute to the richness of our home AS IT IN MOST OF THE OLD STORIES, WAS ORIGINALLY GIVEN TO US (trees, flowers, fields, oceans rivers etc), rather than as we've gotten used to it (plastic milk jugs, superhighways, etc.)Our job is to give up the fantasy of overt control, and adopt a scheme that sensibly, systematically, limits us. And under this scheme our first job is to control OURSELVES. Control our expectations. Count our blessings first and our seventy-eight-degree-Fahrenheit wishes second. <br><br>To use a musical metaphor, whatever is clever ingenious, elegant, about our lives has to become a intentional variation on the ground bass of nature's generosity, and never depart from that foundation.<br><br>In the end that means, as you so often say, JMG, first and foremost: LESS.<br><br>It seems to me, though, that you can't begin that project of unfolding the fist of control--of rebellion against that foundational harmony--until you perceive that the universe we live in is in fact our HOME, and furthermore that "home," if it means anything, HAS to include a touch of what we used to call Providence, of the open-handed gift economy. Of course, any little jack pine seedling growing out of a crack in the cliff could tell us this, but we seem pretty deaf of late.<br><br>To get around to the point: I'm saying that the Tyson quote describes our universe in a surprisingly children-of-Dade-county-like way. <br><br>I'm saying too that this is, at first, sort of surprising.

I listen to local radio stations as they're broadcasting in India and China on my iPhone while I work; I can get real-time micro-news from any corner of the globe via Twitter; the name of a childhood acquaintance from 30 years ago can come to mind, and a moment later, thanks to Google and its links, I can see a current image of his face and find out where he lives and works now (as well as how much his house is worth, who his ancestors are, what his mother looked like in her half-century-old engagement photo, and on and on....)<br><br>All that is true, and what you're saying is true, simultaneously. During your blogging absence, I read your <i>Not the Future We Ordered</i>, in which you address the fact that people alive today have personally experienced increasing technological capabilities, and I was pleased you did so, as I think this experience of advancing technological efficiency and speed is probably the most common thought-stopper people employ for why decline can't possibly be around the corner. <br><br>Obviously the vast majority of people in the world don't have iPhones, but cheap cell phones are very common in poorer countries, so even there people have seen tremendous technological change.

(Apologies to G.K. Chesterton.) It's possible to run a perfectly satisfactory industrial society off of solar power and wind farms -- it just wouldn't be capable of the level of abundance to which 30-some years of eating our seed corn has accustomed Western Uncivilization.

It's not really a simple thing, in part because my loved ones don't agree with me about diminishing natural resources and the potential consequences. Luckily, my partner desires to live more simply than the average and I believe my child understands the importance of sidestepping any and all debt. That feels like an accomplishment and a huge relief, but there's more to do. Choosing a narrative to cultivate is complicated further because truthfully I fall asleep along the way, don't always know how to gauge its usefulness, or question my sanity altogether. On one hand, I know several people who think anyone who doesn't live high on the hog or is struggling is living with poverty consciousness and that with a swipe of a positive thought card could change their perception and experience. This feels disingenuous and in some cases deluded to me; sometimes it's downright mean the way poverty or lack is punished. On the other hand, I can see how my desire to choose and cultivate a narrative might go around the same twist. It takes so much time and effort to tease these things apart, I completely understand why some people decide they'd rather not. I tend to do best in these efforts when I recognize it as a fulfilling creative endeavor with no guarantees.

Those kids, at least some of them, are adults now and likely have kids of their own. What stories are they telling?<br><br>Living here among the rural side of the internal proletariat, I'm not sure they are telling any stories at all other than that the poor get the shaft, always have, and always will. That's not a new story. Most are just trying to smoke, drown, and medicate their sorrows away. There's also the old story of not being able to trust anyone but ourselves, we're on our own. This may be a function of the fact that life never really does change all that much for rural peasants, generation to generation. <br><br>I don't know if this is new, I haven't been in this area long enough, but if you are one of the few remaining Americans who still pick up hitchhikers, you generally get a story right out of the depression of hard luck, nothing left at home, hitting the road looking for anything better, hopes that some cousin of some guy they met once might have work for them in Oregon. Again, there have always been people who fell down on their luck, and it's hard to tell yet whether this is a trend.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c1745411386267854723 title="comment permalink">6/26/14, 11:44 AM</a><br><br>

There's a sense in which people in the Rust Belt are the involuntary early adopters of the future of industrial society as a whole. <br><br>Bill, I'm basing my prediction that these won't be the enduring stories of the dark age ahead on historical principles, as usual -- you can see things like Christianity stirring in the Roman world a good long ways back, but the stories go through a lot of changes before they get systematized into an enduring vision of meaning and values. <br><br>Godozo, yes, the schoolgirl crush that so many right-wing pundits seem to have on Putin these days is a good example of what I was talking about. Mind you, Putin's a competent leader, which we have in very short supply in the west just now, so I can understand why said pundits developed said crush!<br><br>Compound F, thank you! May I ask a favor of you and anyone else who enjoys <i>Star's Reach</i>? I went with a small publisher to keep the story from being edited with a rusty chainsaw by bonobos on bad acid -- the usual fate of fiction in the hands of big publishers these days -- but that also means no publicity budget worth speaking of. The one source of publicity the book has is word of mouth; if you could recommend it to anyone you think would enjoy it, I'd be most grateful!<br><br>Christian, don't confuse the money economy with the production of actual goods and services. The only reason GDP has grown in recent decades is the explosion of fictive wealth of various kinds -- basically, unpayable IOUs churned out by an increasingly reckless financial industry -- to prop up a faltering industrial system. I'd encourage you to look at the percentage of GDP accounted for by the financial industry over the last thirty years -- that's one way to see how much current "wealth" is simply smoke and mirrors.<br><br>As for your second question, infinite growth on a finite planet is an impossibility no matter how you spin it. If energy isn't the limiting factor, something else will be. Thus no matter who comes up with what gimmick, the road leads down from here. <br><br>Angel, well, I'll check it out. <br><br>Indrajala, no, but clearly I should. The worship of death in one form or another -- whether it's contemporary vampire fetishism or the cult of Santissima Muerte -- has become a huge cultural presence of late, and yes, that's a sign worth tracking. <br><br>Boneyard, no, I hadn't seen it yet. Good for the Greeks; they've realized that if you don't use money for your transactions, the financial industry doesn't get to take their cut. <br><br>Grebulocities, you may well be right. I've long suspected that faith in progress, like any other religious belief, will be given lip service long after most people have stopped putting any real trust in it. <br><br>Kevin, it's very typical for the gods of one era to become the devils of the next, so I wasn't at all surprised to see the Virgin Mary turned into a child-eating monster -- and let's not even talk about how many bad experiences with Catholic clergy might also feed into that. (I've commented before that while people from other denominations who left their birth religion have a galaxy of reasons for doing so, every single former Catholic I've ever met left the church because of an abuse of power on the part of a priest, monk, nun, or other Catholic religious functionary.) As for your broader point, no argument there.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c576921602771436376 title="comment permalink">6/26/14, 1:30 PM</a><br><br>

More on this in future posts.<br><br>Kevin, yes, I was thinking of him among others. Give it a while, and there'll be figures of the same kind on a much larger scale. <br><br>Nate, I'm sure all teenagers feel frustrated and unfulfilled, but it wasn't that rare back when I was in that age range for teenagers to feel as though they had a galaxy of enticing possibilities open to them -- and for many of them, here in the US, that wasn't an illusion. Now, for a very large number of teens, there are few possibilities of any kind, and all of them pretty dismal. That's an important shift, one with huge political and cultural implications.<br><br>Renaissance, good question. It's been suggested that she may be partly based on the Vodoun loa Yemaya, who dwells in the sea and wears blue clothing. <br><br>Bogatyr, thanks for the update! I'm not at all familiar with the Neo-Cossack movement -- will have to look into it. With regard to Kaplan, my only objection to him -- which I made in <a href=../../2012/07/distant-sound-of-tumbrils.html rel=nofollow>an earlier post here</a> -- is that he seems to think the industrial West can stay sheltered from the coming anarchy, and there I think he's going to find himself hideously mistaken. <br><br>Ben, no argument there -- when the shale bubble pops, it's going to get <i>very</i> messy. <br><br>Kristoffer, I haven't seen one. I'd encourage you to get writing on it!<br><br>Phil, I saw the same thing on this side of the pond, and it's a standard historical event. When a civilization is on its way down, creativity vanishes from its upper end and reemerges at the bottom of the social pyramid. <br><br>Kutamun, if you want to learn the secret name of the blue-skinned goddess, I suggest talking to some very poor ten-year-olds...<br><br>Yupped, we're early in the process.

It's been part of the tradition all along -- not the whole of it, but an important theme. As for Tyson, he's expressing with remarkable cogency the <a href=../../2013/09/a-sense-of-homecoming.html rel=nofollow>basic religious sensibility</a> that underlies belief in progress, as it does most other Western faiths of the last two millennia or so: the idea that the world is a terrible place where we don't belong, and we deserve better. To my mind, that's a bizarre way of looking at things, but then my sensibility is a different one. <br><br>Unknown, much of what passes for Christianity these days has no resemblance to anything that used to exist under the same label. It's a common event -- more on this in posts to come. <br><br>Peak Singularity, bright and holy gods. If Monbiot has caught onto the fact that a purely negative approach to social change -- "Look at what those horrible people are doing! Please, someone, stop them!" -- simply doesn't work, we may actually see something useful come out of the green activist scene. <br><br>Eric, I saw that also -- another whisper of the same kind. I'll be talking in <a href=http://galabes.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>my other blog</a> about why myth and magic so reliably gather around the end of one historical era and the first centuries of the next. <br><br>DaShui, I don't think it's just a failure of parenting, either. These are extraordinarily difficult times to grow to adulthood. <br><br>Sister BoysMom, not at all surprised, though it would have been nice if they'd given credit. <br><br>Joe, it's a very common habit in ages of decline to attention to those things that appear to be progressing, and ignore those that very clearly aren't doing so. It's amazing to me, for example, how many people have no idea that no human being has gotten further into space than low earth orbit since 1972 -- or for that matter, how many people manage not to notice how steeply standards of living for most Americans have declined over roughly the same period. Sure, we've got a few technologies that are progressing by leaps and bounds, but most of the everyday machines that surround you (cars, toasters, washing machines, etc.) have undergone only minor incremental improvements in the last half century.

It suggested that the biblical story of the Hebrews getting gifted Canaan was a myth hiding the fact that they were themselves remnants of a collapsed Canaan. Apparently Canaan was a two tiered society of God kings above and slaves below. The slaves revolted and left, collapsing everything. People wandered around, hooked up with others forming new tribes. One adopted the God later known as Yahweh from some tribe or other they encountered in North Africa. They resettled in Canaan, but needed to solidify their new identity via 'we are different' myths. So we see the use of myths as Canaanite go through their collapse on to new identity that has become the accepted account worldwide for thousands of years.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c16362646746009851 title="comment permalink">6/26/14, 5:08 PM</a><br><br>

Or better yet: compressed, so that the salient points can be conveyed clearly, in a few words, such that one need not wade through pages and pages of Rameau et al. (future copyists might also thank you). However, music theory, like computers, has much in the way of "business logic," so there may be a limit to how much of the tradition can be compressed, or details that would need reinvention as necessary.

I speak Spanish, and I could care less if Latin American immigrants speak or learn English. While I certainly realize that no culture is perfect, I'm envious of many aspects of traditional Latin American culture, including the focus on family, community, hard work, and making the most of very little. I think these traits are much better adapted to the future we are facing than mainstream Anglo culture. To the extent I listen to pop, I prefer Spanish pop. If I were in a position where I needed labor, I'd prefer undocumented Latin American to native born U.S. My biggest concern is that immigrants are being sold a bill of goods in their home countries when it comes to the American dream, particularly the future of said dream.<br>Khadija, humans, as social primates, are both prone to tribalism and promiscuity. So when you put different groups of humans together, both tribalism and "miscegenation" reliably result. My guess is that, over time" miscegenation" wins out. To my way of thinking tribalism reliably results in fighting and death, witness the Shia and Sunni In Iraq currently, while" miscegenation", for obvious reasons, results in life. "Miscegenated" cultures, for example, Mexico, can be very cohesive cultures. My guess is that the future of North America will involve both balkanization, in the true sense of the word as it occurred in the Balkans, and more "miscegenation". Race is a social construct anyway, but I doubt very seriously if the far future will consist of white and black people as they exist today.

Also, since modern Islam is basically a reactionary religion, as the U.S. collapses, I see the" Great Satan" moving from the U.S. to Russia and China, as they become the lightning rod for Islamic grievance as they ascend in power.

I have a conservative Catholic friend who hangs out with Hispanics by preference, as they share more of his values than the local gringo population does. <br><br>Elaine, contemporary sources contradict your claim -- people writing at the time recognized it as cultural influence from Germanic barbarians, which was very clearly shown in other cultural phenomena at the same time, and there were plenty of people who kept wearing togas for some time thereafter. (Have you ever handled a toga, btw? They were made of wool, averaged 18 feet long and 7 feet wide, and resembled nothing so much as a Highland Scots plaid mor -- that is to say, plenty warm.) I'm aware of the cooling trend, and of course it was a major factor in the social ecology of the time, but correlation is not causation and single-factor environmental theories of cultural change have generally not worn well.<br><br>Shane, the question in my mind is purely where the dividing line will be between Muslim and Russian spheres of influence.

I was talking about <i>wealth transfers</i> via marriage. There was always plenty of "miscegenation" between White and Black Americans. First on the slave plantations, and later on during segregation and Jim Crow. By contrast, there was very little to almost no <i>wealth transfers</i> between White and Black Americans. <br><br>Because the American White collective of previous eras had laws in place to prevent the transfer of wealth via marriage from Whites to the Blacks they were having sexual and/or romantic relationships with. Most ethnic groups seek to preserve their wealth and resources "in house." And to prevent their resources from flowing out to outsiders. This is a normal human urge.<br><br>It's a patriarchal planet, so in most cases (relative) wealth and other resources are flowing from the husband to the wife when a couple gets married. Resources are flowing from the husband's group to his wife (whoever she may be).<br><br>In short, I'm talking about money and economic choices, the economic impact of marriage choices, and the generational effects created by all of this. Not romance. Not "miscegenation." Please don't reframe this as being about "miscegenation." <br><br>The type of comment I responded to has the underlying (and mistaken in my view) assumption that there couldn't possibly be any rational, pragmatic reasons why his father's (Black) friends were displeased by his choice. There are rational, pragmatic reasons for that response. I explained them.<br><br>My point is that other (non-African-American) ethnic groups (like the Jewish community and, from what I've seen, Greek-Americans) understand these dynamics. African-Americans tend to have limited comprehension* of these dynamics, and we suffer because of that.<br><br>[*Spending our money with and investing in ourselves emotionally feels like segregation, so there's no joy in that for many African-Americans. Spending our money with and investing in non-African-Americans feels like freedom, so there's an emotional "buzz" from doing that for many African-Americans. The problem is that this behavior pattern keeps us poor as a group.]<br><br>What most outsiders don't realize is that, as a collective, the African-American is not poor. What keeps the African-American ethnic group living in impoverished conditions is our dysfunctional (and rare among the world of ethnic groups) mass behavior pattern of taking our resources and spending them with everybody and anybody except our own people. <br><br>An article in the Seattle Times sums it up:<br><br><i>"Collectively, last year, black consumers spent more than $270 billion - but little of it with each other.</i><br><br><i>In the more insular Asian and Hispanic communities, a dollar turns over four or five times before it goes elsewhere, but studies suggest that most dollars earned by blacks aren't passed on to other blacks even once."</i><br><br>From the 1992 (nothing has changed since then in terms of collective African-American economic behavior) article, <i>`Buy Black' -- Black Dollar Days Part Of Effort To Fuel Community Business</i>. African-Americans do this, and then have the nerve to beg for charity and handouts from the larger society.<br><br>Most other ethnic groups, especially more "insular" ethnic groups, understand these things. Other folks keep track of where their group's resources are going even when they date and marry "out." I do the same thing, even though my ex is White and I date "out." When non-African-Americans date and marry outside their ethnic group, they don't automatically "space out" on their own "tribe's" collective interests (the way many African-Americans do). It would be nice if more African-Americans learned how to do the same.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c2437742706459231784 title="comment permalink">6/27/14, 7:36 AM</a><br><br>

Tyson then compares the motivation for switching to these cleaner forms of energy to the efforts of the Space race and emphasizes that it is not too late for humanity to correct its course."<br><br>From the abstract to Jon Kabat-Zinn's "Some reflections on the origins of MBSR, skillful means, and the trouble with maps", <i>Contemporary Buddhism, </i>Vol. 12, No. 1, May 2011:<br><br>"The author recounts some of the early history of what is now known as MBSR, and its relationship to mainstream medicine and the science of the mind/body connection and health....He locates these developments within an historic confluence of two very different epistemologies encountering each other for the first time, that of science and that of the meditative traditions. ... The author's perspective is grounded in what the Zen tradition refers to as the one thousand year view. Although it is not stated explicitly in this text, he sees the current interest in mindfulness and its applications as signaling a multi-dimensional emergence of great transformative and liberative promise, one which, if cared for and tended, may give rise to a flourishing on this planet akin to a second, and this time global, Renaissance, for the benefit of all sentient beings and our world." [end of quote from Kabat-Zinn]<br><br>Another American Zen teacher, Shinzen Young: "Science has beauty, depth, power, and practical utility. I believe that <b>the two most impressive discoveries of our species</b> are <b>the Eastern method of meditative exploration and the Western method of scientific exploration</b>. Some people claim that meditation and science have mated, but I think they are just starting to date. I believe the true mating will occur sometime later in this century and<b> will give birth to a world-transforming paradigm shift</b>."<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c3531417613541402274 title="comment permalink">6/27/14, 8:14 AM</a><br><br>

In the first case a particular authority has lost the ability to be inspire imitation, so others are favored and cheered for (go team!); in the latter there is a rejection of all NOTICED mimesis.<br><br>Like you say that people who claim not to have a myth generally just are not conscious of their myths; or the old philosophic joke that those who claim to not think metaphysically just have a bad metaphysics. Those who claim not to be followers (isn't that the vernacular for this phenomena?) just don't make note of what or who they are following.<br><br>An interesting aspect of following is that each one of up is inspired by many sources in many contexts, so as an author fills a page with words and phrases inspired my many source to create a blend which is original, our imitation of many sources is a key part of our creativity and originality.<br><br>The pain of losing respect for what once was inspiring is great indeed, and what is gathered together to fill that gap uncertain.<br><br>If humans only imitated humans I think that it is a house of mirrors, but mimesis can take in inspiration from animals, elemental processes, abstractions, fictional characters, Deities, misnomers, and many many things which I cannot name. For much of religion, much of magic this is key.<br><br>Some people tell me that when the current elite go their will be no more elite, others say that another elite will fill the same seats. I think instead that decline is like the mad hatter <br>hosting a game of musical seats, more chairs, fewer chairs, bigger chairs, upside-down chairs, electric chairs, and comfy chairs, throwns of skulls, throwns of mud, and pews all being added and removed and moved.<br><br>The denial of the possibility of an elite which deserves to be imitated is I think critical to certain strains of barbarism, the 'civilization = bad' idea is connected as well. The move from saying no to this social order toward saying no to all social ordering. Perhaps this makes people more receptive to being followers, and explains how such wild weird characters can receive many followers. What isn't noticed isn't guarded. <br><br>I take pride in having had many important teachers, teachers are my preferred sources of mimesis, I am eager to find good ones, and to find diverse ones, so that short comings and over specializations from one side can be balanced.

Well, the July issue of "Proceedings of the IEEE", the flagship publication of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, contains the following article: "Smart Grids Versus the Achilles' Heel of Renewable Energy: Can the Needed Storage Infrastructure Be Constructed Before the Fossil Fuel Runs Out" (by W. F. Pickard). <br><br>Here are a few choice phrases from the abstract: ... by the close of this century: 1) ...approaching exhaustion of ... recoverable fossil fuel; 2) ...energy shortages...can be avoided only if immediate massive steps are taken... 3) there is little evidence... that the key governments are seriously concerned.<br><br>The author claims that every watt of generating capacity must be backed by 12 watt-hours of storage, and even then, over the course of four years, fossil-fuel backup was needed five times.<br><br>Roughly speaking, a AA battery contains one watt-hour of energy. World-wide, average power consumption per person is 2.7 kW. This is an average over all people in the world, and over all human activities, not simply residential electrical consumption. If we got all of our energy from AA batteries, we'd be exhausting 2700 of them per hour(24/7)... so if you were hoping to use solar panels to recharge batteries during the day, I'm not saying that's a bad idea, only that it's insignificant with respect to your actual consumption.<br><br>The good news is that the IEEE is publishing papers like this, for the engineers who the naive public expects to "think of something". <br><br>The bad news is that (as Pickard cites): "The Maginot Line was built more or less on scheduleo, except that its designers failed to get it right the first time, and there was no second chance."<br><br>Pickard also writes that if the US reduces its primary energy demand to only 1670 GW (avg), this could be supplied with wind for ~$13 trillion. Adding pumped hydro storage (1/3 the cost of lead-acid batteries) to get us through a calm week would cost ~$47 trillion.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c4228615511351030003 title="comment permalink">6/27/14, 6:18 PM</a><br><br>

In my view, the desire to emulate the elite is not the primary glue that keeps societies together. Nor is the respect of that elite. No doubt these help keep a society function with less resistance; but a more fundamental glue is simply sharing the value system of the elite. Sharing the same values does not mean respecting the elite or desiring to imitate them. You can understand the elite to be scum and still be loyal to them. I suggest this is the more common situation.<br><br>When I worked as a UN peacekeeper, I lived and worked closely with people from all over the world. Many of these people actively supported reprehensible regimes in their home countries. Among there number were assassins (aka special forces), kidnappers and torturers (aka intelligence officers), bandits (aka “other armed groups”), murders (aka soldiers), plunderers and rapists (aka militia), and organized criminals (aka government officials). Most of these people admitted to the fact that they supported evil regimes. Indeed, the people who seemed to be least psychologically damaged were those who were most honest with themselves about this. These people did not seek to emulate or imitate the villains they served. They knew what kind of people they were. They did however share their values. Their loyalty was based on their exception to share the loot. At the very least, they expected to be fed. Their loyalty to their masters was based on this not respect. <br><br>You gave the example of Roman Empire. Many cities that were dominated by this empire lavished praise and gratitude upon the Emperor for his benevolent conquest of their dominions. Of course this was politically astute, but this notwithstanding, some historians understand this praise and thanks to be unfeigned. Their conquest ushered in a period of peace and prosperity for the merchants and client rulers of the empire. <br><br>Such was the case even though the Roman Empire was transparently exploitative and brutal. There was a imperial theology that helped justified and glorified the conquests and exploitation. Politics and religion were not distinct entities. No one was expected to really believe this theology, only act as if they did. It helped give people the excuse they needed to support what was transparently evil. The Patron client hierarchy of the Roman Empire did not require respect of the elite so much as a shared value system of exploitation.<br><br>All the titles later given to a certain crucified rabbi from Judea (wherever that was!) were first applied to Octavian i.e. Son of God, Prince of Peace, God from God etc. Publicly challenging this theology, and the value system it implied, earned you a savage death. <br><br>If you found yourself at the bottom of that system, your loyalty to it was not based on a desire to emulate your exploiters. If you were loyal at all it was because it kept you fed (and often entertained) and you were legitimately afraid to oppose it. The same holds true today.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c288481874847067536 title="comment permalink">6/28/14, 6:38 AM</a><br><br>

Put the same ethnic groups (native, European, African) together under a different legal and social structure as exists in many Latin American countries, and within a few generations of initial contact, race as it is understood in North America becomes useless as a social, cultural, and class dividing line. Witness just how much racial mixing/intermarriage has occurred in the U.S. since the first tentative changes in the 60s. Wouldn't one of the solutions to your problem be outmarrying of black women, thereby bringing white male wealth in? By extension, the tentative changes we're seeing whereby black women are finding it more acceptable to outmarry a good sign?<br>I'm not sure that I see" white ethnics" or Asians, or even Hispanics as examples of cohesive ethnic groups in the U.S. Statistics I've read show the highest rates of outmarriage among Asians, and it certainly seems to me that ethnic identity has faded with" white ethnics" who migrated in the early 20th century.<br>Don't get me wrong, I certainly don't want to downplay the power of race as the most important fault line running through American society, but I'm not sure you are accounting for the drastic changes and upheavals society will undergo and the effects it will have on the current legal and social order. I don't see pursuit of wealth in the current social order as an effective survival skill over the long haul. Part of the transformation that is taking place is that what was once adaptive in the old, dying system is becoming maladaptive in the transformation. JMG has discussed at length here pursuing poverty as an adaptive strategy, and ways to live well poor here. He's discussed that the only way to win the game of musical chairs of wealth contraction is not to play the game. He's also shown the difference between fictive paper wealth and real wealth. We've discussed the scenario of a pitchforks/ tie em from a lamppost/ French revolution terror type situation occurring. Again, I'll ask, is pursuit of wealth under the current system adaptive when the wealthiest under that system are probably the most vulnerable? Will people be envying the wealthy then in a French revolution situation?<br>I'm reminded of a guy from Eastern Europe from the rightward side of the spectrum who was dedicated to the preservation of his national ethnic group from middle eastern immigration. No amount of discussion could convince him that ethnic groups were social constructs that reliably shatter during dark ages, and reform themselves as drastically different constructs afterwards. North America is no different. The current ethnic groups that occupy the current U.S. are not going to be the ones coming out the other end of the dark ages falling on us. The people of that time probably won't look like you or me. If I had to guess, I'd say they'd look like some of the most racially mixed peoples of Latin America. Preserving ethnic groups as they currently exist may be a lost cause, but seeing to it that the best cultural contributions of a given ethnic tradition are preserved for future generations could work. (As a ginger, my guess is it could take no telling how many thousands of years for natural selection to select for gingers again in some far northern latitude)<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c6734267834082138705 title="comment permalink">6/28/14, 6:51 AM</a><br><br>

Rising minimum wage from - what was it? $7, $8? - to $15 is not going to duplicate the available wealth available to society.<br><br>The problem with money and the extremely wealthy is that while society in general keeps thinking about wealth in abstract terms, this huge fortunes give them an inordinate amount of power over everybody else. That's it, you cannot really buy solutions to the ultimate problems in life, and luxuries eventually grow shallow, but you can boss around pretty much anyone around you.<br><br>One way to achieve this is by creating artificial scarcity for those at the bottom of the pyramid, so everyone will be even more eager to please you in order to avoid this punishment.

An informative article can be found here: http://www.sunnah.org/articles/Wahhabiarticleedit.htm<br><br>The history of the Wahhabist movement is closely intertwined with the rise and domination of the Saudi royal family in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and in the 20th and 21st centuries has been massively funded with billions of dollars of Saudi oil money; CAIR - the Council on American Islamic Relations - is one of the chief organizations spreading Wahhabism in the US and Canada, along with ICNA (the Islamic Council of North America) and the MSA (Muslim Student Association). The very great majority of US imams and mosques are Wahhabist - not Sunni, Shia, or Sufi.<br><br>The Saudis know they are running out of oil, and are thus seeking to colonize other countries in order to have a place to live when the oil resource is no longer present in such amounts to support them in their home countries. They use their money, therefore, to colonize, occupy, and take over lands where they can continue to live. This process isn't exactly unknown in North America, by the way ;-)<br><br>The recent elections in Europe demonstrate the existence of a growing backlash against, and resistance to, Saudi-funded Wahhabist presence and in some areas, domination. <br><br>The US government has also provided significant military support to Wahhabist groups, in an incredibly ignorant and boneheaded effort to expand the American Oil Imperium throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Modern groups funded and supported include al-Qaeda (the mujahideen of the Afghanistan conflict in the 1980s, Jamaat al-Nusra in Syria (which has funneled arms and money to ISIS) and various other groups. And the US has supplied large amounts of military aid to the Saudi regime, which has been passed, in turn, to various Wahhabist militants. More information can be found here: http://www.globalresearch.ca/us-sponsored-islamic-fundamentalism-the-roots-of-the-us-wahhabi-alliance/5303558 (note the misidentification of Wahhabism as "Sunni fundamentalism" - a result of the massive misunderstanding promoted by US media).

I did realize that you'd stated you were in an interracial relationship, but didn't respond to that. I'd mentioned in my last post that I was a ginger, so that should should disclose my ethnicity as regards the boxes Americans check off. In another recent post, I mentioned that I was part of gen x, so that discloses my age. What I disagreed with was your contention that tribalism and wealth accumulation/preservation ere effective survival responses to decline and collapse. They will indeed occur, but I see them as measures of population reduction, not preservation. Your post reminded me of posts on here by a guy named juhana, an Eastern European working class guy intent on preserving the national ethnicities of Europe. JMG and others discussed how dark ages reliably shred ethnicities and identities, coupled with lots of immigration, but he was undeterred. I was making the same point regarding North American ethnic identities post decline/ dark age. Once the structure supporting those boxes we check off goes away, in due time, so will those ways of identifying ourselves. If identities based on nation states in Europe don't stand a chance against the coming dark ages, I don't see how current racial/ethnic categories do, either. I certainly don't think it will happen overnight either. In due time, as JMG has said, we will all be impoverished compared to now, so a severe reduction of inequality is in order, and over time, it will be a downward compression, not upward. The basis of our wealth is our petroleum based empire, which is faltering.<br>As a member of a group that makes up only a small fraction of the population, I'm under no illusion that the well being of society depends on how well they regard queer people.

If I have misunderstood I am happy to be corrected. <br><br>Stacey<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c2377329200172981417 title="comment permalink">6/28/14, 6:09 PM</a><br><br>

The degree to which 'specific attributes' are 'not harmful' depends very much on the environment the individual finds itself in. And what so many people seem to forget is that the environment changes. Sometimes, selection pressures are rather low, especially in fat and happy times (in human terms, think the last 100 years of petro-prosperity). Sometimes, things get really, really tough. <br><br>And at those times, traits that might have been 'not harmful' or indeed even 'useful' in the previous scenario, no longer are, and in fact might be quite harmful. All of this is complicated/modulated/inflected by the fact that humans live in a cultural environment as well as a physical environment. Sometimes a species can afford to experiment and support all kinds of diversity - other times, not. <br><br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c694292226244984562 title="comment permalink">6/28/14, 7:23 PM</a><br><br>

The move from saying no to this social order toward saying no to all social ordering. Perhaps this makes people more receptive to being followers, and explains how such wild weird characters can receive many followers. What isn't noticed isn't guarded. “<br><br>I think there are a number of false dichotomies there.<br><br>Let start with government. Now, and in all of recorded history, the vast majority of governments are just a group of guys (and sometimes the odd woman) running protection rackets. In its most basic form, the government is the elite. Failing that, such governments rules in the interests of the elite and them alone. All parasites eventually figure out that its best not to kill the host. Indeed a healthy host is as healthy parasite. It also helps if the host thinks it need the parasite or that the host does something for the parasite in exchange; this is where all the lies start. The best way to give this impression is to in fact give something hence noblesse oblige. Its still a lie as the transaction is always balanced in favour of those in power. That is the point of having power. It is important when discussing power, elites, and government to never lose sight of this essential nature of the relationship.<br><br>Is there anything to imitate there? No; and there never was unless you are a psychopath. Does such thinking lead to barbarism (I assume you use this term in a pejorative sense)? No. But seeing things as they are can lead to not allowing yourself to be used by others. There is not social program being advocated here, just a basic understanding of the dynamic of power, government, and elites. <br><br>Can government be more than just a protection racket? Yes, if the host uncompromisingly insists on distributive justice. The idea has its root in the eastern Mediterranean where a group of Judean hillbillies got fed up with being constantly overrun by the empire du jour. The original image of “God the Father” was that of the head of the household ensuring everyone had what they needed and no one was being greedy. A ruler was expected to do the same. The idea every really caught on but it never really died either. This was the original concept of the Kingdom (meaning rule) of Heaven (meaning God the Father).<br><br>Does civilization = bad? There is some basic physics at play here such that civilization (living in cities) has consequences … and they aren't good for the environment. All living things, and collection of living things, take energy and negative entropy for their environment and pass out that energy with higher entropy. The more the energy flow, the more the entropy expelled. Its just the way things are. <br><br>Will this insight tend to make people give up on civilization altogether and lead to barbarism? No; because civilization is already barbaric. Its just the violence is hidden from you because it is exported from your society (i.e. the entropy is exported). By its nature, industrial civilization is extremely barbaric (in the sense of violent): it threatens all communities of life on earth including itself. Industrial civilization is but one of many experiments in organizing human life. They are many ways to achieve social order that do not involve exploiting that community or other communities of living things. There are plenty of examples over the millennia of actual human communities living in far less destructive ways. All these had a social order. Not living in cities does not equate to the absence of social order.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c5064170878378165243 title="comment permalink">6/28/14, 9:15 PM</a><br><br>

Okay, I can better calibrate my responses in light of that information.<br><br>First, I think we might be speaking in terms of very different time periods. I’m speaking of the immediate issue of those who are alive now making it through this beginning phase of the Long Descent. Some of what you’re saying seems to speak to a time frame that’s much further out in the future.<br><br>I believe that what you've described is an idealized and inaccurate view of what currently exists in Latin American cultures; as well as what’s likely to emerge in the future. Latin America’s racial dividing lines are only <i>different in style</i> than what exists in North America. Not substantive differences. For the past approximately 5 centuries (from the beginning of the Spanish conquest), Latin American countries have been what <a href=http://americasquarterly.org/the-effects-of-skin-color-in-the-americas rel=nofollow>one Latin American anthropologist</a> called “pigmentocracies”—where the social hierarchies are color-based.<br><br>The Latin American pattern is essentially the same pattern as in the U.S. The people who have been for roughly the past 500 years at the top are mostly the ones who appear to have the most European ancestry. The people who have been for roughly the past 500 years at the bottom of these societies tend to be the darkest ones (those who appear to have the most Indian and/or African ancestry).<br> <br>The only difference is that, for the most part (except in Old New Orleans) American culture has never before entertained the idea of having an in-between mixed “buffer group” classification.<br> <br>As far as that mixed “buffer group” in Latin America, <a href=http://www.academia.edu/236555/Does_Whitening_Happen rel=nofollow>one researcher</a> has questioned whether or not the notion of a so-called “mulatto escape hatch,” or social and cultural “whitening” (her terminology, not mine) even exists or works for Peruvians who have some African ancestry.<br><br>I suspect this same entrenched pattern in Latin American societies is invisible to more than a few White Americans because they’re at the top of both sets of hierarchies. They don’t perceive it because they don’t have to—they’re not at the yucky end of the hierarchy.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c3758632638139086388 title="comment permalink">6/28/14, 11:12 PM</a><br><br>

The basic pattern of <i>Whites On Top &amp; The Darkest Ones (Blacks in the U.S. context) At The Bottom</i> isn’t changing.<br><br>What’s changing is that more people (for examples, Latinos, Middle Easterners, and the offspring of Asian women’s marriages with White men) <i>are being allowed into the “White” category</i>.<br><br>In the U.S. context, the only ones who are locked out of <i>Becoming White</i> are African-American Blacks who are visibly Black. [The biracial children of African-American Blacks can become more or less White if they appear White, like Cash Warren (Jessica Alba’s husband). An interesting thing I’ve noted in recent years is the divide between those half-Black biracials who can pass for White and those who can’t because they look visibly Black.]<br><br>For the reasons I’ve mentioned, even with the increases in immigration and intermarriage the same basic pattern of <i>Whites On Top &amp; The Darkest Ones (Blacks in the U.S. context) At The Bottom</i> can keep chugging along for an additional 500 years. If all this was going to disappear simply as a result of intermarriage, then Latin America wouldn’t still have the same entrenched color hierarchy in place after 500 years of mixed-race baby-making.<br><br>You mentioned JMG's discussions about pursuing poverty as an adaptive strategy, and ways to live well poor.<br><br>Ah, okay, I think I see where our miscommunication began. There’s an underlying, universal point to my earlier comments that might’ve gotten lost in the discussion of particular details about the African-American collective. I should’ve made the connection in my earlier comments. I didn’t. I’ll try to remedy that here.<br><br>The <i>Too Long, Don’t Have Time to Read</i> universal point to my earlier comments: <b>People who don’t understand reciprocity—and refuse to practice reciprocity—won’t survive the Long Descent.</b><br><br>The Archdruid has been talking about the narratives that societies and individuals tell themselves to make sense of their world. Some narratives are adaptive. Some narratives are not. I responded to a comment that, to my ears, had the underlying narrative of <i>“Those mean Black people were angry with my father because he got with a White girl.”</i> In most situations that I know of, that’s a dishonest narrative. Leaving aside whatever happened with Nathaniel’s father, it’s not that “mean Black people were angry for no good reason when an African-American man ‘gets with’ White women.” <br><br><b>Typically when other African-Americans are angry about those scenarios, they’re angry because of a lack of reciprocity.</b> They’re angry because the individual in question took resources from the community (especially the church ladies), gave those resources to an outsider who did nothing to create those resources, and refused to give anything back to the community. Usually with the justification of, <i>”Well, I’m an individual; I don’t believe in group or collective stuff.”</i> Yet, they weren’t functioning as individuals when they took that collective money and/or other collective support.<br> <br>It’s be similar to how one might feel if somebody accepted a donation that one’s grandmother and other elderly relatives organized and spent it on a gambling and coke binge. And then when questioned about it said, <i>”I’m an individual and I’m doing my own thing.”</i> That’s perfectly fine. Such persons should do their own thing with their own <i>individual</i> resources. And stop taking from the community “pot” when they know darn well the purpose of the community pot is to lift up the collective community. The flip side of this is that the church ladies need to screen people before they give them that type of fervent support; and stop engaging in that wholesale blind giving.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c2318362660254288014 title="comment permalink">6/28/14, 11:29 PM</a><br><br>

One person can’t supply all their needs for themselves. One has to be able to cooperate with other people. A mutually supportive network only functions when the members practice reciprocity.<br> <br>I recall reading accounts (at least one of them I think was on this blog) of various green planned communities that imploded in large part due to more than a few of the members’ refusal to practice reciprocity. In particular, I vaguely recall reading a comment about a communal fruit tree in such a community. The tree was picked bare overnight. When morning came, nobody knew what had happened (except whichever members had snatched all the fruit for themselves under the cover of darkness).<br><br>As others have noted, the future is now in certain segments of the U.S. population. The current violent implosion of the African-American collective is a good example of what happens to people who won’t cooperate with each other, and refuse to practice reciprocity. For those who pay attention and understand what they’re seeing, the disastrous goings-on in the modern-day African-American collective are a handbook of worst practices and how NOT to survive the Long Descent.<br><br>I had neglected to make this clear earlier. Apologies.<br><br>You said, <i>” Your post reminded me of posts on here by a guy named juhana, an Eastern European working class guy intent on preserving the national ethnicities of Europe. JMG and others discussed how dark ages reliably shred ethnicities and identities, coupled with lots of immigration, but he was undeterred.”</i><br><br>Lord have mercy, I’m being compared to Juhana! {catching the vapors and clutching my pearls---LOL!}<br> <br>I find his views repellent. Nevertheless, when he says something that might be useful to know regarding the Long Descent, I pay attention. I’ve been reading a fascinating biography of an individual that, if I remember correctly, Juhana mentioned: a Balkan war criminal nicknamed Arkan who organized Serbian soccer hooligans into a death squad/militia. And, if I remember correctly, he was the commenter who mentioned a similar mobilization of Ukrainian soccer clubs in the current crisis in Ukraine. I’ve been pondering what groups might be a U.S. equivalent of this in the future. I don’t know.

As for Occupy, well, let's just say I wasn't as impressed as you apparently were. <br><br>Cherokee, I don't think they have a clue. That's why they're going to end up dangling from lampposts. <br><br>Agent, nah, you're missing the point. Mimesis doesn't equate to warm fuzzy feelings for the people who happen to occupy the positions of power. Ask people to daydream out loud about what it would be like to be a big success, and far more often than not you'll get a simplified media caricature of the way the rich and famous live in America today. That's mimesis -- the colonization of the imagination by images projected by the current elite. <br><br>When you talk about how people in the Roman world, say, must have seen the Roman Empire as transparently evil, you're projecting your own state of mind concerning governments onto the rest of humanity and the rest of time. Your attitude is a classic example of what follows the collapse of a particular pattern of mimesis; where your grandparents or great-grandparents probably thought that, despite its problems and the idiots running it, the government under which they lived was a good thing, you've embraced a narrative that says all government everywhere is utterly evil, and that everyone's always seen it that way. That blinds you to the change in attitudes that this week's post was trying to discuss. <br><br>Shane, of course they want to get the internet to Cuba. How else are they going to sell the Cubans a bunch of consumer crap they don't need? NPR is Fox News through a mirror, you know...<br><br>Sam CC, exactly. These days, if you look up the word "decadence" in the dictionary, the United States is exhibit A.<br><br>DeAnander, that's fascinating. Expect much more along these same lines as we proceed. <br><br>Khadija, the fit of the vapors was classic! Thank you. ;-) I'll be discussing in future posts the way that ethnic distinctions tend to get shredded and remade during dark ages and their aftermath; the short form is that the Latin American experience (or, for that matter, the North American one) of enduring ethnic divides is very common in most historical situations, but not in dark ages. When everything else goes into the blender, color lines rarely survive long! But we'll get to that in due time. <br><br>Cherokee, what you've described is exactly what Toynbee was talking about -- a creative elite capable of inspiring mimesis loses that gift and becomes a dominant elite which is only able to demand obedience, for a while. Then that goes away, and it's lamppost time.

Those are already beginning to take shape, but it's not happening online!<br><br>Irrational, it fascinates me to see how easily people forget that there were media before the electronic age. Renaissance despots had spin doctors who made sure that the portrayal of the monarch in woodblock-printed broadsheets, popular songs, and the other mass media of the time supported the despot's agenda. How much direct contact, for example, do you think the average Englishman or woman of 1580 had with Queen Elizabeth? She was as much a manufactured media figure as any of her equivalents today; it's just that the media were different. <br><br>Shane, of course the Russians are stepping in -- as usual, Putin is three steps ahead of the amateur in the White House, finding a way to exert Russian power abroad in a context where the US is hardly in a position to object!

I read it at the time, but it had slipped my mind. <br><br>I’ve only read the one of his books, so I can’t comment on his position in any of the others. The one I have, though - <i><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Coming-Anarchy-Shattering-Dreams-Post/dp/037570759X/ rel=nofollow>The Coming Anarchy</a></i> - is composed of the eponymous essay plus a number of others. One very specifically predicts the descent of the US into oligarchic rule - which was recently confirmed by Princeton research, and got a lot of coverage, including the comments here. Another warns of the dangers of having the country led by politicians and advisers who’ve never done anything in real life and are increasingly drawn from academic specialists. Based on these essays, I’d hesitate before saying that he believes/believed that the US, and the West generally, is immune to collapse…<br><br>As for the neo-Cossack revival, there was a flurry of academic papers about it in the 1990s, which are available if you have access to JSTOR. It all went quiet after that, but the book you should try to get through your library is Laura Olsen’s <i><a href=http://www.amazon.com/Performing-Russia-Identity-Routledge-European/dp/041540617X/ rel=nofollow>Performing Russia: Folk Revival and Russian Identity</a></i>, which has a couple of good chapters on the subject. For people who aren’t familiar with who the Cossacks are, and where they’re coming from, I’ve written a short backgrounder on another blog of mine. It needs to be updated, since I’ve learned a lot more since I wrote it, but as an introduction to the Cossacks (and why they attacked Pussy Riot in Sochi) it may be helpful. <i><a href=http://www.singdancefight.com/2014/05/19/who-are-the-cossacks/ rel=nofollow>Who are the Cossacks?</a></i> (It's broken up into several pages - the links are at the bottom of each page, but Wordpress's formatting doesn't make it obvious). There are other entries about the contemporary Cossacks on the same blog.<br><br>Frankly, I think there’s a lot to be learned from them by anyone preparing for the Long Descent. Dmitry Orlov’s latest book gives one view of this (I haven’t read it, but I’m going by what he’s posted on his blog), but the neo-Cossacks give a counter-example, I think.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c5693320729289979654 title="comment permalink">6/29/14, 10:43 AM</a><br><br>

As I see it, big trade triangle of Europe, Africa and Middle East is unraveling very fast now. As there is no material wealth to spread to masses, old feuds are surfacing fast. Even faster than I thought possible, and I have been labelled as pessimist from early on among my peers. <br><br>Interesting thing is that fracture lines are running in all cases I am aware of along ethnic and religious lines, not along any left-right or any other political axis. <br><br>In Africa, states has been erased in all but name and different tribal militias rule inland with mineral company enablers. Hutu FDLR, Tutsi M23 (they are EFFICIENT, like Germans of the Second Reich down there), genocidaires of ultra-balkanized chaos of Nigeria, where Hausa/Igbo/Yoruba nightmare has seen new lows as religion is married with ethnic hatreds. You have never witnessed truly deep racist hatred if you have not seen how African tribes from different ecological areas hate each other. Whole Sahel area is one big war theatre now, where Muslim pastoralists from semi-arid plains fight bitter ethnic cleansing war against animist/Christian agriculturalists about 10 degrees north of equator. It goes all through that continent, from coast to coast. It's amazing that people in Europe are not aware of it. Just amazing. It's so huge vortex of violence and chaos now that you should not miss it, even if never working in the area.<br><br>Then there is old Sunni/Shiite division running through Middle East. Have you ever noticed how minority sects are almost always ethnic minorities also? It's identity game with Kalashnikov and RPG-7. All recent victories have been gained among one's own tribal contignent. Sunni triangle is now ruled by Sunnis, and Shiite areas by Shi'ites. Now main story seems seems to be Ishmaelite tribes against Alawites and Indo-Aryans of that land of Aryans, Iran. And against Kurds, who are traditional Sunnis. Personally I think that there is a lot of Arab national chauvinism involved. When borders are eventually redrawn with blood along tribal lines, then it's time for clan leaders to fight among themselves. Good luck for Western liberal goody-two-shoes when trying to fit that mess and following mass migration into progressive/liberal world view of that cultural black hole formerly known as Western Europe. <br><br>And then there are Slavic nations. No mass migration is going to take them down, they will fight for their survival. Force is strong in them. In the East Slavia (that's what Yuogoslavia means) different religious ethnic enclaves made little rehersal for what's coming among those tribes. Now Unitarian West Ukrainians are fighting against heirs of Constantinople, and in the Great Plains Cossack Old School Orthodoxy really is Old School. Caesaropapism as form of government is going to experience rebirth there some time soon, I believe. <br><br>Anarchy is indeed coming, but also to places Kaplan thought safe areas. Apart that one mistake, he truly has some prophetic blood running through those veins. <br><br>And then there is football, everywhere, and local grassroots identities build around it. I have nagging feeling that these unpolitical, working class identities are undervalued card in the table. They have erupted into paramilitary scene constantly after 90's Balkan Wars, and now it's happening again in Turkey and East Europe. <br><br>But as world of football identities is totally alien for those in high intellectual society, and these things have not yet happened in any Western nation, it has been overlooked time after time. These people live in same hoods, and KNOW each other by name, from childhood on. They are no fictional tribes indeed.<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdj7jBT9tu0<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c466200644186555256 title="comment permalink">6/29/14, 3:08 PM</a><br><br>

The one is rather useless and the other is of great value. I've been organic gardening for about 7 years, for about 4 of those have been after becoming obsessed with Mollison's tome PERMACULTURE: A DESIGNER'S Manual. I've had somewhat of an involved relationship with Permaculture, let me elaborate a bit:<br><br>Permaculture didn't teach me how to make compost, start seeds to transplant, make raised beds or even do companion planting. While reading Mollison gave me a much greater appreciation for trellises and I've employed swales to good effect once, the primary sense I got from reading PERMACULTURE: A DESIGNER'S MANUAL was one of religious awe. I'm not sure quite how he did it, but Mollison managed to fill me with zeal for his method.<br><br>Eventually the zeal wore-off and skepticism took its place.

I think it falls under the greater umbrella of" community" that no one understands now. There is a definite lack of reciprocity today."</i><br><br>Agreed. A LOT of modern Americans have lost the social and emotional skills required for reciprocity. I expect that deficit will cause a lot of unnecessary hardship and suffering for these individuals as the Long Descent continues.<br><br>I think it's more than a little bit generational: Many of the people in my age group have done a poor job of raising their now-young-adult children. Folks' young adult children have good formal educations. The lucky ones have good, yuppie jobs. But too many people in my generation failed to transmit the values that my parents and grandparents referred to as <i>"home training."</i> <br><br>A couple of examples that I see with increasing frequency.<br><br><b>(1) The near-refusal to engage in in-person conversations with business associates and other non-intimates unless it's absolutely required.</b> This is currently creating problems for one of my friends and her husband who live in a condo. Their neighbors in the rest of the building refuse to hold in-person condo association meetings. Instead, these nuts try to do everything by email. Even though doing things that way doesn't work very well. Even though an in-person meeting would be very efficient in clearing up the many ambiguities and misunderstandings that happen during email-only conversations. Many of these people also have the pattern of hurrying into their units to avoid saying <i>"Good morning"</i> or other basic greetings to neighbors. It's all very peculiar.<br><br><b>(2) People who are new to a setting (new person at a job, new person in the neighborhood, new person who moves into a building, etc.) who NEVER bother to introduce themselves to the other people who are already there.</b> Friends and I have been noticing a drastic uptick in this behavior with each year that passes. <br><br>In a job setting, often a coworker (at least those who were raised with home training---smile) will take it upon themselves to introduce the new person around. But they don't always catch up with everybody at a worksite to make that introduction. So, it would behoove the new person to introduce themselves when they run across somebody at work they weren't already introduced to. But increasing numbers of folks aren't doing that. Even though, on a practical level, the new person is much more likely to need something (help, an answer to a question, etc.) from the established coworkers long before the established coworkers will need anything from the new person. <br><br>It's all strange and off-putting behavior to a lot of people. Basic, old-fashioned manners makes it so much easier to approach somebody if you happen to need something from them later on down the road. Unfortunately, as the collapse continues, many people will learn this lesson the hard way. {smh at it all}<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c3504486045078235524 title="comment permalink">6/29/14, 6:31 PM</a><br><br>

I've suggested that what's more fundamental is getting one's share of the loot. <br><br>You have written: “When you talk about how people in the Roman world, say, must have seen the Roman Empire as transparently evil, you're projecting your own state of mind concerning governments onto the rest of humanity and the rest of time.” Not so. Many people of the time regarded the Roman Empire as rotten to the core and evil beyond words. In my case, I came to that conclusion through them and what they wrote about their society. The fact that Rome was transparently evil to a great many people of the time is demonstrated in part by the appeal of Christianity. At issue were two conflicting sets of values. One glorified exploitation and conquest; the other glorified what would be called now “social justice”. You referred to this appeal in your essay. Though the book of Revelations was a late addition to the Christian canon, its inclusion destroys any doubt one might have about the Christian (at the time) take on Rome and its empire. Recall the names given to these in that book: the Dragon, the Beast, the Whore etc.. Still, I'm not certain the lack of by-in by these Christians or many others of all classes had much to do with the fall of Rome though. Certainly not everyone thought Rome was a bad thing. I indicated that there is historic evidence to suggest that some were genuinely grateful to be conquered.<br><br>I like your second definition of mimesis better: “the colonization of the imagination by images projected by the current elite.” This sounds a bit like my reference to Imperial Roman Theology if the images projected are in fact those that embody the value system of the elite. If so, we are simply using different words for much the same thing; or perhaps looking at the same phenomena from different perspectives. If that is true, then I haven't so much missed the point as got there on my own and came to a different conclusion.<br><br>In your essay you wrote “Civilizations fail, in turn, because their political classes lose the ability to inspire mimesis.” Not so. Ruthless oppression is always an option and historically has often been very effective. How many peasant revolts were effectively put down during Roman times and since? <br><br>You wrote: “Your attitude is a classic example of what follows the collapse of a particular pattern of mimesis; where your grandparents or great-grandparents probably thought that, despite its problems and the idiots running it, the government under which they lived was a good thing, ...” No. My attitude is the historic norm. Peasants have always known that they were being ripped off and who was doing it. Being systemically looted by the upper class is what it means to be a peasant by definition. As for my grandparents, they were both members of the International Workers of the World. Sorry, they were hard core commies and had no sympathy for the governments of their day. Its in my blood. In modern times the sort of naivety you describe largely died in the First World War. People no longer sing as they go off to war to support empire. <br><br>You wrote: “... That blinds you to the change in attitudes that this week's post was trying to discuss”. No, I see the change in attitude, but I submit it is not due to disenchantment with the elite so much as disenchantment with the dream of getting crumbs from their tables. What is happening now is not so much a loss of faith in the elite as loss of faith in getting a share of the loot. No more loot, and especially no more food, then the society has got big problems. On that I'm sure we can both agree.<br><br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c2665299297629612464 title="comment permalink">6/29/14, 9:09 PM</a><br><br>

Yes, this is very much true! A real tribe is a collection of people who would be litterally willing to DIE for each other. This kind of goes back to the ethnicity conversation from earlier. Some of the tribes that may form over The Long Descent will indeed be primarily the same ethnicities. But this is not what will make them a tribe. Especially after the means of collective identity with people of the same ethnicity from an area on the other side of the continent is lost. <br><br>It will be the familial and personal ties that have grown over time and constant interaction with eachother. To the point that they may begin referring to themselves as a "People". Completely different from the "People" who live on the other side of the river, despite the fact that they share the same, former, ethnic identity. In the case of more ethnically mixed communities they will probably still regard themselves as the same "People" despite the fact that there members don't look alike. That doesn't mean that collective identy wont be important, nor that they wont be mistrusting or even hostile, to outsiders. Just that this will be based on the new ethnic identifiers rather than the old ones. <br><br>You could also apply this to national idententity and other groupings as well. In the example of the United States people already regard themselves as being different Americans from 'those' Americans of a totally diffent region or city, even within states. Its not too far a leap to assume that the geopolitical sphere of North America could look very diffent in a few hundred years.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c4899624305696343823 title="comment permalink">6/29/14, 11:23 PM</a><br><br>

That is part of American hypocrisy and general negativity towards Whites expressing their identity I have never understood. Why are Whites so special among races for your country that they cannot express same tribal feelings that all others do..? It would be fascinating to get explanation for that. <br><br>I just cannot understand these American sensibilities. And just to remind you: I have worked around continents, and I am labelled as MODERATE person among my own. I find myself often in situation trying to influx some open-mindness into my own peers... That fact just shows how far apart our worlds truly are. Even my moderate and non-violent opinions insult your orthodox Western liberal views. Amazing. You should meet some guys from my original hood. See how you would fit in with them. I think my company would be very pleasant and smoothing experience for you then, as warm breeze of reason among unemployment, hard manual labor, petty criminality and football madness...<br><br>@JMG: Yep, football ultras (aka hooligans) were involved heavily at those Turkish riots and unrest. This is happening more or less everywhere outside good ol' NATO bloc, and partly inside it in the Southern NATO countries. These identity groups are slowly becoming political force to be reckoned... Maybe there is also some modern-day Belisarius waiting to be unleashed upon them, as in Constantinople :). <br><br>As job opportunities have become scarce and people are more and more restricted to their original neighborhoods, with no hope for outward or upward mobility, these local identities are on the rise. Their level of alienation from existing political machinery of EU is amazing. Only acceptable political parties ever mentioned among night outs are either those labelled far-right or far-left by media, though scale is tilted into the far-right side. For example, in Hungary some football ultras are practically enforcers of Jobbik. Not to say that political conversation plays a big role, never :).<br><br>Also the amount of insulation from mainstream media and politics these identity groups have gained is astonishing, they have this parallel network of information distribution at place. Scene was not this politicized just ten years ago, things have been evolving fast.<br><br>And I was just telling what I have heard and seen, not my political daydreams. It seems that disclaimer should be raised for those fancy readers who have right opinions, opposed to my wrong opinions... Whatever they might be. I know only that my opinions are confused and uncertain, but always pragmatic. Enough food, rest and good workouts are central for those opinions :). Apparently some American readers of this blog know better what I am than I do myself. I seem to offend them by living in wrong reality, where people say and do wrong things that do not fit sensibilities that Baby Boomer generation in the Western heartlands brought to mainstream. I beg you pardon for that. Maybe I can start to live in right reality after some re-education or something. As I have said before, my deepest feeling towards this magnificent structure of post-World War Western industrial society is deep dissapointment and disillusionment, not anger. For anger you have to go for other persons, but they do not write into blogs like this. Why I would otherwise waste my time reading and writing here, as there are plenty of other venues where there is no risk of being misunderstood?

Its Greek is the fluent, yet broken Greek of someone whose first language was a Semitic one. (Think of the broken, yet fluent English spoken in many large cities like New York by immigrants whose first language was not English.) Because of this linguistic fact, Revelation cannot have been written by any of the other men named "John," authors of the canonical gospel and three epistles. Indeed, if there is any book in the NT written by one of the Twelve, it is Revelation. <br><br>Margaret Barker, a very perceptive scholar, has powerfully argued that Revelation was written to oppose the person and works of the apostle Paul, who is characterized in it as "Balaam." One of the major bones of contention between this John and Paul was precisely the proper attitude toward Rome and its empire -- which amply accounts for the late acceptance of that book in Western Christendom. <br><br>And this question of Rome and the World is one of the major "fault lines" that runs through the entire history of Early Christianity -- which never managed to be(come) a unified religion that held to a single orthodoxy. Even the books in the New Testament -- in any of its several current canons -- do not obviously share a single orthodoxy, despite theologians' best efforts to tease a single orthodox doctrine out of them.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c4522990331612063347 title="comment permalink">6/30/14, 6:03 AM</a><br><br>

Shock-media is a universal. So is hedonistic indulgence in whatever forbidden earthly pleasures are in vogue in that particular decade. Ditto for glorification of the outlaw. "Slumming" by the children of the comfortable in whatever the current alternative is? Sure thing. Todays WWOOFers were yesterday's beatniks, sleeping from sofa to sofa.

When sperm meets egg, these pairs swap in about 30-odd places; some pairs don’t swap at all, some of the longer ones might swap in as many as three places. The actual locations are sort of random.<br><br>To put a number on it, and this number will be wildly wrong in real cases, a typical block that gets swapped might have 500 protein-coding genes and 150 non-protein-coding genes. If one of these genes happens to have a large positive selection value, it can drag a lot of genes that are neutral or mildly negative along with it.<br><br>These blocks, which sort of resemble islands, can persist for a long time. The way those islands are distributed, and their relative sizes as the edges get nibbled off, is one of the two major “molecular clocks.” It’s why geneticists can say, with reasonable assurance, that adult lactose tolerance in Europeans arose once between 7 and 9 thousand years ago. They’re looking at an island that contains multiple genes.<br><br>The conclusion is that a lot of rather obvious characteristics, like the gene variants that give red hair and hyper-sensitivity to ultra-violet, have no positive value. They’re hitchhikers with something else that does have positive selective value.<br><br>This feeds into something that JMG has pointed out recently: publicizing a watered-down version of something can lead to radically wrong conclusions, massive confusion and a loss of faith in the original, and much more accurate, version.<br><br>@Chris<br><br>Please don’t apologize for using a conjunction at the start of a sentence. That proscription is a “zombie rule.” That is, it ought to be dead and buried at the crossroads with a stake through its heart, but it’s still shambling about eating people’s brains and making them stupid about real English grammar.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c3415590968058308498 title="comment permalink">6/30/14, 11:01 AM</a><br><br>

Thank you. <br><br>I'm more aware of the Peter versus Paul issue (Do Christians need to be Jews?) than the John versus Paul issue. Both raise the issue of which Paul one is talking about. The writing ascribed to him fall into three groups: 1) those most scholars agree he wrote, 2) those where there is no firm scholarly consensus about whether he wrote them or not, and 3) those most scholars agree he did not write. If we restrict ourselves to the first group of writing, we see a very radical message against Rome. There seems to be a progression towards greater accommodation as we move through group 2 to group 3. Group 3 writing represents a view of almost complete assimilation to the dominate world view of the time (and now). This progression suggests a deliberate dumbing down of the message. <br><br>If we assume Jesus was killed for publicly criticizing the legitimacy of Roman rule and Jewish upper class collaboration (the Temple incident) and we accept only group 1 writing as Paul's, we see a very clear stance against Rome in very early Christianity. I rely on John Dominic Crossan for the preceding points. Christianity paid a very dear price to become a mainstream religion. The fault lines you mention are certainly still with us today.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c3291730301031083465 title="comment permalink">6/30/14, 12:18 PM</a><br><br>

To the point that they may begin referring to themselves as a "People"."<br><br>The place you really see this happening is in the inner city gangs right now. I grew up around a lot of the gang community because my mother was a bilingual educator in Dallas, TX, and she was struck by how close-knit or familial the gangs were, providing the services that the government programs couldn't, or wouldn't to the families living in their territory. They even identify their alliances by names like "The People" or "The Folk" and use elaborate, rich symbolism and ritual to identify themselves and set themselves apart from outsiders and rivals. It's a violent, short, brutal life, but for those born to it, it's what there is. And these gangs and the alliances that hold them together very often cross and blur ethnic boundaries and become their own thing.<br><br>Earlier in another comment I also linked to an essay about street families on the Northwest Coast who have banded together and formed into their own tightly knit groups tossed together by situation and common experience and clinging to identities drawn from bits of media entertainment and pop spirituality adapted to fit life on the streets, sometimes even forming religious belief systems every bit as elaborate as the Miami children described in the article.<br><br>So even here in the US tribal identities are forming and making an existence completely outside of the world we see on the surface. Getting a taste of the sorts of visions of the world, tribal identities, and lifestyles that will be in the bidding for banner bearers of the next cycle of civilization takes no more than volunteering at a homeless shelter or prison and just listening to the conversations you overhear.

I may read this wrong but to me that sounds a little like "it will cease to exist for all intents and purposes" when that happens. <br>My impression is actually that much of the Europe participating in making the new narratives is actually fairly islamic already (just look in a urban elementary school class). But there are very different flavors (not only the "official ones") to islam, which matter a lot I think. I am not sure on what point islam as a religion can or will make compromises but if I see pork-free, no alcohol, praying muslims living (happily) with promiscuous lesbian atheists in a community of choice there seems to be some wiggle room at the personal level at least (currently). <br>In a similar way the christianization of northern Europe may have been a strong foreign influence, but not the end of all things. There is friction and rebranding here and there of course but I am not sure all of it had its actual cause in religion. What are your takes on this? What bits of Islam do you think would be non-negotiable and what could have some stretch, especially after historical precedent?<br><br>Another question I have is:<br>If the narratives generally come from the urban areas - but the Urban areas gradually die out. What would be the likely consequence with regard to the surviving narratives? Wouldn't they have to make sense in a rural area as well?<br><br>I sometimes wonder, if many (the majority of?) people would start to see general predicaments, which form the basis of the discussions here. When would we know? <br>As I have become much more acutely sensitive to many of the issues - I see lot's of action on these front I don't remember seeing before. Now I wonder is it me that changed or is something happening. Today I had another discussion with someone heavily invested relatively high up the tech food chain. It took a few sentences only and we had established much common ground with disagreements being mostly quantitative. In this context Emmanuel Todd cropped up (http://www.svabhinava.org/friends/JosephMartin/EmmanuelToddDigest-frame.php) who may also be of interest with regard to islam...<br><br>I wonder if we would write a list of 5, or 10, or 20 friends, then check who may be "peak aware", and who is doing what in that regard - what picture would we get?<br>Would there be a demographic / local slant? What is the critical number for new narratives to coexist with the old ones?

One of the points I remember being made is that when you look at the ordinary everyday common people's lives, you don't so much see the great archaeological ages. Iron-age Yorkshire looks pretty much like Roman-era Yorkshire, which is like Dark Age Yorkshire, which strongly resembles Medieval Yorkshire, which is not very different from Renaissance Yorkshire. Cornwall is different from Yorkshire, but likewise it remains more like itself that like anything else as the centuries and millennia pass. <br><br>So, do we just pay too much attention to the urban areas and their myths, perhaps because they tend to be the seats of literacy? If life doesn't change that much for rural peasants, and most of the time most of the people are rural peasants, are the occasional rises and falls of the city-states really the most important, central, defining part of the human experience? For a brief time in North America, at the height of the Maize culture and the city states like Cahokia, culture became urban, hierarchical, complex, structured. For thousands of years before then, it was decentralized. Then the city-states collapsed, and it decentralized again (just in time for the Europeans to arrive). Europe was decentralized, then the classical city-states arose for a few centuries, faded, popped up somewhere else, faded, etc. Then came our current era of fossil-fueled industrial centralization and urbanization... which will fade also.<br><br>So, do these brief interludes of transient centralization really matter as much as we like to think they do (seeing as how we are all currently living in one)? Or is the ancient pagan (small-p) sensibility what really defines the human experience... birth, plant, grow, eat, die, summer, winter, sunrise, sunset, repeat from before the beginning of time until after its end. <br><br>The human brain is the most complex structure in the universe. People like to say this. And it is the human brain that has made this judgement. Centralized urban civilization is the epitome of human existence. We know this because the people who live in centralized urban civilizations have taught us this.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c425840698377847501 title="comment permalink">6/30/14, 9:11 PM</a><br><br>

It's currently the second fastest growing religion behind Islam, and it re-interprets and re-invents traditional islamic teachings in much the same way Christianity did with Judaism and Buddhism did with Hinduism. I could especially see it starting to gain traction in the Islamic world if they manage to put together a significant empire in the twilight years of the industrial age and wind up losing it to the last waves of crisis. And the narrative is malleable enough to spread to a lot of cultures and build up its own distinct interpretations.<br><br>Regarding your other question: "If the narratives generally come from the urban areas - but the Urban areas gradually die out. What would be the likely consequence with regard to the surviving narratives? Wouldn't they have to make sense in a rural area as well?"<br><br>As a civilization settles comfortably into its old age, one of the things that pretty reliably happens is a mass relocation of the majority of the population from rural areas to urban centers. When the temples and social wellfare programs that allow the homeless to survive break down, and the supply lines and financial infrastructures that allow the middle and working classes to crunch numbers and do road construction in exchange for money to buy food at the markets all start to break down, people pour out of the cities in search of food, work, and a better life, carrying their stories with them and adapting them to their new homes. In our time, a lot of those seedbearers will likely be climate refugees so a good place to look for narratives would be in low lying coastal areas with a high poverty rate. Miami and New Orleans are both pretty good bets.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c100458685857061768 title="comment permalink">7/1/14, 7:09 AM</a><br><br>

I probably need to do a post talking about that one of these days. <br><br>Phil, if you've dodged the death cult so far, that's a good sign. <br><br>Cherokee, I tend to think it's not wealth as such, but the supremely toxic combination of wealth and irresponsibility. People who have never had to deal with the consequences of their actions in their everyday affairs -- and a huge amount of contemporary society these days is set up to keep the wealthy from ever having to deal with the consequences of their actions -- tend to lose track of the fact that, in reality, their actions have consequences...<br><br>Bill, the fact that today's kids get along with their parents strikes me as a huge shift, and possibly more important than most of the other transformations I've chronicled. Given that, the possibility of intergenerational transfer of knowledge outside the media -- which almost stopped happening in the US in the 20th century -- becomes a live option again, and that bids fair to have massive consequences. <br><br>Juhana, I recall someone else going on at great length about the importance of hate. It was most of a century ago, granted, in the pages of a book written in a German prison -- I'm sure you know the one I mean. May the gods help Europe if that sort of thinking is becoming standard again. <br><br>Bear, you may be right, and it may come to nothing -- but it was exactly this sort of thing that ended up putting Franklin Roosevelt into power and giving America the New Deal. We'll see. As for the possibility that the kids in Dade County are describing real phenomena, well, you know, that's an issue for <a href=http://galabes.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>my other blog</a>...<br><br>Pinku-Sensei, exactly. I've visited Detroit, and seen the American future there. The people who are having their water cut off are more early adopters -- how long, do you think, before most Americans have no running water or power? <br><br>LatheChuck, excellent! I had the great good fortune, a couple of years ago, to find an Olivetti Lettera in pristine condition in a junk shop for $50. Another communication technology I plan on relearning how to use, as soon as time permits!<br><br>Latefall, of course history will continue no matter who lives in the southern part of Europe; I don't recall suggesting anything else. As for the cities as seedbeds of new myths, it's during the several centuries between when they start to falter and when they actually perish that they serve that role. It's when the myths that sprout in the cities spread into the hinterlands, generally carried by refugees from the cities, that the new myths really take root.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c6389989762524936832 title="comment permalink">7/1/14, 11:36 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks for that - I'll see if I find some heads to bounce it off on. <br><br>re stories <br>@Varun <br>Hmmm... I'd have not thought of such a concrete list for the most part. I'll just try to shamelessly play the devil's advocate on it (even though from position of wealth and youthful enthusiasm I would be inclined to agree really).<br><br>1) Not sure how to roll that into a story nicely. "The emperors new clothes" possibly. But making an attractive plot out of the value of compromise is not easy I'd say<br>2) I'd say it may have to be about both, but the latter may indicate a more stable society.<br>3) Does require some authority of science (or leap of faith) I guess. Hygiene and work related health is actually where I'd start though. <br>4) or churches or skyscrapers? Also I can imagine physical artifacts as highly effective in propping up a narrative. It may not have to be the pyramids - but you can turn it around and say that it really shows commitment.<br>5) In as far as that saves on other more costly leisure activities I might be convinced - but I am not at all sure how much patience I'd have with non functioning addicts<br>6) If you have the time - here's a story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=vXr-2hwTk58#t=3452<br>7) Organization yes. Some complexity yes. Hierarchy? Maybe. This is what I'd want to make narrative address really. I'd like to see more of a "questioning authority approach". From my perspective that dovetails nicely with science as well. I am mulling about how to put self similarity and self organization into a story that makes as much sense when looking at an ant colony in a rural environment as when looking into a crumbling city. Stories about complexity and connectedness I could imagine very well.<br>8) Lastly I'd want to emphasize imagination as a very important part. It is what struck me about Bill Pulliams comment especially. What has changed mostly in these scenes was the way that they are perceived. You could say a story about telling stories would be important. I could imagine that this is difficult to do in a LESS world. Maybe table-top roleplaying games would be good for that. Or learning about the observable intricacies of ecological systems (which would then provide stimulation at the same time).<br><br><br>re end of cities<br>@ Eric S.<br>Hmm. The sea level thing may be a good place to start. That also makes me wonder more on what time frame they will go down. I guess it will depend on the causes.<br>Other causes I could imagine are: shortage of water/disease - that would probably be rather abrupt.<br>Too intermittent energy could be a reason that making "city products" gradually becomes nonviable and people leave.<br>In some areas maybe fires or sieges.<br>On the other hand I could also imagine cities that hold out for quite some time - say something in Norway close to hydropower. Some place where you'd think twice about leaving the city because the immediate environment seems significantly more unforgiving/uncomfortable.<br>If these cities really shape the narratives though I am not sure. My gut reaction is that they may be too exceptional for that. I do like the idea of their former citizens being blown over the countryside like dandelion seeds...<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c4278653222414303957 title="comment permalink">7/1/14, 3:06 PM</a><br><br>

During the hiatus, my introspections led me to believe that one reason I have trouble accepting supernatural dieties is because I was brought up in a society that prizes industrial story production. Throughout my youth, I have been sold, and even found some belief in, any number of pantheons with great powers and epic feats to their credit. Not to offend any Christians in the forum, but, for example... Jesus may have died for our sins, but Batman would have been resourceful enough to avoid being nailed to a cross in the first place. Jesus' oratory has been translated, probably multiple times, from an ancient dialect of Aramaic; so I'm going to struggle to find him to be as impressive as Captain Jean-luc Picard, especially if Jesus is coming through the medium of a relatively sedate suburbanite Protestant pastor. <br><br>The difference is that all these fictional heroes are contained safely within the printed page or the TV screen. There is no assertion that these stories are a higher form of truth than daily experience; in fact, just the opposite. There is also no direct, transcendental experience, only banal, passive consumption behavior. All this is something I probably would've taken much longer to realize without this blog being here. Still, I find myself wondering what strange permutations, if any, we might see once the first wave of comic-book superheroes fall out from under copyright protection. <br><br>I'd also like to note the longer perspective on history taken in this post. We are encouraged to accept an article from 1997 as "now," while myself and most of my contacts on social media are more likely to consider something from 1997 as a nostalgia trip. Interesting change of perspective, I'll keep trying to adopt it myself.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c3563273072334355010 title="comment permalink">7/1/14, 3:57 PM</a><br><br>

It is difficult to understand any culture that you have not spent an extensive amount of time living in. Americans mostly think of Europe as just a bunch of amusing and confusing little countries that have a tendency to start slaughtering each other for reasons that often make no sense to us. <br><br>But don't take it personally, most of us don't realize that Iraq and Iran are two different places. Heck, closer to home, most residents of the U.S. aren't even aware that Mexico has States, or whether Guatemala is in South America or Africa (yes, I know, it is not in either). <br><br>As for working-class Europeans rallying around their identities, I'm going to repeat my ongoing theme here -- what is new about this? I never got the sense that the EU was especially welcomed by the average European, in much the same way we had NAFTA forced upon us here. I was in Europe a couple of times in the early days of this millennium (for a total of about a month) when the EU was being forged, and I didn't sense a whole lot of love for it. So, if in rejecting the EU, Europeans are returning to smaller-scale definitions of identity, to me it just sounds like they are returning to the way Europeans have behaved since, oh, about 40,000 B.C. And of course other people all over the world are very much the same.<br><br>Here in the southern U.S. in the former confederacy, one of my professors in grad school had an interesting observation. When he first moved here from Michigan in 1960, he found that the one thing that united white southerners was bitterness about the Civil War (which had ended almost 100 years before). But over the intervening decades, he had seen this shift, so that the one thing that unites the region now is college football (American-style of course). And it may well be true that good-natured football rivalries diffuse a lot of the racial and regional tension that might otherwise cause a lot more trouble. One thing I find interesting about this is that in spite of the extreme passion for (American) football here, it very rarely crosses the line into the sort of "hooliganism" that happens around that other football in Europe. People don't actually get beaten up or killed for wearing the wrong team's colors here, just shouted at. And coworkers who have allegiances to different teams can still go out and have a beer together after work without getting in a fist fight. Sure I know there are counter examples, but they are quite rare. <br><br>Remember also that most of what we hear and see about Europe here comes through the corporate-controlled mass media. And they love the EU, since it makes them tons of money. So we are going to see a lot of stuff about wonderful European unity and harmony, happy amusing people with funny accents speaking silly languages, come here and spend lots of your money. Just stay in the places we tell you to go, and don't look too closely.<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c2661443099714900212 title="comment permalink">7/2/14, 7:02 AM</a><br><br>

Not when the ownership class has created a tier of wholly-owned-and-operated media whose primary purpose is to reinforce the notion that any restraint on the ownership class would constitute "class warfare" (one of many synonyms for "Communism" they use to stop thought), and another, wholly-owned-but-not-operated tier which nonetheless knows which side its bread is buttered on and won't say or do anything to upset the people with the butter knives.<br><br>@MawKernewek: "The Muslim groups with sizable populations in Europe come from diverse parts of the world with different languages and cultural backgrounds. [...] Muslim populations have not been exempt from the general trends of dropping fertility rates in recent decades around the world." Thanks. I've been wanting to make a counter-argument to the "Eurabia" fears that wrack so many of JMG's posters, but I didn't know enough about the facts on the ground to argue convincingly against them.<br><br>@Ian, that's a good point. Particularly about the power levels; I'm reminded of the moment in Joseph Torchia's <i>The Kryptonite Kid</i> when the main character is confused that the nuns at his school believe in a triune God nobody has ever seen, but not in one Superman that anyone can see on TV every afternoon.<br><br>"There is no assertion that these stories are a higher form of truth than daily experience; in fact, just the opposite. There is also no direct, transcendental experience, only banal, passive consumption behavior." I wouldn't be so sure. Grant Morrison and Alan Moore have both explored the mythic potential of metahumans; we don't need to wait for the characters to enter the public domain. (I'm not so sure the corporate owners will even let that happen, ever.)<br><br><a href=the-broken-thread-of-culture.html#c7790037947631489463 title="comment permalink">7/2/14, 11:26 AM</a><br><br>

I know that I have been kicking hornet's nest here many times, but these sensibilities of US just are really strange for me. I believe there are good and honest people in both sides of your "culture wars" and that both sides have good arguments why they believe what they believe, but these touchy areas just are too far from me... My genetic and linguistic ancestors have been living where I live from neolithic Stone Age onwards, so I see my country and it's nature as American Indians probably see your country... I have no issues of doubt about being proud of my ancestry, but it's no attack against anyone else thousands of miles away from me. Clearly things have some weightload of history in your culture that I do not carry, but I didn't mean to offend anyone. I just think it's just good thing that people are rallying around their communal identities. I come from a culture where individualism or "standing out" is not appreciated much, and staying in line with your peers is respected a lot. As I said, this is just a good thing for me. Like-minded community with strong points of emotional rallying points is community which can take a lot of punishment from bad government decisions and still stay afloat. But there is this vein of bitterness and agression which has been injected into the narrative not so long ago, and that worries me. It's not just Europeans, it's Middle Easterns and North Africans also. I am no scholaropf social relations, but I believe that bitter agression is response to chancing conditions caused by resource depletion and peak cheap oil. We don't live in market economy anymore, but in feudal one, and people are reacting strongly against shackles of this new serfdom. I am just worried things get out of hand, like they have done in the Iraq. The scent just is in the air, but I cannot really explain it. It was like this with these Kiev football fans also; I heard that they have been strongly politicized long before they entered world news as paramilitaries of the Right Sector. I know there are lot of underlying problems and anger of people is justified, but oh man... There are constructive ways of response and those that lead to slaughter house. I just don't believe anymore that later option can be avoided, but I cannot explain it with this difficult language of yours better than this. <br><br>There are lot of kids in my immediate environment, from my own family and from families of my friends and relatives. I don't want them to go war because some hotheads are making stupid moves and greedy nihilists are making power grabs in corridors of EU power structure... It worries me a lot. I live next to Russia and all other East European nations.

While again I'm not comfortable talkalking too much about myself I don't mind doing it on occassion if its a good conversation. Unfortunately those were turning into arguments, something I'd rather not deal with right now, and rather not be the cause of either.
