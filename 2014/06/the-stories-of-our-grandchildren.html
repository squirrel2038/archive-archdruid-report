<div class=MsoNormal>
Over the last six weeks, in what spare time I could find, I’ve glanced back over the last eight years of weekly <i>Archdruid Report</i> posts, trying to get some sense of where this blog has been and where it might head in the months and years to come. In language the Grateful Dead made famous—well, among those of us in a certain generation, at least—it‘s been a long strange trip, crossing terrain not often included in tours of the future of our faltering industrial civilization. </div>
<br>
<div class=MsoNormal>
</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Among those neglected landscapes of the mind, though, the territory that seems most crucial to me involves the role that stories play in shaping our ideas and expectations about the future, and thus our future itself. It’s a surprisingly difficult issue for many people these days to grapple with. Each time I raise it, I can count on hearing from readers who don’t get what I’m saying, usually because they’ve lost track of the distinction between whatever story they’ve gotten stuck in their minds and the far more diffuse and shapeless experiences that the story claims to explain. We tell ourselves stories to explain the world; that much is normal among human beings, and inevitable. The problem creeps in when we lose track of the difference between the narrative map and the experiential territory, and treat (for example) progress as a simple reality, rather than the complex and nuanced set of interpretations we lay over the facts of history to turn them into incidents in a familiar narrative. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
During the time just past, I’ve had several reminders of the power of stories to shape the world of human experience, and the way those stories can get out of step with the facts on the ground. I’d like to take a moment to talk about a couple of those just now. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The first reminder made quite a splash in the news media a couple of weeks ago, when the Energy Information Administraton (EIA)—the US bureaucracy that publishes statistics about American energy resources and production—was forced to admit in public that, well, actually, there was only about 4% as much economically extractable oil in the Monterey Shale in California as they’d claimed a few years earlier. Given that this same Monterey Shale was supposed to provide us with around two-thirds of the oil that was allegedly going to turn the United States into a major oil exporter again by 2020, this was not precisely a minor issue. How many other oil shale deposits are facing similar downgrades? That’s a good question, and one which the EIA seems noticeably unwilling to address.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Bertram Gross pointed out a good many years ago that economic indicators were becoming “economic vindicators,” meant to justify government policy instead of providing accurate glimpses into what’s actually happening in the economic sphere. That certainly seems to have been one of the things behind the EIA’s stratospherically overenthusiastic estimates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Equally, the US government seems to have responded to the current boom in shale with exactly the same sort of mindless cheerleading it displayed during the housing bubble that popped in 2008 and the tech stock bubble that popped in 2001. I trust it hasn’t escaped the attention of my readers that the key product of the shale oil boom hasn’t been oil or natural gas, but bundled shale leases and similar scraps of overpriced paper, sold to gullible investors with the same gaudy promises of fast wealth and starry-eyed disdain for mere economic reality that fed those earlier bubbles, and drove the market crashes that followed. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Still, there’s more going on here than the common or garden variety political puffery and securities fraud that makes up so much of business as usual in America’s years of decline. The question that needs asking is this:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>why are investors who watched those two earlier booms go bust, who either lost money in them or saw many others do so, lining up so eagerly to put their nest eggs into shale-oil companies that are losing money quarter after quarter, and can only stay in business by loading on more and more debt?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>Why is the same weary drivel about a new economic era of perpetual prosperity being lapped up so uncritically for a third time in fifteen years, when anyone in possession of three functioning neurons ought to be able to recognize it as a rehash of the same failed hype paraded about in previous bubbles, all the way back to the tulip bubble in the 17th-century Netherlands? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That’s not a rhetorical question; it has an answer, and the answer follows from one of the most popular stories of our culture, the story that says that getting rich is normal. From Horatio Alger right on down to the present, our entertainment media have been overloaded with tales about people who rose up out of poverty and became prosperous. What’s more, during the boom times that made up so much of the 20th century, a modest fraction of those tales were true, or at least not obviously false. Especially but not only<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in the United States, you could find people who were born poor and died rich. An expanding economy brings that option within reach for some, though—despite the propaganda—never for all. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The story was always at least a little dishonest, as the golden road up from poverty was never normal for more than a certain fraction of the population, and the wealth of the few always depended, as it always does depend in the real world, on the impoverishment of the many. During their 20th century heyday, the world’s industrial societies could pretend that wasn’t the case by the simple expedient of offshoring their poverty to the Third World, and supporting their standards of living at home on the backs of sharecroppers and sweatshop workers overseas. Still, in those same industrial nations, it was possible to ignore that for a while, and to daydream about a future in which every last human being on earth would get to enjoy the benefits of upward mobility in a rapidly expanding economy. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That dream is over and done with. To begin with, the long arc of economic expansion is over; subtract the fake wealth generated by the mass production of unpayable IOUs—the one real growth industry in our economy these days—and we live in an economy in decline, in which real wealth trickles away and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the fraction of the population permanently shut out of the workforce rises year after year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Downward mobility, not upward mobility, has become a central fact of our time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The reality has changed, but the story hasn’t, and so investors convinced that their money ought to make them money are easy prey for some grifter in a Brooks Brothers suit who insists that tech stocks, or real estate, or oil shales will inevitably bring them the rising incomes and painless prosperity that the real world no longer provides.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The same sort of mismatch between a popular story and an unwelcome reality defines the second reminder I want to discuss, which popped up during and after the Age of Limits conference late last month in the woods of south central Pennsylvania. That was a very lively and enjoyable event; when Dr. Dennis Meadows, this year’s special guest, noted how pleasant it was to speak to an audience that didn’t have to be convinced of the reality of limits to growth, he spoke for all the presenters and a great many of the attendees as well. For a few days, those of us who attended had the chance to talk about the most important reality of our age—the decline and impending fall of modern industrial civilization—without having to contend minute by minute with the thirty-one flavors of denial so many people use to evade that reality and the responsibilities it brings with it. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That said, there were a few jarring moments, and one of them happened in the interval between my talk on dark ages and Dr. Mark Cochrane’s excellent presentation on the realities of climate change. In the Q&amp;A session after my talk, in response to a question from the audience, I noted how the prestige of science among the general public had taken a beating due to the way that scientific opinions handed down to the public as proven fact so often get retracted after a decade or so, a habit that has caused<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>many people outside the scientific community to treat all scientific pronouncements with skepticism. I cited several examples of this, and one of them was the way that popular works on climate science in the 1970s and 1980s routinely claimed that the world was on the brink of a new ice age.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Mention the existence of those claims nowadays and you’ll inevitably get denounced as a climate denialist. As my regular readers know, I’m nothing of the kind; I’ve written extensively about the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on the decades and centuries ahead, and my recently published science fiction novel <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2014/04/new-release-stars-reach-by-john-michael.html>Star’s Reach</a> takes place in a 25th-century America ravaged by the impacts of climate change, in which oranges are grown in what’s now Illinois and Memphis has become a seaport. It’s become popular, for that matter, to insist that those claims of a new ice age never happened; I’d be happy, if anyone’s curious, to cite books published in the 1970s and 1980s for the general public, written by eminent scientists and respected science writers, that described the imminent ice age as a scientifically proven fact, since I have several on my bookshelf.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
What I found interesting is that Dr. Cochrane, who is a more than usually careful scholar, jumped to the conclusion that my reference to these popular works of a bygone decade meant that I must be a climate denialist. I corrected him, and he accepted the correction gracefully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Yet permaculturist and peak oil author Albert Bates then proceeded to miss my point in exactly the same way in <a href=http://peaksurfer.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/a-gathering-of-silverbacks-age-of.html>his blog post on the event</a>. Bates was present at the discussion, and presumably heard the whole exchange. He’s neither a stupid man nor a malicious one; why, then, so embarrassing and so public a misstatement? </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
This isn’t a rhetorical question, either; it has an answer, and the answer follows from another of the most popular stories of our culture, the story that says that having the right answer is all you need to get people to listen to you. You’ll find narratives with that theme straight through the popular culture of the last two centuries and more, and it also pervades the rhetoric of science and of scientific history: once the protagonist figures out what’s really going on, whether it’s a murder mystery or the hunt for the molecular structure of DNA, everything falls promptly into place. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Now of course in the real world, things aren’t generally so easy. That was precisely the point I was trying to make in the discussion at the Age of Limits conference:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>however convincing the evidence for anthropogenic climate change may be to scientists, it’s failed to convince a great many people outside the scientific enterprise, and one of the things that’s driven that failure is the accelerating decline in the prestige of science in modern industrial society as a whole. Among the roots of that decline, in turn, is the dogmatic tone so often taken when scientists and science writers set out to communicate current scientific opinions to the general public—a tone that differs sharply, it bears remembering, from the far more tentative habits of communication practiced within the scientific community itself. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
When climate scientists today insist that they’ve determined conclusively that we’ve entered an age of rising temperatures, I see no reason to doubt them—but they need to recall that many people still remember when writers and speakers with equally impressive scientific credentials insisted with equal vigor that it was just as certain that we’d entered an age of cooling temperatures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Scientists in the relevant fields know what’s behind the change, but people outside the scientific community don’t; all they see is a flip-flop, and since such flip-flops of scientific opinion have been fairly common in recent decades, members of the general public are by no means as quick as they once were to take scientists at their word. For that matter, when spokespeople for the scientific community insist to the general public nowadays that the flip-flop never took place—that, for example, no reputable scientist or science writer ever claimed to the general public that a new ice age was imminent—those spokespeople simply leave themselves and the scientific community wide open to accusations of bad faith.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
We don’t talk about the political dimensions of scientific authority in the modern industrial world. That’s what lies behind the convenient and inaccurate narrative I mentioned earlier, the one that claims that all you have to do to convince people is speak the truth. Question that story, and you have to deal with the mixed motives and tangled cultural politics inseparable from science as a human activity, and above all, you have to discuss the much-vexed relationship between the scientific community and a general public that has become increasingly suspicious of the rhetoric of expertise in contemporary life. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
That relationship has dimensions that I don’t think anyone in the scientific community these days has quite grasped. I’ve been told privately by several active online proponents of creationism, for example, that they don’t actually care that much about how the world’s current stock of life forms got there; it’s just that the spluttering Donald Duck frenzy that can reliably be elicited from your common or garden variety rationalist atheist by questioning Darwin’s theory is too entertaining to skip. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Such reflections lead in directions most Americans aren’t willing to go, because they can’t be discussed without raising deeply troubling issues about the conflict between the cult of expertise and what’s left of the traditions of American democracy, and about the social construction of what’s considered real in this as in every other human culture. It’s much easier, and much more comfortable, to insist that the people on the other side of the divide just mentioned are simply stupid and evil, and—as in the example I cited earlier—to force any attempt to talk about the faltering prestige of science in today’s America into a more familiar discourse about who’s right and who’s wrong. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Equally, it’s much easier, and much more comfortable, to insist that the ongoing decline in standards of living here in America is either the fault of the poor or the fault of the rich.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Either evasion makes it possible to ignore all the evidence that suggests that what most Americans think of as a normal standard of living is actually an absurd degree of extravagance, made possibly only briefly by the reckless squandering of the most lavish energy resource our species will ever know. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
One of the crucial facts of our age is thus that the stories we tell ourselves, the narratives we use to make sense of the events of our lives, have passed their pull date and no longer make sense of the world we experience. The stories our grandchildren use to make sense of their world will be different, from ours, because they will be living in the world that the misguided choices of the last four decades or so will have made—a world that is beginning to take shape around us already, even though most people nowadays are doing their level best not to notice that awkward fact. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Meanwhile, those new stories, the stories of our grandchildren, may already be stirring in the crawlspaces of our collective imagination. In future posts, I’ll be talking about some of the more troubling of those, but this week I’m pleased to have the chance to discuss something a little more cheerful along those lines:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the outcome of this year’s “Space Bats” deindustrial science fiction contest. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Regular readers of this blog will remember that back in the fall of 2011, in the course of discussing the role that the science fiction of previous decades played in shaping our expectations of the future, <a href=../../2011/09/invasion-of-space-bats.html>I put out a call</a> for SF short stories set in a world on the far side of peak oil and climate change. I was delighted by the response: over the five months or so that followed, 63 stories were submitted, and I duly assembled an anthology: <a href=http://www.foundershousepublishing.com/2012/10/on-sale-after-oil-sf-visions-of-post.html>After Oil: SF Stories of a Post-Petroleum Future</a>. This January, I announced
<a href=../../2014/01/return-of-space-bats.html>a second contest of the same sort</a>, with a three-month window in which stories would be accepted. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The response was even more impressive this time around. Over those three months I received 92 story submissions, some from
<i>Archdruid Report</i> regulars but many others from people I didn’t know from Robert Heinlein’s off ox, and a remarkably large fraction of them were not only publishable but of very high quality. I despaired of winnowing down the input to one anthology’s worth; fortunately, the publisher came to the rescue by proposing a slight change in plans. </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
I’m therefore delighted to announce that there will be not one but two new anthologies—one of stories set in the twilight years of our own civilization, one of stories set in the new societies that will rise after the industrial world is a fading memory. The first one, <i>After Oil 2: The Years of Crisis</i>, will include the following stories: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Grant Canterbury’s "Dreaming"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Walt Freitag’s "A Mile a Minute"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Matthew Griffith’s "Promised Land"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Diana Haugh’s "The Big Quiet"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Martin Hensher’s "Crown Prerogative"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
J.M. Hughes’ "Byte Heist"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Calvin Jennings’ "A Dead Art Form"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Joseph Nemeth’s "A Break with the Past"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
N.N. Scott’s "When It Comes a Gully-Washer"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
David Trammel’s "A Fish Tale"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Tony Whelk’s "Al-Kimiya"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Rachel White’s "Story Material"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
The second new anthology, <i>After Oil 3: The Years of Rebirth</i>, will include the following stories: </div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Bill Blondeau’s "The Borax Road Affair"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Phil Harris’ "North of the Wall"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Wylie Harris’ "Dispatches"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Diana Haugh’s "Silver Survivor"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Jason Heppenstall’s "Saga and the Bog People"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
J.M. Hughes’ "Dahamri"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Gaianne Jenkins’ "Midwinter Eclipse"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Troy Jones’ "For Our Mushrooms"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Catherine McGuire’s "Singing the World"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
David Senti’s "Nuala Thrives"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Al Sevcik’s "Community"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Eric Singletary’s "City of Spirits"</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
Once again, I’d like to thank everyone who contributed a story to the contest; even with a spare anthology to fill, it wasn’t easy to choose among the entries. I’m looking into whether it might be possible to launch a quarterly magazine for deindustrial SF:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>there’s clearly an ample supply of good writers who want to tell such stories, and (to judge from sales of the original anthology, and of my deindustrial SF novel <i>Star’s Reach</i>) plenty of people who want to read them as well.</div>
<div class=MsoNormal>
<br></div>
That strikes me as a very good sign. We may not yet be in a position to guess at the stories our grandchildren will tell each other to make sense of the world, but the fact that so many people are already eager to write and read stories about a world on the far side of progress gives me hope that the failed narratives of the past are losing their grip on the collective imagination of our age—and that we may be starting to tell at least a few of the new stories that will make sense of the world after oil. </div>

I've posted it once or twice before, and you haven't responded. I am not saying this with any sort of insinuation that you are avoiding it - I actually am just assuming I'm asking a question badly.<br><br>I do administrative work for an Oil and Gas company that has many wells up in North Dakota.<br><br>My company has grown immensely the past three years. They are adding more people each month. It is not my understanding that my company is "losing money every quarter." Rather, I know for a fact that the higher up people in the company are making a lot of money, and that most of them are probably millionaires.

Even with the prices new leases are going for now (double what they were years ago), companies are "making money." What am I missing?

As for the end of motoring, here in down-at-the-heels Cumberland, the kind of teenage guys who used to be hot-dogging around in cars are now hot-dogging around on bikes instead -- equally careless of life and limb, but a lot less dangerous to passersby. <br><br>Sunyata, I have no idea what's going on in the specific company you work for. I know that credible writers in the financial media have been warning for months that most companies in the fracking scene are spending a good deal more money than they're making from natural gas sales, and making claims about future production that fly in the face of geological reality. I also remember that when the housing bubble was on the verge of popping, blogs that talked about it constantly fielded posts from people in the real estate and mortgage industries who insisted that it just wasn't so...<br><br>Nr-Cole, glad to hear it! Would it be over the top to suggest that copies of any of these anthologies would make great birthday and holiday presents for people you know? <br><br>Joe, yes, I've seen it. Funny how it doesn't cite any of the books I have on my bookshelf, which range from mass market science writing (for example, the <i>Ice Ages</i> volume in the Time-Life <i>Planet Earth</i> series) to works by respected natural scientists (for example, E.C. Pielou's <i>After the Ice</i>, a natural history of postglacial North America, which discusses the Neoglaciation in some detail). <br><br>The article is right that there was no scientific consensus in favor of glaciation, but that wasn't my point -- my point was that the scientific opinions presented to the general public (in, among others, the books just cited) treated a new ice age as a done deal -- and it's that gap between the tentative internal language of scientific discussion and the overly dogmatic language too often used in presenting science to the public that I was trying to talk about. <br><br>John, if sales of these two volumes are decent, there'll be another contest, or possibly a regular magazine. Keep writing!<br><br>Chaos, hmm -- haven't read it yet. I'll look for it. As for the moderation thing, yes, I know it's annoying -- sorry, but that's what it takes to keep spammers and trolls at bay. <br><br>Mark, so? The existence of any or all of the factors you've cited doesn't disprove the existence of the factor I've discussed, and my conversations with people who have a negative view of science suggest that the factor I tried to bring up here -- the flip-flops of scientific opinion as presented, often in an overly dogmatic form, to the general public -- has played a very large role in generating that view. <br><br>Sam, exactly. Science is not a messiah.

I sense a lot of arrogance and belief in their own infallibility coming from scientists and those who swear by them. The response to skepticism about scientific facts seems to be "don't these simpletons realize that we have the answers to all of their problems?" They don't, of course, have all the answers, because the data they've mustered and concluded on is subject to value judgments, assumptions about people and nature, and a great many omissions of basic facts about the systems they're researching. It's scientists that often continues to insist that we're separate from nature and not a tightly interwoven part of it, for instance. <br><br>I'll happily bemoan the role that creationism and climate-denial play in the modern world, but I was equally dismayed a few weeks ago when scores of "progressives" in my social media feeds were insisting that we could solve all of our energy problems if we just covered all of America's roads with PV panels.

Even the well-and-moderately educated can't help but have noticed that the results of "science" part like the red sea depending on who is funding the studies. "Science" is now ideologically driven in the public's eye, and therefore untrustworthy. Having lost this trust, it will be nearly impossible to get it back. <br><br>So now you cannot use "science" to win an argument, because most people will just roll their eyes if you try.

Once upon a time we should eat low fat, then it was low carb, now the latest fad is "gluten-free". I'm not saying that there are not legitimate concerns about all of those things, but all of them have been hyped for marketing purposes. It is also because "experts" can be bought. All of the groups Mark mentioned that produced mis-information, had experts and scientists saying what those groups wanted. When you find out that your doctor chose to prescribe a particular drug for you because of the premiums available from a pharmaceutical company, your faith in experts, tends to be replaced with cynicism. But it is also the fault of publications for using sensationalism to create interest. One of the popular headlines picked up recently was about a Cure fo Cancer. Which of course turned out to be that "a" person was successfully treated with a measels vaccine to treat advanced bone cancer. Good progress on treating a particular type of cancer, but a disappointment if you have any other type of cancer and are hoping for a cure. You discussed the difference between "thamaturgy" and "theurgy" (sp.) once and I feel like it's again the attempts of some people to manipulate others that has caused the most damage to the credibility of "experts" these days.<br><br>Glad you are back!<br><br>Candace<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c6434009767100224503 title="comment permalink">6/18/14, 9:25 PM</a><br><br>

I've missed your weekly essays.<br><br>In regards to science, I think you've hit the nail on the head. While I have no beef with climate scientists, am too young to have memories of the ice age bit (though I've certainly heard about this in climate change conversations) and fully believe in climate change, I have the distrust of scientific dogma you speak of here in another realm: that of diet and nutrition. So I understand what you're talking about. I don't buy the claims about saturated fat that have been peddled for years (and that now seem to be slowly falling out of favor.) I grew up eating margarine, partly because it was cheaper than butter and partly because my parents thought it was healthier.<br><br>I believe that if I eat real food that's been raised and grown well, if I don't eat too much of it, if I pay attention to how my body feels, and if I exercise, I'm pretty much going to be fine. Whenever I see some new hyper-reductionist study about some single component of some food or another and how it's good or bad for you, and how maybe that's different than the study about it last week--which claimed the exact opposite--well, I just roll my eyes and maybe grumble a bit under my breath.<br><br>Is red wine good for you? How much? How often? Chocolate? Milk or dark? What about a beer? Coffee? Is saturated fat good or bad or does it depend? Grassfed? Organic? GMO? Which tropical fruit, if I eat it twice a day, exactly eight hours apart, except on Wednesdays, will reduce my risk of a heart attack by 17.8%? I can never remember.<br><br>The comedian Lewis Black had a great bit about this, and I think it represents the thoughts of quite a few Americans:<br><br>"Have you ever read the ingredients in sunblock? I've never seen those words anywhere. We don't even know what this stuff is and we slap it on our face. And I guarantee in 10 years you're going to go to the doctor and he's going to look at your chart and go 'look at your cholesterol...it's out of control.' And you'll go 'but doc, I've been eating all the right things.' And he'll say, 'were you using sunblock regularly?' And you'll go 'of course.' And he'll go 'that's your problem.' You could've eaten all the sausage you wanted.'<br><br>Why do we trust sunblock? The people who told us about sunblock are the same people that when I was a kid said eggs were good.

Dear , dear , very unedifying .. Still , though it appears the scientists may have flipped , there is every chance they are right on both counts , ie we may experience both warming and freezing , as dry ice is nothing but frozen CO2 , right ??... Seems to me the public seems to expect a definitive narrative and an accurate timeframe both , and as you have rightly pointed out, this process is anything but linear , and anything and everything may happen when we least expect it , which is hard for our massively rational , accountant like brains to deal with .. <br><br>I think you are right about gen - Y , they are very underrated .. They have gone to the grinder cheerfully in war over resources since 911 and continue to do so, to the tune of 8000 dead, 50000 wounded and 100000 suicides ( and counting ) since the outbreak of hostilities ... I am sure this is bound to colour their perceptions somewhat in the years ahead, they are made of tough stuff indeed...

A group of climate scholars tried to sail to a location in Antarctica previously accessible on foot, and got their boat stuck in ice, requiring an expensive rescue mission.

<div class="avt a_9249f9" id=c6722299829585762558></div><b><a href=https://draft.blogger.com/profile/05862060722142125282 rel=nofollow>Grebulocities</a> said...</b></div><div class=cmt>After a couple of aborted attempts at graduate school and a fair amount of student debt, I finally settled on a program and a university that is worth staying with. I’m now studying atmospheric science, focusing on modeling of aerosols and cloud dynamics. In addition to normal research, our group is working through the latest IPCC report (AR5) this summer and giving presentations on various chapters of the physical science report. I grabbed the paleoclimate chapter, which I’ll give a talk on in a couple of weeks.<br><br>Paleoclimatology is a young field and its foundations weren’t really in place until the 1980s. I can definitely confirm that there was some time in the 1970s and early 1980s where some climatologists worried that we were headed for a new glacial cycle. This was largely triggered by the realization that interglacials have been quite transient throughout the current ice age, with cycles of roughly 10,000-year interglacials providing brief reprieves from glacial periods of roughly 100,000 years; and that we’ve been in the present interglacial for about 11,000 years. For a while it was an open question whether we would return to glacial conditions (as the cooling trend from the early Holocene to the Little Ice Age would anticipate) or whether human-generated greenhouse gases would lead to warming above the Holocene temperature range. <br><br>The subsequent years have answered that question as well as any short-range question in climatology can be answered. Between 1980 and 2014, average annual CO2 concentrations climbed from 340 to 400 ppm, an increase of about the same magnitude as that of all of human history before 1980. Along with that, global average temperatures increased spectacularly from 1979 to 1998 and only somewhat more modestly since, along with ice effects that were only slightly delayed and are continuing to embarrass people who try to model the cryosphere. Even the newest IPCC report says that sea level rise is highly unlikely to be more than 1 m by 2100 and even then only under the most extreme scenarios. I’m sure the IPCC will officially figure out this is absurdly optimistic sometime in the 2030s. <br><br>I’m interested in the mid-Pliocene warm period (3.3-3.0 Ma) where global average temperatures reached ~3 C above present and sea level rise was about 15-20 m above present. Even the Eemian interglacial (which was actually only warmer by 1-2 C worldwide; large polar warming was offset by equatorial cooling relative to present) would show a rise of about 7 m. I prefer the mid-Pliocene as an analogue because it was the most recent time that CO2 levels were even as high as ~400 ppm, and the warming was global.<br><br>I know you’re aware of all of this, but communicating scientific findings to non-scientists is a minefield. If you say something along the lines of “many climatologists predicted global cooling in the 1970s”, you’re correct, but you’ve also echoed one of the most common talking points of “skeptics”/deniers of anthropogenic climate change. This will trigger kneejerk reactions by most people who care deeply about climate change, and they’ll assume you’re on the other “side” regardless of what else you say that should logically dispel that conclusion.<br><br>How does someone communicate all the necessary nuances in a society that largely ignores them in favor of false binaries? This isn’t irrational: many “experts” have been shown to be wrong and/or corrupt in the past couple of decades, and discounting statements that come with many “weasel words” is a good heuristic to ensure that someone won’t take politicians and other “experts” too seriously. But sciences dealing with complex systems are full of qualifications and exceptions, and it takes a long time to properly understand what is really going on. <br><br>But in science, the qualifications are critical to the statement, and these statements are necessary to talk about the consensus made up of careful observations. How would you recommend communicating limits to growth to a population that thinks in dualistic ways and has learned to discount qualified statements?<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c6722299829585762558 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 1:24 AM</a><br><br>

I think false narratives are so pervasive that being 'right' almost always leaves you in conflict with prevailing worldviews, and you must overcome the self-interest of those who hold to it. For instance, take 'climate denial' - I doubt very little of it is real actual scepticism, as they claim. It's not the diagnosis of the problem that is rejected, but the cure for it. People deny climate change simply because accepting it would entail them giving up the historic extravagance which they currently enjoy.

Then the new generation stories prevail.<br>And these conflicting stories breed conflict. I can see it in my family - me and my wife left our country's capital, and one of the reasons was that we were afraid of taking mortgage. Our fear was strengthened by the story we believe in - that we are probably not going to have larger, but rather smaller and maybe intermittent incomes in the future, which is clearly not very good position to get big debt burden.<br>But my parents reaction was: you could have taken mortgage, it was just your choice. And, when we needed help during renovation and with little children, the answer was that we are adult and hence responsible for ourselves, and (grand)parents have no obligation to help their children in this life stage.<br>The morale of the story is not that I am angry at my parents:) But I can see the stories at work. On my parents side: you don't have to worry about today's expenses, because you and your children will have plenty in the future, and there will always be some state support.<br>On our side: lack of help from our parents forces us to greater expenses, more car driving, less sensible investments, less time to work on garden etc. All of this will make it little bit harder for us, but especially for our children (because we have home already) and so on. And more the pie shrinks, the more will this hurt. <br><br>Disclaimer: this story makes clear narrative from an experiences that are far more complex and ambivalent, and does not provide full picture of relations in our family:).<br><br>P.S.: Welcome back, it's been a long time.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c7979622819634093258 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 3:09 AM</a><br><br>

I hope that your travels and lectures were both fruitful and that you experienced many new and wonderful places and met just as many new and interesting people.<br><br>How weird is this, but this is the third mention of the Grateful Dead in several weeks? I initially thought that they were a punk band but was strenuously corrected by a mate in my thinking... Anyway, maybe I’m a bit young for that… Now that you’ve mentioned music I’ve been enjoying: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5Ae-LhMIG0" rel=nofollow>Future Islands - Seasons</a>. The images in the film clip are a bit clichéd, but the song is enjoyable.<br><br>Does it not seem strange to you that the EIA fessed up about the economic realities of the Monterey Shale? Doesn't it make you wonder what may have happened to have caused this announcement? Disgruntled investors with some weight to throw around? Makes you wonder too as the EIA are under no obligation to spruik when an investment is a dud.<br><br>Haha! If a government ever acknowledges to the general population the economic (and ecological) realities of the present situation, then they may find themselves in the rather difficult and uncomfortable situation of having to actually govern for such a possible outcome... My gut feeling is that the powers that be are incapable of this feat. Just sayin... I’m watching local politics – from afar - here as there is a guy that is talking 50% crazy stuff and 50% things that are unmentionable – which the population on the other hand is genuinely concerned about - and he is gaining in popularity and will next month hold the balance of power in Federal politics here. Watch this space. I struggle listening to politicians yabber as somehow they’ve forgotten that they are in a job to serve the population. Somehow they have become enamoured of the argument itself and they’ve lost themselves in it whilst people simply stopped listening. Sad.<br><br>Confession is good for the soul, I'm told, so here goes. My partner was taken rather brazenly by unlisted unit trusts in commercial property during the very early 90's. Who would have thought that at the time directors could value commercial property on an estimate and record capital growth, whilst paying themselves huge salaries? Well done, you. I'm no better as I dabbled in online share trading a little bit later only to realise that it was akin to gambling and then stopped immediately. Once you are aware and honest, it becomes hard to ignore the economic and ecological realities. <br><br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c6858916553675019152 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 3:50 AM</a><br><br>

The case of bio-concentration of, for example, organo-chlorines, heavy metals or radio-nuclides, was thus conveniently set to one side. Real and serious distrust of science surely was given a boost here!<br><br>Similarly, it was held that ‘the body’ was built to extract what it needed from digestion and to maintain homeostasis from the welter of incoming nutritional and other molecules at different concentrations. We now know this was true but false!<br> <br>America is in this as in many ways a failed exemplar. I have held fast to ‘science’ in order both to hold onto and to temper my scepticism, but science fails – regularly. With climate science though we have useful tools of observation; much as our ancestors used microscopes, telescopes, chronometers, thermometers and balances, we have geological history – ice and sedimentary cores with their chemical stories – and ‘we’ can look down from satellites with electro-magnetic spectacles to see the world differently, ‘with our own eyes’.

Again, those that rely heavily on investments are really in the process of spending that investment money.

I suspect this is part of why you used the world "grandchildren" in your title. Among the late teens and 20-somethings of today, in the mass, there is a shocking lack of coherence in anything. There is a substantial backlash among a subset of the young, such as the Ray Wharton describes, or my own nephews who chose to spend their time in the woods studying tracks. But en masse the swirling milieu of corporate distraction and political sloganeering completely fills the brains of most young adults now.

Could you give us the sources you mentioned about the global cooling publicity in the 1970s? The wikipedia article on global cooling identifies several of the more prominent sources (Time and Newsweek for popular accounts and the National Science Board and the National Academy of Sciences for more scientific perspectives.) (Of course you have to sift through the edit wars to get to the useful information on wikipedia). <br><br>I think you are right that the reputation of scientific expertise has taken a serious hit in recent years. I suspect a main factor is the overly optimistic vision of science that dominated in the early atomic age and following trips to the moon etc. Retractions have always been a part of the research frontier. But retractions of settled science have been very rare. For example, there have been no Nobel Prizes in physics which have turned out to be wrong. The real problem is the large gap between the problems that science can answer (like how atoms or genes function) and the questions that we need answered (like what humans will do in the face of environmental limits). <br><br><br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c2325252124498084452 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 6:36 AM</a><br><br>

This money is borrowed at rates and with terms that depend upon the ability to repay that money with revenue from future sales. The problem being that fracking requires much larger capital outlays than other oil well technology and that all of the revenue estimates were overly optimistic (or ludicrous if you start looking at the new information that JMG has sited).<br><br>What this all leads to is a lot of capital investment (the bubble on the way up) and then when revenues fail to appear and the wells go bad early you get the bust phase. It is no doubt that the company will produce millionaires in the current phase.<br><br>Fracking looks to bust harder / faster than housing. Housing at the very least provided a product that would survive on a 25 year time scale. Fracking wells will produce and then fail on a 2-3 year schedule based on current production data. The high price of oil will inflate revenues but will not make up for bad estimates of production capability if the estimates used for production turn out to be false.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c6135591093314334561 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 6:45 AM</a><br><br>

Science promises nothing. It attempts to explain observations and extract principles and patterns that can give our human minds a more conceptual, structured, and predictive understanding of the world and our observations of it. Science doesn't promise to produce a glorious future anymore than the rules of grammar promise to produce poetry. <br><br>I was an insider to climate science and global change science from the early 1980s on. And yes, there was still lingering disagreement about whether what looked like a natural cooling segment of the long-term climate cycles or greenhouse warming from fossil fuel burning would win. I myself was not convince that the greenhouse warming was indeed happening, in spite of the many negative feedbacks that could suppress it, until the 1990s<br><br>I was (and am) usually at least mildly embarrassed, and often aghast, at the versions of "science" that wind up being promoted as truth in mainstream media. And I can assure you that the vast majority of scientists are not the ones making these proclamations. But I am equally embarrassed when I hear Brian Green babbling about String Theory (a.k.a. the Theory Of Nothing) in the mass media as a true, accurate, and beautiful description of reality. <br><br>Einstein didn't say that the universe actually IS a 4-dimensional structure with three dimensions of space and one of time. What he said, and probably believed, was that it can be modeled as such in the mathematical equations, and when you do this, many fascinating things occur, all of which have since been verified by experiment. Even all the experimental validation does not mean that the universe IS that way. It means that the universe can be successfully modeled that way. There is a huge difference between the concept "can be represented as" and "is." And this difference is still carefully maintained within formal science. Models are models, predictions are estimates based on current models, all theories are subject to reevaluation, all conclusions are padded with caveats and conditions. <br><br>Working in global ecology, it was long ago decided that the phenomenon to be studied was best described as "global change," and this was/is taking place at many levels. Atmospheric chemistry was one place where many processes intersected, but it was not the only thing that mattered, not by a longshot. This broader perspective still doubtless exists within the scientific community, but in the mainstream mind Al Gore (NOT a scientist) successfully boiled it down to one thing, and you are either with him or agin' him, thats all you need to know.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c678002203956007845 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 6:59 AM</a><br><br>

I guess that was new to most people in the 70s and they did not want to buy it just like plate tectonics. That has nothing to do with climate change theory, mostly unknown back then. In fact a new ice age will come certainly after the earth has overheated and the CO2 is out of the atmosphere it will cool down again. So the ice age cycle is just being interrupted. So no contradiction there. Even scientists seem to have short memories about the background of what was going on.<br><br>Scientism can be a religious belief if we ignore the principle that the observer is part of the system. My 15 year old son is in school, hates established religions and denies God. In other words very simplistic idea of progress, expansion of human ability to infinity with rocket ships, technology, whatever. this is about as bad as my father's ideas (would have been 90 now) of Catholic church as the only true religion. I think in a more nuanced manner of course, accepting that what I think today can be proved wrong tomorrow, that maybe I am in a dream of sorts, that reality could be altered in any conceivable way depending on circumstances, that God is way beyond human conceptualization, as is reality or the universe. Perhaps in a million years of growth in my energy form I will be a little further in my maturity but right now caught in this physical body I must perceive reality as any other life system perceives it according to its abilities, be it an ant or a mouse or a sponge. So the medium is the message. We are a medium, i.e. humans and therefore our perception bias is for growth, expansion , positive hope for future-in a religious idealized framework (scientific is also a religious framework of sorts). <br><br>Nice that you are back. Let's see if the sci-fi lives up to reality. I would give a prize for predictive ability. Like if you had your sci-fi mag or books with short stories for 5 or ten years and whoever caught up with the real facts first(how did civilization really end- with a bang or a whimper and what sort of) would win the prize, a million dollars or something-maybe a bomb shelter or a survivalist hut in the mountains. Say you have a wall chart or something with various scenarios on the future people dream up and % of what panned out on each scenario from each story checked off. <br><br>E.g. in a story people eat only insects and tomato juice and have passive solar heating and free love but only 10,000 people are left alive at the north pole and use electrical energy from jelly fish for their A/C in summer and for lights in winter and therefore jellyfish are holy and may not be killed and eaten. <br><br>In another story people live in sycamore trees in Arctic and have bred huge birds over generations to use for transport so that they can avoid the giant snakes and spiders on the ground and the poison plants on the ground. <br><br>In a third TEOTWAWKI took place by a computer virus attack from a hacker terror cell and the few survivors were not connected to their smart phones due to technical difficulties and wander around disoriented and crying. <br><br>Anyway hope you had a good ole time on vacation.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c5056824530537337010 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 7:14 AM</a><br><br>

Some climatologists predicted the trend would continue, inching the earth toward the colder averages of the "Little Ice Age" from the 16th to 19th centuries.<br><br>[...] the story was tantalizing enough that other variations – somewhat more nuanced – were written by the New York Times and National Geographic, among others. The theory picked up support from some pretty reputable scientists: the late, esteemed Stephen Schneider of Stanford endorsed a book on the issue. But there also was a small but growing counter-theory that carbon dioxide and other pollutants accompanying the Industrial Age were creating a warming belt in the atmosphere, and by about 1980 it was clear that the earth's average temperature was headed upward.<br><br>Even today, "there is some degree of uncertainty about natural variability," acknowledged Mark McCaffrey, programs and policy director of the National Center for Science Education based in Oakland, Calif. "If it weren't for the fact that humans had become a force of nature, we would be slipping back into an ice age, according to orbital cycles."<br><br>But earth's glacial rhythms are "being overridden by human activities, especially burning fossil fuels," McCaffrey noted. The stories about global cooling "are convenient for people to trot out and wave around," he said, but they miss the point:<br><br>"What's clear is we are a force of nature. Human activity – the burning of fossil fuels and land change – is having a massive influence.

First, I assume they mean banning creationism as a science, since banning aspects of creationism as, say, philosophy would be arbitrary and wrong. Still it occurs to me that once you start running around banning things, it means you're afraid of it, so while science groupies are hailing this as a great blow against backward dogma, I see it as a somewhat desperate move.<br><br>I'm 29, and among my circle of friends and acquaintances, "I F---ing Love Science" is quite popular as a source of new scientific curiosities and ham-fisted memes poking fun at all the luddites and god-followers. None of them have seemed to notice that IFLS routinely makes facepalm inducing blunders of basic reasoning. Discussing the difference between the conversation within the scientific community and the public face of science, IFLS is a great example of people kneeling before the icon of SCIENCE, while not actually bothering to make use of the logical tools common to its practice.<br><br>One other thought: I've started keeping track in my head of all the times a personal acquaintance posts a link to an article about lab grown meat or prototype nano robots and says something like, "it took a while, but the future is finally here. Get excited, people!" I assume I'll be seeing a lot more of those, perhaps especially after we go through another round of economic contraction and those same people can barely afford to put gas in their hybrid, let alone pluck filet Mignon from a petri dish.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c2143477791871239412 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 8:02 AM</a><br><br>

I hope the OBOD 50th was as exciting as it looked from the pictures and podcast. Also, congratulations to everyone who got accepted into the volumes (when should we be keeping an eye out for e-mails?).<br><br>I also spent the last month catching up on the essays that I missed from before I started following and got inspired by your practical Green Wizardry series and most specifically by the lack of advice for people living in apartment complexes and crowded urban areas (which may well be the only habitat available for lots of people for a good portion of the slope down). (And, lots of people I talk to, myself included when I was living in my old apartment, wind up using their living situation as an excuse not to do anything). I started thinking that that sort of talk might be the same sort of thought stopper that keeps people from getting involved with magic because they think it requires the floor space to draw 12 foot sigils on the ground. I’ve decided to start by putting my education in invertebrate zoology to work and learn the ins and outs of edible insect farming. I’m starting simple with mealworms and crickets, but hopefully I’ll be able to eventually graduate to some more advanced insects and produce enough diversity to provide a significant portion of my diet from livestock produced in a few small aquariums. Between that, indoor mushroom logs, and a few other tips and tricks borrowed from tightly packed urban areas in less industrialized societies hopefully I can start cobbling together a green wizards grimoire for some of my friends who are trying to make transitions but are stuck in indoor areas without much space. I wish it was a project I’d started years ago when I was still living in the old apartment, but hopefully late can still prove better than never.<br><br>I’m looking forward to the next series, it looks like minus a brief interlude about empire, the Archdruid Report has flowed pretty smoothly from magic to religion to mythology, all of which are very Druish themes.<br><br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c5645910193825628977 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 8:12 AM</a><br><br>

And new ones that might be told by our grandchildren. Man what a great idea for a series of posts. <br><br>When I first read this I had an immediate memory. It was a recollection of a discussion my favorite blogger had about the upcoming financial crisis titled "Recession without Romance". In the article he took on some of the "myths" that were being promulgated concerning the degree of cleansing and creative destruction that the painful but (in the minds of some economists) in the end positive consequences of the recession would be. <br><br>He blew those arguments to smithereens. <br><br>Correctly, he stated that the status quo would be protected, the financial fever dreams would only increase, and in the end we would come out of the recession not stronger but in a weaker position with fewer options. Unfortunately this was correct on all counts. <br><br>The reason I remembered it so vividly was that I think some of the people who actually do see the decay and danger we are in now suffer from some of the same delusions. Not that I think some of the changes you predict won't be for the better, I do. But I also think that in the end some of our visions of the future do flirt with romanticism. You do a great job of weeding some of this out. <br><br>Four generations from now?

I hope your time off was rejuvenating/refreshing. <br><br>JMG said, :"One of the crucial facts of our age is thus that the stories we tell ourselves..."<br><br>I wonder if the main story prevalent in our culture is "only now matters", or some related thing. <br><br>I remember 10 or so years ago, when drilling in ANWR was approved (before it was then disapproved). I lived near DC then, and was talking at a dinner party with someone who thought drilling in ANWR was the greatest thing ever. I, trying to be diplomatic (this was a dinner party, after all, and not mine), remarked how sad I felt it was that one of the last relatively untouched places would now become despoiled, with plenty of roads and machinery and other such things. And she looked right at me and proudly said, "Oh, but that won't really happen for at least another few decades!" And the conversation just continued on, blithely, from there. Mostly because I was so shocked I had absolutely no response. I felt I had just stared into the gaping maws of evil. I mean, her complete - and completely oblivious - comfort with the fact that future people would be left with a mess of what was once sacred totally unsettled me. She honestly believed that her view was the right one to have. How do you correct a worldview like that?<br><br>I believe one of the main underlying cultural myths we have is that the future (and its people) doesn't count/matter. That's probably not news to any one else on this list, but I have trouble wrapping my mind around it. It just seems....evil, and I struggle to understand how we got to this point. My lifestyle at this point is not as reduced as I want it to be, but I am working like mad to get there. So few seem to think that is even a worthwhile goal. <br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c3398519483770085574 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 8:37 AM</a><br><br>

Is it simply the reporting of the media, some scientists and researchers, the entire establishment, or some messy combination of all of these? I don't know. I'm not in the scientific community, so I can't speak to that angle. I do know I've read plenty of media stories about scientific studies that were largely untethered from what that study was actually saying.<br><br>What about the studies versus the publication and promotion of the studies? If you have a study, and you publish it in a peer-reviewed journal, and then some media outlet runs with it and misrepresents it in some way, you can't blame that on the study's authors or on "science," whatever the heck that means. If the study is intentionally publicized, then I think we get into a more grey area. The festering ties between corporate money and scientific research helps greatly to complicate things. A lot of research is carried out with a particular motive in the funding background. That doesn't mean the research is inevitably going to be compromised, but I think skepticism can often be warranted.<br><br>When it comes to health and nutrition--and I think this applies to some other areas of study--one of the issues I see is the constant attempt to represent, define, and understand whole systems with reductionist research. I think this is a consistent failure within the scientific community. We see this constant desire to isolate some single compound in food, understand its health effects, and then perhaps attempt to apply that one compound in isolation. Personally, I think this is mostly idiocy. There are a lot of things in the world that cannot be reduced without fundamentally altering them and their effects. The entire reductionist approach so consistently taken in studies often, I suspect, renders the studies pointless and misleading.<br><br>The scientific method is a brilliant tool. Unfortunately, I think it far too often is applied wrongly or to situations in which it doesn't work particularly well. The resulting failures--and a too-common unwillingness to understand the implication of those failures--help to obscure its usefulness as a method of knowledge and understanding.<br><br>Every person who claims the infallibility of the scientific method, proclaims it the one and only way of understanding the world, and suggests it's the appropriate approach to every single question, hurts the legitimacy of the scientific method within the public's view. <br><br>I would say the best thing you can do to help the broad acceptance and understanding of science is to acknowledge that it doesn't have the answer to every question.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c4922209937746568704 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 9:02 AM</a><br><br>

We had an educational crisis in teaching Science, a missile crisis (that was gerrymandered if not faked), and the oncoming Nuclear Winter. <br><br>Sagan and his cronies (if memory serves) morphed the Nuclear Winter into the Global winter that Must follow from massive atmospheric carbon unlocking. "Better" modelling, based on studies of Venus, suggested that Global Warming was an inevitable consequence, and that's where we are today.The next generation of satellites will be monitoring Carbon, oceanic temperature layers and give us much better weather maps. Until then a lot of this is simply simulator time on computers designed to win nuclear wars. Does anyone else see a design flaw in the whole process?<br><br>Though I need to note that Lovelock has very recently walked back much of what he said ten or twenty years ago. He noted that the oceanic capacity to moderate heating hadn't been factored into the calculations of global warming. <br><br>To be honest, the Carbon exchanges look like a way of failing to deal with the enormous and real health costs that pollution is causing on a daily basis and fob it off down the road. <br><br>The obvious signs are the air in Los Angeles, Mexico City, and Beijing. Modern society has found ways to bury pollution issues so deeply or far away from cameras that they go unsuspected. If you own a hard drive, modern speakers, or anything with rare earth magnets, it is likely that the neodymium and its kindred elements that make it work were mined in an illegal (even in Mainland China) and in a hazardous fashion. Shall we talk about open pit use of cyanide to mine gold? Of course not--for the same reasons that Lysol was available over the counter and used as a contraceptive without actually saying so. (Housewives had to be taught to use it as a cleaner.) <br><br>As to why the Suits would continue to promote shale oil as viable is due to the way that financial "instruments" are created and manipulated. It is much easier to speculate when you are betting with someone else's money and you are taking a cut coming and going. <br><br>My recent thoughts have turned to nursery rhymes of the late 21st century. While I am still working on the exact wording, MRSA, lymphoma, malnutrition and urban decay are going to be some of the bits of cultural wisdom passed down by four to twelve year olds the next 3-12 or so generations. <br><br>I trust that my post hasn't crossed the line into vitriol but serves folks as a call to look at the basis of the tools used to describe past, present and future. Hidden assumptions, equations and motives are always the hardest things to grapple with.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c733867525321797688 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 11:32 AM</a><br><br>

Far from liberating us, we are unable to make sense of the vast array of complex and often abstract information we are expected to digest on a daily basis, hence the need for experts to make sense of it all for us.

I think most people are starting to realize that whether a treatment is labeled scientific, safe, effective, etc., by the medical industry has more to do with who's making money on it than with whether it's actually worth having. You're right that this doesn't do any good at all for the public reputation of science. <br><br>John, sorry to have missed you! Yes, it's been six more weeks of political gridlock and imperial failure, hasn't it? <br><br>Wadulisi, hmm. I hope you don't start getting Archdruid Report hangovers...<br><br>N Matheson, I'm a bit puzzled -- I traveled by public transport all through my time in London, going as far afield as Oxford and Reading. Mind you, I'm used to much less efficient public transport systems!<br><br>Joel, exactly. The rhetoric of science has been used for so many competing sales pitches that a growing number of people simply tune it out. That's a huge issue, for reasons that will lead straight into the series on dark ages. I'll have to check out Black -- if that's a representative sample, he's a very funny man!<br><br>Derv, it's a good story! I'll be sending out emails to the authors in the next few days so we can get the contracts and editing under way. <br><br>August, exactly! The fault line that scientists by and large don't seem to see lies between the way that scientists talk with other scientists, and the way they talk to the general public -- and the way the general public reacts when yet another authoritative pronouncement by somebody in a lab coat gets reversed on them. The phrase "Oceania has never been allied to Eurasia" comes to more minds than mine...<br><br>Kutamun, now that's a metaphor that would never have occurred to me. If this is Central Europe, though, we're all in deep trouble -- remember what happened in Central Europe during the last round of major crises, the one between 1914 and 1954...<br><br>Avery, among social primates, facts <i>are</i> decided by who can shout louder. Call them "social facts" if you like -- the things that are considered true by a community. Now of course those can be hopelessly out of step with the real world, but such is life among social primates...<br><br>Rita, thank you!<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c6121254060352636729 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 12:42 PM</a><br><br>

That wasn't clear a few decades ago, as you note, and there were quite a few books and media programs claiming, far too dogmatically, that we were heading into an ice age in short order. Of course the issues around communicating science to nonscientists are complex, but I'd suggest that it's not just that people expect dualistic, non-nuanced statements -- it's that scientists and the publicists of science have a long and not very creditable track record of making such statements that turned out to be dead wrong. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Marxmarv, the kid under the trash can may be the best metaphor I've encountered this week. It certainly earns you today's gold star. As for the left-right thing, no, it wasn't deliberate, but of course you're right. <br><br>Unknown, good. I may need to do another post on faith one of these days -- I discussed it in an earlier post or two, but it's a massive issue. We none of us know for a fact what shape the world has, or which narratives about it to trust; we settle that matter on faith, which is an act of will motivated by a sense of values -- and it's because that isn't part of our contemporary discourse that the ability to motivate people to do much of anything has been lost. More on this down the road!<br><br>Tony, thank you. Of course what motivates a lot of the denial these days is entirely selfish -- but I'd point out that history is full of events in which people shelved short-term selfish advantage for the sake of, say, survival. Why isn't that happening this time? That's the question that needs discussing now. <br><br>Ondra, that's a great story -- and a useful reminder of the generational shift now under way. <br><br>Cherokee, glad you enjoyed the story! If you name the dog Plummer, don't be surprised if he steals books and buries them. ;-) As for the EIA thing, I admit I was wondering about their motivation as well. Possibly the growing roar of outrage from Californians who were looking at seeing some vast fraction of their state's remaining water supply dumped down a fracked rathole? <br><br>Phil, I had a great time, thanks. Yes, I remember the days of "the solution to pollution is dilution" -- repeated endlessly by qualified experts in lab coats, and dead wrong. You're probably right that this had a significant role in sparking distrust of scientists. <br><br>Yupped, thank you for passing the book on to your daughter! If she and other members of her generation can grasp what's happening and take constructive action, it may yet be possible to salvage something from the present mess. <br><br>Bill, the interesting thing is that there seems to be a split in the younger generations.

That wasn't clear a few decades ago, as you note, and there were quite a few books and media programs claiming, far too dogmatically, that we were heading into an ice age in short order. Of course the issues around communicating science to nonscientists are complex, but I'd suggest that it's not just that people expect dualistic, non-nuanced statements -- it's that scientists and the publicists of science have a long and not very creditable track record of making such statements that turned out to be dead wrong. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Marxmarv, the kid under the trash can may be the best metaphor I've encountered this week. It certainly earns you today's gold star. As for the left-right thing, no, it wasn't deliberate, but of course you're right. <br><br>Unknown, good. I may need to do another post on faith one of these days -- I discussed it in an earlier post or two, but it's a massive issue. We none of us know for a fact what shape the world has, or which narratives about it to trust; we settle that matter on faith, which is an act of will motivated by a sense of values -- and it's because that isn't part of our contemporary discourse that the ability to motivate people to do much of anything has been lost. More on this down the road!<br><br>Tony, thank you. Of course what motivates a lot of the denial these days is entirely selfish -- but I'd point out that history is full of events in which people shelved short-term selfish advantage for the sake of, say, survival. Why isn't that happening this time? That's the question that needs discussing now. <br><br>Ondra, that's a great story -- and a useful reminder of the generational shift now under way. <br><br>Cherokee, glad you enjoyed the story! If you name the dog Plummer, don't be surprised if he steals books and buries them. ;-) As for the EIA thing, I admit I was wondering about their motivation as well. Possibly the growing roar of outrage from Californians who were looking at seeing some vast fraction of their state's remaining water supply dumped down a fracked rathole? <br><br>Phil, I had a great time, thanks. Yes, I remember the days of "the solution to pollution is dilution" -- repeated endlessly by qualified experts in lab coats, and dead wrong. You're probably right that this had a significant role in sparking distrust of scientists. <br><br>Yupped, thank you for passing the book on to your daughter! If she and other members of her generation can grasp what's happening and take constructive action, it may yet be possible to salvage something from the present mess. <br><br>Bill, the interesting thing is that there seems to be a split in the younger generations. Yes, I've seen quite a few internet addicts who don't seem to be able to function in a non-electronic environment at all -- but I've also seen a lot of kids and young people who don't fit that stereotype.

I will look forward to reading the published versions. <br><br>I'm old enough to remember the possibility of global cooling being discussed in the 1970s, based on the cycling of glacial periods as noted by other readers. Some years back I was given a collection of Organic Gardening magazines from 1975 through 1980, when Robert Rodale was editor. At least once during that time, and I think more than once, he wrote of his concern for the onset of global cooling in his editor's letter. Since that was a period of very harsh winters in OG's East Coast location (I was living the next town over from OG's headquarters at the time and remember those winters well), his concern made sense.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c4641425877748519429 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 1:12 PM</a><br><br>

It may end up dividing those who survive from those who don't. <br><br>Ganv, I cited two in an earlier response -- the Time-Life volume in <i>Ice Ages</i> in the Planet Earth series and E.C. Pielou's <i>After the Ice</i>. I'm not at home right now, so don't have access to my bookshelf, but Nigel Calder's <i>The Weather Machine</i> was a popular source. <br><br>Zaphod, no argument there -- and it's interesting to note that climate activists could have spun it that way, and didn't. <br><br>Ceworthe, when was your childhood? Scientists were lying through their teeth for financial benefit in the 1960s, when I was growing up -- chemists tried to shout down Rachel Carson as a crank, for example. <br><br>Bill, and that begs the question: exactly what is this thing we call "science"? There's a method, a set of beliefs about the universe, a set of social institutions, and several other things all hiding behind that one label, and the conflicts between these different things are a major source of confusion just now. <br><br>Justin, hmm! That's an interesting idea. <br><br>Joseph, that sort of reframing might be worth trying. I've found it more useful to use terms like "decline," to get past the culture of entitlement that leads people to think they can have whatever future they want, but your mileage may vary...<br><br>Ed, thank you -- I had a great time. As for predictive ability, I've tried to raise that issue in my annual posts about each year's predictions in the peak oil scene, and nobody's taken me up on it. It might be interesting to run a betting pool on some specific question and see who wins -- that would require attention to gambling laws, granted. <br><br>Cathy, thank you. Glad to hear that you're writing again -- if you have something post-peak and booklength in mind, you might consider contacting the publisher who's doing the <i>After Oil</i> anthologies, as he's expressed definite interest in such things. <br><br>Escape, exactly. Thank you for getting it. This is one of the main reasons I fear for the survival of the scientific method -- so many abuses have been excused or even committed in its name that people in the decades ahead may end up rejecting it on that basis alone. More on this as we proceed. <br><br>Nick, that's an excellent point -- the fetishization of science and technology on the part of its groupies is as much a source of problems as its condemnation by its enemies, since in both cases what's put on a pedestal or a pyre isn't science itself, but an effigy shaped by raw emotion. <br><br>Eric, excellent! If the green wizardry project is to go anywhere, it'll be projects like yours that give it wings -- people who decide to apply the principles to their own lives and situations. As for the emails, expect 'em in a few days, as I finish getting dug out from under neglected business.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c1995086714723022779 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 1:30 PM</a><br><br>

One model I could suggest for accounting for at least some of this is the interplay of two factors: Ego and peer review. Scientists are humans, they have egos, some of them of course quite large ones that are unchecked by modesty. Peer review is a far from perfect system, but one thing it does it cause these egos to provide checks on each other. Your chief rival and harshest critic is likely to be selected as one of the anonymous reviewers of your manuscript, of course. So in the peer-reviewed literature, if you try to overstep what your data actually support, or to claim grandiose significance to the results of your one little study, you will get bashed back down to earth fast before your words ever appear in public. <br><br>But... now you write a press release, talk to the nice person from NPR on the phone, get the cameras pointed at you at a press conference, go on the speaking circuit where you are talking to mass audiences, not other scientists in your field. The checks on the ego are off. You can make all the grand claims and extreme extrapolations that those pesky reviewers forced you to tone down. No caveats and qualifiers necessary. My study of the effects of one lipid on one measure of blood chemistry in mice means EAT ALL THE BUTTER YOU WANT!!

In the UK, where I live, a book full of dire warnings on this very subject was authored by the eminent British astronomer, Fred Hoyle in 1981. At the time he had a media profile comparable to, say, that of Richard Dawkins nowadays. So, his predictions were widely broadcast, including a exposition in the Sunday Times, a quality broadsheet).<br><br>Here's the amazon link to the book:<br><br>http://www.amazon.com/ICE-The-Ultimate-Human-Catastrophe/dp/B0016JUNQU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1403212956&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Ice%2C+the+Ultimate+Human+Catastrophe<br><br>By the way, and perhaps more amusingly, Hoyle was also a proponent of the abiotic oil theory.<br><br>Your suggestion that the climate flip-flop as a potential cause of climate change scepticism/denial is well made.

Their vision of science - where the right questions are asked, the right conclusions are drawn at the right time; and the conclusions are so compelling that they can overcome any collective financial, psychological, cultural, political and even environmental impediment - has failed them. They desperately need new visions and new stories. I fear they won't ever be receptive (especially if their esteemed fellow Dawkins poses any more questions about the potential dangers of fairy tales...).

There are songs about worms, mushrooms, mulching, and all natural processes being made by street kids here. Many love to be in gardens, or sit under trees for hours. I am one of them and far more gone than the bulk following the green mans trail. I gardened with some kids from the youth corp this morning, they were charming in how some were learning respect for natural cycles.<br><br>There is a scary side to it too. We were not generally well trained as workers, or in processing failure, and with a normalized sense of humor that is sadistic. Some of the music that goes around in respectable circles of my generation have lyrics that are too disturbing to describe in this venue. When we have the first spark to take power in society I think that thinks will be changed in very big ways. Some of the changes will be very sensible almost for sure, and like wise there will almost certainly be horrors too. <br><br>On Monday a young man I meet was crying into his beer, literally, about how we have to 'get off this rock' travel across the cosmos an destroy the rest'. I could tell he didn't really want this fate, but was terrified by its perceived possibility.

Here in Canada, stalling or reversing Harper's approval of the Enbridge pipeline seems like the cause du jour and I'm sure I'll contribute something to it; but my sense of futility is strong right now, like the doomward momentum of industrial civ is enormous, unstoppable.<br><br>I remember being appalled a decade or two ago when I saw RVs and SUVs driven by elderly couples, which displayed a bumper sticker reading "We're Spending our Grandchildren's Inheritance!" ... and now it seems to me that every car on the road -- including mine -- should be wearing one :-) <br><br>"Future discounting" (minimising in perception the harm or cost arriving beyond a certain near-term threshold) seems to be epidemic, and I think it has something to do with a fully commercialised culture (one in which commerce and commercial metaphors and stories are hegemonic). Future dollars are always worth less than today's dollars, y'see.

My guess is that the social value/history of smoking proves more resilient than more recent attempts to ban it, which are based on contemporary fears of death. Also, as the" four horsemen" proceed apace, dying of lifestyle diseases will be a luxury even smokers won't enjoy. My guess is that antismoking efforts will have to focus on more immediate negative effects on health &amp; productivity. Considering just how much money and effort has to be expended on relatively small reductions in the smoking rate, I can easily see our grandchildren putting out ashtrays and puffing away, horrifying their parents and grandparents. On the flip side, you won't have large tobacco companies pushing a harmful product. Tobacco may return to being a sign of wealth, as average people of the future will no longer be able to afford it, and, due to food shortage, acreage could not be diverted to tobacco. Still, I think the antismoking lobby has always given short shrift to tobacco's social benefit, which explains its dogged resilience in spite of the western world's determined war against it.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c3677663078707700985 title="comment permalink">6/19/14, 6:47 PM</a><br><br>

It isn't supposed to happen, but it did -- years of whatever was going on before we bought the house. Plumbers came out to scope the problem, and decided that it needs to be cleared from outside the house. The pipe runs under the driveway. There is no access.<br><br>Yesterday they came out with a concrete cutting machine, and a backhoe on a flatbed trailer hauled by an enormous truck. They sliced a coffin-sized hole in the driveway with the cutting machine, since the driveway slabs are too large (and fragile) for the backhoe to pick up, but since the cross-cuts went crooked -- it's a heavy machine, and the lone operator couldn't keep it straight on the driveway slope -- they could not pry even the small pieces out, so they had to take a sledgehammer to one of the pieces to break it up so they could make a gap big enough to get the backhoe claw under the next chunk. Then they started digging. However, there are both electrical and gas lines in the vicinity, so they could not just dig away. They took out two big scoops with the backhoe, then had to jump into the hole to move earth with shovels, looking for the gas line, which they'd been assured by the city worker was about three feet down. Two hours later, alternating backhoe and shovels, the one digger had worked his way down to the water table, about ten to twelve feet down, and still no gas line, or sewer lines. They checked locations again, and concluded that everything is still further down, where the backhoe could not reach. So they had to order in a bigger backhoe, which will show up tomorrow. It will arrive on an even bigger flatbed trailer, which will lumber down a street not made for such a beast. We went around and asked the neighbors to bear with us and please move their parked cars so the behemoths could maneuver.<br><br>Watching all this "normal practice," it occurred to me that a work crew of ten unskilled laborers, working at $10/hour, armed with sledgehammers and picks and shovels, could probably have broken up and hauled off the entire driveway in less than an hour. With a simple bucket brigade to move the dirt, or a bit of technological boost in the form of pulleys and ropes, they could have dug the coffin-sized hole to fifteen feet in another hour with no particular risk to the gas line. Let's assume I'm an idiot at estimating how hard the job is, and double the time: four hours, ten guys, $10/hour = $400. Double the pay to a princely $20/hour for unskilled labor, and it still comes in at only $800.<br><br>I don't think this orgy of gas-powered "labor-saving" machines came in at anywhere near $800 in terms of amortized cost to the company. I'm certainly not paying anywhere near as little as $800 for it.<br><br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c3951957402000210002 title="comment permalink">6/20/14, 9:51 AM</a><br><br>

Be gentle -- I am trying.<br><br>In facing the "sewer problem" above, what are my options?<br><br>One is to abandon the idea of indoor plumbing, and dig an outhouse. I actually asked, when they presented the bid for what they intended to do: two guys, $700. An extra $40 to carve the moon on the door. Apart from the hair-shirt inconvenience of an outdoor toilet in winter while running a fever, it would eventually result in an injunction from a neighbor, if the homeowners' association didn't get there first. Same with a permanent porta-potty contract. Nice thought, but not viable, unless I'm looking for legal trouble.<br><br>We could have investigated indoor composting toilets. But the issue isn't just toilets -- it's the outflow of all water from the house, which has to go somewhere: toilets, dishwater, shower water. The city isn't going to allow us to dump it on the ground outside the house, or to turn the street gutters into an open sewer line, nor would it be responsible behavior on our part. Assurances that we would purify the water with our moonlight infused crystals would not sway them — that’s exactly how the city would view any such assurances, and rightly so. Sewage lines are not legally optional within city limits, and there are good reasons for that.<br><br>Could I have insisted that the plumbers come out with ten unskilled laborers, rather than their mechanical behemoths? Well, you all know how hard it is to dislodge the progress myth even at theoretical levels. How far does anyone think I'd have gotten trying to tell a master plumber and his crew how to do their jobs? I haven't the dangly-parts to attempt that, and I think the only result would be that I'd end up looking for another plumber.<br><br>Could I have found a “cheaper” competitor that used hand labor? I’ve tried that in the past, on smaller projects, and the results have been very much less than satisfactory: the guys who do that sort of thing aren’t generally looking to warrant their work, or for repeat business. I think that's asking for trouble.<br><br>Alternatively, I could try to do my own contracting and scheduling. Not part of my existing skill-set, and for the few times I’d practice it for my own use, I’d never get good at it. Not practical.<br><br>I could have rolled up my sleeves and dug the hole myself. The size would have been just about right to lie down in when I was done, and have someone else shovel the dirt back in. I’m not John Henry, and have never pretended to be. Yes, my ancestors would have been ashamed of me, and picked me up and snapped me in two like a twig. A sad truth, and, unless I walk away from my sedentary job and start doing hard physical labor at $10/hour, unlikely to change.<br><br>We could walk away from the house and everything it represents of civilization, and move elsewhere. Outside city limits, away from all the rules and regulations, where we could install the composting toilets and dump the dishwater into a ditch. Alaska, maybe. Appalachia. Rural Colorado. We actually looked into that last option a few years back. It wasn’t a good idea for either of us, for many reasons.<br><br>Even if we decided to move, unless we walked away from the house AND the bank that holds the mortgage AND the bounty-hunters and process-servers who would try to track us down, we’d have to sell the house, and I don’t think I could live with the fraud of trying to pass the plumbing problem off on the next owner, undisclosed. Assuming I could get away with it. So we’d still end up paying for those plumbers to come out with their backhoe.<br><br>Did I miss any options?<br><br>These false and even inverted economies are baked into the way we do things at every level. It takes courage, vision, conviction, dedication, and a lot of work to do otherwise. It also takes a certain psychological bent to pull it off. People who have all that could rightly be considered virtuous. But most of us don't have all that.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c1097459052821178430 title="comment permalink">6/20/14, 10:50 AM</a><br><br>

It’s probably getting to be high time I start working on overcoming my allergy to web forums and get on the Green Wizards group. I expect there will be a good share of people living in tightly packed urban tenements for the first few stair steps of the decline, so adapting the principals of Green Wizardry to that sort of setting is a valuable task to get underway. I can already tell though that insect farming is an important piece of the puzzle for urban people. They’re hardy, breed quickly, produce a lot of meat with only a little bit of feed and are quite nutritious. Really the hardest part of incorporating them into your life is the mental work to get past the completely nonsensical Western dietary taboos that get hammered in from early childhood (and which have nothing to do with cleanliness, taste, or, given our love of aquatic crustaceans, even appearance). Superworms/mealworms and crickets are good starters since they’re commonly raised on a home scale by reptile hobbyists so there’s a lot of material out there. You can get them from your local pet store, or from a company that specializes in food grade insects for human consumption like World Ento. There are also plenty of good recipe books out there, and a whole world full of traditions to model. Crickets are easier to raise, but mealworms taste better. That’s about all I’ve got so far. Eventually I might be able to graduate to tropical roaches, beetle grubs, and possibly even silkworms, but I’m starting with what I know how to do. There’s also a lot If can probably pull out of my memories of trips to Mexico with my mother back when she was studying to be a bilingual teacher. We stayed with a lot of poor urban families, and there were lots of little tricks they had to get by. One of the big things I remember was that a lot of families would have mushroom logs growing under their counters that they’d use in most of their meals, which sounds like another fun project. I’m probably starting to ramble, and since this doesn’t have a whole lot to do with cultural narratives (aside from the cultural narratives that tell us that insects are meant to be squashed and sprayed rather than eaten) it’s starting to veer of topic, so just tell me what would be the best way to keep in touch, and once I get deeper into my adventure I can keep you updated.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c3214026733066289893 title="comment permalink">6/20/14, 11:20 AM</a><br><br>

For the past few weeks I've been getting up early read first excerpts from the DECLINE OF THE WEST (http://spenglercrashcourse.blogspot.com/) and now am about 200 pages into the unabridged version (https://archive.org/stream/Decline-Of-The-West-Oswald-Spengler/Decline_Of_The_West_djvu.txt).<br><br>When you talk about the stories of our grandchildren I think, of course, to the Second Religiousness. As you mentioned in a response to a comment the conceptual framework most likely to be used in 50 years is pure theology. The nature of that theology isn't probably apparent yet – Spengler says it begins its first tentative growth during the Age of Cesears, which fortunately we haven't arrived at yet.<br><br>An interesting point that Spengler makes is that Classical Culture had an almost inverse world-feeling to Faustian Culture in that the Classical world-feeling is defined by the present moment, radical localization, and numbers, whereas Faustian world-feeling is instead defined by past-future orientation, a quest for infinite space and mathematics that defy simple visualization.<br><br>I wonder if the world-feeling of civilizations frequently invert upon their collapse like a blackhole? If the future invaders, dismantlers and conquering heroes develop world-views in direct opposition to that of the civilization they will eventually sack and, possibly, inoculate with their vision. Or if the almost total inversion of Classical Culture and the rise of the Faustian is only one way history plays it self out, rather than a general tendency.<br><br>Interesting to me that it was the Visigoths that broke apart the Roman Empire and it is GOTHIC architecture that first began to display Faustian aesthetics. I wonder if the conquerers ultiamtely are the ones who plant the seeds of the new cultural experiment or if the new arising culture is more the product of cross-pollination. In the case of the Romans and Visigoths it appears to me squarely the latter.<br><br>As for the conversation about 20 somethings, I have my 2 cents to add! I'm 26 and have for my entire life felt a keen disconnect from the dominant culture, while still using its metrics for my self-definition. I spent my childhood eating berries and running around the woods, read STALKING THE WILD ASPARAGUS as if it were my bible, don't have a degree (or debt!), lived for years in communities and squats, and currently work on a farm. <br><br>That being said, I think the binary of “the techno-obsessed youtube addicts” and the “aware earthy youngsters” is somewhat erroneous. What I see from my vantage point is that it's all mixed and mingled. My peers are often BOTH studying herbalism and helpless without their cell-phone. Both have unpayable student debt and farm experience. <br><br>People are complex and contradict themselves in subtle and unsubtle ways. My life, so far, has been in large part a study of how to be sustainable without fossil fuels. I am also a transgender woman who, without modern medicine will go into permanent menopause pretty quickly with all that entails for any woman. While traveling I have run out of hormones for a few months, and I can attest it wasn't that fun. Pun intended.<br><br>I can't seperate my trans-ness from any part of me. I only began to have something akin to faith after transitioning. After becoming a woman I felt charged by religious epiphany, a feeling that lasted intensely for well over a year. Not uncommonly I still use intuition and my dreams as a navigational tool through my life, with way better results than pure rationality.<br><br>Perhaps though that is a far statement of MY generation, not that of 50 years of the future. A bundled mix of extreme post modernism, a keen interest in sustainability, and an emergent religiousness too young to yet have found the right language or mathematics to express.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c4790871634178408261 title="comment permalink">6/20/14, 5:14 PM</a><br><br>

Meanwhile, nicotine is a mild stimulant. So while you have to set aside considerable valuable time to get high and recover from cannabis, there are many things you can do while smoking tobacco, or immediately after. Generally, I'd expect drug and alcohol usage rates to mirror third world rates after the industrial age is thoroughly over, which is considerably lower than current rates in the industrial world. People will be living just to close to the bone to indulge such things, &amp; alcoholics &amp; addicts will be shunned and die in short order absent an industrial system that makes long term addiction possible. Now on the way down is a different story. I'd expect an explosion followed by gradual tapering society wide.

It hammers this point home by citing the lack of compelling jobs and other challenges, and putting the current reality in contrast with how much easier things were in the past. <br><br>Things go wrong at the end when it straight-up ignores the wider implications of a contracting economy and highlights the irrational optimism of individual twenty-somethings living with their parents. The article's solution is to talk about a few people for whom moving home has allowed them to start businesses or otherwise succeed, so apparently the whole thing's not a problem at all. <br><br>Interesting how the admission that the world is becoming a less affluent place can still so solidly ignore what it might mean for the rest of our lives. At some point I wonder if father and son will realize the best use of their time is to start knocking together raised beds for the backyard? My parents have covered up most of theirs I think... shame. <br><br>If anyone reads the article, there's also a parallel in America with Schumacher's twin economies in the third world.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c2141912678327815588 title="comment permalink">6/20/14, 8:44 PM</a><br><br>

Ha! Too funny. It is the winter solstice here today and the 3.8kW of PV panels here produced just 2.4kWh of energy. The progressives that you mentioned would be well advised to attempt to live with that tight an energy budget. Perhaps the scientists don't know either? It is in the attempt that we discover the truth at the heart of the matter.<br><br>Hi Joel. I remember that Arthur C Clarke (or is it Sir Arthur now?) once wrote that we should reserve a portion of our fossil fuels as a bulwark against future Ice Ages. Unfortunately, I can’t for the life of me remember where, so I’m happy to be corrected on this matter. I'm a bit young to remember all of the rest of it, but that thought stuck in my mind for some reason. How come you stopped updating your blog? Keep well, bro and wishing you a productive summer! PS: During summer I avoid working outside during the hours of 2pm to 4pm when the UV is extreme - mind you we have a massive hole in the ozone layer above us in the atmosphere, which you may not have to deal with. PPS: Sometimes people serve me up items resembling food that I reckon not even my chickens would actually recognise as food!<br><br>Hi Kutamun. I recently heard Dr Karl on Triple J (ABC youth station) during the science hour (who had as a special guest Julian Cribb author of the book Poisoned Planet) describing his road to Demascus moment in relation to farming. It went along the lines of: "I thought farmers were all hicks in overalls, but I now realise that farming is incredibly complex". Just sayin...

In Harcourt which is about 80km further north and at a lower elevation than here (and thus much warmer) which produces something like 40% of Australia's apples, many of their fruit trees have not yet gone deciduous. It is weird looking at their orchards in leaf at this time of year. PS: I used to suspect that you were JMG posting as a nom de plume - now I'm not so sure.

It is not just the scientists, it's just that the scientists are no more immune to the decay than any other profession or institution in our society. We live now in a world of total fraud, where everything we see, hear or read is or could be a lie, and everyone is trying to game us 24-7. The organizations that ostensibly provide oversight have been incorporated into the scams they were supposed to oversee. <br><br>It's not that everything actually need be corrupt, rather that enough of it is that no one can tell which is which, and therefore trust is destroyed. So if a scientist or scientific organization says one thing, another can be paid to say the opposite, or at least some science(ish)-sounding group that is confusing to our poorly educated population. After all, the Education Industry(TM) is another former social institution now corrupted, untrustable and unable to perform the function it was set up for. <br><br>Eventually a new way of understand how the world works will emerge, along with a new religious sensibility as previously described here, and it won't use the concepts that underlie the world of science and our religion of progress. It may well be openly hostile to the language and ideas of science. This is how concepts like the scientific method could be lost. If the ideas and methodologies of science are to persevere, it will likely have to be well hidden, or likely in service to whatever power emerges in the guise of keeping it under control. After all, when it comes to thing like weapons and military technology, it will always have a role.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c1899047759097291211 title="comment permalink">6/21/14, 6:33 AM</a><br><br>

I am glad to see that my most favorite ones will be included. I was impressed by the quality of many of the stories, so much so that I wasn’t sure of the chances that my story would be picked. Plus I hadn’t written a short story in over a decade, so I really had no expectations. It is an honor to have been chosen, and I’m inspired to seriously work on some other writing ideas that have crossed my mind.<br><br>I gather that story contributors will be able to make further edits. I submitted my story right at the deadline, and although I did the best I could given the time constraint, I was aware of some imperfections in my story. I look forward to hearing from you about the final editing process.<br><br>Working at a public library brings a mixture of joy and grief. In the last several months, I came across some statistics -- if I’m remembering them correctly -- essentially indicating that our large city’s library system currently has 1/3 the amount of books it had around fifteen years ago. I don’t actually see most libraries becoming completely bookless…I think those all-digital libraries one hears about in the news will remain outliers for a variety of reasons. But I do see the overall trend of libraries becoming much more focused on technology, digital collections, and greatly diminished book collections. I’ve worked at my library for less than a year, and wow, I already have lots of telling stories to say on this subject.<br><br>When I walk into some of the newer libraries in our city and see how sparse the book collections are, it almost makes me cry (and I’m someone who doesn’t easily cry). I don’t find I can really talk about these things in any depth with others around me. Writing that story was a healing way of channeling many frustrations that have built up within me, which I’m often at a loss to know what to do with them.<br><br>On a more positive note about my workplace, copies of your two newest books (Decline and Fall &amp; Star’s Reach) are on order and will arrive sometime in the next two weeks to be prominently displayed in our new book sections. I will take pleasure in seeing them so visible to many patrons, in whatever small way providing some balance to our expensive 3-D printer not too far away.<br><br>Lastly, I’m very curious about next week’s post, if it’s going to be about children’s stories. I’m not sure what angle you will be writing from. I work in the children’s section of the library, and I have much to say in discussion of how children’s stories intersect with topics we discuss here.<br><br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c24095432284141356 title="comment permalink">6/21/14, 8:12 AM</a><br><br>

My current house has balky sewers, but it was built in 1925 and access to the pipes is pretty easy. <br><br>Matt, in drawing the terms for the contests as narrowly as I did, I was trying to make a space for stories that actually grappled with decline and fall as a setting for SF, rather than falling into various well-worn ruts. I gather from the response that there's clearly a great deal of interest in exactly the kind of stories I was looking for! That's going to remain in place for future projects of the same kind; I'm not interested in, say, stories where science and technology rescue industrial society from the consequences of resource depletion, because such stories have plenty of venues for publication and there are godzillions of them already. I want to provide a place for stories that don't have another venue, because the current cultural orthodoxy rejects them out of hand -- even though there's good reason to think they're a better image of where we're headed than the orthodoxy can provide. <br><br>Mike, now go back and read the part of this week's post that says that I'm talking about the way science is communicated to the public, not the internal workings of the scientific community.

I really think it comes to the difference between who founded which country; a nation founded by religious fanatics is likely to have more problems with reality testing than a nation founded by convicts!<br><br>Twilight, exactly! But there's another option, which has worked in the past -- the scientific method can be taken up by traditions and communities that aren't part of the current power structure and aren't tarred by the same brush, and kept going on that basis. That's what happened with classical logic and the Christian church, for example; it's a strategy for the long term, but the long term is crucial in this game. <br><br>Beneath, I have the same reaction to what's happening to libraries these days. I've been crazy in love with libraries since childhood, and watching them be debased and stripped of books is like watching a much-loved grandmother sink into senility. This is one of the reasons that, down the road, I want to see whether it's possible to resurrect the old model of the private subscription library and get some of those in place; more on this in an upcoming post.

It sounds like you just placed your finger on the trouble we had in the 80s here in America. People read about the coming ice age, read Clarke's suggestion, and doubled down on fossil fuel burning to keep the ice age at bay. It wasn't selfishness or a giant middle finger to the future, but rather a careful and considered response to a troubled future. Thank god for their forward thinking.<br><br>I haven't been updating the blog because I've been ridiculously busy establishing my new homestead, as well as continuing to work the two farmhand jobs. I keep thinking that I should let people know what's happening, maybe post some pictures, but it hasn't happened. But it's proving to be a wonderful and productive summer. I've got a nice chook flock--21 total: 19 Black Sexlink hens, a Barred Rock rooster, and a Silver Laced Wyandotte rooster. The garden keeps getting bigger and bigger, perhaps closing in on a 10th of an acre. In a short while here, I'm going to go out and finish putting in my strawberry patch and then interplant some little lettuce starts with them, since there's a lot of spare space with great soil. I otherwise have potatoes, onions, kale, broccoli, spinach, peas, more lettuce, beets, carrots, romanesco, summer and winter squash, painted mountain flour corn, chard, quinoa, cabbage, cucumbers, mustards, beans . . . probably a few other things I'm forgetting at the moment.<br><br>I just started seeding some of the fall and winter crops for transplanting in July. I'm going to try to keep myself in veggies throughout the winter this year. I don't know how well it will work, but it's all about experimentation and learning, right?<br><br>Oh, and the hoop house is filled with tomatoes (48 plants) and eggplant and peppers. They're growing well and I'm hoping for another year of canning abundance.<br><br>While I don't want to go beyond the homestead scale, I am hoping to do some side sales to bring in a little income to help cover the costs of growing and raising this food. I've been pondering names--Homestead by Hand, perhaps?--and am hoping to get up a website and blog for the place at some point. And I just haven't felt like I've had a lot to say in the <a href=http://www.ofthehands.com/ rel=nofollow>Of The Hands</a> vein of late.<br><br>But I do miss the interaction with my couple regular readers. You, Lew, Martin . . . I do need to do some writing again.<br><br>As for 2 to 4, I always seem to be out working in that period of time. I often get a late start and work late, sometimes until 8 or 9pm this time of year. I've never been a real early morning person, though I'm getting better in that regard--generally up around 8am on days I don't have to be up earlier for one of the jobs. But I also sure like to sit for awhile when I first get up, drink coffee, catch up on some reading, sometimes write a letter on the porch (speaking of which, I keep meaning to write one to you.) We all have our routines, I suppose. I've been getting more work done this year than ever, so I feel pretty okay with giving myself a couple lazy mornings a week.<br><br>It's amazing what having your own place (even though I don't own it) can do for one's productivity.

If you don't mind a tangential thought to this theme; I'd like to mix in the notion of our dependence on fossil fuels as a “progress trap”. I won't define “progress trap” as it is well documented elsewhere.<br><br>A big difference between the myth and the trap is that it is conceivable in principle to change the myth. The trap suggests we have less choice in the matter. A progress trap implies dependence on a technology or food or energy source that is difficult to change. <br><br>We are going to burn every last drop of oil and every last chunk of coal that we can. We are going to do so because we just can't help it. Its our nature. We like our comforts. Its who we are as a culture. Industrial civilization, or just plain civilization, is rapacious and exploitative by it very nature. Some have argued that once we started living in cities the final result was baked into the cake. Personally, I think the big mistake was leaving the trees. May that day live in infamy! <br><br>My point is this: the mistakes that were made were made some time ago (pick a date: 50 years ago or 5,000 years ago) and they are a direct result of being human, or at least being a civilized human. Yes, some humans are still hunter gatherers … but not many. They are blameless. Indeed there are still some primates in the trees. They be the lucky ones.<br><br>We made our decision generations ago to consume the earth as fast was we can so we can have comfortable lives now. Now we know (actually we did long ago but hell, we just didn't care) that we do so at the expense of future generations. As my grand father used to say (and he really did), “To hell with posterity, what did it ever do for me?” Thanks Granddad! Not nice, but at least honest. This is what it means to be a member of an industrial civilization. <br><br>The myth of progress is certainly one way of framing the reason people cannot, or will not, see the danger ahead. I think its is a valid one and useful to a point, but even if all could really perceive what is ahead, even 50 years ago, I'm not certain the result would be much different. We would still burn every last drop of oil and every last chunk of coal because our mode of life demands it. <br><br>Lets say we miraculously started burning oil at a constant (flat line rate) say 50 years ago and were miraculously able to continue economic growth at 3% (the rate required for steady state economies) by more efficient use of that oil. How long before no more efficiencies are possible. Lets say its miraculously 50 years. Then what? Growth must slow and eventually reverse. In other words we are in the exact same economic state we are in today. All we would have gained was some more oil to burn on the downside. <br><br>And what of the effect on climate change? If we burn the all fossil fuels in 300 years or 600 years, does it make much of a difference? I suspect not as both of these periods of time are but a blink of an eye in the timescale that matters: geological time.<br><br>The problem is that our pattern of ecological exploitation is hard baked into our the economic system. Our dependence on fossil fuels is but one part of this. It is the program our culture has been following since we started living in cities: trash the place and then move on. Eden in the land between the rivers is now a desert, the grasslands of the Sahara: a desert, the north shores of the Mediterranean Sea: deforested and dry etc. Of course we never called our pattern of behaviour “exploitative”. We called it … “progress” and have made it one of the central myths of our culture. But myth or no myth, we are caught in a progress trap and have been for millennia.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c8884167793143597195 title="comment permalink">6/21/14, 4:55 PM</a><br><br>

The vast interior of the continent here is mostly uninhabited.<br><br>With one exception though. Perth in Western Australia which is the most remote capital city on the planet, is now - I believe - wholly reliant on several desalination plants for their drinking water supplies.

More on this as we proceed. "<br><br>Certainly this has happened a number of times, and it hasn't exactly helped the credibility of science to the general public.

This would convey some nuance, but it would it stick in anybody's minds? There have also been problems with scientists being excessively dogmatic about whatever they happen to believe from their findings, but it's not clear to me that complex scientific findings could be communicated in a way that would both be accurate and stick in the minds of average nonscientists. Do you have any ideas on how the communication problem could have been better solved, while also avoiding dogma?<br><br>I certainly think the scientific community could be more forthcoming about the fact that a substantial minority of people who looked into the subject believed that the next Ice Age could come soon. If they have several minutes to explain, they could then explain Milankovitch cycles and how they lead to ice ages, and then how greenhouse forcings from humans completely overwhelmed orbital forcings. It would be a good example of how scientific thinking evolves, among other things.

We have huge mountain ranges (some summits above 4000m, much land above 3000m) transecting the western third of our continent from south to north, roughly parallel to the coastline and perpendicular to the prevailing winds off the Pacific. This is the reason most of our drylands exist -- the mountains extract the moisture from the atmosphere and create giant rainshadows. Your mountains are much smaller, and much of your aridity is simply a function of being in the subtropics, which are in general a band of aridity around the world in both hemispheres. <br><br>Since our deserts and steppes are caused by the rainshadows of the mountains, many of them are crossed by large permanent rivers that drain all that moisture that fell in the mountains. So combine this water with energy and infrastructure, and you get agriculture. Yes, it is very dependent on energy inputs. But all our global mass commercial agriculture is nowadays. We eat petroleum, effectively, regardless of where it is grown.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c6476898442790101163 title="comment permalink">6/22/14, 1:08 PM</a><br><br>

The U.S. pressured otherwise ambivalent countries with a cultural history of cannabis use to outlaw its production and use as part of lucrative trade agreements with the U.S. As the U.S. loses clout and legalizes cannabis itself, you're seeing more and more countries unwilling to continue their" reefer madness" prohibition policies (Mexico, Uruguay) to appease the U.S.<br>Regarding generational trends, I don't really see so much differences so much as continuations and accelerations that began with the boomers, perhaps even the silent generation, and have just gotten worse over the time of excess that's been the late 20th early 21st century. Narcissism, self centeredness, indulgence, extreme individualism, social balkanization/antisocial behavior, learned helplessness/lack of resilience, commercialization, andinfantilization/lack of maturity are trends that started with the boomers and just accelerated from there. It's just unfortunately reaching its tipping point with millennials and other younger generations. They represent the worst of those trends at a time when those habits couldn't be more maladaptive to the world we're facing, so the choice is most stark for them. They must go against the grain and their upbringing to survive what's to come. The silents and the boomers can just die a few decades earlier when things fall apart. Still remains to be seen just how much of the coming change gen x will live through, as they're a cusp generation. I guess for millennials and younger generations it's the same realization that we all have to face that the world we were raised for is not the world we're going to inhabit, but it's all the more pressing that they make the leap, considering the dysfunctional trends at work, and the changes upon us.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c3898441954045852965 title="comment permalink">6/22/14, 1:41 PM</a><br><br>

It was simultaneously depressing and comical to sit through it. Some of the things he mentioned didn’t seem all that innovative either. For example, he talked about how libraries of the future will have brain training stations (special kinds of computerized games) for seniors to keep their brains active. Umm… isn’t merely reading a book “training your brain” if you want to call it that?<br><br>And very few of the break-out sessions related to books that day, by the way. Most of the topics were such things like 3-D printing, Digital Storytimes, or Planning Retirement.<br><br>Seeing the direction many public libraries are going really pains me, for the public library was the public institution that I did believe in, unlike a lot of other wasteful government spending. I agree maybe it’s time for some subscription libraries focused on books to pop up. Though working in high poverty populations, I still value the open nature of public libraries. I’ve read about many authors who grew up poor, whose families had no money for books, who credit the public library as their saving grace, where they had access to great volumes of literature they wouldn’t otherwise have had…<br><br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c6871181080900411530 title="comment permalink">6/22/14, 11:50 PM</a><br><br>

What fascinates me is that scientists, who ought to know better, are enthusiastically participating in it. I should probably do a post on that down the road a bit. <br><br>Diogenese, I remember it well! <br><br>Jim, definitely signs of the times. I like to call such reflections to mind when I field claims that of course we can keep running the internet without an industrial system to support it...<br><br>Agent, funny. A friend of mine used to speculate about the Omega edition of DSM, with the <i>real</i> diagnoses: Major Jerk Disorder, Just Plain Nuts, and so on. <br><br>Mark, well, of course she knows nothing about the Indian election, or, really, anything else; American media personalities generally don't. <br><br>Agent, and yet plenty of human societies have flourished in relative balance with their environments for millennia. I see this sort of reasoning as an attempt to blame our genes for our own mistaken choices. <br><br>MawKernewek, that's quite possible. The annual cost of weather-related disasters is still rising, and various other measures of climate perturbation are bad and getting worse; if the temperature of the atmosphere happens to be in a state of punctuated equilibrium, well, that's not surprising in a complex system. <br><br>Cherokee, soil quality in the dryland West varies -- some of it's very good, some of it's good for raising bumper crops of scorpions and sagebrush and not much else. Our continent's really old rocks are in eastern Canada -- further west, the rocks are more recent, and of course (as Bill pointed out) we've also got major rivers laying down sediment, which helps. That may be behind the blind spot here. <br><br>Grebulocities, that's a topic for a whole post; the short form is that it would require a significant shift in the structure of the relationship between science and the general public. More on this later.<br><br>Myriad, yes, I've heard that argument!

After all, the whole point of science is to escape from opinion and move onto firmer ground. <br><br>In a properly functioning scientific discipline (e.g. physics away from the disaster zone of string theory), opinion simply doesn't matter. <br><br>It's not that physicists don't have opinions: they tend to be highly opinionated on all sorts of topics. It's just that it's understood that those opinions are strictly tea room banter and are not to be taken seriously in the business end of scientific reasoning. In fact, it's quite useful to maintain opinions that are as outlandish, extreme, provocative and/or entertaining as possible, because then it is much easier to notice if you accidentally include them in your reasoning process. <br><br>If you have an opinion (we might call it a hunch), it can lead you to follow a particular line of inquiry. It can lead to an investigation that might reach some kind of solid conclusion. But the whole point of that investigation is that the conclusion cannot rely on the original hunch. The hunch can be the starting point, but not the endpoint. <br><br>So if a scientist is making statements beginning with "it is my opinion that … XYZ", then XYZ are mere speculations unless the scientist actually has something more solid in the drawer (but is, for some unspecified reason, withholding it). <br><br>There is a whole branch of scientific literature detailing the woeful performance of "expert opinion" in a wide range of fields (e.g. engineering). For example expert opinion is typically wrong by at least an order of magnitude in risk assessment. <br><br>So, if the state-of-the-art in a particular scientific field is such that its conclusions depend on and cannot be detached from the notion of "opinion", then those conclusions have to be treated as speculative. <br><br>In many cases the dependence on opinion is not essential (meaning the reasoning can be made more solid with some serious work). However they won't do the work if the culture in that discipline holds that "opinion" counts as a valid ingredient in scientific reasoning. <br><br>Relatedly, the concept of scientific "consensus" is preposterous. Science is not and has never been a democracy. This is where the scientists allowing themselves to be cooped by the IPCC made a huge mistake. Once you start talking about consensus you are telling the public that it actually matters what percentage of scientists agree with X or whatever. This then gives them the idea that all scientists are equally knowledgeable on a given topic (otherwise why would they each get the same vote?). So then you get the phenomenon of geologists who know zilch about the atmosphere and can barely do arithmetic but feel entitled to blather on about climate models.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c8869199812667537656 title="comment permalink">6/23/14, 10:55 AM</a><br><br>

I believe the narratives germinating around the world in the next few decades, will shape and blossom in the next few generations as their authors and agents come of age - and there are less influential old people to hold them back. I assume they will define the inter dependencies of the future "human ecosystem" lastingly and to a large degree.<br><br>My take on this is quite different than<br>@Agent Provocateur's when he said: "We are going to do so because we just can't help it. Its our nature." <br><br>If you base your perception on the narratives peddled through the vestiges of the industrial society media system it may seem like that. There is other stuff going on, and although it is hard to judge, my impression is the volume and quality of activities is rapidly increasing. Have a look at the unMonastery (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckj-0yRY7Rw) or FLOK in Ecuador (http://en.wiki.floksociety.org/w/Research_Plan).<br><br>I would argue humans are generalists. They are versatile, omnivores, and at times diverse to the degree of wackiness. <br>This brings me to a scientific publication that is long overdue, which (if funded correctly) would show societies can be lumped into a handful of different clusters. Within each cluster you find highly correlated opinions, relationships, reactions, values, prioritization, motivations, lies, blind spots, and inconsistencies. I think the significant variable in the end is how these clusters view humans. E.g. there is a lot of people basing their world view on "homo economicus quartarius". They often make me think that every traffic death statistic also has its bright side. <br>Such a self destructive perception as you suggest is really not very prevalent in say the Netherlands on the other hand. It probably has something to do with the sea level.<br><br>I am quite convinced humans can develop the empathy to switch between different perceptions of their fellow man and bridge a few of these clusters. They also have a limited ability to change their ways. For practical purposes however this may be cut off at a fairly young age where they do not yet have to un-learn maladaptive behavior. When push comes to shove I am afraid it is a little late to start.

I mentioned one group of such societies: hunter gathers. But once we started living in cities, the draw-down on the environment almost always exceeded the carrying capacity of the adjacent land eventually. Now a few cities in river valleys with an enormous agricultural base (e.g. ancient China and Egypt) often worked for a long time but eventually the cities grew in number and size that over reached the ability of the local environment to sustain them. Conquest and empire was a common “solution”. <br><br>So I was referring to civilized humans; by that I mean those who live in cities. Clearly genes are not a factor here. Perhaps I was a little loose in my use of the phrase “our nature”. I didn't mean all humans. Once we started to live in cities, we had little choice but to continue as the environmental destruction generally did not allow successful reversion to simpler modes of life. Having destroyed the environmental base, we had to move on. I don't say this as a way to let us off the hook. At any point we could have made better decisions to reach better outcomes, but the main trajectory was set a long time ago.<br><br>Let me give an example: myself. I have been aware of peak oil and climate change for a decade or more. How has this changed my behavior? Well, quite a bit. I now grow and raise a substantial amount of my own food, heat with wood, etc. In real terms though, this is trivial. Though my ecological footprint is much smaller than the average in North America, I cannot escape the industrial culture I live in. Even if I wanted to, I could not be a hunter gathered (though I do a little of both, but not enough to actually live that way). Laws and lack of societal support prevent it. Even subsistence agriculture is not a real possibility. Industrial society will not allow the level of poverty this implies. <br><br>Serious attempts to swim against the dominate cultural current would only leave me and my family exhausted and broken. Across the current: yes. Against: no. Leave the society altogether: yes. But if I stay in it, in no way is my life ecologically sustainable. Anyone who is a member of an industrial society who thinks they are living such a life is seriously deluded. My dependence on the internal combustion engine, oil, gas and the industrial infrastructure that provide these is absolute. I am caught in a progress trap and so is everyone else in industrial societies. To expect whole societies to chose poverty is to expect people to behave other than …. well …. than the way people do. It is Utopian. Yes I did chose relative poverty, but not the level of poverty that would make a real difference. Society would not let me in any case. It didn't happen in my life for the same reason it didn't happen 50 years ago for the same reason it didn't happen 5000 years ago. Unless already born to it, few individuals, and no societies chose the level of poverty that “living in balance with nature” implies.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c4131393453071458555 title="comment permalink">6/23/14, 7:16 PM</a><br><br>

But collectively, we tend to chose wealth over poverty. We do so because we generally chose comfort over pain and difficulty. That certainly is human nature. That tendency has brought those of us in industrial societies to the point where we are trapped in our dependence on fossil fuels. <br><br>There really wasn't (and isn't) much room to make decisions to reduce this dependence voluntarily because doing so means choosing poverty. Your society will only allow you to chose in the direction of subsistence poverty to a point. Chose further and it will make you not poor (just getting by) but destitute (unable to support yourself). <br><br>None of us in such societies can choose to live on so much less that would truly change the basic arc of the story. Further, you and I and everyone else who lives in an industrial society does not want to live on substantially less fossil fuels because to do so means to live at a level of poverty none of us is willing to accept. This is not to say we won't be forced to at some point; but I'm saying we can't choose to do so on the scale that would make much of a difference. In my reply to JMG above, I gave myself as an example. In an industrial society, it is impossible to live without fossil fuels and extremely difficult to even live on substantially less. <br><br>None of this suggests the reducing your dependence now will be a good think for you personally. Doing so will make you more resilient to the shocks to come. But even if we all did the same, the story will still play out more or less the same way, just a little less pain. <br><br>That humans are generalist; no doubt this is true. I'm not sure about sea level. Certainly the Dutch have created the landscape not destroyed it. But this comes at the expense of other places. They had an empire. I'm equally certain the Dutch are as dependent on fossil fuels as anyone else. <br><br>R.e. My “"We made our decision generations ago to consume the earth as fast was we can so we can have comfortable lives now. Now we know (actually we did long ago but hell, we just didn't care)"<br><br>Before scientific studies proved the link between cancer and smoking, your grandmother knew its was a filthy habit and no good for you. It is in that sense that we knew we were plundering the earth long before the point we are at now where the results now threaten us deeply. Where are the forests of Iraq? Did Gilgamesh and his like not know the harm they did? Where are the springs sacred to the local deities of the Greek islands? Did the classical Greeks not connect their absence to deforestation? <br><br>Nuclear Fission and Genetic Splicing? Do we really not know that more power means more unsafe?<br><br>The “we” I was referring to was city based societies generally and right now industrial societies. I explicitly excepted hunter gathers (and tree loving primates). I implicitly excepted subsistence societies. Over half the human population now lives in cities. That's a majority.<br><br>R.e.. The city you live in on the north shores of the Mediterranean. The ecological devastation of the entire Mediterranean basin and most other places civilization has been earlier has taken place over millennia. I referred above to the fact that this process was already apparent to the Classical Greeks. No, we city dwelling humans have trashed every place we stayed long enough. Industrial culture has just sped things up considerably.<br><br>R.e. Your “We may be extremely lucky that our oil ran out in time to save us from some really irreparable damage. I for one would think that makes a good story.” That's my hope too.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c7921013331009309882 title="comment permalink">6/23/14, 9:11 PM</a><br><br>

I'm not sure know who the protagonist was, my ears didn't prick up 'til later, but he was a scientist who became known as 'The Man Who Can Record Dreams'. Now clearly, this cannot be so... so how did the monicker arise? <br><br>Weeeell.... his research DID involve brain scanning, and it did identify certain cognitive processes from the scans. Then a throwaway comment by an associate in a YouTube vid (you can't make this up) about what might eventually be possible one day with enough research, found its way to a journalist. The story was born. And our protagonist, instead of being able to publicise his actual work could do nothing more than deflect constant misapprehensions from journalists. Though he became a typical 15 minute media storm, even down to the obligatory Hollywood job offers, his actual work and the paper he'd published on it, did not get a single mention. NOT ONE. I think the media machine has contributed much to the undermining of the credibility of science amongst the public. After all, journalism has ceased to serve truth, and has become a corporate interest with corporate values. They keep piling up the circus so we don't notice the bread being genetically modified, drenched in poisons or being planted in furrows ploughed across stolen land.....<br><br>Second point: @Agent Provocateur, although I agree with much of your contributions in this thread, there is one point you repeatedly make which I believe should be dissected and re-examined, as I feel you may have been infected by a meme which has slipped under your otherwise excellent intellectual immune system.<br><br>Namely this: 'hunter gatherers lived in harmony with the environment'. Who or what this meme serves, I'll return to, but the point itself is palpably false. It was hunter gatheres who colonised the globe's surface. Everywhere they went megafauna were hunted to extinction, keystone species eradicated, ecosystems were ravaged and transformed by fire management, for instance.<br><br>This myth of the benign hunter gatherer has many roots - part of it is cultural colonialism of the 'noble savage' strain. Part of it is a romanticisation of privileged hunters who try to justify themselves in atavistic terms (notice they never do any gathering, which was the majority of hunter gatherer lifestyles), and I'm sure the 'primal' food fad has powered this belief no end.<br><br>The fact is, the HGs who survive living in some sort of balance have basically pulled short of totally trashing their ecosystems. They are not living in balance with the ecosystem they discovered, but rather a transformed and damaged remnant of it. <br><br>The benign HG meme is just a secular, anthropological Eden myth. Sure, the culture has some appealing features, but it is simply inaccurate to depict it as ecologically harmless.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c1460246825672505808 title="comment permalink">6/24/14, 3:37 AM</a><br><br>

Thanks for that. At this latitude, every 100m in elevation above sea level results in a shift in climate of approximately 1 degree latitude south.<br><br>Does that rule of thumb operate the same way for those elevations past 3,000m in the US?

I even thought about writing a submission myself, but I only discovered this blog and the contest announcement a couple of days before the deadline. What with that and the submission method needing people to get blogs of their own up and running, I didn't try. Let us know the next time you do something of the same sort (hopefully, with an easier submission method by then).<br><br>Off topic, but peripherally related: last year I finished a commissioned economics research paper, and some people who saw that suggested working it up into a short book. That has some upsides and some catches. The main upsides are that it offers a better way to get its substance into the policy arena while also paying its way. The catches are that, as well as following the suggestions I've had about moving appendixes into the main body, incorporating more recent events, and so on, it will need thorough editing feedback and it will take an unknown amount of my time and energy, which are in short supply because of a medical condition. Even though I do have editing skills, e.g. from editing an amateur magazine some years ago, authors are always too close to their own work to do a proper job for themselves (see! I do know something). A silver lining to the delay is that I can do <i>some</i> editing because the time away will have given me a fresh eye, but I still can't afford to pay an editor and it looks like organising crowd funding for that would also be too much of a personal drain - particularly since I don't know in advance the dates when I would need an editing resource. The thought has occurred to me, there might be people who need editing for their own projects; if so, we could swap each other's children, so to speak. Is anyone interested, bearing in mind that I won't have anything fit for hand off for at least a few months but I can look at other people's work in the near future?<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c8330803946130775595 title="comment permalink">6/24/14, 4:15 AM</a><br><br>

While I think subscription libraries might play a larger role in the future, I lament this change. Having worked in one of the rougher neighborhoods in Brooklyn I appreciate what the public library can offer those with less means. But I don't think they will do anybody much good if they become little more than community centers. The library I worked at made a point of not controlling the noise level and implementing a bunch of other policies that came from trustee members who it seems never stepped into a branch. This was despite the fact that repeated polling of our patrons indicated they wanted a quiet library. I was also forced to do video game programs with teens. Call me crazy, but when the library is scrambling for money they should not be spending money on something that seems like the antithesis of what the library is about.<br><br>I could probably write a book about my experiences, though it would dredge up a lot of negative feelings. When I started working for the library I did not think I would encounter the kind of mindless careerism I encountered there. Decisions get made according to the latest trends, instead of trying to simply fulfill the very basic mission of the library. 3D printers, indeed. Employees were treated like machines. Beneath, when I came into the system branch librarians did a small amount of ordering. By the time I left it was all handled through the central library. Many of our responsibilities were centralized. This left us with very little to do, so they slowly started making librarians do more clerical work to keep them busy. <br><br>The most amusing change was when they told us we could not read on the reference desk even when we had finished all our work and the branch was empty. The previous director loved that I would read on the reference desk when she visited my branch. I was never in the same room with the new CEO, as she has titled herself.<br><br>Sorry for the rant, my point is that libraries face a lot of problems and many of them are internal. A subscription library might be a worthwhile endeavor in the future.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c2334784782619119718 title="comment permalink">6/24/14, 5:19 AM</a><br><br>

I'll try to make myself more clear.<br><br>Regarding the "we": If you frame it that way, you correct indeed. I had not thought of that. <br><br>My angle was a slightly different. I deny a "we", as in "us humans". I'll try to put it like that: Imagine we are more like ants with a significant polymorphism. Only ours is even more pronounced - but it is in our heads so it is less obvious. Let's go a step further and say these differences in attitude really make us into very different subspecies. For example "cat people", "dog people", "Toxoplasma gondii people", "beaver people", "weasel people", "cockroach people", "butterfly people" and what have you. Now between these people there are certain relationships, just like in a regular ecosystem. Some are predator and some are prey. Sometimes the prey is helpless, sometimes it thinks it is helpless (an therefore is to a large degree), and sometimes it grows pointy things. Now you have elaborately described the pressures on dissenting people, and I agree to a large extent. It is to no small degree the job of corporate HR to keep this system in place. But what if corporate HR fails? What if the "cat people" grow a collective consciousness/become organized (internet anyone)? What if it becomes terribly maladaptive to be anything but a "cockroach person"? For example the people that to this day have not assimilated with industrial society. <br>If the others mostly die off they may be replaced by a very different set of subspecies - with different "top dogs" and different relationships. And it could be possible that influential people would be very risk averse and circumspect. <br>We only know that in an ecosystem that runs on fossil fuels this does not seem to be the case.

The "arid treeline" at the lower end is often around 1500-2000m in the continental interior. Below that is brushland, desert, and mostly-dry lake beds. In between the treelines is mostly coniferous forest. There's grazing and timber harvesting in the forest zones; most of the higher terrain is owned and managed by the federal government. Much of it is managed primarily for watershed and recreation; significant portions are designated wilderness (i.e. foot, ski, and horse travel only, no road-building, no motors).<br><br>Interestingly, if the increasing warmth beats the increasing aridity, the mountain west could become a net carbon sink.

Is an opinion connected to the person who gives it, so that another person, starting with exactly the same assumptions and evidence, might have a different opinion? <br><br>I assumed this is what you meant because this is exactly the problem with the way climate science is presented. If a "consensus" of "opinion" (in the above sense) tells you something you don't like, well it's a simple matter to find another opinion. If it's just about opinions, why shouldn't they all be equally valid? Everyone can have an opinion, so why bother with science? <br><br>Which leads to the question: if those 70's ice age people were expressing opinions, why does it surprise you that they were wrong? As I already mentioned, expert opinions are notoriously unreliable in practice. <br><br>Not coincidentally, scientists in a properly functioning discipline don't actually use the concepts of "opinion" or "consensus", because there is simply nowhere to put them, even if one were so misguided as to make the attempt.<br><br>Of course a bunch of naked apes inhabiting a physics department are subject to social processes, but successful disciplines got that way by learning how to modify those processes so that they don't get in the way. After all, if you are studying the interior of stars, it is highly unlikely you will be able to explain any data if your theories are merely "opinions" driven by social processes that have no bearing on the interior of stars. The modified social processes end up being a subculture and different disciplines have radically different cultures. <br><br>You cannot expect any tolerance of "opinions" in a physics or mathematics department. However the further you move away from mathematics, the more you will see the notion of opinion taken seriously. The reason isn't really to do with the inherent subject matter, but rather with a particular social process called "mathematics avoidance". Many students like the idea of science but lack confidence in or genuinely lack ability in mathematics. They deliberately choose disciplines like zoology or geology because they won't be expected to do any mathematics. I have seen up close what this leads to: in those disciplines, basic mathematical mistakes are treated as "different opinions". I wish I was joking or exaggerating, I really do.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c4282763517048942042 title="comment permalink">6/24/14, 12:53 PM</a><br><br>

These wunderkinder showed no interest whatsoever in acquainting a mass audience with the range of theories about climatic temperature fluctuation, such as the attempt to correlate them with the sun (or the less-theoretical-than-prosaic willingness to just observationally accept the fluctuations themselves rather than treating each peak or trough as the end-result of an ineluctable teleology). They were interested, not in ideas, but in mass-mobilization. Interest in ideas admits "maybe", but the ultimate end of mass-mobilization requires a definite Yes! or No! So may we distinguish them. Actually, mobilization of any kind requires a definite Yes or No, like the Flies of the Marketplace, because even if a supervisor does not actually know the answer to a given question it is important to group dynamics for him/her to choose an answer forthwith to function as THE answer.

Perhaps just way too much is lost in translation for the public to understand complex scientific studies. The culture of acquired stupidity has been discussed on this blog before: perhaps the general public is at a level of ignorance now that the effort to dumb down timely scientific research and concepts to a level that the" average Joe" will understand does more harm than good.

May 2014 recorded the highest average global temperature on record. The record it broke was set in April 2014.

You can google the acronyms plus the word "climate" for definitions, by the way.

He has used the phrase “apocalyptic thinking” in the sense of the expectation of exceedingly fast collapse or destruction or end of a society or the world (however defined). “Near Term (Human) Extinction” seems to be the most recent manifestation of this in the peak oil scene. The problem with apocalyptic thinking is that it prevents effective action to meet a difficult future. If you are convinced its all over tomorrow, then the most reasonable response is to “eat drink and be merry (now) … for tomorrow you will die”. <br><br>As I hoped to make clear in my second post, this is not how I have responded personally. Since I have responded to my concerns about a difficult future, you can infer I believe there is some point in doing so. Any change of behavior to mitigate a difficult future is not indicative of apocalyptic thinking. <br><br>I have tried to made the case that industrial societies are caught in a progress trap and so by definition have few options. I think the only collective way out of the trap is to do what we seek to avoid: to choose poverty. This is what it means to “collapse early and beat the rush”. Collapse is poverty. No industrial society will consciously choose poverty. It human nature not to. Indeed it is the nature of all living things not to. All such beings seek more pleasant modes of being and avoid unpleasant ones. Poverty/collapse is not pleasant. The reason why humans are in the situation we are in is because we have spend millennia seeking and finding the means to more comfortable modes of existence i.e. material wealth. The basic problem is we have become too good at it.<br><br>My main point was that the thought that we could have made decisions about energy use as societies that would have made a significant difference in the main arc of our rise and fall as industrial societies is false. We are just too dependent on economic growth fundamentally linked to increasing energy use for this to have happened. This is not apocalyptic thinking. It says nothing about the speed of descent. <br><br>But you have hit on something nonetheless. So did Latefall. I think this something is also the reason JMG somewhat reflexively dismissed my initial post. What all of you picked up on is the the issue of predetermination. Being caught in a “progress trap”, or any trap, implies limited options: few ways and means to respond to a bad situation. If you think you have no choices in meeting a difficult future, even if you don't think that future is the “end of days”, then there is little practical difference between apocalyptic thinking (i.e. “its all going to end really soon”) and thinking “I'm trapped and there is nothing I can do about it”. I think this may be the basis of your collective concern/response. It is a legitimate concern. Nonetheless, few options does not mean no options. All you can do is exercise what few options you have as best you know how. <br><br>I wish you and everyone else success in however you chose to respond to the limited choices they have, provided you do no harm.<br><br><a href=the-stories-of-our-grandchildren.html#c5339792574821592081 title="comment permalink">6/25/14, 7:07 AM</a><br><br>

I'm actually intimately familiar with the mathematics being done in ecology and related disciplines and I'm hardly the first physicist to be so: if you look at the history of mathematical biology, you will find a lot of the names turn out to be physicists when you dig a bit. In a comment here some time ago I mentioned Bayesian analysis in a discussion with JMG on the disastrous effects of the old-school p-value type analysis in the biosciences. The context of that particular discussion was scientific fraud, and I've seem plenty of that too, mostly statistical fudging, but also the cherry-picking variety that JMG mentioned. I've never seen any of that in physics, but then if someone *was* doing that in physics they certainly wouldn't cheerfully tell you about as they do in ecology (JMG reported similar phenomena from decades ago). If they are cheerfully telling you about it, they obviously feel it is condoned. <br><br>But I wasn't talking about fraud in my post just now, I was talking about another phenomena: the inability to accept that a mistake is just that.

Of course this is extensively done nowadays because it is cheap, simple, and looks good superficially. And if your teachers have been trained like that already some rather witless chipmunks in labcoats bloat up academia a little later. I have seen the horror in some of these peoples eyes when they understand that some of their variables may be codependent. This means they can either expand their test matrix by a factor of 100 or more - or they decide the variables are nice and clean and independent.

That may be one of the reasons this succesful "physics hammer" is going around looking for "nails" in other disciplines.<br><br>@sgage &amp; 1ab re math:<br>This is an interesting point. No question that math is useful and important. Also no question that the subjective success of math and physics make most scientists proud to be a scientist - yet "Many students like the idea of science but lack confidence in or genuinely lack ability in mathematics." - Which I think is totally okay. When they need to though know it though, they'd better get busy learning it or talking through the results with someone who has the required background. But this is the case for anything. Curiously though math always struck me as the one exception you may not admit to be deficient in. It is a little like math is the closest to "godliness" you can become in the natural sciences. So not trying your utmost to be "godly" is one step away from being heretic. That said in many good groups I worked with you could've replaced 1-2 people for smart but uneducated folk to get significantly better results. Having passed an announced exam X years ago is only good for so much, if you didn't actually need the stuff once in a while. And in like 80% or more of the cases (also in a technical field) you can get away with 20% of the math you "learned". Furthermore my impression is that the didactic tools for math education are horribly inappropriate for a large percentage of kids heading for academia or technical fields.
